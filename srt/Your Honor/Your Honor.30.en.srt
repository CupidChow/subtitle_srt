1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,990
Next, Number 17, Song So Eun?
You can come in.

2
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,680
Unni, fighting!

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,260
If a defendant denies the interrogation
they received when they were a victim,

4
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,470
and if the plainclothes officer who was
in charge of the case attends the trial

5
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,400
and testifies that they heard the
defendant's testimony,

6
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,140
can it be admitted as evidence?

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,850
A plainclothes officer's written
report of a victim

8
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,880
only becomes evidence when the defendant,
who was a victim, acknowledges its content.

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,980
Therefore, it cannot be
admitted as evidence.

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,870
Then, if this report by the
plainclothes officer...

11
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,860
If the defendant does not consent to it
being used as evidence,

12
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,840
even if the plainclothes officer who
interrogated the defendant testifies,

13
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,310
it cannot serve as evidence?

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,270
That is not so.

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,120
I know it may conflict with
what I said before,

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,320
but if the defendant denies it in court...

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,040
Summarize in one sentence

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,620
why what I said was wrong.

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,790
The defendant's interrogation itself does not
have the power to become evidence,

20
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,790
but with the officer's testimony,

21
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:36,030
what they experienced during the
case can become evidence.

22
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,400
I didn't understand any of that,
but you were amazing.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,380
You can go to the next room now.

24
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,750
Number 18, Lee Ho Sun, please.

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,170
[ Trial Research Institute
Candidate Interview ]

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,710
Then...

27
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,490
did you ever feel like law was difficult?

28
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,700
Once, I saw all the movies I meant to
see on a day off after exams.

29
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,770
One was set in an anarchist
land without law

30
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,560
and the other was set in a time where
the law controlled humans' emotions.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,100
What is law that its absence
creates a dystopia

32
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,580
and its strength of also
creates a dystopia?

33
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,840
From that moment, when I realized the strength
of law's existence determines a society,

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,920
I have felt that law is difficult.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,570
Sounds complicated.

36
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,380
We will end this interview with a
question we're asking everyone.

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,510
If there is something that law
needs to protect in the end,

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,380
is it the order of a society or its value?

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,890
What do you think?

40
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,820
What the law needs to protect in the end...

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,330
is someone's heart.

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,060
What brings you here without any notice?

43
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,110
What's going on with you guys?

44
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,670
I told you to come this weekend,
and you didn't even call.

45
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,330
I had to pack.

46
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,150
You quit that fancy judge job.

47
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,990
Where are you going?

48
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,510
I'll take care of it myself.

49
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,810
Sure.

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,980
I...

51
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,690
married the eldest son of a family.

52
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,670
I thought that was all there was to life.

53
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,480
When sent Kang Ho away to be
adopted by our relatives,

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,470
I thought that the elders had decided this,
so I had to go along with it.

55
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,970
Not his body, not his mind.

56
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,800
It was just a piece of paper.

57
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,780
Above all,

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,630
I thought it wouldn't change the
fact that he was my son.

59
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,360
Kang Ho...

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,870
will understand one of these days.

61
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,260
I was so grateful after I had you two.

62
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,930
How could such beautiful
kids come into my life?

63
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,650
I was thankful to you two
for coming into my life.

64
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,600
Thankful...

65
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,690
and thankful some more.

66
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,910
But one of you...

67
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,750
has bad fortune and lives on the edge.

68
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,250
The other one is waning.

69
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,620
His pain is becoming thorns.

70
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,320
That's what it means to be a mother.

71
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,190
Go to bed. You must be tired.

72
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,590
Soo Ho,

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,730
I'm sorry I didn't raise the two of you well.

74
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,430
Because I was lacking,

75
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,570
I raised the both of you

76
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,320
to be lacking as well.

77
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,420
Since I quit being a judge,
I'm not enough for you.

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,800
To me...

79
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,790
you are always more than enough.

80
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,580
You...

81
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,980
and Kang Ho are not good people.
That's what I mean.

82
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,700
When you kept winning first place,
I should have liked you less.

83
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,910
In this world

84
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,480
there is second place, tenth place

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,640
and even last place.

86
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,780
I should have taught you that.

87
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,120
Soo Ho,

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,340
Be the best you can be.

89
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,500
To other people...

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,650
and to the world.

91
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,420
Got it?

92
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,770

It's okay.

95
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,560
I came to say that.

96
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,770
See you during Chuseok, my son.

97
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,120
I said not to come out.

98
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,660
- I'll take you.
- No, I know the roads and everything.

99
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,300
Don't come out. Go inside.

- Hi, how are you?
- Sit down.

103
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,780
You're applying to study abroad
in Germany, right?

Yes.

are prioritized this time.

106

I don't know if we'll get in on it.

107
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,390
We? Did you apply too, Sunbae?

108
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,730
Of course. It's a good opportunity.

109

Don't you think it's a bit earl
y for you to apply?

110
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,470
I talked to Press Director. He said I could.

111
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,570
- Press Director really must want to get rid of you.
- What?

112
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,850
He has just has one more year left.

I don't want to keep her around,
but I can't kick her out.

114
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,240
If I send her abroad right now,
my last year will be great.

115
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,320
No one to talk back to me.

116
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,350
I don't talk back.

117
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,880
I'm always polite.
Press Director misunderstands me.

Anyway, you are a worthy rival.

119

Have you asked your parents?
Did they say it's okay?

120
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,320
Yes.

121
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,480
My parents think it's a good
opportunity. They approve.

122
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,430
How about your boyfriend?

123
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,110
I don't... have a boyfriend.

124
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,720
You answered a second too late.

125
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,160
Talk about it with your boyfriend first.

126
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,410
Are you going to break up and leave,
go together, or make him wait?

127
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,070
Certainty is always the best.

128
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,320
I don't have a boyfriend.

129
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,370
See? Late again.

What do you call this?

133
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,200
This is a reinterpreted version of army stew.

A new menu option for solo diners.

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,370
Army stew soup?

137
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,630
Ran, taste it.

Hey, who do you think I mean by "us"?

In this case, "us"

is us. Not us.

If we voted on romance,

Hey.

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,590
You found her? Really?

169
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,630
Where?

170
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,850
Got it. Text me the address.

Let go, man! What if someone sees?

173
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,550
I said we found her!

174

What are you doing? Give it back!

175
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,010
This is urgent. I need to leave.

Why are you looking for that woman?

177
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,550
How do you know that woman?

178
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,160
Aigoo. It must be a lookalike.

179

Her last name isn't Song, is it?

It is Song.

Her name isn't Ji Eun, is it?

182

It is. Song Ji Eun.

Unni, this is a wish bracelet.

190
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,410
When it breaks, your wish will come true.

191

- If it never breaks, my wish won't come true?
- I guess.

192

What if it doesn't break all my life?

Then we'll just have the bracelet
together, forever.

Let's make a wish right now.

The typhoon was late and
the bugs followed it.

196
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,540
In the summer, we were begging for rain.

197

You're right. We won't have
any crops this year.

198
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,540
I'm worried. Every year
the weather is like this.

Here you go.

You should get adhesives, too.

want it, not when we do.

Five adhesives, please.

Eleven hundred and four thousand won.

Ahjussi, you're always a bit short!

or eight years, you could have stayed over.

Who found her?

225
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,340
After I retired from being
on the ground,

226
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,500
whenever I give these guys work, they trudge
so slowly, a day's worth of work...

227
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,520
can take ten days, I mean.

228
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,230
But someone must have made
a threat or called a meeting.

229

They printed an entire list of ID buyers

and distributed it to the whole
country, and it worked.

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,310
did something happen?

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,870
No.

237
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,770
There are two reactions from seeing your family
for the first time in three, four years.

238

Crying and hugging, or
fighting and screaming.

What do you mean?

00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,160
She searched for her for years, and...

We don't know the circumstances.

244
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,970
If she has a kid, she
probably has a husband.

245
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,480
If someone just shows up, like ta-da!

246
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,910
"Who are you?" "Her sister!"

247
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:42,410
What do you think would happen?

248
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,920
Sexual assault, running away...
all would come to the surface.

249
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,290
Then her husband and the in-laws...

250
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,630
Aigoo, too complicated.

251
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,190
So? She didn't meet with her?

252
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,490
What did she say?

253
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,400
Because Unni looked so happy,

254
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,710
I couldn't go inside

255
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,900
for fear I'd ruin things for her.

256
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,610
She is so thoughtful.

257
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,170
Where are you going, man?

258
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,930
To Gimpo, to her sister's place.

259
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,570
Why would you go there?

260
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,650
To ask her.

261
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,760
If her sister came, would she be happy?

262
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,250
It's someone else's family.
Why are you sticking your nose in?

263
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,640
Wait a few days or a few months,
and things will unfold naturally.

264
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,200
During that time...

265
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,370
So Eun will be hurting!

266
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,040
So Eun?

267
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,590
I thought she was your
judge brother's trainee.

268
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,940
Yes.

269
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,550
I thought your brother
asked to look for her.

270

Yes.

271

Hey, man, of course not.

276
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,940
Huh?

277
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,780
She's in training to be a judge and you

278
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,200
have five criminal records, to be frank.

279
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,390
Want me to explain it to you?

280
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,630
She's a queen, and you

281
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,840
are s***, s***!

282
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm s***. That's me.

283
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,240
I know...

284
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,670
that I'm s***.

285
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,080
I'll be back.

286
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,880
- So Eun.
- Leave.

287
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,800
Your sister wants to see you.

Let's go.

289
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,550
Were you the one who found my sister?

290
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,560
- Yes.
- Why?

291
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,250
You were the one who destroyed her.

292
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,790
Did you want to take a look?

293
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,180
Let's go.

294
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,670
Don't get involved in my business anymore.

295
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,570
If I go, it'll be by myself.

296
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:32,590
Someone like you...

297
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,050
don't have the right to visit my Unni.

298
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,510
Do you remember...

299
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,590
when I blew out the candle on the cake?

300
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,450
Make a wish.

301
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,310
So Eun...

302
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,080
I wished that you would find your sister.

303
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,450
The only thing I could wish for

304
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,660
was that.

305
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,810
The only wish that can come true for us...

306
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,900
was just that.

307
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,780
Do you know why?

308
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,410
About testifying in your sister's case...

309
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:11,510
want to know why I did that to you?

310
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,400
The reason...

311
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,080
is all in here.

312
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,070
Read it later.

313
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,100
I will never, ever

314
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,960
appear in front of you again,
even by coincidence.

315
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,120
So just listen to me today.

316
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,970
No.

317
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,800
I don't want to.

318
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,660
No matter how much you hate someone,

319
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,510
I think you should listen
to them at least once

320
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,410
If they mean what they say.

321
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,210
Go...

322
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,520
to your sister.

323
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,960
I'll trust you

324
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,600
about never showing up ever again.

325
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,320
Go. I'll go, too.

326
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,470
You hated me for this, didn't you?

327
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,540
Yes. A lot.

328
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,640
So much.

329
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:18,250
♫ The memories that await me there ♫

330
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:25,020
♫ Like a dream, the loneliness
that pierces me ♫

331
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:33,630
♫ The thirst that could not
fill my missing heart ♫

332
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:42,110
♫ Leads me to you, here, guide me ♫

333
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:51,390
♫ I know the road I've chosen is often hard and long... ♫
