1
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,580
This is my adjudication.

2
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,550
Defendant Park Jae Ho.

3
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,170
I sentence you to death.

4
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,690
Honey!

5
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,490
No!

6
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,320
Honey!

7
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,590
My goodness.

8
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,670
I've never seen such a townhouse.

9
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,360
Soo Ho, I'm sorry.

10
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,560
I couldn't contribute toward the house.

11
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

12
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,390
Mom, have some.

13
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,690
Soo Ho.

14
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,200
Kang Ho...

15
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,710
got arrested again yesterday.

16
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,740
I looked into it.

17
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,490
It's partially his fault

18
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,820
but I think he's being framed.

19
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,600
He didn't know he was
doing something wrong.

20
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,770
He fell for some bad guys' tricks.

21
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,030
I paid the legal fees and
the settlement last time.

22
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,050
I'm not talking about money.

23
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:37,830
I'll figure this one out somehow by myself.

24
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,880
Please see him

25
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,720
and give him some tough love.

26
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,440
He's not a bad boy.

27
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,460
He won't listen to me,

28
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,320
so can you knock some sense into him?

29
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,870
He has to mature in order to live.

30
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,510
Give it up. He's never going to mature.

31
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,240
How can I give up?

32
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,520
A mother might give up her own life,

33
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,200
but she can't give up on her child.

34
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,020

35
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,970
Soo Ho.

36
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,430
Mom! You have nothing else
to talk about but Kang Ho?

37
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,930
It's always about Kang Ho, Kang Ho, Kang Ho.

38
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,660
If it makes you that sad,

39
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,070
live with him and make him a better person.

40
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,990
Don't push him onto me!

41
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,140
You can sleep here.

42
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,690
Where are you going so late?

43
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,850

please save Kang Ho?

Can you save me, Mom?

I heard your little brother mugged him.

It has nothing to do with me.

60

I'm out here helping out a friend.

You're out here running
away from your brother?

Talk to Kang Ho.

63
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,730
That bastard Kang Ho never comes to class.

64
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,440
It's so hard to get a hold of him.

65
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,520
You can pay now

Get out of my way.

70

This is important, so make
sure you tell the truth.

71
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,320
Did you see him pull a knife?

72
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,140
No.

73
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,640
I didn't.

74

Can you just...

75
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:15,190
disappear from my life?

76
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,940
Come to your senses!

77
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,580
I caught Han Soo Ho.

78

I know.

79

Han Soo Ho...

80
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,850
There are two Han Soo Hos.

That's why I'm asking what you mean.

82
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,120
There are two Han Soo Hos. I caught him,

83
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,550
but he followed me.

84
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,730
You saw that wrong.

85
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,420
Han Soo Ho is an only child.

86
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,090
He doesn't have a twin, nor a
brother who looks like him.

87
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,940
I followed him from the court and caught
him leaving that woman's home.

88
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,220
How can I be wrong? Huh?

89
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,440
We even bugged Han Soo Ho's
phone with a tracking device.

90

If you'd nabbed them both, we'd be fine.

91

Whether it's the guy or a lookalike,
you should've caught them both!

00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,300
Something like that.

171
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,620
5 million won in cash
if you tell me its source.

172
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,100
Why do you have this?

173
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,120
Someone installed this in my car.

174
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,530
Your car?

175
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:45,870
Yes.

176
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,060
Crazy bastard.

177
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,540
Since when do you have a car?

178
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,170
- I do.
- Stolen?

179
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,470
I work hard these days.

180
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,890
I even work late.

181
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,970
- So, where did you park your car?
- Outside!

182
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,210
Go bring me your auto registration.

183
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,940
If I see Angry Han Kang Ho's
name printed on it,

184
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,120
I'll help out, you son of a b**ch.

185
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,200
Hyung!

186
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,570
I'm not asking for help.

187
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,540
I'm helping you.

188
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,200
If you're fine with it, it'll be my gift.

189
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,760
Sure. Enjoy your meal, f***er.

190
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,310
Hello. How are you, sir?

191
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,740
It's hot outside, right?

192
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,240
You go outside and see if it's hot or not.

193
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,870
Let me take you to a cool seat.

194
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,570
Are you... by yourself?

195
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,550
Do I look like several people?

196
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,820
No, I thought maybe you were with others.

197
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,170
- I'll bring the menu.
- Forget that. Bring out the owner.

198
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,570
The owner is very busy
making the beef broth.

199
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,530
So chatty.

200
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,570
Tell her I said to come out!

201
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,630
I need to know who this "I" is.

202
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,750
Move your face.

203
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,340
Hong Ran, your husband is here!

204
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,690
Hong Ran!

205
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,170
Other customers are eating.

206
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,780
Could you keep it down?

207
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,950
Move your face!

208
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,090
Aigoo! Aigoo, my wife.

209
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,980
Aigoo!

210
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,240
What are you doing here?

211
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,130
I'm not welcome after
all we've done together?

212
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,940
Hey, you made it!

213
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,800
You must be raking it in.

214
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,950
I made this with my own money,
not a cent of yours.

215
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,730
You must be crazy.

216
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,430
Please don't be this way.
Just have a seat.

217
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
Move your face!

218
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,880
Stop this, and go in the kitchen!

219
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,330
What are you doing?
I need to take his order.

220
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,080
That's my job.

221
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,360
Oppa, why are you acting
like this too? Stop!

222
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,800
Oppa?

223
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,250
Hey.

224
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,500
What oppa?

225
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,610
Sir, if you're not going to order...

226
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,470
Let's have a visit, I mean, a chat.
How does that sound?

227
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,230
I said stop!

228
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:07,050
- Stop!
- Look at them. Hey! Hold on a second.

229
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,070
Come outside, motherf*****!

230
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,080
I got this, so don't dare come outside.

231
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,120
Please.

232
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,740
Kang Ho, enjoy your meal, f*****.

233
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,780
Stop!

234
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,790
What are you?

235
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,760
Just a part-time server at the restaurant.

236
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,690
How do you know Hong Ran?

237
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,390
We're hometown sunbae and hoobae.

238
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,340
I had nowhere else to go.

239
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,780
So she gave me a job at the restaurant.

240
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,870
A country bastard like you,

241
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,270
you have no fear.

242
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,570
I mean, if you tell me what is going on,

243
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,830
I'll do my best to figure it out for you.

244
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:04,070
I think you have your eyes on my Hong Ran.

245
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:06,800
She kept screaming at me to get a divorce.

246
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,900
She must've scammed me into marrying,
so I'm here for the money.

247
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,990
I need to get at least three million won.

248
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,820
If that's it, you should have just said that!

249
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,820
I just need to give you 3 million?

250
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,090
- You will?
- Yes, I will.

251
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,920
I got 3 million won from my
savings account the other day.

252
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,020
If I give that to you,

253
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,540
are we good?

254
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,930
This is my account number.
Wire the money here.

255
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,890
Send it within today.

256
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,240
Or...

257
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,430
I'll come back.

258
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,930
Of course, I'll do it as soon as
we close after lunch.

259
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,650
I'll do a transfer right away.

260
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,480
You're not going to bow?

261
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,620
Have a safe trip home.

262
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,450
See you later.

263
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,020
Oppa.

264
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,600
Aigoo, I told you not to
come out. Why did you?

265
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,980
What did you do to make him go away?

266
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,500
I told him to let it go just this one time.

267
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,120
I mean, I didn't really have
anything else to say.

268
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,900
Why didn't you beat him up?

269
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,070
I told you, I'm not the type to use my fist.

270
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:35,590
Go to the sauna.

271
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,660
Hey, lady, we need to finish up lunch.

272
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,370
Just go.

273
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,370
I'm fine.

274
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:49,470
Go!

275
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,170
I don't want to see any of you!

276
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,850
Come out, man! There's
nothing more to watch!

277
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,150
What was that?

278
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,410
I thought I was going to see the
legendary flying martial expert.

279
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,420
Did you pay for your meal?

280
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,790
Come on. How much could it cost?

281
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,450
Pay for it, man.

282
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,850
Give it to me.

283
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,820
Wire 3 million won,

284
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,010
and have a drink with the
other two. Happy ending, right?

285
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,380
And tell me about this one's origins.

286
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,440

really...

288
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,620
liked someone with your heart?

289
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,270
I don't deserve to.

290
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,750
Sure, don't experience that.

291
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,880
Bad guys like us

292
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,450

[ Judge Han Soo Ho ]

306
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,440
Yes, Your Honor?

307
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,210
What's up?

308
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,400
I'm working. I just organized
the current cases for you.

309
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,900
I was going to write some rulings,

310
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,060
so I was looking through
all the documents.

311
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,250
Stop working and go home.

312
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,490
Right now?

313
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,380
It's only six o'clock.

314
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,830
Let's have dinner. Come out.

315
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,200
What? Come where?

316
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,700
Yes, Your Honor.

317
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,190
What do you want to eat?

318
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,690
After eating porridge for
days, I really craved this.

319
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,450
You were sick.

320
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,100
I wanted to let you off work early

321
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,770
and treat you to something nutritious.

322
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:56,560
How come this coffee shop sells beer?

323
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,340
I told you I wasn't sick because of work.

324
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,480
You finished your medication, right?

325
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,910
I told you something bad had happened.

326
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,850
Someone who was my
closest friend and sunbae,

327
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,850
someone who was like family left.

328
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,000
A guy?

329
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,760
If he was your friend and
sunbae, he wasn't a friend.

330
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,450
If he was your sunbae and relative,

331
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,050
he wasn't a relative.

332
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,250
Yes, it's a guy.

333
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,030
He was like a brother to me.

334
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,540
Did he go far away?

335
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,800
Yes.

336
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,350
Very far.

337
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,780
After that,

338
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,970
I felt like I was really alone.

339
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,900
I really have nobody now.

340
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,160
What do you mean you have nobody?

341
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,900
You have me!

342
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,790
And Section Leader Jo.

343
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,570
Plus Dong Soo and Eun Jeong.

344
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,610
Everyone in the judge's office likes you.

345
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,070
Fighting!

346
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,560
So why are you trying to transfer me?

347
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,030
You're really going to send
me to another judge?

348
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,540
I...

349
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,020
I don't want to mess up
your luck by being with me.

350
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,620
I have a month left.

351
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,270
I'm going to work for
you until the very end.

352
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,240
I told you, I'm quitting before that.

353
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,230
Can you at least just
stay until I'm finished?

354
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,010
Or have you already decided?

355
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,610
Tastes plain.

356
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,120
Want some soju?
