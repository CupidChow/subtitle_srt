1
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,600
I shouldn't fall for you.

2
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,360
But I keep falling for you.

3
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,010
I can't hide it anymore.

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,200
As for me...

5
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,330
I'm just a trainee

6
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,340
and you're a judge.

7
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,550
You're a good person, So Eun.

8
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,950
And I'm a bad person.

9
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,370
Not a judge and trainee.

10
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:45,320
♫ The memories that await me there ♫

11
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,650
♫ The endless loneliness that  ♫

12
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,380
♫ digs deep in me like a dream ♫

13
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,570
♫ The loneliness, the longing,  ♫

14
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,020
♫ the thirst in my heart that
can't be quenched ♫

15
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:08,230
♫ It leads me to you ♫

16
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,960
♫ My...  ♫

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,240
♫ My all... ♫

18
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,900
Won't it be awkward tomorrow?

19
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,070
You made me think about it.

20
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,320
What?

21
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,730
Tomorrow.

22
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,100
I used to...

23
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,080
not think about tomorrow.

24
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Let's live for the day.

25
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,140
I thought about it seriously for the first time.

26
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,100
What do we do tomorrow?

27
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,910
Your Honor, you're weird sometimes.

28
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,830
You hold the important position of a judge

29
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,170
but talk like someone who has a rough life.

30
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,960
The more I think about it,

31
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,090
the more I wish tomorrow would never come.

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,320
All my life, until I die

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,820
I wish today could just repeat.

34
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
What part of today?

35
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,570
Specific time and place?

36
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,270
Right now.

37
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,940
Right this moment, right here.

38
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,710
This hour.

39
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
You a**hole.

40
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,020
Come back after you're
qualified to be a judge.

41
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,110
I can't give it to you before then!

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,490
[ Joo Eun ]

43
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,100
Hey.

44
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,380
Bastard.

45
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,380
I saw the news.

46
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,680
How are you?

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,610
Fine. I'll be fired, I guess.

48
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,700
Couldn't you at least say sorry, Your Honor?

49
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,880
Oh, right. Judges don't apologize.

50
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,280
No...

51
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,970
you did that time.

52
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,350
You said sorry, that it was your fault.

53
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,280
I was wondering how to apologize

54
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,810
and about exactly what part.

55
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,500
You're writing my ruling?

56
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,940
I did this thing wrong in this part.

57
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,820
I'm sentenced to three years
of being sorry. Like that?

58
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,920
Not like that.

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,370
Do you know how confused
I am right now?

60
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,910
I don't know if what I did was
a journalist's behavior

61
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,340
or a girlfriend's antics.

62
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,380
I just can't figure it out.

63
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,140
I...

64
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,160
don't want to be with someone
who confuses me.

65
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,180
Let's talk in a little bit.

66
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,570
I was going to talk to you in person

67
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,700
but I don't think I can see you.

68
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,780
It's late.

69
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,910
Go home and sleep.

70
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm breaking up with you right now,

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,900
and your response is to
tell me to go to bed?

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,250
I hear you.

73
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,380
Fine.

74
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,720
I'll go home and sleep.

75
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm sorry, Eun.

76
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,660
When I can, I'll come to see you.

77
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,500
Excuse me.

78
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm...

79
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,580
Soo Ho's mother.

80
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,680
Hello.

81
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,770
Have you eaten?

82
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,250
Would you like a midnight snack?

84
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,160
Oh, I'm okay. I have to go home.

85
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,980
I think I've seen you on TV.

86
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,700
I'm an anchorwoman.

87
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,720
My name is Joo Eun.

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,020
That's right. I've seen you.

89
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,970
I always thought you were the
prettiest anchorwoman in Korea.

90
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,300
So you and Soo Ho...

91
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,710
I'm his girlfriend.

92
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,180
Oh, I see.

93
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,690
But we broke up.

94
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,300
You broke up?

95
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,210
You broke up, but you came to his place?

96
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,500
We just broke up.

97
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,240
A minute ago.

98
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,300
I'm sorry, ma'am.

99
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,360
I'll get going...

100
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,690
Have you and Soo Ho

101
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,840
been together for a long time?

102
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,150
Ma'am,

103
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,930
I don't want to talk about him.

104
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,350
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,370
I want to ask one thing.

106
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,380
Did Soo Ho tell you

107
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,180
that he was an only child, by any chance?

108
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,040
Yes. He said he was the only son.

109
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,180
I...

110
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,230
am very proud of my Soo Ho.

111
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,630
How did I give birth to such a son?

112
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,270
I'm so proud of him

113
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,930
and thankful, and sorry.

114
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,010
I've always felt that way.

115
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,340
It's good you broke up.

116
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,280
It's good you broke up.

117
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,160
Why do you say that?

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,140
Do you live alone?

119
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,670
No, with my parents.

120
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,470
But...

121
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,450
you were Soo Ho's girlfriend.

122
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,780
Can you wait a minute? Just a minute.

123
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,840
Can I help with anything?

124
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,630
No, no, have a seat. I'm almost done.

125
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,260
What about the dishes?

126
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,060
No, please, be comfortable.

127
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,170
I'm not comfortable.

128
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,050
I'm really uncomfortable.

129
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,900
Did I...

130
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,850
make you uncomfortable?

131
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,400
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,160
This is what "not knowing what to
do with oneself" must mean.

133
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,080
I only know how to make packaged ramen.

134
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,470
I'll just do the dishes.

135
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,510
What dishes? Oh my.

136
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,850
But...

137
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,230
why did you say it's good we broke up?

138
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,070
Even if you're a judge

139
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,380
you need to be human first.

140
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,580
Did something happen?

141
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,460
It's all my fault.

142
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,760
I raised both my sons all wrong.

143
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,130
Both?

144
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,550
Isn't he an only child?

145
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,800
When they were little,

146
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,300
I registered the younger son
under a relative's family registry.

147
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,650
If that's why he says he's an only child,

148
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,990
he doesn't have the right to be a brother.

149
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,470
You sent him to be adopted?

150
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,970
Just on paper.

151
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,830
The elders of the family discussed it.

152
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
Why did you and Soo Ho

153
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,500
break up?

154
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,960
I don't know if it's seasoned well.

155
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,520
Taste this.

156
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,200
It's salty.

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,450
Salty?

158
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,560
Oh, no.

159
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,580
Why is that so?

160
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,000
I think...

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,900
you put too much salt in it.

162
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,090
I did?

163
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,650
Why did I do that?

164
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,880
Why did I... what should I do?

165
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,800
Wait a minute.

166
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,680
You don't have to walk me out.

167
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,200
I was about to go home, too.

168
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,860
I don't want to see my so-called son.

169
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,530
But...

170
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,190
thank you.

171
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,640
For what?

172
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,130
Soo Ho doesn't talk much
nor has many friends.

173
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,870
But because of you, Anchorwoman Eun,

174
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,540
he must have been less lonely.

175
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,650
I think you're the lonelier person.

176
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,630
Do I even know what
loneliness is? I'm too old.

177
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,420
I'll see you on the news.

178
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,820
We trust everything that's on the news.

179
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,930
So please keep reporting good stories.

180
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,540
I think Han Soo Ho is definitely using
his brother to keep an eye on us.

181
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,780
If I jump him like last time,

182
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,280
he'll follow and jump us.

183
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,460
Don't think about it too hard.

184
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,850
If they stoop low, we'll stoop lower.

185
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,230
What do you mean?

186
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,120
Han Soo Ho's mother lives alone.

187
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,360
What?

188
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
Must we do that?

189
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,180
Does Han Soo Ho's mom
have a right to be happy?

190
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,740
If we did...

191
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,260
- would that make you happy?
- Yes.

192
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,710
At that moment, I'll be happy.

193
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,220
I read the visitation records.

194
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,370
After Hyung died,

195
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,260
I requested them and read them.

196
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,700
I wanted to know what
happened after I left,

197
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,220
why Hyung did that all of a sudden.

198
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,740
Did Han Soo Ho kill him?

199
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,660
Hyung.

200
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,270
It's okay.

201
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,530
All right?

202
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,830
We'll appeal.

203
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,900
It's all going to be okay.

204
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,670
Hyung, look at me. Please?

205
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,460
Look at me.

206
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,120
Do you need anything?

207
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,310
Hyung, are you listening to me?

208
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,420
Look at me!

209
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,700
Stop it.

210
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,880
Don't you know not to push him?

211
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,490
You should go outside.

212
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,980
Look at me.

213
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,680
Look at me.

214
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,510
It's okay. Look at me.

215
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,460
Why did you do that?

216
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,890
Why do you keep lying?

217
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,400
You didn't do it.

218
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,010
I have to.

219
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,190
Did someone make you?

220
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,860
The judge doesn't like
people who flip-flop.

221
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,530
If I don't, I won't ever go home. Ever!

222
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,550
Who told you that?

223
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,240
Who told you to do that?

224
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,360
Why? Why are you doing this?

225
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,430
We're working so hard to save you,

226
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,760
but why aren't you listening?

227
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,430
You promised to just listen to me.

228
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,090
You promised to just listen
to me, so why?

229
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,270
Are you an idiot for real?

230
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:38,140
Why are you making me suffer?

231
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,790
Because of you, we're now...

232
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,850
completely broken. Do you know that?

233
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,290
If you want to die so badly, die alone.

234
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,730
Don't make me suffer with you.

235
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,410
Hyung listened to every word you said.

236
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,480
I'll ask you again.

237
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,860
Is the person who killed Hyung

238
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,660
Judge Han Soo Ho?

239
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,040
Yes.

240
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,740
It was that judge.

241
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
Then, fine.

242
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,810
Don't do anything else.

243
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,800
Don't think you'll kill everyone
and kill yourself from guilt.

244
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,520
Kill the one bad guy,

245
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,390
and live in a world
that's a bit less corrupt.

246
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,360
Think carefully.

247
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,810
Good morning.

248
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,040
Hello.

249
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,510
Hello.

250
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,920
So Eun.

251
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,170
Yes?

252
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,130
- Come to my office for a moment.
- Okay.

253
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,110
You shouldn't call me in like this.

254
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,250
A judge wants to call in
his trainee. So what?

255
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,490
It's strange to think
something's wrong with that.

256
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,130
Sure.

257
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,000
I thought you called me in for nothing.

258
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,270
Can I do something for you?

259
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,480
No.

260
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,890
I called you in for nothing.

261
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:11,820
Your Honor!

262
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,670
What are you doing this weekend?

263
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,800
- I'm working.
- C'mon.

264
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,120
Your first and final trial are all
on the same day next week.

265
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,500
You assigned all of the rulings and
the summaries to me as homework.

266
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,790
I wouldn't have enough time
even if I came in all weekend.

267
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,260
And, Your Honor.

268
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,840
In court, I'm just a trainee.

269
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,130
Got it?

270
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,020
Please hurry and answer me!

271
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,620
You're a trainee.

272
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,500
I'm a judge.

273
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,580
Okay?

274
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,840
Yes.

275
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,610
This is why I didn't want today to come.

276
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,160
I wish yesterday could just repeat.

277
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,520
I will work very hard.

278
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,410
- So Eun...
- Oh, yes?

279
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,730
This is awkward for me to say.

280
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,920
Something happened
between you two, right?

281
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,230
- What?
- I knew it.

282
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,970
I knew something would happen.

283
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,570
No, not at all.

284
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,750
It's not like that, no.

285
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,150
I've worked in this court for 16 years.

286
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,940
I've seen countless judges and
trainees. I know it when I see it.

287
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,990
A trainee is a trainee.

288
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,620
It's unacceptable.

289
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,100
I...

290
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,620
It's really not like that.

291
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,090
Don't think nothing can be done
because it already happened.

292
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,360
Just don't do it ever again.

293
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,560
We're not like that.

294
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,480
At the dinner that night,

295
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,710
when we were playing
rock-paper-scissors,

296
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,500
and he asked for a rematch,
why did you say no?

297
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,760
We were all okay with a rematch.

298
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,570
Of course, he found that unpleasant.

299
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,480
You got a big scolding, right?

300
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Yes.

301
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,650
I saw him wagging his finger
at you just before.

302
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,230
He's not usually like that.

303
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,290
Did you apologize?

304
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,690
- Yes.
- That's good.

305
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,030
I'm sorry to intrude.

306
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,950
But keep in mind one thing.

307
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,370
I...

308
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,680
am always on your side.

309
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,640
Oh, yes.

310
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,420
Gifts that women like.

311
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,440
Gifts to bring when
you confess your feelings.

312
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,580
Sunbae.

313
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,290
I didn't get the script for the news.

314
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,180
You haven't heard?

315
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,220
Heard what?

316
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,990
Man, the press director...

317
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,000
he said he'd tell you.

318
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,460
Tell me what?

319
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,740
Whatever it is, he said he'd tell you.

320
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,040
Press Director, I didn't get a script.

321
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,920
I'm almost done organizing my desk.

322
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,190
Get out before you make
me throw things again.

323
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,850
I didn't get a script.

324
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,490
There won't be any news for a while.

325
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,480
Go on vacation.

326
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,840
I didn't submit a vacation request.

327
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,380
I did.

328
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,760
Why?

329
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,190
You're not qualified.

330
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,790
Go on vacation and don't come back.

331
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,260
I understand.

332
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,660
I'll meet with the
department head tomorrow.

333
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:02,160
If he tells me to go on vacation too,

334
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,010
I will meet with the president the next day.

335
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,220
Hey, you, Anchorwoman Joo!

336
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,470
At the new staff orientation, you said:

337
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,550
"Hey, bastards, you guys are the news."

338
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,730
"Don't ever back down."

339
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,820
"Keep your chin up."

340
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,970
Remember that?

341
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,090
I'll do as I learned.

342
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,310
Do I need an occasion
to see my hyung?

343
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,280
I promised to never hang out with
tattooed guys like you again.

344
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,430
Tattoos are very popular these days.

345
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,590
You don't know the trend.

346
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,140
Not that kind of tattoo, dude.

347
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm talking about guys like you.

348
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,510
Guys wondering what trouble to stir up
tomorrow while making trouble today.

349
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,280
Guys like ex-convicts with records, man.

350
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,580
So shove food into your mouth and leave.

351
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,080
It's about to get crowded. I'm busy.

352
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,100
Hyung...

353
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,790
I have a question.

354
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,720
If you have a question, ask the internet.

355
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,690
How do you become a good person?

356
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,610
I thought you were trying to be good, too.

357
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,870
I had a momentary thought like that.

358
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,920
Not totally.

359
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,980
I've never been good before, so

360
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,470
I don't know how.

361
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,800
Hey, man, are you drunk?

362
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,880
Hyung!

363
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,280
I'm dead serious.

364
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,290
Man, you're making me
want to munch on this.

365
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,740
You said a bad guy

366
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,100
doesn't have the right to like someone.

367
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,800
How come you show up out of nowhere

368
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,860
and make me cringe, man?

369
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,610
What kind of guy am I?

370
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:43,430
Hyung, you're the master
at figuring out people.

371
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,360
I am.

372
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,000
- Take it off.
- What?

373
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,220
Then you will know who you are.

374
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,120
Fine.

375
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,470
I'll take it off.

376
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,480
You don't think I will?

377
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,380
Not that, dude!

378
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,610
Your shirt, man!

379
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,940
Why your pants? Someone
wants to see your underwear?

380
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,620
Your shirt.

381
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,670
See something?

382
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,880
What?

383
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,820
Your tattoos, dude.

384
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,800
[ Angle ]

385
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,080
I don't know much English

386
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,860
but "angel," the flying thing

387
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,050
is spelled a-n-g-e-l.

388
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,050
But dude, under your angel, it says "angle."

389
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,960
A-n-g-l-e.

390
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,440
That's why I'm Angry Han Kang Ho.

391
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,820
Sure.

392
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,750
You know? That's you, man.

393
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,870
You were almost an angel, and then not.

394
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,240
When I saw that,

395
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,210
I saw you clearly.

396
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:53,110
You would be clumsy.

397
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:57,790
I knew it would be hard
for you to be truly bad.

398
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,660
Hey. Get dressed.

399
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,130
Put your shirt back on, dude.

400
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,080
Put it on!

401
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,780
Hurry up.

402
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,030
Dang it.

403
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,000
I was wondering what you were
doing during the busy hour.

404
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,300
You leave our restaurant and
buy food at some other place?

405
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,990
Give me a break. An angel?

406
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,050
No, the spelling should be

407
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,300
a-n-g, now...

408
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,810
You said you'll never hang out
with tattooed guys again!

409
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,890
Go, go watch the tables!

410
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,090
We're about to get busy.

411
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,860
Are you the only one with a mouth?

412
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,800
I like lamb skewers too.
I know how to eat them, too!

413
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,600
Don't come.

414
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,730
Go! Go! Hurry up!

415
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,310
Can't believe you left...

416
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,560
We'll be done with
the trial tomorrow, right?

417
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,160
The judge is being
disciplined, so it will be final.

418
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,880
Get some rest and see you on Monday.

419
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,870
This is the only time to
pull out my hidden card.

420
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,930
What is this?

421
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,660
So...

422
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,940
that night, I handed over
the drugs and got a check.

423
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,580
But that wasn't from Lee Ho Sung.

424
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,260
It was a check from
President Choi of Choi Hospital.

425
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,280
But they all did drugs together.

426
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,900
Even if you just take one,
the drug makes you go nuts.

427
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,690
I think they did a lot.

428
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:22,070
If you change your testimony now,

429
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,230
you could go on trial for selling...

430
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,680
Get to the point.

431
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,730
It's a bit strange.

432
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,570
Park Hae Na gets commercials
and TV shows after her trial.

433
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,520
You have her back. What about me?

434
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,110
Aren't you treating us unfairly?

435
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,520
What's your point?

436
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,730
We got blamed together.

437
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,050
But someone sells her face on TV
and is taken care of.

438
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:49,830
I only got 30 million won.
What the heck am I doing?

439
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,470
Honestly, it's not even 300 million.

440
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,860
Are you saying you want 300 million won?

441
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,790
If you can give me more,

442
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,250
that would be great.

443
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,280
You requested the lightest
punishment possible,

444
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,080
and I delivered legal services accordingly.

445
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,450
Legally, there is no problem.

446
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,650
If you're so confident,

447
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,390
should I release this to the press?

448
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,310
Sure, go ahead.

449
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:24,050
A lawyer acting like this

450
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,410
is a big moral issue.

451
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,770
You won't work anymore.

452
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,960
Morals?

453
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,740
The comfort women forced into sexual slavery
during the Japanese colonial era

454
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,510
filed a lawsuit against a Japanese corporation.

455
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,350
Do you know who represents
that Japanese corporation?

456
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,340
My firm.

457
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,190
The best law firm in Korea

458
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,900
fights the ex-comfort women grandmothers

459
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,810
and defends the Japanese
corporation, a war criminal.

460
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,930
The press should have cried

461
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,330
that it was immoral!

462
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,470
Citizens should have protested!

463
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,060
But the reality is!

464
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,280
We are still...

465
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,200
the best firm in Korea.

466
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,650
I...

467
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,820
just...

468
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,940
Have you ever imagined what kind

469
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,830
of things I protect, in the name of law?

470
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,600
Just because I defend petty criminals like you,

471
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,770
do I seem like a petty lawyer to you?

472
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,390
It's not like I want a large sum.

473
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,970
I'm sorry.

474
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,700
So why do you keep trying me?

475
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,670
We're not such amateurs.

476
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,190
I'm sorry.

477
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,590
I'll release your travel ban.

478
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,260
Take the 30 million won
and go abroad for a year.

479
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,480
I'm sorry.

480
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,080
Please forgive me.

481
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,950
Until I tell you to come back,

482
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:07,660
don't return to Korea.
