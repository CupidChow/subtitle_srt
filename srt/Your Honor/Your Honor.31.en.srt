1
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,980
Unni.

2
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,900
We're out of mole poison.
Do we need more...

3
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,170
Is that... your sister?

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,020
So Eun unni.

5
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,100
Is that...

6
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,520
is that really your sister?

7
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,650
So Eun unni, right?

8
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,020
That's right. My sister.

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,260
My sister-in-law.

10
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,150
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

11
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,420
My goodness.

12
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,960
- Have you told Oppa?
- Not yet.

13
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,750
Unni,

14
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,310
go home.

15
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,430
I'll watch the store. Go home.

16
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,590
My goodness.

17
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,840
Are you sure you can watch
the store like that?

18
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,630
I'm okay. Go ahead.

19
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,930
I don't know what to say first.

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,590
I got into the Trial Research Institute.

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,400
What is that?

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,980
I was so happy I got in

23
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,810
but I had no one to call.

24
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:31,570
No one to brag to.

25
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,880
No one to be happy for me.

26
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,110
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

27
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,550
Didn't you miss me?

28
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,770
Why didn't you visit?

29
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,830
Why didn't you call even once?

30
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,510
You could have called at least.

31
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,170
You didn't have to get
married without a family.

32
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,290
Even if it wasn't in person,
at least a phone call.

33
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,080
At least for me.

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,350
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,070
I'm sorry for everything.

36
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,350
I'm sorry, Unni.

37
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,770
I got here too late, right?

38
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,360
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,010
I got here too late.

40
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,010
My sister-in-law is here?

41
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,740
- Honey, slow down.
- Okay.

42
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,090
Sister-in-law,

43
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,940
I wanted to meet you.

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,420
We really missed you.

45
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,890
Thank you...

46
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,570
for coming.

47
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,660
So...

48
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,780
after the Trial Research Institute,
you'll become a judge?

49
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,370
No.

50
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,360
These days, you need at least 10 years
of courtroom experience to apply to be a judge.

51
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,830
It's a two-year researcher contract,

52
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,150
so I'll get experience as a lawyer
afterward and then apply.

53
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,000
I see. So you don't just become
a judge after your exam?

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,450
- She said no.
- I didn't know.

55
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,890
I mean, no one should be a judge
because he's book smart.

56
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,940
You should only judge someone after
at least 10 years of working experience.

57
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,570
- Right?
- She just said that, Oppa.

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,100
You keep asking questions
so she can't eat.

59
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,700
I ordered the mole poison.

60
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,260
Did you get plenty?

61
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,730
It's the rainy season,

62
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,630
so a lot of people will want it.

63
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,930
Same amount we got last year.

64
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,660
I'm learning so I can open my own store.

65
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,090
Not everyone can do business.

66
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,290
I keep telling you to go to trade school.

67
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,190
- Business is a trade.
- You need a certificate in something.

68
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,110
I'm in installation.

69
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,610
It's an automated greenhouse system.

70
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,690
How do I explain it?

71
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,460
Don't explain it.

72
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,630
Don't listen.

73
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,850
His nickname is "infinite mouth."

74
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,270
It's okay, go ahead.

75
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,880
The most important thing in
a greenhouse is the humidity.

76
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,750
It's also the hardest to control.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,110
So...

78
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,510
You win!

79
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,670
The winner of a beauty
contest in our house.

80
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,370
- What?
- Bo Ram...

81
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,700
thinks she will become prettier
next to a pretty person.

82
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,360
She goes next to whomever
she wants to look like.

83
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,370
- Bo Ram, do you think your aunt is pretty?
- Yes.

84
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,150
Who's prettier, your mom or your aunt?

85
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,550
My aunt!

86
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,950
I knew it.

87
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,500
Am I prettier or your aunt?

88
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,040
My aunt!

89
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,910
Oh, wow.

90
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,940
You traitor.

91
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,790
As you can see, I'm the
only man in the house.

92
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,210
So let me ask you a favor.

93
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,820
Sister...

94
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,250
please marry a man!

95
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,630
Ow, why?

96
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,910
I want to have a drink with
a male family member.

97
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,210
I love drinking.

98
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,370
I drink a lot sometimes.

99
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,530
Really? Great news.

100
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,080
Let me go get drinks.

101
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,740
Dad.

102
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,970
Okay.

103
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,440
I've never had such a
raucous dinner before.

104
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,570
Your family is so lively.

105
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,770
I'm proud of you, my little sister.

106
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,650
You passed that hard exam.

107
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,290
It must have been hard with
no one looking after you.

108
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,600
Mom and Dad sent me
money until I graduated.

109
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,500
It was plenty.

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,080
Are Mom and Dad doing okay?

111
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,430
Yes.

112
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,700
When Mom said she was
emigrating because of me...

113
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,620
Unni,

114
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,780
this is weird.

115
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,490
It should break off now that
I found you, but it hasn't.

116
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,350
Is it a knockoff?

117
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,400
What other wish could you have?

118
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,850
Nothing, besides seeing you again.

119
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:34,290
They say wishes change with
time and become stronger.

120
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,790
That's weird. I don't have any.

121
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,970
How are you these days?

122
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,760
In school, the salary was tight.

123
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,090
But as a researcher, it'll be better.

124
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,080
Want to live together?

125
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,180
I always felt sorry

126
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,280
that our family suffered because of me.

127
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,690
I thought everything would
be solved if I went away.

128
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,420
But now I wonder if I'm the
one with the good life.

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,070
Unni,

130
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,020
are you happy?

131
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,450
And you?

132
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,370
Me, too.

133
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,170
Then it's all good.

134
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:35,010
♫ The memories that
await me there ♫

135
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:42,180
♫ Like a dream, the loneliness
that pierces me ♫

136
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:51,000
♫ The thirst that could not
fill my missing heart ♫

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:02,880
♫ Leads me to you, here,
guide me... my all ♫

138
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,690
You awake?

139
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,320
Have a drink.

140
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,340
Did it surprise you

141
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,210
that I spoke casually from the beginning?

142
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,000
No. It's okay. I liked it.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,660
I promised your sister

144
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,110
I would speak casually from
the beginning if I ever met you.

145
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,610
So it would be less awkward.

146
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,730
Please speak comfortably.

147
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,210
Then...

148
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,290
think of me as a drinking buddy...

149
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,410
and feel comfortable.

150
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,420
I first saw your sister on Jeju Island.

151
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,420
I went down there to
design a greenhouse

152
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,960
and met her at a restaurant.

153
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,390
She was working there part-time.

154
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,420
It was love at first sight.
I kept going back.

155
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,460
She was so cold to me.

156
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,640
After a month, she still didn't notice me.

157
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,270
You couldn't talk to her for a month?

158
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,330
No, two months.

159
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,080
My work was done,

160
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,900
so I had to leave Jeju Island.

161
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,900
I talked to her without a plan.

162
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,630
What did you say?

163
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,970
Back home,

164
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,580
I have a pesticide store that
I inherited from my parents.

165
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,380
Do you...

166
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,150
like pesticides?

167
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,310
There aren't a lot of girls
who like pesticides.

168
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,310
She told me later

169
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,960
that she almost smacked me with a ladle.

170
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,680
So?

171
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,100
After that day,

172
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,460
I went there every weekend for a year.

173
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,850
I finally asked her out and
we started dating.

174
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,880
She was amazing,

175
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,170
so I proposed.

176
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,110
I got rejected.

177
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,350
She said she didn't
deserve to be married.

178
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,640
- Unni said that?
- Yes.

179
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,400
She said she had lied,

180
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,800
that she had deceived me.

181
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,730
Sister-in-law,

182
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,720
you have a scar on your arm, right?

183
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,140
After I heard the full story, I said to her:

184
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,140
"The bad thing that happened to you

185
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,260
wasn't your fault.

186
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,930
You leaving home, living
with a new name

187
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,050
and not being able to tell me
isn't your fault, either.

188
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,950
You lied so you could be with me.

189
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,380
So... let's keep being together."

190
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,870
Thank you

191
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,460
for saying that.

192
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,970
I'm the thankful one

193
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,980
that she chose me.

She...

198

talked about you every day.

199
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,660
She wanted to go find you every day,

but she couldn't.

don't hate her too much.

I don't hate her.

Because you're not a judge anymore?

243

I made an incorrect ruling
in a certain trial.

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,200
too big for one person anyway.

In the world,

Better than doing something wrong
and getting away with it.

Anyway,

275
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,970
I hoped you would at least
tell me not to go.

276
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,640
Or insist that you come with me.

336
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,720
but I couldn't get in touch.

337
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,670
Contact him later.

338
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:26,810
He's busy seeking a position
as a law professor.

339
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,160
Professor?

340
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,590
Not a chef?

341
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,770
What do you mean by chef?

342
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,440
He can't even make ramen.

343
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,390
No, he's a really good cook.

344
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,730
How do you know that?

345
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,570
Have you seen him cook?

346
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,860
No.

347
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,560
I saw him cook poorly.

348
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,060
How can someone be
incapable of peeling garlic?

349
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,580
That can't be.

350
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,180
That certainly can.

351
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,820
I would know.

352
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,890
If I fed you when you
weren't working...

353
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,400
the right thing to do is share the goods
when you're making money!

354
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,230
You're perfectly right.

355
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,280
What do you mean?

356
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,990
To get money from your ex-wife.
Is that the right thing to do?

357
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,650
Of course, it isn't the right thing.

358
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,360
Who do you think you are?

359
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,290
Why are you hitting an innocent person?

360
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,770
Get out before I call the police!

361
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
Call them! Call them!

362
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,540
If I stab myself here, see
who's losing out! Call them!

363
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,560
Don't make a scene here.
Let's go outside.

364
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,000
Who do you think you are,
and why do you keep butting in...

365
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,330
Let go! It hurts!

366
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,490
You want your wrist or your arm broken?

367
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,560
Han Kang Ho, what are you doing?

368
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,820
What do you say? Wrist or arm?

369
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,070
Han Kang Ho!

370
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,930
Young bastard, doing grunt
work at a restaurant.

371
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,240
I can't believe this.

372
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,170
Tell him to come out!

373
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,400
I'll give him a nice scolding later.

374
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:16,580
I'm the victim. Why are
you scolding him?

375
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,800
I used to be someone in the old days.

376
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,700
Call him.

377
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,000
Call him! You won't?

378
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,840
I'm coming.

379
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,050
Bastard, the grown-ups are talking.

380
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,600
Go inside. Go inside.

381
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,980
I said, go inside.

382
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,480
I told you not to come outside, you punk.

383
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,940
Why are you bowing down to a thug who's
stealing from his ex-wife?

384
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,840
I wouldn't be able to roll like that.

385
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,920
Do you think it's easy for me?

386
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,760
Let's end this today, Hyung.

387
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,030
What are you doing? Hey!

388
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,810
This is embarrassing.

389
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,370
Hey, hey!

390
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,690
This is a misdemeanor, dude.

391
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,110
Ahjussi! Do you know who this is?

392
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,120
Yes? Oh, yes.

393
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,400
He does grunt work at the
restaurant... I don't know.

394
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,340
If you don't know,

395
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:20,060
google the Dangjin Praying Mantis.

396
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,570
Why are you bringing up my
old name all of a sudden, man?

397
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,020
Did you find it?

398
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,250
I... I'm working on it,

399
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,900
but I'm out of data, so...

400
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,800
Do you see it? Dangjin Praying Mantis?

401
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,940
- I don't...
- You don't?

402
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,100
I don't.

403
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,400
It says there are no search results...

404
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,500
That's the kind of man he is.

405
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,240
He gets rid of people
without anyone finding out.

406
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,330
It doesn't even show up on the internet!

407
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,890
You want to see what
perfect crime looks like?

408
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,670
Hey, threatening is a crime! Stop it!

409
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,530
This is not a threat.

410
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,530
I'm appeasing him.

411
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,240
If you don't want a missing
report about you,

412
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,970
I hope you will never come back.

413
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,040
Please, I ask this of you.

414
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,400
Yes.

415
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
Help us!

416
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,470
Yes.

417
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,750
Put it back on.

418
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,400
You don't want to scare the owner.

419
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm trying to have a good life!

420
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,180
- Geez!
- Yes.

421
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,300
Thank you.

422
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,920
Let's shake hands.

423
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,530
Thank you for staying by
Hong Ran's side during hard times.

424
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,980
I'm always grateful.

425
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,030
No problem. I'm sorry.

426
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,830
I will carry...

427
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,080
that gratitude with me forever.

428
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,030
No, I'm thankful.

429
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,410
You came all the way here,
so have lunch before you go.

430
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,890
No, have a good day.

431
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,800
I should go.

432
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,650
When it comes to playing hard to get,

433
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,730
age and nationality don't matter.

434
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,650
At your age...

435
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,330
isn't it too much?

436
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,240
What are you talking about?

437
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,790
I'm still young.

438
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,300
Young?

439
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,900
Honestly, you're fully ripe, no?

440
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,800
In my opinion, you're the problem.

441
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,400
What do you know about
love between grown-ups?

442
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,030
Oppa, what do you know about love?

443
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,800
If I wrote about love,

444
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,260
I would have written
an epic with 100 sequels.

445
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,850
If you have time to write,
wipe down another table.

446
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,300
- You also have a problem.
- What about me?

447
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,090
I'm just jealous, looking at you two.

448
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,400
So jealous,

449
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,890
but I wish I were even more jealous.

450
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:07,920
You two are really in love.

451
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,180
Sir,

452
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,370
you saved our restaurant, so I've treated
you well, but you're crossing a line.

453
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:15,620
Why would I love someone like this?

454
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,020
What kind of person is that?

455
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,390
Is it a genre or a species?

456
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,270
- You don't know?
- If I did, would I ask?

457
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:25,160
Do I need to explain? If I had to list all
your wrongs, it would take me my whole life!

458
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,900
Go ahead. I'll listen for
the rest of my life!

459
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,360
Don't try to make moves!

460
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,150
So, then, should I just explicitly
ask you to marry me?

461
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,090
What? Propose? What?

462
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,630
Why do I need to marry you?

463
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,180
Why shouldn't you?

464
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,350
I don't have a reason to.

465
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,150
I'm asking because I do.

466
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,360
What, what? What could
your grand reason be?

467
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I know that all this time

468
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:51,840
I have wronged you many times.

469
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,350
So you know that you wronged me?

470
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,360
I do, of course.

471
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,550
If I made it up to you my
entire life, it wouldn't be enough.

472
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:03,910
But I want to try.

473
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,270
Until I feel I have made it up to you,

474
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,550
I want to try making it up to you.

475
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,620
That's how I live these days.

476
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,200
I know you don't know.

477
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,400
I know.

478
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,900
I know, but...

479
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
I don't like that I know.

480
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,400
I'm scared.

481
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,030
Let's...

482
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,990
Ran, if you don't have any
special reason to object,

483
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,760
let's just get married.

484
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,090
I'm officially proposing.

485
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,920
How... romantic.

486
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,150
Truly.

487
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:03,800
♫ We give each other new wounds,
live that way, like now ♫
