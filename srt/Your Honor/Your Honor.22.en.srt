1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,090
I got it, I got it.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,590
It's okay. I got it.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,370
- Hey, hey.
- Hey!

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,470
Let's share the duty.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,590
Leave it to our luck.

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,770
Rock-paper-scissors. The loser
gets to grill the meat.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:19,260
Geez, no way. How could we do
rock-paper-scissors with you, Judge?

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,010
Let's do it. If you don't, no meat!
Rock-paper-scissors!

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,810
Rock-paper-scissors!

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:27,040
- Yay!
- Rock saved me!

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,650
I appeal. Let's do it again.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,250
- Dismissed.
- Why?

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,270
For all rulings, don't we have
right to three appeals?

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,470
Dismissed without reason.

15
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,320
You're like the judge.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,760
Fine. I'll take your order.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,700
- Eun Jung, you first.
- How could I, Your Honor?

18
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,020
Well done, please! Well done.

19
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,800
Okay!

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,690
- And Dong Sik?
- I like it rare.

21
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,700
You guys, how could you be
so rude and order him around?

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,160
Don't you know our dinner is
an extension of our work?

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,190
Section Leader Jo.

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,600
Give me your order.

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,340
I'll eat however you cook it.

26
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,070
- How can I do however I want to?
- Just...

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,540
I like the outside crispy but

28
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,880
it can't be hard at all.

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,100
The inside has to be moist
and hold the juice.

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,540
Moist but not oily.

31
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,860
And you have to cut the large cartilage.

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,020
And it's good to leave
the small ones alone.

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,830
When you grill kimchi, you can't have the
meat marinade touch the meat.

34
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,700
Because it burns before it cooks.

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,300
Never, you can never let them mix.

36
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,880
How did you want your meat?

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,350
You can just grill it however.

38
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,480
Grill it however. Deal!

39
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,950
So Eun.

40
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,150
Well, for me...

41
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,710
Please grill it prettily.

42
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,310
I'll grill it prettily for all!

43
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,910
Yay!

44
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,020
Here, here.

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,220
So Eun, this is delicious.

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,100
Judge, I learned this on TV. Look.

47
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,440
One, two, three.

48
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,880
Whoa!

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,500
- Fun, huh?
- Wow, so cool!

50
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,600
- Wow!
- So good!

51
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,420
A long time ago,
my sister said this to me.

52
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,940
The life will become abundant
when you know how to party.

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,560
I wish I had a noona like that.

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,280
But I was scared of the word, "partying."

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,470
"Party people, party girls, party students..."

56
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,120
It has negative connotations.

57
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,030
Someone made that up
to stop us from partying.

58
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,320
"You all work. Partying is bad." Just like that.

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,140
But still, partying makes me nervous.

60
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,360
That's because you haven't partied much.

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,780
Once you get used to partying, it's the best.

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,370
That's not it.

63
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,590
I thought about why I feel anxious.

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,020
Why is that?

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,110
Let me see the pictures.

66
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,260
What pictures?

67
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,840
The pictures from the karaoke earlier.

68
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,090
Oh... I knew it.

69
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,220
I look so ugly.

70
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,470
Delete it.

71
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
Don't delete it.

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I closed my eyes.

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,630
Oh? You look cute.
Why are you deleting it?

74
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,110
Oh, no.

75
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,160
This is okay.

76
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,100
Crazy. I'm dancing.

77
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,240
Don't delete it, I said.

78
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,950
No.

79
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,120
Delete.

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,880
Don't delete them.

81
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,730
You look good, but I look so weird.

82
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,420
Delete. Crazy. Delete.

83
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,530
Whoa.

84
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,580
Whoa, a photo of a lifetime.

85
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,030
I don't know how I went to look
for my sister last night...

86
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,390
What happened inside...

87
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,520
I don't remember too well.

88
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,950
I was too nervous

89
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,950
that I felt like my body, mind,
and thinking all went numb.

90
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,760
I was lying in bed to go to sleep.

91
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,200
And that's all I could think about.

92
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,070
Feeling as if I'd die from suffocation.

93
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,910
When someone held my hand,

94
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,870
I was finally able to breathe.

95
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,040
Those two things.

96
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,790
♫ Believe me now ♫

97
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,500
I deleted all my ugly pictures.

98
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,280
Send me the rest.

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,250
♫ I was genuine ♫

100
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,240
♫ Hear my words ♫

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,160
♫ Calling me in my heart ♫

102
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,250
♫ Your voice ♫

103
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:11,430
♫ Sorry, my story ♫

104
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,910
♫ No matter how much I yell out to you,
I can't cover up your wounds ♫

105
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:25,320
♫ And I don't want to be without you ♫

106
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,070
♫ Remember the time we spent together ♫

107
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,680
Sunbaenim.

108
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,810
Let's release the news
on my father tomorrow.

109
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,640
To put pressure on Judge Han's
disciplinary action, too.

110
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,410
There are so many people
who are guilty on the inside.

111
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,420
It's a bit ambiguous.

112
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,660
It's not the first time we spread
prosecution information to press.

113
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,580
First, put it on the news and
let Judge Han be disciplined

114
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,230
and be eliminated from rehire.

115
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,980
And my father can retire smoothly after that

116
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,230
to stop the press.

117
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,830
Then, it looks good as well.

118
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,490
Hey, Oh Sang Cheol.

119
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,280
Whether I'm doing your job lately

120
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,640
or you're doing my job...

121
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,060
I can't tell.

122
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,240
It's all for you, Sunbaenim.

123
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,780
The disciplinary committee
that was just dragging...

124
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,040
You finally pulled it together.

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,700
I almost forgot to tell you about
the disciplinary committee.

126
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,410
You know Trainee Song?

127
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,290
- She's peculiar.
- Trainee Song?

128
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,370
I trained her while doing
her prosecution rotation.

129
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,930
She wrote a petition on
behalf of Han Soo Ho.

130
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,460
"Our judge isn't like that..."

131
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,700
In my view...

132
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,660
they slept together.

133
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,310
So Eun is my college hoobae.

134
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,250
She doesn't sleep around like that.

135
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,430
Hey.

136
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,430
Not even God knows a man
and woman relationship.

137
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,430
To put it bluntly, if they
didn't sleep together,

138
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,610
what courage would a trainee have to submit
a petition for a judge disciplinary committee?

139
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,900
She's trying to ruin her future.

140
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,740
Sunbaenim.

141
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,300
May I see that petition?

142
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,350
[ Korea's biggest law firm Ohdaeyang's
golf ball incident, a bribery scandal ]

143
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,060
Sunbae.

144
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,030
Why this news out of the blue?

145
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,680
Wasn't it banned?

146
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,390
The higher-ups up there
released a part of it.

147
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,220
It was meant for the top news
for the main news.

148
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,740
But the Press Director is taking
our news to steal the spotlight.

149
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,310
He's very cunning.

150
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,470
Everyone else's names are
being used with initials.

151
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,160
Why are we opening up
Judge Han Soo Ho's name?

152
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,850
Probably got in trouble
playing the star judge?

153
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,490
The investigation hasn't
been concluded yet.

154
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,480
This is about burying one's career.

155
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,230
How will you be responsible for that?

156
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,640
Why would we be responsible?

157
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,650
- We're the press.
- Then who does?

158
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,270
Someone will, I'm sure.

159
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,410
It's not us.

160
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,100
How can you say that?

161
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,310
Because you pity one person,

162
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,330
you cover up suspicions, go easy, or ignore.
Is that what the press does?

163
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,750
If we have to be responsible for their lives
after the news airs, no one can work in news.

164
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,310
Whether the money you
received was on loan or bribe,

165

I'll do the news if I have to.

166

have to utter your name.

The biggest law firm in Korea,
Ohdaeyang's golfball incident

169
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,430
is becoming a bribery scandal
in the legal world.

170
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,910
Especially...

171
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,520
with a shocking verdict for an heir
who was arrested in the court

172
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,750
and became the star judge...

173

[ Korea's biggest law firm Ohdaeyang's
golf ball incident, a bribery scandal ]

174
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,290
It's been revealed that

175
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,200
the star judge, Judge Han Soo Ho
had accepted the bribe as well.

176
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,550
It's expected to send a shockwave.

177
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,610
I'll connect the reporter on site.

178
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,590
Let's do it. Standby.

179
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,150
The biggest law firm in Korea,
Ohdaeyang's golfball incident

180
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,100
is becoming a bribery scandal
in the legal world.

181
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,270
During the Prosecutors' Office investigation,
the CEO of Ohdaeyang

182
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,860
partially admitted to giving bribes through
entertaining while playing golf.

183
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,640
I have the name of the judge who is suspected
of receiving the bribe in my news script.

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,370
However, the investigation
has not been conclusive.

185
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:19,920
The Prosecutors' Office that conducted the
investigation has not given an official briefing yet.

186
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,360
So, the news we're going to tell you

187
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,100
is merely prosecution information
leak or a suspicion.

188
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,130
The responsibility for reporting
suspicion lies with the press.

189
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:33,850
However, reporting merely on suspicion
is an irresponsible act by the press.

190
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,260
After receiving the news script, between the
idea of being responsible and irresponsible

191
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,950
I weighed the difference
numerous times.

192
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,340
And I came to a conclusion.

193
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,410
The prosecution information was
leaked by someone intentionally.

194
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,790
And the press broadcasts on the cue.

195
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,940
And the person is judged by the society.

196
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,200
But no one takes responsibility for that.

197
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,150
Our news wishes to stop that cycle.

198
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,530
The fact that we won't turn the
viewers into the slaves of the news.

199
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,250
I won't forget that is the basic
principle of the press.

200
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,800
There are mere suspicions over the
Ohdaeyang Law Firm's corruption.

201
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,790
The minute that suspicions
turn into facts,

202
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,880
or the minute someone tries
to cover up that suspicion...

203
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,060
We'll be sure to convey the news.

204
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,790
Next news.

205
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,310
Aigoo, I'll have to join that
anchor unni's fan club.

206
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,290
Doesn't she get fired if she
says that as an anchor?

207
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,260
Why would she get fired?

208
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,340
She needs to be awarded.

209
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,260
She just said she won't report
the news on the news.

210
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,070
She's saying she won't do
the news unless it's true.

211
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,940
Have you seen news like that before?

212
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,850
Huh? Have you?

213
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,890
You think you're that good?

214
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,560
If you do that, what about
the follow-up news!

215
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,490
You made the rest of the
news items into nothing.

216

Who the hell are you? Do you
get paid by another TV station?

217
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,390
Hey.

218
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,260
Do I have to hear this crap
from other TV stations?

219
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,740
You're the only one who's best and
the rest of the press is bulls***?

220
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,160
Who the hell do you think you are?
You're low rung on the ladder.

221
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,630

even our TV station!

222
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,490

223
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,890
Submit your resignation and get lost.

224

when the suspicions have been confirmed.

227
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,950

If you s***ted all over,
you should clean it up!

235
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,630
It's the money I borrowed.

236
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,810
I'm a bit short, but I'll give you the rest
along with the interest soon.

237
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,680
Are you distancing yourself
from me, Judge?

238
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,640
I promised to give it back.
That's why I'm doing this.

239
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,970
I never made that promise.

240
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:44,760
I did.

- With my girlfriend.
- She's a good person.

242

While I...

243
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,400
was being investigated
by the Prosecutors' Office,

244
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,900
I never brought up anyone's name.

245

never been on the field together.

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,160
Pardon?

253
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,150
No matter how desperate you are,

254
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,540
For you to threaten that you'll divulge the
corruption in front of the Supreme Justice...

255
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,700
That was uncalled for, Judge.

256
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,260
I...

257
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,570
threatened them at the
committee hearing?

Should I write up a ruling for this, too?

00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,710
What will you say?

266

I'm not sure.

267
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,860
You already decided, but

268
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,970
your legal interpretation is different from
the norm, so you're being cautious.

No, it's not.

When you say you're not sure,
it was always like that.

272

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,920
Han Soo Ho will be
disciplined for sure.

324
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,520
It will be good for you to be
transferred out of there.

325
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,000
I have a colleague in
the administrative office.

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,740
I'll ask him and change you out.

327
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,600
No, I don't want to.
Don't do such a thing.

328
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,730
Such a thing?

329
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,640
I won't transfer.

330
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,270
Even if he's disciplined or I'm
disadvantaged, I don't care.

331
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,060
What's with you?

332
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,480
What?

333
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,790
You have no reason to act this way.

334
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,390
I do.

335
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,960
What is it?

336
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,160
What's your reason?

337
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,380
Do you...

338
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,440
like Judge Han?

339
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,220
I'm a trainee.

340
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,000
A trainee can't fall for the mentor judge.

341
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,720
Even if I do,

342
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,740
I can never show it.

343
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,050
So, for the time being,

344
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,160
I won't think about anything else.

345
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,350
After I graduate from the judicial institute
and I'm no longer a trainee,

346
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,430
at that time...

347
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,000
I think I can show that I like him.

348
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,550
If I muster up the courage,

349
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,030
I can even tell him that I like him first.

350
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,640
Our judge...

351
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,100
He's a good man.

352
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,520
Sit down. Don't go!

353
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,540
I think I'll be disappointed
more if I stay longer.

354
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,540
Song So Eun!

355
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,070
Hey, Han Kang Ho!

356
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,290
Stop yourself, a**hole!

357
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,860
How much longer do you have to
pretend to be crazy to feel satisfied?

358
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,590
You'll die for real.

359
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,990
Look.

360
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,760
Where have you been?

361
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,640
Stop your crazy shenanigans!

362
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,710
Did you hide away afraid that
someone would take you away?

363
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:20,940
You punk...

364
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,740
Get lost quietly.

365
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,280
You think you're a real judge?

366
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,770
How about you?

367
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,830
How about you who killed
an innocent person

368
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,480
to cover up the
drug incident by the rich?

369
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,610
Neither one of us are
qualified to be a judge.

370
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,780
What do you know to say that?

371
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,820
How did I become like this?

372
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,160
To pay for your settlement
and lawyer fee...

373
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,730
How about my life that you ruined!

374
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,840
I went to jail because of you.

375
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,850
Ever since then, my life was gone.

376
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,340
I did lead a bad life.

377
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,620
But I never lived cowardly like you.

378
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,890
Stop rambling on. You're out of line.

379
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,660
Know who you are.

380
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,560
Just because you have it
doesn't mean it's yours.

381
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,730
Who do you think you are then?

382
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,110
I'm human.

383
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,930
And you're a worm.

384
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,590
Don't you know?

385
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,240
Before I take legal measures,
give me my ID and get lost.

386
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,170
Why are you fighting
in front of our house?

387
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,560
What are you doing to your brother!

388
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,120
S***!

389
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,040
How dare you cuss in
front of your mother?

390
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,560
If you're going to do that, don't even
think about seeing me ever again!

391
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,010
I won't. I'll never see you ever again!

392
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,020
He's your only son.

393
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,080
Take care of him and have a nice life.

394
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,500
This jerk goes around saying
he's the only son.

395
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,100
Be quiet! Be quiet!

396
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,220
You a**hole. Come back after you
become qualified to be a judge.

397
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,210
I can't give it to you before then!

398
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,480
Did you tell people...

399
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,110
that you're the only son?

400
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,480
Forget it.

401
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,880
Is it true?

402
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
Stay for a few days.

403
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,910
I'll be back in a few days.

404
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:31,370
If you really did, you're not a hyung.

405
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,730
Do you know how much
Kang Ho cried over that?

406
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,390
Don't skip meals.

407
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,900
Is it true? Is what Kang Ho saying true?

408
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,560
It's not, right?

409
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,900
Goodnight.

410
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,420
[ Judge Han Soo Ho:
Want to ride on a swing? ]

411
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,690
Want to ride on a swing?

412
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,350
Is it fun?

413
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,080
Did you drink?

414
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,640
No.

415
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,980
Is there something you want to say?

416
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,640
No.

417
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,800
Do you have something for me to do?

418
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,730
Geez.

419
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,730
Why did you come then?

420
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,940
I didn't come.

421
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,960
When I arrived, I realized I was here.

422
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,210
I was going around here and there

423
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,620
and when I realized I'm about there

424
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,940
and found myself here.

425
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,770
The gravity must be strong here.

426
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:51,800
You must be my gravity, So Eun.

427
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,870
I shouldn't fall for you.

428
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,420
But I keep falling for you.

429
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:06,270
I can't hide my feelings anymore.

430
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,210
As for me...

431
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,260
I'm only a trainee...

432
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,260
and you're a judge.

433
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,370
You're a good person, So Eun.

434
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,100
And I'm a bad person.

435
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:31,760
Not a judge and trainee.

♫ In this darkness,
I'm looking for a path. ♫
