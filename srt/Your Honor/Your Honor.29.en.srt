1
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,000
The call is not going through.
You'll be connected to the voicemail.

2
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,530
What are you doing here, So Eun?

3
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,180
What's wrong?

4
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,300
Are you okay?

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,020
Is something wrong?

6
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,740
What is it?

7
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,430
You don't want to talk about it?

8
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,240
Is it too hard to talk about it?

9
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,130
Do you want to go inside?

10
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,450
What do I do?

11
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,170
What?

12
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,440
I know everything.

13
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,560
I know everything now...

14
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,710
What do I do?

15
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,970
Why you kept calling yourself
a bad person...

16
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,240
Why you kept your distance while
showing interest in me.

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,470
Why you quit being a judge and ran away.

18
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,570
Why did you lie?

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,490
I was going to tell you everything today.

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,630
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,550
Today when?

22
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,740
While we're strolling and holding hands?

23
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,160
Or when we're kissing?

24
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,820
I don't know.

25
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,130
I thought...

26
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,550
I'd have to tell you everything today.

27
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,780
Tell me, then. Why'd you do it?

28
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,160
Why did you lie and do
that to my sister?

29
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,240
Judge Han Soo Ho,

30
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,340
one word from your mouth...

31
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,220
resulted in a not guilty verdict in
my sister's sexual assault case.

32
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,530
The thing that freed that bastard
wasn't the law. It was your mouth.

33
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,760
- That... that's...
- You know what's even worse?

34
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,970
I know you're not like that.

35
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,750
Does this mean...

36
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,180
my sister really did something wrong?

37
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,050
I started doubting her,
even if it was for a moment.

38
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,240
I abandoned my sister.

39
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,970
Han Soo Ho...

40
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,580
you're a really bad person.

55
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:49,940
An arrest warrant has been issued for the representative
of Ohdaeyang, the largest law firm in Korea.

56
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,650
According to the prosecutor's office, because
of the serious nature of the matter,

57
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,590
they fear evidence tampering.

58
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,970
All right.

59
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,500
You worked hard.

60
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,370
Be healthy wherever you go.

61
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,240
It has been revealed that Managing Director Lee Ho Sung,
who is under suspicion of throwing a drug party,

62
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,710
has been addicted to drugs
for more than 10 years.

63
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,800
The evidence and witness testimonies have proved the crimes
of the suspects who were charged along with Director Lee.

64
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,910
The prosecutor's office forecasts that there
won't be much difficulty in sentencing them.

65
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,910
[ Commanding investigations on Oh Sung Group's corruption
scandal, Prosecutor Hong Jung Soo targets the upper class ]

66
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,950
I have to ask a question.

67
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,650
Should we go out for a drink?

68
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,090
We meet again.

69
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,410
Yes.

70
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,200
That's right. We're meant to work
together the rest of our lives.

71
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,450
Here.

72
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,780
Drink.

73
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,080
We're just enjoying a dinner
out with everyone.

74
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,230
Pour.

75
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,870
You'll be graduating from the
institute in a few days.

76
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,550
Have you decided on your path?

77
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,830
Yes.

78
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,960
I requested to be a trial researcher.

79
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,830
You think you'll make it?

80
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,910
Since it's a shortcut to becoming a judge,

81
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,890
it's highly competitive.

82
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,390
Yes, I'm not sure.

83
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,110
It's a tough position.

84
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,350
They don't select you based
on grades only.

85
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,820
- I already know.
- Then why do you keep knocking on the courthouse door?

86
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,470
Do you have a romantic
notion of being a judge?

87
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,290
No, I don't.

88
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,380
Do you keep in touch with
Judge Han Soo Ho?

89
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,230
I don't.

90
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,190
Did you have a fight?

91
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,600
Excuse me?

92
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,040
Weren't you guys in a relationship?

93
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,980
Prosecutor!

94
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,880
Driving me crazy.

95
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,610
Look at you getting mad again.

96
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,380
It's weirder when you react that way.

97
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,690
It's a small world in this field. Behave.

98
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,260
Your reputation is just as
important as your ability.

99
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,470
Tell me if you need a
recommendation letter.

100
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,730
I'll make sure you get the position
you want wherever it may be.

101
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,050
Got that?

102
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,570
Prosecutor Hong Jung Soo,

103
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,330
starting today...

104
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,900
I'll officially submit a complaint

105
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,840
for your repeatedly unscrupulous

106
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,400
and persistent behavior.

107
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,170
Please behave yourself.

108
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,130
Hey! Angry!

109
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,390
I'm returning the favor I got
from your brother.

110
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,560
All right, I'll let him know.

111
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,010
Relay this one, too.

112
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,580
I don't think he beat you this much.

113
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,960
The interest rate is high in
our world. You know that.

114
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,570
Bring it on if you think it's unfair.

115
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,390
Why don't you attack?

116
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,400
What is it?

117
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,690
These are people who purchased foreigner IDs.

118
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,100
You looking for someone?

119
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,840
I have to find her asap. But more than half the
people on the list have incorrect addresses.

120
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,380
Go find them, one by one, and check.

121
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,530
I just sent it to you.

122
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,900
Okay. This is my specialty.

123
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,360
Thanks.

124
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,520
I'm the one who should thank you.

125
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,740
5 million won advance pay.
10 million won when the job is done.

126
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,210
Would that be enough?

127
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,840
Something's up, huh?

128
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,680
A big one, huh? There's more, right?

129
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,140
Whatever you're up to, let's work together.

130
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,100
I know many pros depending
on what kind you want.

131
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,590
Just wrap this up for me. Thanks!

132
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,940
Hey, hey!

133
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,150
The advance.

134
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,910
Oh, that?

135
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,210
A heart worth 5 million won!

136
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,040
Is it not enough?

137
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,710
You want to die?

138
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,510
You stealing black market vehicles
and selling them overseas...

139
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:04,830
If you behave, my brother says
he won't turn it over

140
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,780
to the prosecutor's office.

141
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,690
You blackmailing me?

142
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,580
I don't do that anymore.

143
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,170
I'm trying to appease you.

144
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,850
Are you playing with me?

145
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,450
Just find that woman.
At the very least...

146
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,920
it'll equal a year and a half in jail.

147
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,280
You're making a mistake, using
your judge brother's power.

148
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,360
This is what you call a mistake.

149
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,390
Hitting someone over
a momentary mishap...

150
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,010
Let's touch base once a day about
where you found whom.

151
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,030
Okay?

152
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,080
If I can't reach you, the
Prosecutors' Office may call you.

153
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,950
Why didn't my brother become a judge?

154
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,660
Look at you...

155
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,450
Just because you've become a star after being
on TV few times. Come to your senses!

156
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,190
A prosecutor receiving a complaint
from an institute trainee.

157
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,840
Don't you know how sensitive
that issue is right now?

158
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,220
So, to avoid slipping unintentionally,

159
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,730
I'm being extremely cautious.

160
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,450
A complaint is the result of
your extreme caution?

161
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,860
Do you remember Trainee Song?

162
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,750
She was whining about calling a disciplinary committee
hearing for sexual harassment by an authority figure.

163
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,190
When I asked her for a recording,

164
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,380
she changed her story.

165
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,220
- What's this? That trash again?
- Yes.

166
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,910
Geez, that crazy...

167
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,130
You sure you didn't do anything?

168
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,160
Prosecutor Seon, speak.

169
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,910
I completed the investigation of the accuser.

170
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,010
There's no evidence and I haven't
heard from the supposed witness.

171
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,050
Why is she doing that without any evidence?

172
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,860
You know those kids who suffer
from a victim mentality?

173
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,170
I'll take care of this.

174
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,720
Take care of it how?

175
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,620
I perceived a false accusation
while investigating the accuser.

176
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,680
We'll subpoena Song So Eun and press charges.

177
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,050
Go as far as a subpoena?

178
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,590
I believe we should teach her a lesson.

179
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,880
Doing something like that to
a current prosecutor...

180
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,570
I think we should ensure she will
never work in the legal system.

181
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,610
Do a good job without creating
too much of a buzz.

182
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,770
I'm afraid of all women these days.

185
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,630
So Eun.

186
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,830
There's something I couldn't tell you that day.

187
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,810
Song So Eun! Are you inside, Song So Eun?

188
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,270
Who is it?

189
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,310
We're from the Seoul Central District Court.

190
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,020
Please open the door.

191
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,420
You checked, right?
Please open the door.

192
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,080
Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office,
Detective Lee Sang Yeol.

193
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,900
You're Song So Eun, right?

194
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,750
Yes, what is this regarding?

195
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,990
You filed a sexual harassment complaint
against Prosecutor Hong Jung Soo, right?

196
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,050
Yes.

197
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,050
We perceived a false accusation while
conducting the plaintiff investigation.

198
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,870
Please come with us to the
Prosecutors' Office for the investigation.

199
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,280
Give me a minute.

200
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,870
- What are you saying?
- It's just as I explained.

201
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,040
We're taking you into custody for being under
suspicion of making a false accusation.

202
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,420
Just a moment.

203
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,640
I'll go myself.

204
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,930
Let's just go. Don't create a scene.

205
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,710
Why did you do it?

206
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,800
What?

207
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,170
Were you trying to get settlement
money from Prosecutor Hong?

208
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,330
It's exactly as it says on the complaint.

209
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,320
I'm saying what it says on
the complaint isn't true!

210
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,850
What did you do to fact check?

211
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,580
An investigation.

212
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,460
I'm still doing it.

213
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,680
Please come in.

214
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,360
Prosecutor.

215
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,900
It's not right to investigate both the sexual
harassment victim and the suspect at the same time.

216
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,950
The sexual harassment charge was dismissed
as a result of the investigation.

217
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:29,010
Right now, Prosecutor Hong Jung Soo is
a victim of false accusation.

218
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,660
And you're the suspect.

219
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,410
Don't misunderstand and sit down.

220
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,950
I'll begin the interrogation.

221
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,790
Sit down.

222
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,700
Should I write in my report that you refused
to cooperate with the interrogation?

223
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,050
I apologize for having you here at this late hour.

224
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:56,910
I'll cooperate with the
investigation wholeheartedly.

225
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,350
C'mon, answer!

226
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,950
Do you know what time it is?

227
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,230
Why didn't you pick up?

228
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,840
I need to request a favor.

229
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,850
Don't.

230
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,250
Someone I know...

231
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,130
- got called in for accusing sexual harassment.
- I'm not a judge anymore.

232
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,730
- Not a lawyer either.
- You must still have connections!

233
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,140
She's innocent!

234
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,800
She'll be released if she's innocent. And I...

235
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,870
- don't have any connections. Bye.
- Don't hang up. Wait.

236
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,660
- Don't call me.
- Hey, Han Soo Ho!

237
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,360
Hey, a**hole, I'll call you hyung from now on.

238
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,880
The phone is turned off. After the beep...

239
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,190
While you were a prosecution trainee,
you accused the victim of sexual assault

240
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,710
and requested disciplinary action
with the deputy prosecutor, correct?

241
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,980
Yes, I did.

242
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,900
Why did you suddenly withdraw your request
for disciplinary action and apologize?

243
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,730
That day, Prosecutor Hong Jung Soo...

244
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,110
took me to a bar after work.

245
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,530
He forced me to drink and

246
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,070
said my chance of becoming a prosecutor
depended on how he evaluated me.

247
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,580
He pressured me and sexually harassed me.

248
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,170
Thank you.

249
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,670
Just with words?

250
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,710
Do you want to sleep with me?

251
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,620
To have evidence of that situation,

252
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,810
I decided to record him.

253
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,390
I'm recording right now.

254
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,930
Will you please repeat yourself?

255
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,010
I think you're drunk.

256
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,220
Go home and sleep it off.

257
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,780
These days...

258
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,330
we can't just ask you to drink and stuff.

259
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,520
However, he tried to lead the
situation to his advantage

260
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,380
and tried to use that
recording as his evidence.

261
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,480
That's why I requested a
disciplinary committee hearing.

262
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,640
You mean only the part that made
you culpable was recorded?

263
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,810
You're a repeat offender.

264
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,550
This is already your second time.

265
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,740
Without any proof nor any witnesses,
why do you keep bothering Prosecutor Hong?

266
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,180
That's what I want to ask him.

267
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,270
Why is he continuing to do that to me?

268
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,460
Now that we're talking about the past,
I think it's becoming clear to me.

269
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,330
When she was a trainee,
her performance was subpar,

270
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,620
so she only did grunt work.

271
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,970
She also received the
lowest scores possible.

272
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,260
She is resentful of that.

273
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,270
Is that so?

274
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,920
That is not true.

275
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,200
What do you mean it's not true?

276
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,450
When you were a prosecution trainee,
your mentor gave you low scores.

277
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,460
You filed a complaint against him for
sexual harassment as revenge.

278
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,220
That's it.

279
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,730
Do you admit that?

280
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,180
I cannot admit it.

281
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,920
Then we will fight in court.

282
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,450
Do you have anything else to say?

283
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,130
I don't think she will be accepted
into the trial research institute,

284
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,740
but even if she is,

285
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,810
if she is indicted, she will be kicked out.

286
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,540
I pity her future, so I will only say five words.

287
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,120
I will think about whether
I want to let her off easy.

288
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,100
What are the five words?

289
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,120
Please, save, my, life, sir.

290
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,550
Are you saying if she apologizes,
you will let her off easy?

291
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,570
Get on your knees and apologize.

292
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,270
You want to be unemployed after graduating from law school?

293
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,720
You need to pay your bills.

294
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,410
I...

295
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:45,410
only testified the truth.

296
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,550
Also, because of the
"innocent until proven guilty" rule,

297
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,130
an indictment is not sufficient
reason for dismissal.

298
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,510
You don't have to...

299
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,780
pretend like you care about my future.

300
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,430
Are you throwing out a challenge right now

301
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,170
to a prosecutor of South Korea?

302
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,400
A challenge would be for a champion.

303
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,020
Is a prosecutor our society's champion?

304
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,090
You are out of your mind.

305
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,220
What makes you so arrogant?

306
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,050
Justice.

307
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:58,420
He touched my thigh. When I attacked him,
you gave me a thumbs up.

308
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,260
So what do you mean you didn't see it?

309
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,970
I didn't say I didn't see it.

310
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,470
Then you saw it.

311
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,240
I told you already.

312
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,060
I don't know.

313
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,130
When you say you don't know,

314
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,540
do you mean you saw it or you didn't?

315
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,290
Like I said.

316
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,170
I don't know.

317
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,730
Meaning, I don't know.

318
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,220
Madame.

319
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,470
As a woman, I understand your situation.

320
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,760
But I still don't know.

321
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,290
I might not know because I didn't see it,

322
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:30,560
or I might have seen it, but not
know if it was harassment.

323
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,710
You saw it, right?

324
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,460
Do you have a boyfriend?

325
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,500
I have a great guy for you.

326
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,250
He's in business. Want to meet him?

327
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,070
My life is on the line, madame.

328
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,800
Can I give you advice as an unni?

329
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,000
Don't put your life on the line for anything.

330
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,450
Then your life will just be
more burdensome.

331
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,370
Section Leader!

332
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,960
Song So Eun...

333
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,630
was interrogated by prosecution recently.

334
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,690
Our Trainee Song?

335
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,510
Please keep it a secret.

336
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,280
Of course, but...

337
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,670
What happened? She would never do
something to warrant that.

338
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,000
Could you get the word on the street?

339
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,170
How she got involved, how it's progressing?

340
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,980
Everything that might be helpful.

341
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,730
That won't be too difficult,
but you called me up here.

342
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,130
Your Honor, your connections in
this field are all gone, right?

343
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:57,210
What are you talking about?
Connections are how I live.

344
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,060
I heard about it.

345
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,250
You've been looking for a
law professor position,

346
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,380
but no interview has led
to something yet.

347
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,550
That bastard Lee Ho Sung still hasn't
come to his senses after being arrested.

348
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,380
He's threatening to cancel every scholarship
his company funds if you get a professorship.

349
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,310
The schools should not fall for that.

350
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,020
They're just desperate for corporate support.

351
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,480
That...

352
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,380
Cheer up.

353
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,380
It's unusual that you didn't become a lawyer

354
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,170
and also unusual you want to be a professor,

355
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,160
but you've always done well
in unusual situations.

356
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,620
Don't worry too much about Trainee Song.

357
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,740
I heard she requested to be a trial researcher.

358
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,660
It's competitive, but once she gets it,
no one can touch her.

359
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,400
Yes.

360
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,240
She has to get it.

361
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,630
She will.

362
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,780
So Your Honor, whatever you do, do it well.

363
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,280
Trainee Song really trusted
and looked up to you.

364
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,560
Go ahead, Your Honor.

365
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,700
Not that.

366
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:11,240
♫ I tried revealing my inner thoughts ♫

367
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:20,680
♫ No one, nothing has
ever changed for me ♫

368
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:29,960
♫ I wished it would pass me, I wished
it would not be me, I wished I wouldn't know ♫

369
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:41,560
♫ I close my eyes and avoid it,
we all live this way ♫

370
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:50,790
♫ We give each other new wounds,
live that way, like now ♫

371
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:58,240
♫ Burying your sadness in the graveyard
of my memories, if it's all right ♫

372
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:07,200
♫ Someday, come back, to me, to you ♫

373
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:16,430
♫ Those shouts that have
been ignored, I see you ♫

374
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,900
♫ It may hurt ♫

375
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:35,720
How are you doing in here?

376
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,450
How is the firm?

377
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,650
There is some movement
among the shareholders.

378
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,810
They'll want my shares turned
over to the company

379
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,530
and for me to step aside.

380
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,960
I don't think the movement will last long.

381
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,860
Why aren't you asking me for it?

382
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,640
- What are you...
- The shares.

383
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:05,220
You are at the center of this right now,

384
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,570
so you should be asking me
to hand them over.

385
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,450
If I asked, would you give them to me?

386
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,880
If I gave them to you,

387
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,480
do you have confidence?

388
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,230
If I'm confident, will you give them to me?

389
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,110
Was it you

390
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,320
who made your father like this?

391
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:27,310
Besides you,

392
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:30,860
I don't know anyone else who would
have had tax evasion records.

393
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,040
If I say no,

394
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,780
would you believe me?

395
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,440
You would not believe me.

396
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,870
Father, you have never

397
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,520
trusted me, not once.

398
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,210
Is that why you did this?

399
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,060
If you pushed me out,

400
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,700
did you think the firm would be yours?

401
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,500
Yes.

402
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,670
Really...

403
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,550
you did this.

404
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,740
Yes.

405
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,910
I raised you as a son.

406
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,740
But you are just garbage.

407
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,980
Have you ever told me

408
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,430
that I did a good job?

409
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,460
Ever given me praise?

410
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,240
Have you ever patted your son's head?

411
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,530
Never, not even once.

412
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,540
What more do I need to do?

413
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,120
That's why...

414
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,350
you should have done well!

415
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,040
Yes.

416
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,550
Yes.

417
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,400
I'm sorry that I was not
good enough for you.

418
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,190
Father.

419
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,690
When will you grow up?
