1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,010
If I bounce now, 100 million.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,720
If I stick it out for a month, 1 billion.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,750
[ Pilgrimage to Santiago ]

4
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,560
Crazy bastard.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,880
Quit being a judge to travel?

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,600
How ungrateful.

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,710
Damn. Santiago.

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,550
A month and a half!

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,500
Wow...

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,920
So he won't be here for a month and a half.

11
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,140
A little earlier...

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,470
Your father and Prosecutor Hong were here earlier.

13
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,520
They weren't in a good mood.

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,790
What if Judge Han doesn't pass his rehiring?

15
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,070
I think Judge Han wants to quit.

16
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,290
- Really?
- He turned in his resignation a few days ago.

17
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,600
You know all that, right?

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,560
Anyway, aren't you going to get married?

19
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,020
Want me to introduce you to a nice girl?

20
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,190
She's from a nice family, majored in piano.

21
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,970
You got my dad to remarry, now
you want to marry me off, too?

22
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,720
Why did Han Soo Hoo turn in his resignation?

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,090
You two went to training institute together.

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,270
Why are you asking me about your friend?

25
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,790
You introduced Soo Ho to people
from Han Young Group, right?

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,000
Everyone knows Judge Han is close to O Sung Group.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,110
Who would do such a thing?

28
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,370
Right?

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,500
Only I would dare to do such a thing.

30
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,680
I set them up for drinks once.

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,600
Because of the Park Hae Na and Ji Chang Soo case?

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,410
Don't ask me such questions if you're not ready to pay.

33
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,720
This is our presiding judge.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,500
I know.

35
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,500
I think he knew everything
before he delayed our sentencing.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,020
Maybe he wants a retrial.

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,470
He's not an ordinary judge.

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,740
Don't you think we should tell the truth?

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,130
It doesn't matter for you how we get out of this,

40
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,650
but it matters to me.

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,100
I'll sing,

42
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,800
act,

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,500
and shoot commercials again.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,410
If we do what they say, they promised me that.

45
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,650
You think they'll keep their promise?
They're scarier than the law.

46
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,460
I know.

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm scared of them. That's why I'm listening to them.

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,870
Don't contact me again.

49
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,930
Excuse me...

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is the judge coming in?

51
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,990
He'll be in.

52
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Oh, I heard him say he was quitting yesterday.

53
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,800
Then maybe he's not.

54
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,420
He always does what he says he's going to do.

55
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,260
- Then he's not coming in?
- Maybe not.

56
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,210
- He's a star judge now.
- Isn't that a good thing?

57
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,500
This is a government organization after all.

58
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,510
Being a star is stressful.

59
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,810
- Also, Trainee Song.
- Yes.

60
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm telling you this out of concern.

61
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,990
- Since I have some experience.
- Yes.

62
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,880
It's better to do what they say.

63
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,260
Everyone says they value passion,

64
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,840
but I've noticed they score opinionated people lower.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,100
Do I have strong opinions?

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,850
I didn't think I did.

67
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,140
Hey! Look at your own documents.

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,120
The judge hates disjointed stacks.

69
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,750
But why is it stressful to be a star judge?

70
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,570
It's Judge Han Soo Ho!

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,080
Your Honor, the whole country is strongly responding.

72
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,510
- How do you feel?
- Why did you violate courtroom guidelines?

73
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,630
Over here, please!

74
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,070
Why didn't you take his economic
contributions into account?

75
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,900
Your Honor! What does law
mean to you in these times?

76
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,440
Whoa.

77
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
Hello.

78
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,260
I'm just here to cash out.

79
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,140
Fighting, everyone!

80
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,780
Here!

81
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,860
Fighting! Fighting!

82
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,390
The star is born, huh? Give me one.

83
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,970
Fighting!

84
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,670
Where's your letter of resignation?

85
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,320
I'll work hard.

86
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,720
What is this?

87
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,300
Why are you suddenly so polite?

88
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,400
From now on, I will sincerely serve my
duty according to law and my conscience.

89
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,680
If you have a conscience, turn in your
resignation. You said yourself you'll quit.

90
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,400
- No!
- I shouldn't say this, but...

91
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,970
Don't you know what consequences
that trial will have?

92
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,600
Aren't you embarrassed in front of your trainee?

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,440
What will the trainee learn from you?

94
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,000
I think she'll learn a lot of different things.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,530
You say that after stepping all over sentencing
guidelines? A trainee wouldn't make that ruling.

96
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,150
Tell me, would you?

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,570
- I would.
- What?

98
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,360
Judge Han made a ruling according
to the law and his conscience.

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,070
I think that responsibility lies not only
in the judge but all of society.

100
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:15,660
If the society accepts the ruling, it was a just ruling.

101
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,310
If not...

102
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,650
The sentencing guidelines are wrong.

103
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,960
- You want public opinion to decide the trials?
- No.

104
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,270
Law needs to reflect the healthy
common sense of our society.

105
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,340
I think this ruling was such a case.

106
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,670
- Who are you?
- Hello, my name is Song So Eun, a judicial trainee.

107
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,040
Looking forward to working with you.

108
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,380
Who is she?

109
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,740
She is judicial trainee Song So Eun.
I'm looking forward to mentoring her.

110
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,720
Right. Such peas in a pod.

111
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,090
Everyone, go outside.

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm a judge, you're a judge.

113
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,620
Just like you can't intervene in my trials,
I have no influence on yours.

114
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,310
- So, don't misunderstand my intentions.
- Yes.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,620
Do you know who's the happiest
about your ruling yesterday?

116
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,720
- The people?
- The Congress.

117
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,090
The sentencing guidelines law made to
stop the dominance of the judicial branch.

118
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,760
They're bringing it up again.

119
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,690
We need to rule based on the law and our
conscience, not some rules made up by the government.

120
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,840
Of course. I mean, politicians always say stuff.

121
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,660
This could be an ego battle between the
legislative and judicial branches.

122
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,760
But your rehiring review as a judge
is less than a month away.

123
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,460
You could be dropped for the
survival of the judicial branch.

124
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,990
Plus, there have been tips about you
in administrative about bribes.

125
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,420
Bribes?

126
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,590
I thought he was good at being a judge...

127
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,910
If you don't get rehired, you won't
get a good lawyer job either.

128
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,250
It might be better to resign now.

129
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,440
I'll decide after a month.

130
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,950
Sure.

131
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,520
And yesterday's ruling,

132
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,630
this is my personal opinion, but

133
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,350
it was great.

134
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,360
It made me ashamed as a sunbae
that I couldn't have done that myself.

135
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,170
I wanted to compliment you. I mean it.

136
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,290
I also mean it when I say resign.

137
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,470
I know you're worried about your mom.

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,380
Judge Han resigned after he came
in contact with Han Young Group?

139
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,230
The order is not important.

140
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,790
- Then what is?
- After Judge Han resigned, he wanted to come to O Sung.

141
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,490
But when they refused, he met with Han Young.

142
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,930
Han Young used Judge Han to gain an advantage

143
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,950
in the 11 trillion won venture
to build on government land.

144
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,550
Judge Han gave an unfair guilty
sentence to Lee Ho Sung.

145
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,950
Is this true?

146
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,140
Whether it's true or not is not important.

147
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Sit.

148
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,330
- What is important to you?
- Image.

149
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,490
Change Lee Ho Sung from the defendant
to the victim of an unfair sentence.

150
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,230
The important thing is not this trial,
but the venture on government land.

151
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,610
You want my validation on this?

152
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,730
No.

153
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,810
I'll validate myself.

154
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,180
Anyone can make such a plan.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,710
The problem is whether one has
the power to move the media.

156
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,670
I'll meet with reporters.

157
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,790
You deal with imprisonment.

158
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,890
I have meetings set up with reporters.

159
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,420
- You're going to meet with them?
- I told you.

160
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,570
I'll validate myself.

161
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,510
You're all fired up.

162
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:49,360
This is why you won't make it.

163
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,110
A poisonous snake does not flare its fangs.

164
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,540
The prey would run away before
getting bitten. It's no use.

165
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,130
Just lift up Judge Han.

166
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,900
The higher you go, the more it hurts when you fall.

167
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
So Eun!

168
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,020
Yes!

169
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,550
Do you know what job requires
the most reading in Korea?

170
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,370
- Being a judge?
- What about the most writing?

171
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,650
- Being a judge!
- Very good!

172
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,820
A sunbae at the training institute told me.

173
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,460
Lawyers have money, prosecutors have power,

174
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,220
judges have stress.

175
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,870
- Let's share some workload.
- Sure.

176
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,290
- If you give me homework, I'll do it.
- First...

177
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,870
- Can you write the rulings for the delayed sentences?
- Yes.

178
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,580
Thank you so much.

179
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,810
I'll do my best.

180
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,600
Okay.

181
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,520
Thank you so much.

182
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,290
Can you look over the records, too?

183
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,800
Sure. I'll do my best.

184
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,480
Section Leader!

185
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,000
Yes?

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,700
- Can you call Park Hae Na?
- The defendant?

187
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,470
Is it not possible? I'm the judge.

188
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,760
I mean, it's possible... it is.

189
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,130
You've never done that before.

190
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,110
Pick a date. As soon as possible.

191
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,860
What should I put down as the reason?

192
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,400
Defense strategy.

193
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,420
Reopening the... defense?

194
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,310
This is the ruling for Ji Chang Soo and Park Hae Na.

195
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,950
Are you doing a retrial?

196
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,690
Can you...

197
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,590
look over these records?

198
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,510
I'm a judge!

199
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,040
I know. Your name, face, phone number, address.

200
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,000
I know what you like to snack on
in the office, how you take your coffee.

201
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,580
I don't need money.

202
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,140
You'd kill yourself anyway if
this was leaked to the press.

203
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,070
Wouldn't it feel better to think we're helping you out?

204
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,900
[ Judge Han speaks on the
meaning of law in these times ]

205
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,610
I'll kill you.

206
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,140
Do you want to die?

207
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,680
Don't show off.

208
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,820
I'll kill you.

209
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,300
What are you saying?

210
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,900
I'm eating!

211
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,020
I almost spit it out!

212
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,980
Han Kang Ho, you a**hole...

213
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,430
You know Judge Han Soo Ho, right?

214
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,650
Of course.

215
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,510
He's still #1 online search.

216
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,500
- Should we get him on the show?
- Judge Han? Us?

217
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,700
The main news wants to interview him,
but they can't even get through his phone.

218
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,550
Other channels, too.

219
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,050
- But what if we called him to the studio?
- Nah.

220
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,680
- Would he come?
- What if he did?

221
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,020
If he did,

222
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,840
the main news would steal him.

223
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,010
- They won't let us.
- We won't let them steal him.

224
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,650
- I'll book him.
- Who will?

225
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,900
You?

226
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,980
He's a sunbae's friend, so I've met
him socially a couple of times.

227
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,540
Is that enough of a connection?

228
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,750
Let's just go for it, Sunbaenim.

229
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,900
We need to make our own news.

230
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,360
Aren't you tired of reading scripts
that reporters throw at us?

231
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,570
No, I'm not.

232
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,090
It's easy. I like it.

233
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,290
I respect that.

234
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,560
Very much.

235
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,730
I've looked over all these records
and organized the main points.

236
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,980
and organized the main points.

237
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,060
I don't know if I did a good job.

238
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,890
- Good work.
- It's nothing.

239
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,700
Thank you for letting me get real experience.

240
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,380
Darn it, I have more paperwork.

241
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,060
So Eun, aren't you going home?

242
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,530
I'm going to do a little more work.

243
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,050
You didn't even have dinner.

244
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,490
- I had a hand roll.
- No...

245
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,400
- Let's go get some food.
- It's okay.

246
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,480
I have too much work.

247
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,410
You should go home.

248
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,230
With your pay, you shouldn't work that hard.

249
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,830
I've never done so much work at once in my life.

250
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,120
I've never delegated this much work either.

251
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,600
I've heard judges have a huge workload.

252
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,610
How do you get so much done every day?

253
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,090
That's the problem.

254
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,190
Judges shouldn't have so much to do.

255
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,840
I mean, does it make sense to
process three cases in a day?

256
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,230
The defendant's whole life depends on it.

257
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,280
But does the judge bet their life going into a trial?

258
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,820
How about you?

259
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,750
Me?

260
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:04,840
As for me...

261
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,910
I did bet...

262
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,180
my life on this trial.

263
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,330
I think it's very tough.

264
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,920
To make a final decision that no one can challenge.

265
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,660
I can't even decide on what to eat most of the time.

266
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,490
What do you want to eat?

267
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,100
Well, anything that's good.

268
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,200
The close spots are the hot spots.

269
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,920
- Let's go.
- Yes!

270
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,730
What do you think about the Park Hae Na case?

271
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,910
She did drugs, she admitted to it.

272
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,330
Like the ruling you wrote,

273
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,890
a year in prison and two years
of probation sounds right.

274
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,600
What if there's a related organization behind it?

275
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,730
I don't think there are such circumstances,

276
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,430
I was a little surprised you were thinking of a retrial.

277
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,770
In this world, there are lots of things
that don't go documented.

278
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,180
More than that,

279
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,980
I had a hard time writing the ruling for
the drunk driving case next week.

280
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a drunk driving death case,

281
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,210
they didn't settle, they deposited a lot
of money and got out on bail.

282
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,730
We're a society lenient on drinking.

283
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,370
The victim has no intentions of settling.

284
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,400
Tell them to get more money out of it.

285
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,370
Don't move!

286
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll kill myself right here!

287
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,150
Put the knife down.

288
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,990
- Team Leader.
- We need to talk.

289
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,300
- Put the knife down first!
- Stop lying.

290
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,500
If I didn't go this far, you wouldn't listen to me.

291
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,190
I called hundreds of times

292
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,780
and knocked on your doors, but you wouldn't answer.

293
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,250
You guys are ruining my business.

294
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,170
Get out.

295
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,160
Whether you kill yourself or get killed, do it outside.

296
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,970
Get out!

297
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,150
Do you know what it took to open this place? Get out!

298
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,640
- Hey!
- Move!

299
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,370
Is this the justice you talk about?

300
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,080
Tell me.

301
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,160
Is this the justice you talk about?

302
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,970
You ruined my life, you're killing me.

303
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,860
Is that what you wanted?

304
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,450
What did I do wrong?

305
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,700
What did I do wrong?

306
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,020
His father is Lee Ho Sung's victim.

307
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,450
I met him at the factory.

308
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,010
We punished the perpetrator, you
should be thanking us with a gift.

309
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,110
You bring a knife to kill yourself in front of us?

310
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,590
You killed us.

311
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,000
What do you mean? Did something happen?

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,150
You were right.

313
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,510
My dad got a beating.

314
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,450
But... it was my dad's idea.

315
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,610
We weren't going to win anyway,

316
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,830
and the rest of us need to survive.

317
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,060
But we won.

318
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,930
He got the punishment that fits the crime.

319
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,750
You guys won.

320
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,840
Not me.

321
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,950
You guys are stars now,

322
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,990
but do you know what happened to us?

323
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,050
My father was going to get cornea
transplant surgery yesterday.

324
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,300
But he couldn't.

325
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,060
The hospital refused,

326
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,130
all of a sudden.

327
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,630
Let go!

328
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,100
At the factory?

329
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,950
Our deal with O Sung is off

330
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,430
and I got fired.

331
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,250
All that...

332
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,900
happened in one day.

333
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,570
Your trial...

334
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,020
ruined my family's way out.

335
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,750
How... How can that...

336
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,020
I told you...

337
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,380
to leave it alone.

338
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,650
Leave us to survive.

339
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,240
We were fine,

340
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,530
so why did you butt in and do this to us?

341
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,720
I lost my pension, too.

342
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,380
At this rate...

343
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,600
my family is going to starve to death.

344
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,090
Please help me, Your Honor.

345
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,050
Please help me, Your Honor...

346
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,650
Don't cry.

347
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,260
I told you to leave it alone.

348
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:45,090
I told you we weren't going to win.

349
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,470
I told you to leave it alone.

350
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,060
No, there has to be a way.

351
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,460
There is no way.

352
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,670
Your Honor!

353
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,880
You came to see me because there is no way.

354
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,770
You have no money to sue,

355
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,150
and it takes two years.

356
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,510
You have no way to survive until then,

357
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:06,790
and you don't dare to kill Lee Ho Sung.

358
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,750
You don't have the guts to kill a judge,

359
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,550
and you go, whatever!

360
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,210
You just blame it on the judge bastards, right?

361
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,220
Stop it.

362
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,620
You living this way...

363
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,930
Is it my fault?

364
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,550
What are you saying to someone who's ready to die?

365
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,600
He didn't come here to die. He came to ask for help.

366
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,800
If he wept with a knife in hand,
the judge would help him. No?

367
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,300
If he came here for help, we should find a way to help.

368
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,050
Why is that our job? He needs to help himself.

369
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,480
There is no way.

370
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,240
No.

372
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,970
So Eun, no need to apologize.

373
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:51,220
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

374
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,400
I just want to live.

375
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,500
But I really don't know how.

376
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:01,840
- I think it would be easier to die.
- No.

377
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,790
You know how.

378
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,750
Fight Lee Ho Sung.

379
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,230
You're just scared

380
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,500
because no one has won so far.

381
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,010
You assume you can't win.

382
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,010
Listen up, Ahjussi.

383
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,120
The slave makes the master.

384
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,150
The master doesn't make the slave.

385
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,560
Let's go.

386
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,240
Hold on.

387
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,930
Let's go!

388
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,300
What if we leave now

389
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,390
and he does something to himself?

390
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,770
It doesn't matter.

391
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,560
People determined to die don't know

392
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,700
how desperate someone trying to stop that is.

393
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,900
If you want to die,

394
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,710
go home and get your wife and
children's permission first.

395
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,700
Geez.

396
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,900
I just...

397
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,830
want to work to eat and live.

398
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,700
I don't want to hurt anyone.

399
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,070
I wanted to be happy.

400
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,080
From now on,

401
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,770
there won't be any more people
like Lee Ho Sung in our society.

402
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,760
Think of it this way.

403
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,220
Team Leader Shin lit that match.

404
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,020
What good is it if you light the match and then die?

405
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,880
If a better world comes because one person dies,

406
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,780
does it make it okay that he is dead?

407
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:32,140
Is that the justice the judge talks about?

408
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,240
I won't come to see you again.

409
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,130
Now that it's happened to me, I'm even more scared.

410
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,200
Of Lee Ho Sung.

411
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:45,480
Of the judge.

412
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,720
I feel like I'm not even human.

413
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,700
Unni! Unni!

414
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,090
Ah! No! Unni!

415
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,060
So Eun... I'm scared...

416
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,290
- What is the reason?
- Over here, please!

417
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,370
Judge Han Soo Ho!

418
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,370
What does law mean for you in these times?

419
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,500
I don't really know much about law.

420
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,170
But one thing I know is...

421
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,090
the law is...

422
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,370
the standard with which we divide this world.

423
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,500
Let's say this is average.

424
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,560
Right.

425
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,860
If you are scared of the law,

426
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,260
it means you're down here.

427
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,470
If you laugh at the law,

428
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,250
you're...

429
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,700
way up there.

430
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,030
So Eun...

431
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,840
I'm scared.

432
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,780
I'm so scared of living.

433
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,370
So Eun...

434
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,300
I'm even more scared having gone through it.

435
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,340
People like us aren't even considered human.

436
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,870
♫ We all live another weary day  ♫

437
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,680
♫ Is it okay to lean on each other?  ♫

438
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,700
♫ You brought me small comfort, a shadow in my life  ♫

439
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,230
♫ Like a giant  ♫

440
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,690
♫ The world is so much more ♫

441
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,850
♫ So much higher  ♫

442
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:18,750
♫ So much bigger  ♫

443
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,700
♫ All of me...  ♫
