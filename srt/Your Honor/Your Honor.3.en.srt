1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,100
Witness.

2
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,500
What is your relationship to the defendant?

3
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,900
We know each other from a small club
of friends interested in photography

4
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,100
in a law-med combination study group

5
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,000
created by law and medical students.

6
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,000
Were you aware of the defendant
and the victim's relationship?

7
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,600
They were sunbae and hoobae,

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,000
I heard the victim had a crush on him.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,300
How did you know that?

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,100
I've seen a text from that girl

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,290
saying that she likes him.

12
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,740
This matches the recovered
texts, submitted as evidence.

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,100
The day of the photography club meetup

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,200
at an inn called "Basecamp,"

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,900
did you see the two of them go inside together?

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,000
I did.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Could you describe it more in detail?

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,900
I was in the yard,

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,200
and all the windows were
open because it was summer.

20
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,500
So...

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,900
you must have heard the victim yelling

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,400
or resisting.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,500
I did not.

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
He's lying!

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
It's all a lie!

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,300
I screamed and screamed, but no one came.

27
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,300
I said no.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,900
"No." "Stop."

29
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,310
You're sure you didn't hear anything like that?

30
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,900
I'm sure.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,600
You're the devil!

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,600
You bastards. Bastards...

33
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,600
Security, remove her from the courtroom!

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
Let go!

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,500
Let go!

36
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,900
Unni!

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going to kill you!

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,000
[ Your Honor... ]

39
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,200
[ Sa Ma Ryong ]

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,100
[ Dear Judge, I lost my parents at a young age... ]

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,750
Okay...

42
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,350
the sentencing...

43
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,950
will now begin.

44
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,850
Seoul Judicial Branch,

45
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,650
the 40th Criminal Court.

46
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,050
The 764th trial of 2018.

47
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,350
Violation of drug administration laws.

48
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,800
Defendant Park Hae Na.

49
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,650
Park Hae Na?

50
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,150
From the girl group?

51
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,290
You're the idol Park Hae Na!

52
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,950
Yes, that's correct.

53
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,310
Wow!

54
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm a huge fan!

55
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,550
I will announce the sentence.

56
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,150
Shoot, it's all in Chinese characters...

57
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,350
What is this?

58
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,550
Chinese characters...

59
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,850
Hold on.

60
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:24,550
Park Hae Na...

61
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,350
One year...

62
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,750
One year... that's...

63
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,050
So...

64
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,450
One year...

65
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,450
If you combine all the factors of the past year

66
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,650
you must consider the diverse and
problematic aspects of legal interpretation.

67
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,250
Therefore...

68
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,850
I will postpone the sentencing for a week.

69
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,550
Next!

70
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,650
Defendant Ji Chang Soo.

71
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,250
I will postpone the sentencing for a week.

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,250
Why did it get delayed?

73
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,650
The diverse and problematic
aspects of legal interpretation.

74
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,850
What does that mean?

75
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,750
I don't know either.

76
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,950
Park Hae Na and Ji Chang Soo...

77
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,350
Do you know how hard I worked to make them
petty criminals not even worthy of jail?

78
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,750
Go see Judge Han.

79
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,250
See if it's just a delay or a defense strategy.

80
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,150
Or if he wants something more.

81
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,950
Do you think he's pissed off about Lee Ho Sung?

82
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,750
He drank well, ate well, why would he be pissed?

83
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,550
Go find out immediately. Our firm's fate is on the line.

84
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,750
Got it?

85
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,850
Aigoo, my apologies.

86
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,070
Things were better in the beeper days.

87
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,410
This cell phone makes us all its slaves.

88
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,690
Don't say that. It makes you sound old.

89
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,650
Sweethearts.

90
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,150
Have you ever seen a beeper?

91
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,750
Just now...

92
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,250
Park Hae Na and Ji Chang Soo's

93
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,340
sentencings were delayed.

94
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,950
That judge!

95
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,250
Postponed for a week.

96
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,350
All rise.

97
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,450
Please take your seats.

98
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,350
All rise.

99
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,050
Do you remember who I am?

100
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,650
The press secretary is
preparing the briefing right now.

101
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,150
We need to let them know the reason for the delay.

102
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,350
Let them know.

103
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,950
Why aren't you answering your phone?

104
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,250
This is the office of Judge Han Soo Ho.

105
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,350
Yes.

106
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,550
Yes, we'll let him know.

107
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,750
It's Lawyer Oh Sang Cheol.

108
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,550
You're not answering your phone

109
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,750
so he wants to know if you can meet.

110
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,650
No. Just hang up.

111
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,550
Hello, this is Judge Han Soo...

112
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,150
Yes.

113
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,550
Yes, got it.

114
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,190
I will let him know immediately.

115
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,100
Yes.

116
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,950
It's the press secretary.

117
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,500
He wants the sentencing document

118
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,760
and he wants you to answer your phone.

119
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,250
Hold on, hold on!

120
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,710
Hold on, don't move.

121
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,650
Let's go over it together.

122
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,050
Everyone, calm down.

123
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,450
I...

124
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,350
will be right back.

125
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,650
- What about the afternoon trials?
- I'll be right back.

126
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,150
What about Lawyer Oh?

127
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,150
He says he has to see you.

128
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,850
What's your name?

129
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,850
I'm Song So Eun.

130
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,150
Oh. You can meet with him instead.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,250
Me?

132
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,150
It'll be a good experience for
you to talk with a lawyer.

133
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,260
Fighting!

134
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,650
Your Honor, your robe!

135
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,150
You have a trial at 2 p.m.!

136
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,650
Those leeches!

137
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,150
Why don't I see him?

138
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,250
Let's see... where is the back exit... the back exit...

139
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,550
- He sent you to see me instead?
- Yes.

140
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,650
Are you sure you two are friends?

141
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,450
I'm a little older, but we're friends.

142
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,650
We took the bar and went
through the training together.

143
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,650
But not as a hyung?

144
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,650
He's a bit rude like that.

145
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,550
He's totally annoying then.

146
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,150
But he's good at what he does.

147
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,350
Except for one thing.

148
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:22,550
What?

149
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,650
When we were training, a notorious thing happened.

150
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,150
Law is fundamentally difficult.

151
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,850
How can you make it easy?

152
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,850
The movement for simpler sentencing documents

153
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,150
is to get on the citizens' level.

154
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,250
That's why we suggest stop
the use of Chinese characters.

155
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,950
Legal terms are based on Chinese characters.

156
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,750
If you write them out in Korean,
there's room for interpretation.

157
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,250
When you look at the word "one"

158
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,450
it could mean a day, a method,

159
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,650
or a daily interest rate on principal.

160
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,150
There are various meanings.

161
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,050
If a ruling has the potential to
be misunderstood, it's not a ruling.

162
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,750
Wow. So annoying.

163
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,350
He was always number one in the country.

164
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,050
Number one in the country?

165
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,250
Yes.

166
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,650
Did you ever come first in the country?

167
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,850
First in the school?

168
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,050
No, first in the country.

169
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,350
He would be first in the country
at every exam he took.

170
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,850
Does Judge Han have a younger brother?

171
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,450
