1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
Put this on.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,200
Why? Where are we going?

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,860
You asked me before.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
Do you need a judge, or me?

5
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:11,730
Does my answer change anything?

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,220
If you need a judge, I can do some legal consulting.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,720
If you need me,

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,200
I'll speak more comfortably.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,620
Go ahead.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,740
Do some legal consulting for me when I need.

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,730
I said that cheesy line?

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,260
So embarrassing, right?

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:34,030
It's the worst.

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,490
Today...

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,410
I need a judge.

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,790
I have to go to work.

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,180
It's Saturday, Oppa.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,850
[ SBC ]

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,340
Hey.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,530
Hold on a second!

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,450
Hey!

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,410
What are we doing?

23
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,250
You should have told me!

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,370
If I did, you wouldn't have come out.

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,620
I can't be on the news!

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,500
Everyone is trying to get to you.

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,600
Once you're on the news, no one
can touch you. Power of the media.

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,700
We're just recording today, and it'll air on Monday.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,800
- You know what that means, right?
- No!

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,500
It's recorded, so it's okay if you make a mistake.

31
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,800
Relax.

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,280
How is this a relaxing experience?

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,300
Don't look at the camera, just look at me. Be natural.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,790
Recording!

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,030
Three, two, one!

36
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,800
The controversial figure who sentenced

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,300
seven years in prison to Lee Ho Sung of O Sung Group.

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,950
From Seoul Central District Court, Criminal Division.

39
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,820
We have Judge Han Soo Ho here in our studio.

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,460
Thank you for coming.

41
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,110
Have we started?

42
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,190
Without telling me?

43
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,710
Let's go again.

44
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,080
Relax.

45
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,960
This is not relaxing!

46
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,790
One more time. Three! Two! One!

47
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,020
Good job.

48
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,940
Not as well as I thought, but still.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,900
Let's break up. Don't ever come see me again.

50
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,600
Everyone's first time on air is stressful.

51
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,800
Fill this out.

[ Social Security Number, Account Number ]

53
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,560
It's not the main news, so the fee is small.

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,920
Fill it out and let's go eat.

55
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,910
Forget it.

56
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,990
- I don't need it.
- Take it!

57
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,610
It's the station's money.

58
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,640
I don't want it!

59
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,810
You're so whiny all of a sudden.

60
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,670
So cute.

61
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,420
What's your mother like?

62
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,320
My mom?

63
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,250
You said you were sick of her.

64
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,460
You're a good son.

65
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,460
Mom...

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,500
She's good to me.

67
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,890
Since I'm a judge.

68
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,180
You said you didn't like that.

69
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,050
I'm curious why you said you wanted
to live alone without any family.

70
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,700
Just sign.

71
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,660
Sometimes my parents annoy me, too.

72
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,010
But I've never wished that they weren't around.

73

Han Soo Ho-

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,370
So, me.

for having a devoted mom.

He doesn't know how hard it is not
to be accepted at home.

Don't be so guilty.

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,400
You sound like someone else.

It's weird.

81
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,740
Sign.

82
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,570
You can take that.

83
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,170
It's fine. I'll call them back.

- I'm busy. I'll call you back.
 - Your Honor!

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,410
your little brother's cellmate, Jin Wook Tae!

89
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,100
Kang Ho wouldn't answer his phone.

90
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,730
I had no choice but to call you and ask for help.

91
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,590
Please excuse me for calling.

92
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,130
Don't do that!

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
If you don't stay still, I'm going to die right here.

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,110
Do you want that?

95
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,680
What kind of s*** are you up to?

96
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,610
Excuse me, we just met.

97
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,350
You know what, no worries.

98
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,870
You're my friend's brother.

99
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,650
Can I call you Hyung?

100
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,530
Get to the point.

101
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,850
I have some money to get from Kang Ho.

102
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,970
Your mother wrote up her house and land as collateral.

103
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,240
I was going to just put it up for auction

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,000
but it's under your name, too.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,010
So?

106
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,390
I wanted to ask you one last time.

107
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,790
If not possible, I'll just set the
house on fire and die with it.

108
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,640
With no money, why go on?

109
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,700
Hold on.

110
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,270
I'll send over some cops.

111
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,600
I poured gas all over. What will
happen when the cops show up?

112
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,350
Ask Kang Ho.

113
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,990
If I'm capable of setting something on fire or not.

114
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,930
Set it on fire.

115
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,030
Okay.

116
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,490
Your word is the law, Your Honor. I should follow it.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,300
The older son you're so proud of wants us to die.

118
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,130
I'm about to flick the lighter, Hyung.

119
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,040
What do you want?

120
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,490
Come stamp the paperwork.

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,300
Or 100 million won.

122
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,510
Wait.

123
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,200
I can't wait too long.

124
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,800
The gas is highly vaporous, so
after a while, it loses its flammability.

125
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,620
She wants money?

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,840
It's a bit tough that she keeps asking.

127
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,860
You send her an allowance every month.

128
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,590
Not a small amount, either.

129
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,620
Let's go eat.

130
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,420
Next time. I need to go to work.

131
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,020
Go after lunch!

132
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,950
My mom didn't ask for money.

133
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,910
Don't talk about her like that.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,180
Soo Ho.

135
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,220
Wow.

136
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,640
You're really identical.

137
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,510
You look exactly like him!

138
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,470
Come in, Hyung.

139
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,540
Come outside.

140
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,450
I tried...

141
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,910
to stop him from contacting you.

142
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,250
Stay here.

143
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,710
I need to talk to him.

144
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,910
Wow, he's got mad charisma. So cool.

145
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,480
I'm coming with you, Hyung!

146
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,650
Look.

147
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,030
Aigoo.

148
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,670
I'll use it for good.

149
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,600
I said look, not take.

150
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,200
I could get a doctor's note for this.

151
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,790
Should I try?

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,530
I heard from Kang Ho.

153
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,050
You stole used cars to be exported
and sold them as unregistered.

154
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,200
The case statute of limitations has
ways to go, should I give it to a prosecutor?

155
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,400
This is why it's bad to utilize public power in private.

156
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,940
Ring me up already.

157
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,230
Take it out.

158
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,000
50 million won to plan the crime, 50 million to settle.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,930
A total of 100 million, correct?

160
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,230
- I gave you a friendly discount.
- Make it even better.

161
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,600
Take 50 mil.

162
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,800
That's not right, Hyung.

163
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,800
To the Prosecutors' Office.

164
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,300
- Is this how you're going to play?
- You want it another way?

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Get in. I'll introduce you to a tough prosecutor.

166
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,630
Let's just get it over with.

167
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,720
Open.

168
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,700
Take it out.

169

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,570
In your testimony,

336
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,430
you took something that an unknown
woman gave to you in a club restroom,

337
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,520
not knowing it was drugs.

338
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,290
You thought it was a pill for sobering
up, that's what this says.

339
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,000
Is that possible?

340
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,770
The defendant...

341
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,050
is a celebrity well known to the public.

342
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,700
I think it's definitely possible that
an average person could approach her.

343
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,170
"Oh, my gosh! It's a celebrity!
I'm going to give her drugs!"

344
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,370
Really?

345
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,910
If you put it that way, yes.

346
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,050
Is that so?

347
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,870
It's a fact revealed during the investigation.

348
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,410
Rough him up first. I'll treat you after.

349
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:55,760
Now I know what kind of person you are.

350
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,720
Normally, a narcotics investigation

351
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,640
includes friends and family
because often they're involved.

352
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,420
Did you seize the defendant's cell phone?

353
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,940
A random search could be
an invasion of privacy, so no.

354
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,650
Is that so?

355
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,530
I'm issuing a warrant to seize and
search the defendant's cell phone.

356
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,810
Make good records.

357
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,870
We'll pick this up next week, on the 26th.

358
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,740
This trial will continue to be closed to the public.

359
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,580
Call up the next defendant, Ji Chang Soo.

360
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,720
[ Team Leader Shin ]

361
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,860
My father and I both fell for Lee Ho Sung's
act and gave false testimonies.

362
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,540
If we tell the truth, we'll be punished too, right?

363
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,060
That's okay.

364
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,160
At the appeals, we'll tell everything.

365
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,660
We're going to fight until the end.

366
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,050
Also, this...

367
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,160
This is for you.

368
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,680
And this is for the male judge you were with that time.

369
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,530
No, we can't accept these.

370
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,840
I wanted to get a shirt or something

371
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,300
but I heard it's against the
Kim Young Ran Act, so I just got socks.

372
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:29,100
No, we can't take stuff like this.

373
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,970
I'll accept the gesture.

374
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,130
That male judge...

375
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,260
gave me money.

376
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,350
What?

377
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,540
It was definitely his voice.

378
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,170
He said don't worry about living
expenses, fight until the end.

379
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,690
He said don't ever think about suicide.

380
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,540
The judge...

381
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,780
gave you money for legal fees
and living expenses?

382
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,520
He said he was giving us half of what he owned.

383
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,120
It was such a huge amount of
money, I didn't know what to do.

384
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,020
But per his will...

385
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,480
I'll fight until the end although I'm scared.

386
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
And I'll work hard...

387
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,740
and repay him. Please let him know.

388
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,110
- What is this?
- Socks.

389
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,470
They're from Team Leader Shin as thanks.

390
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,710
Oh. The ahjussi with the knife?

391
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:27,350
Aigoo. What a little gift.

392
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,500
He said he wanted to get something bigger

393
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,800
but he couldn't because of the Kim Young Ran Act.

394
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,320
Oh. Kim Young Ran?

395
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:37,240
My mom is a huge fan of Kim Young Ran.

396
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,460
"Tears of the Dragon," "Apgujeong Midnight Sun,"
"You Who Rolled In Unexpectedly"...what else?

397
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
A gift! Yay!

398
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,300
Your Honor?

399
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,790
Do you want to get a beer with me?

400
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,200
No.

401
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,760
Just one drink.

402
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,330
I'm broke. I spent all my money, I'm poor.

403
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,870
Then I'll treat.

404
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,860
What about appetizers?

405
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,900
On me as well.

406
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,890
Do you think all law people are your friends, too?

407
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,970
Sang Cheol.

408
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,250
Yes, Sunbae?

409
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,300
That bastard Han Soo Ho.

410
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,080
He's not qualified to be a judge.

411
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,090
Let's unrobe him.

412
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,690
Help me.

413
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,920
I don't think so.

414
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,610
I'll be doing the unrobing.

415
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,850
You help me.

416
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,740
Deal.

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,960
I don't really know what I want to do yet.

418
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,360
The prosecutor brings in the bad guy,
but can't make the ruling.

419
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,560
The judge can rule, but can't bring the bad guy in.

420
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,550
The lawyer needs to help
everyone, even the bad guys.

421
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,850
Do what makes you money, that's the best.

422
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,900
Why did you become a judge?

423
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,120
One thing led to another.

424
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,360
But I want to make big money.

425
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,300
That's right.

426
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
After you build your resume and go
work for a law firm or a legal team

427
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,080
I heard you can make an
unbelievable amount of money.

428
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,910
Sure, but you're basically their slave.

429
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,610
Wow.

430
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,160
This is nice.

431
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,010
This would be perfect for a date.

432
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,150
Do you have a boyfriend?

433
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,600
I think it's inappropriate for you to ask me that.

434
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,470
This is inappropriate, but do you have a boyfriend?

435
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,360
Your question is inappropriate.

436
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,620
That's why I said it was.

437
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,590
If it's inappropriate, then don't ask.

438
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,050
If I've risked being inappropriate, you need to answer.

439
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,500
How about you?

440
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,380
Who'd date someone like me? I'm so busy.

441
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,020
Same here.

442
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,200
Why?

443
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,070
Every hour you're not in love is a waste of time.

444
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,160
Heard of it?

445
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,880
I haven't. Who said that?

446
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,000
I'll tell you later.

447
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,300
- Hey, let's go over there!
- Okay.

448
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,800
Wow.

449
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,300
You're blowing your paycheck.

450
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,400
When I knock a big case out of the park,
I'll pay you back with a great present.

451
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,870
What present?

452
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,990
I don't know what you like.

453
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,870
So I'll just buy out an entire store.

454
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:36,210
Or, you could just ask me what I like.

455
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,350
What do you like?

456
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,500
I don't like anything. You don't
need to give me a present.

457
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,400
When women say that, I heard
you have to buy her something.

458
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Who said that?

459
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,850
- Guys who get dumped after not getting her anything.
- Then...

460
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,620
I...

461
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,400
would like a case of beer.

462
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,830
You're a down to earth drunk.

463
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,790
Cheers!

464
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,980
Nice.
