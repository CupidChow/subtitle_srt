1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,780
[ Episode 16 ]
Don't come to the trial tomorrow.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,140
Travel overseas.

3
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,120
The judge summoned me in person.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,420
It won't cost you for denying
witness subpoena a few times.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,760
No.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,110
I think I should appear and tell
the truth about everything.

7
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,230
Now...

8
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,150
then the problem will get bigger.

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,400
You will be liable as well.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,820
Even so...

11
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,430
I think I should reveal the truth.

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,370
Can I ask you why you're
doing this all of a sudden?

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,900
Just...

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,600
consider it the pride of an athlete.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,050
Fine. How much?

16
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,480
How much do you want?

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,670
Don't look down on me this way.

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,330
I really don't understand.

19
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,250
Why do you think I'm looking down
on you when I offer money?

20
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,620
Let me talk to him.

21
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,520
I really don't understand.

22
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,730
If we were born in different places,

23
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,590
our lifestyles are different, of course.

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,420
The fish swim and birds fly.

25
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,620
Does it hurt pride when I tell the
fish to live in the water?

26
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,020
But we're human, not animals.

27
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,390
We were born in different places!

28
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,340
How are we the same people?

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,300
Money doesn't solve everything.

30
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,800
Look, Mr. Min.

31
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,350
Listen carefully.

32
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,180
When I say I'll pay you,

33
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,930
I'm telling you to keep your place.

34
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,640
When a boss pays salary to an employee,

35
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,300
it means for the employees to keep their places.

36
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,440
With your mentality, the salarymen

37
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,580
would have to all die from
hurtful pride when they get paid.

38
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,390
But they don't die.

39
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,660
They're all happy on payday.

40
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,970
Appear as a witness...

41
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,590
if you want to.

42
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,190
Instead...

43
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,810
I'll let you know what happens when
a fish comes out of the water.

44
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,910
Attorney, please...

45
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,280
take care of matters like this yourself!

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,190
Don't make me do all the work!

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,400
When you come back, you won't
work for someone else.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,200
I'll help you open up a
business under your name.

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,710
I hear the most expensive thing in the world

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,450
come free.

51
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,200
We'll investigate your father a few more times.

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,230
He'll be charged with a fine anyway.

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,280
But he'll be flawed for sure.

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,510
Yes.

55
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,630
How about Min Goo Nam?

56
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,930
I persuaded him as much as
I can, but didn't get an answer.

57
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,470
You can't even stop a witness from appearing?

58
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,920
If he comes out and rambles on,

59
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,090
it's over for you and me both.

60
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,360
I know.

61
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,830
Do volunteer work for a few
months even if it's a hassle.

62
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,470
Once the press starts to sympathize
with you, you can make your comeback.

63
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,460
Please end the trial soon.

64
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,580
- You want to own a business like Izakaya, right?
- Yes.

65
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,070
Just focus on that no matter
who comes out as a witness.

66
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,360
Is my boss appearing as a witness?

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,060
Just listen to me.

68
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,930
Don't think about anything else.

69
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,880
Will you still insist you took the drugs alone?

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,870
I'm not insisting. It's the truth.

71
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,590
And I thought it was for sobering up.

72
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,510
I didn't realize it was a drug.

73
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,860
I'll ask you as a person, not as a judge.

74
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,210
Park Hae Na.

75
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,810
Are you a good person?

76
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,880
Yes.

77
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,110
I am.

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,530
Your Honor.

79
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,920
Since last week, the defendant

80
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,930
started volunteering at an orphanage.

81
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,690
She acknowledges her
wrongdoing and is remorseful

82
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,820
and is working at becoming a
healthy member of our society.

83
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,860
Please consider this with your generosity

84
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,890
and I ask you to designate a date for sentencing.

85
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,480
Ji Chang Soo.

86
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,590
Your testimony from last
hearing was all true, right?

87
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,240
Yes.

88
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,260
It's true that you attacked Min Goo Nam, right?

89
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,300
Yes, that's right.

90
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,960
I'll call out Min Goo Nam as a witness.

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,260
Yes, I told only the truth.

92
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,900
- Bailiff, call the witness.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,100
The witness is not present.

94
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,800
He's not there?

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Did you look for him everywhere?

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,460
Yes, he's not here.

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,420
You have Min Goo Nam's phone number, right?

98
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,880
I'll contact him.

99
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,660
We're unable to connect this call...

100
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,130
He's out of the country right now.

101
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,690
Since the incident, the defendant

102
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,470
quit working as a waiter

103
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,930
and is making a living as a day laborer.

104
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,560
To attend the trial today,

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,960
he couldn't work today.

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,470
He's suffering from serious financial difficulties.

107
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,570
With your generosity, please
designate his sentencing date.

108
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,600
I'll notify you of the designated date.

109
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,450
What a pathetic judge.

110
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,130
Did you see him sweat not knowing what to say?

111
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,750
He completely trusted Min Goo Nam.

112
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,760
You should've told me he went out of the country.

113
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,230
You made me worry for no reason.

114
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,050
He didn't take the airline ticket to the end.

115
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,440
He must've changed his mind
considering things overnight.

116
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,530
[ Han Soo Ho ]

117
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,960
Judge Han is calling me.

118
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,080
He must be in a hurry.

119
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,360
For a judge to call up a lawyer.

120
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,090
Song So Eun wasn't at the trial today.

121
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,060
She's sick. I guess too much stress.

122
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,330
I told her to take the day off.

123
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,480
I wonder how sick she is.

124
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,240
Sang Cheol.

125
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,490
Let me ask you one thing as a friend.

126
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,480
Did you send off Min Goo Nam out of the country?

127
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,000
There's no way I would've.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,900
Did you sweet talk him or threaten him?

129
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,140
That never happened.

130
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,810
I also wanted him to appear and tell the truth.

131
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,340
What's the truth?

132
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,590
Let me ask you one thing as a friend, too.

133
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,770
Do you even consider me a friend?

134
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,990
The best of friends.

135
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,330
Then, end this at an appropriate timing.

136
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,890
You, me, and Prosecutor Hong
were all on the same boat.

137
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,620
Ever since Park Jae Ho's death sentence.

138
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,800
Isn't that right?

139
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,030
I don't know what you're talking about, but

140
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,750
it sounds like a threat to me.

141
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,270
I don't know what kind of offer
Han Young Group made to you.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,090
But don't make the wrong decision.
You'd be the one to get hurt.

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,240
It will be tough to recover from.

144
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,880
It is a threat.

145
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,840
I guess so if you heard it that way.

146
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,970
Geez.

147
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,420
Why didn't I think of that?

148
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,350
I forgot all about that having
worked like this for a long time.

149
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,510
What are you saying?

150
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,980
A threat works quicker than a request.

151
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,890
I was like that originally.

152
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,390
Bye.

153
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,720
Hey, Han Soo Ho.

154
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,590
Just because you always beat me,

155
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,310
don't think you'll continue to win.

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Got it?

157
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,040
Bye.

158
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,700
Hello?

159
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,960
Park Hae Na?

160
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,180
Who is this?

161
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,840
I'm your fan.

162
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,650
Also a judge.

163
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,360
I wanted to meet you for personal reasons.

164
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,950
You didn't tell anyone about this, right?

165
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,240
Yes.

166
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,980
The judge doesn't meet with a
defendant over personal matters.

167
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,490
For that reason,

168
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,800
let's take out our cell phones.

169
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,870
For an honest conversation,
recording won't be nice.

170
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,770
I won't record.

171
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,310
This is your first drug offense,
and you took it without knowing.

172
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,190
Yes.

173
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,990
That makes you a victim.

174
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,980
You were had.

175
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,820
Thank you for saying that.

176
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,900
Get a year in prison and about
two years of probation.

177
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,610
Give up the appeal and

178
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,280
focus on volunteer works.

179
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,350
You'll probably get some sympathy.

180
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,160
Go on a variety show and cry once.

181
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,840
The fans who ditched you will come back.

182
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,260
I thank you for saying that, Your Honor.

183
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,170
No need to thank me.

184
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,950
That won't happen.

185
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,260
How many years do you think I can give?

186
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,080
Not sure...

187
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,770
If I give you about five years in prison,

188
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,650
you'll be arrested in court

189
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,250
and will have to stay in prison until your appeal.

190
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,130
In the ruling, I'll say, "Consumed
central nervous system stimulant."

191
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,450
"A shocking incident to our society."

192
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,910
"Stunning act by a public figure."

193
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:32,190
If I indicate it like that,

194
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,040
the press will love it.

195
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,350
I used all the words they love.

196
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,160
"Stimulant, shock, stunned."

197
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,590
I...

198
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,480
trust my lawyer...

199
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,050
and the prosecutor...

200
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,830
Usually, a prosecutor sells fear.

201
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,210
And a lawyer sells hope.

202
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,300
In your case, I think you bought
hope from both of them.

203
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,560
Am I wrong?

204
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,720
I'm deeply remorseful.

205
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,000
Your Honor.

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,580
I'm very sorry.

207
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,960
I asked you sincerely today...

208
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,150
if you're a good person.

209
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,250
I'll ask you once more.

210
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,240
Hae Na...

211
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,890
Are you a good person?

212
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,080
That's...

213
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,130
I'm not a good person.

214
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,200
A good person would give up after
making requests if it doesn't work.

215
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,720
A bastard would threaten
if things don't go his way.

216
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,230
What do I need to do?

217
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,760
Be a good person.

218
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,370
If you don't, you'll keep meeting people like me.

219
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,640
You know Ji Chang Soo?

220
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,730
Pardon?

221
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,010
You don't know him?

222
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,130
No.

223
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,890
He'll be arrested in court as well.

224
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,910
Say hello to him in advance.

225
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Whoa!

226
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,240
Say hello.

227
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,640
She's in for drug use, and you're in for injury.

228
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,980
Coincidentally, your prosecutor and
lawyer are the same people.

229
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,480
You know that, right?

230
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,720
Yes, I've seen her in the court
house several times.

231
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,940
Ji Chang Soo.

232
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:01,890
You know why I called both of you out, right?

233
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,400
No, I'm not sure.

234
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
You really don't know?

235
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,350
No.

236
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,480
Really?

237
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,570
No.

238
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,110
- Then, leave.
- Oh, no.

239
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,980
Then, I'll leave.

240
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,540
No, Your Honor, speak.

241
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,700
You two talk.

242
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,570
You got a scuzzy judge and lost all hope.

243
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,900
Comfort each other.

244
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,340
What happened?

245
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,830
Huh? What's going on?

246
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,510
We're...

247
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,030
screwed.

248
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,800
Wow. Aigoo...

249
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,070
What brings you here during
work hours, Ms. Song?

250
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:00,410
Everything is going well with
you these days, right?

251
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,350
I came by because it's my last day off today.

252
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,160
How is it going?

253
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,430
I told you. If people voted on finding people,

254
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,020
I'd be the president.

255
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:14,040
You're all talk. You didn't
give me a progress report.

256
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,550
I don't see any result.

257
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,490
Did you ask for help at the police
station for missing persons?

258
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,700
Geez, why can't they find her, do you think?

259
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
There's only one answer.

260
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,150
She's no longer in this world.

261
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,600
When a woman is raped and leaves home,

262
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,940
most definitely...

263
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,400
Stop your nonsense.

264
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,820
My unni is alive.

265
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,740
She promised me.

266
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,480
That she won't kill herself.

267
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,660
What I'm saying is...

268
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,170
Someone who cut off contact with her family...

269
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,530
Do you think she kept her name?

270
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,120
Most definitely, she's living under
a new ID as a different person.

271
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,240
Are you saying you're connected
to people who sell IDs?

272
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,990
I'll find your sister soon and-

273
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,020
Geez, you scared me.

274
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,930
Why are you wiping a perfectly clean table?

275
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,910
Geez! You'll wear the surface down. Stop it!

276
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,980
Look,

277
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,080
we're talking about something
extremely important here.

278
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,150
What the heck is he saying?

279
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,550
Gosh.

280
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,180
[ Sang Cheol oppa ]

281
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,580
Let's take some time before we start talking.

282
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,050
I'll call you in a few days.

283
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,390
Judge.

284
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,670
You didn't go home?

285
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,720
How are you feeling?

286
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,180
I'm all better.

287
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,770
I even ate rice and soup for dinner.

288
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,970
I told you not to come to work.

289
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,700
I couldn't rest when I thought of
all the work I had to catch up on.

290
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,620
I'll go home after working for a little bit.

291
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,700
It's nice to have you back.

292
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,650
Let's go. I'll take you home.

293
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,020
Take your time coming in tomorrow morning.

294
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,330
You can come in late.

295
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,850
I told you I'm all better thanks to you.

296
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,830
Bye.

297
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,090
Bye.

298
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,640
Thank you.

299
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,240
Goodnight.

300
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,760
Let's grab some tea.

301
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,570
Oh, no. What to do?

302
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,060
There is no coffee shop nearby.

303
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,900
Let's just go anywhere. I'll drive.

304
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,040
Then...

305
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,660
come in. I have tea and coffee.

306
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,670
It's uncomfortable, huh?

307
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,650
Oh, no.

308
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,210
I'm so comfortable.

309
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,620
I can even lie down.

310
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,100
I'm not saying I'll lie down.

311
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,200
When you said you'd stop by last night

312
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,580
and couldn't come because you were so busy.

313
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,460
That's why I went in today.

314
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,550
So I can work even for a bit.

315
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,760
I wasn't that busy.

316
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,930
I...

317
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,990
won't be a judge for a long time.

318
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,520
I did overhear some things.

319
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,310
But why are you trying to quit?

320
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,700
I thought it was a place

321
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,310
for just anyone to fudge around
if you know some law.

322
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,240
But it's not just for anyone.

323
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,820
Why are you just "anyone?"

324
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,580
You're the best one among all
the judges I've seen thus far.

325
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,720
Have you worked with other judges?

326
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,710
Well, no. You're the first one.

327
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
If you work with someone like me,

328
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,000
I won't be of any help to you.

329
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,930
That's not true. After I enrolled
into the judicial institute,

330
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,530
I'm learning the most and
realizing things right now.

331
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,120
You have about a month
left as a trainee, right?

332
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,240
Yes.

333
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,610
I'm so sad when I think of the time passing.

334
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,410
I was reviewing the document on
the 911 EMT assault case earlier.

335
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,930
The case for next week.

336
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,680
I was so shocked and angry.

337
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,820
I wanted to ask you.

338
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,880
Should I talk to the administrative office
and switch out a mentor judge for you?

339
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,670
For me, you're the best judge there is.

340
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,260
You've never met other judges.

341
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,700
Someone who's the real thing.

342
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,190
By chance...

343
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,600
did I do something wrong?

344
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,500
If you tell me what you don't like
about me, I'll do my best to change it.

345
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,390
It's not you, So Eun.

346
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,290
It's me.

347
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,350
Is it because I talk back too much?

348
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,370
I really didn't mean to talk back to you.

349
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,780
I said that's not it.

350
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,780
Once I make some money,

351
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,130
I'm thinking of opening up a restaurant.

352
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,390
A judge or chef...

353
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:52,100
they're both professional occupations.

354
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,820
Are you serious?

355
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,920
When that happens,

356
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,790
I'll invite you, So Eun...

357
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,810
and will make the most
delicious dish in the world

358
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,230
for you.

359
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,440
You don't even know what kind of food I like.

360
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,330
What's your favorite?

361
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,980
Everything.

362
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,120
I'll make you everything then.

363
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,260
I'll leave.

364
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,520
Okay.

365
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,500
For paying special attention to all the details...

366
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,760
I really thank you.

367
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,840
Even if you feel better, you know that
you have to finish your medication, right?

368
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,320
Yes.

369
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,130
And...

370
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,040
I don't want to go to another judge's office.

371
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,710
I like working with you.

372
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,520
You'll like it even more if you
work with another judge.

373
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,240
No.

374
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,780
Please don't send me elsewhere.

375
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,500
I may be just a trainee.

376
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,790
But once you're in charge of a person,

377
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,430
you should take charge to the end.

378
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,560
See you tomorrow.

379
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,560
♫  I’m closing my eyes,
so the night grows white ♫

380
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,630
♫  With the night, I’m going to you ♫

381
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:33,350
♫  In my heart that had a lot of sadness ♫

382
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:40,330
♫  If you shine a warm light ♫

383
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,730
♫ I want to dream again  ♫
