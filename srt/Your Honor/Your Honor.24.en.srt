1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,670
- Were you on call last night?
-Yes, Your Honor.

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,590
You're in on a Sunday.

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,380
I'm sorry, but I forgot my ID.

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,730
I'll take you in. Go ahead.

5
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,730
[ Letter of resignation ]

6
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,420
[ Letter of resignation ]

7
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,540
Your Honor!

8
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,360
Have a good day.

9
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,880
I'm sorry I keep contacting you.

10
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,860
Tomorrow is the last day.

11
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,260
The final trial.

12
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,990
Thank you in advance.

13
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,420
The trial is public tomorrow.

14
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,910
The courtroom will be packed with people.

15
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,290
Are you scared?

16
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,360
I majored in threatening and blackmailing.

17
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,940
But today...

18
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,960
I contacted you to apologize.

19
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,380
What?

20
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,780
I'm sorry I threatened you
with five years in jail.

21
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,350
You're a victim, too.

22
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,070
Then...

23
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,200
It'll be over within the
lines the lawyer said.

24
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,790
You won't get arrested in court.

25
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,820
Thank you.

26
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,630
Thank you, Your Honor.

27
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,330
But...

28
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,440
Hae Na, you and I

29
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,900
will carry the burden of
the crime all our lives.

30
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,260
What crime?

31
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,780
Lee Ho Sung, Choi Min Gu and
Kang In Joo all did drugs together.

32
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,340
In the first call to the police,

33
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,710
all their names were mentioned.

34
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,540
But...

35
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,160
they're really fierce enemies.

36
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,990
The grandson of a conglomerate.

37
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,990
An heir to a hospital.

38
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,870
A politician's son.

39
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,770
So...

40
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,830
it was covered up by other news.

41
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,220
A case that should have
ended in manslaughter.

42
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,210
News birthed more news.

43
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,130
It made the entire country go mad

44
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,130
and turned him into a cruel murderer.

45
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,910
He...

46
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,760
got the death penalty.

47
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,460
I...

48
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,300
didn't hear about that.

49
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,590
A person died

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,540
to cover up the drug party

51
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,760
that some sons of powerful families threw.

52
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,410
No.

53
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,890
I didn't hear that.

54
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,680
That did not happen.

55
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,480
I don't know much

56
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,120
but an actor

57
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,100
makes other people happy, I think.

58
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,770
You make people cry and laugh.

59
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,820
You're angry on their behalf

60
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,950
and avenge them on their behalf.

61
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,110
And, you make people happy.

62
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,900
I...

63
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,800
hope you are that kind of person.

64
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,040
I'm an ordinary citizen,

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,960
so I can't promise you nice things
like a rich man's son.

66
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
I can't do anything for you.

67
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,960
But...

68
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,920
I promise you one thing.

69
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,530
I'll sincerely cheer you on

70
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,990
in everything you star in from now on.

71
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,890
I'm leaving now.

72
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,950
See you in court.

73
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,460
Wow.

74
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,180
I knew you would get it done.

75
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,780
You're always the best

76
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,140
but today, you're especially the best.

77
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,380
What's wrong?

78
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,780
That's what I want to ask you.

79
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,100
Why were you like that yesterday?

80
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,060
Yesterday?

81
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,940
You came in yesterday and took
something out of the safe.

82
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,240
I know we said we would be
a judge and trainee at work,

83
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,580
but I didn't ask you to give
me the cold shoulder.

84
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,980
Oh, I, yesterday...

85
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,690
I came in

86
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,850
and took something...

87
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,060
I'll see you in court.

88
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,120
I was sick.

89
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,860
I was so sick

90
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,490
and had gotten a shot, so

91
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:11,430
I wasn't feeling well and don't really remember.

92
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,000
If I were myself...

93
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,350
I mean...

94
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,300
if I were feeling myself, I wouldn't
have done that to you.

95
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,320
- No.
- I'm sorry.

96
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,390
I'm really sorry. Really.

97
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,860
You were very sick?

98
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,620
Yes.

99
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,890
Where?

100
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,290
Everywhere.

101
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,270
Why didn't you call me if you were sick?

102
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,000
I will from now on.

103
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,090
It wasn't the person I know.

104
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,810
I'm sorry...

105
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,420
that I startled you.

106
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,020
Your hand...

107
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,090
I'll be in court.

108
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,450
Is it true that you were really sick?

109
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,670
Are you okay?

110
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,420
You don't need medicine?

111
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,860
I'm okay.

112
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,330
Don't be sick.

113
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,740
Han Soo Ho, what are you
planning, you f***er?

114
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,530
You wanted to see me before
the final trial, so here we are.

115
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,810
You didn't even let me
contact him when I asked.

116
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,950
But ever since I threatened
suicide, I see you a lot.

117
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,510
Not that again.

118
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,300
After today, I'll see you all the time.

119
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,280
You can't last a day without whining?

120
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,610
You can wait outside.

121
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,180
Once the trial's over,

122
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,660
go to Africa for three or four months.

123
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,520
Do some volunteer work.

124
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,230
After that,

125
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,930
you'll do a variety show. I've talked
to the broadcast stations.

126
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,010
Oppa,

127
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,760
let me ask you one thing.

128
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,980
Go ahead.

129
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,080
I was just a toy you played with, right?

130
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,280
Did you dream of being a
conglomerate CEO's wife?

131
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,200
You're cute.

132
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,480
I can't dream?

133
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,970
No, you can.

134
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,640
It's just a dream anyway.

135
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,400
Okay.

136
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,810
I'm leaving.

137
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,820
Hey, Hae Na.

138
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,960
I wasn't just playing with you.

139
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,090
I really liked you.

140
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,920
I still do.

141
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,430
We got ourselves out

142
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,350
and sent you to trial alone.

143
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,920
I'm sincerely sorry about that.

144
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,730
I'll repay you

145
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,720
to make up for it and more.

146
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
Good luck at the trial.

147
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,190
Good luck with your comeback.

148
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,620
You're going to be a top star.

149
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's do it, Hae Na.

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,510
You...

151
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,950
and I are going to go all the way.

152
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,860
You promise?

153
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,020
You know how it works.

154
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,100
Is there anything I can't do in this town?

155
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,050
Ji Chang Soo. He's not here?

156
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,700
The defendant has been hospitalized
with an acute liver infection.

157
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,690
He could not be present.

158
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,390
Please allow us to proceed
as trial in absentia.

159
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,560
That's not advantageous for the defendant.

160
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,500
What does the defense think?

161
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,850
It's okay with me.

162
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,930
Okay, then.

163
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,450
Prosecution, proceed with
the cross-examination.

164
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,700
There is nothing to examine.

165
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,910
Defense, proceed with
the closing statement.

166
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,200
We do not have one.

167
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,890
I will announce the sentence
next Wednesday.

168
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,120
Next, Park Hae Na.

169
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,600
It's been a long trial, right?

170
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,490
It's all over today.

171
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,700
Prosecution, please cross-examine.

172
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,140
There is nothing to examine.

173
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,000
Do you not have a desire
to prove the crime?

174
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,880
I have a desire, but!

175
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,950
There is nothing to cross-examine.

176
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,720
How excellent.

177
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,720
Closing statement, please.

178
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,670
We do not have one.

179
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,480
I think you're asking me
to end the trial quickly.

180
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,020
Then, I will.

181
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,340
Defendant,

182
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,130
your last testimony.

183
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,740
You don't have anything to say?

184
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,840
I will deliver the sentence next Wednesday.

185
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,570
You don't have to say anything.

186
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,690
I will give...

187
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,120
a final testimony.

188
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm listening.

189
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,280
In the hotel club's bathroom,

190
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,890
a stranger told me a pill
would sober me up,

191
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,910
so I used it.

192
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,910
It was only in the emergency
room the next day

193
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:28,860
that I learned I had consumed drugs.

194
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,080
I did not use it with anyone else.

195
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,530
And it only happened to me.

196
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,400
I apologize...

197
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,910
for causing controversy.

198
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,930
Through multiple trials, I was like a parrot

199
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,400
repeating those words.

200
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,230
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,480
All of it

202
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,600
has been a lie.

203
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,610
The day of the incident,

204
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,690
I went to a private bar in
Gangnam with acquaintances.

205
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,300
I'm going to Congress.

206
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,660
What?

207
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,440
Really?

208
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,980
My dad became the Chair
of his party and isn't running

209
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,960
in return for my being
number three on the ballot.

210
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,320
What are you doing?

211
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,580
Pour him a drink.

212
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,900
Let's go!

213
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,740
Oppa, are you really
going to be in Congress?

214
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,210
Of course.

215
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,670
Hey, but...

216
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,160
If you're number three, it's basically free.

217
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,810
- Totally free.
- Work hard in your career.

218
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,610
I'll make you the main
model for healthcare.

219
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,610
Really? You promised, okay?

220
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,220
This won't do. Drink more!

221
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,270
Let's get our energy up.

222
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,980
Let's kill it!

223
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,110
Congressman Kang, congratulations!

224
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,680
One shot!

225
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,330
It was a place we frequented.

226
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,220
A server I knew

227
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,460
gave me the pill. Then...

228
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,620
there was an accident.

229
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,220
Thank you!

230
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,710
Have a good time!

231
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,340
Bring it over here, you bastard!

232
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,550
Over here, over here!

233
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,050
Hae Na.

234
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,210
Hurry up.

235
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,430
The defendant is making a false testimony!

236
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,930
Do you know what you're doing right now?

237
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,740
Sit down.

238
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,550
- Your Honor!
- Sit down!

239
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,500
Please continue.

240
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,040
One of my acquaintances got too high

241
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,500
and assaulted the server
and the club's owner.

242
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,130
Are you crazy?

243
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,900
Are you out of your mind?

244
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,990
Stop!

245
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,970
- Stop it!
- Hey, f***er!

246
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,470
What do you want me to do?

247
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,590
Stop it. Please calm down.

248
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,120
I'm leaving. This isn't fun.

249
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,530
You blocked me?

250
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,060
You blocked me?

251
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,720
Then, when it seemed
like the story would leak,

252
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,350
my acquaintances asked me for a favor.

253
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,970
I would say I did the drugs alone

254
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,650
and the assault...

255
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:06,130
was an incident between
the server and the owner.

256
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,780
I...

257
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,420
accepted that offer

258
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,230
and falsely testified to the prosecution.

259
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,120
Why?

260
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,860
They said they would ensure

261
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,910
my future.

262
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,800
Why are you changing your testimony now?

263
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,630
Yesterday...

264
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:40,190
I met one of my fans.

265
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,230
He hoped that...

266
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,490
I would be a good person.

267
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,020
I trusted that he will cheer me
on for the rest of my life

268
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,450
and decided to tell the truth.

269
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,380
Who was the server that provided the drugs?

270
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,090
Ji Chang Soo.

271
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,740
Can you tell us the names of the acquaintances
who did drugs with you that day?

272
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,210
Yes.

273
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,470
O Sung Group's Managing Director, Lee Ho Sung.

274
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,650
Professor Kang In Gyu at
Hanguk University, and

275
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,640
Choi Hospital's Department
Head, Choi Min Guk.

276
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,810
I'm calling a recess for five minutes.

277
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,170
Park Hae Na flipped the
testimony upside down!

278
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,480
Print the article now,
high-class drug party!

279
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,050
O Sung Group's Lee Ho Sung, Professor Kang In Gyu,
and Choi Hospital heir Choi Min Guk!

280
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,740
It's legally okay if their real names are
revealed since they were said in court!

281
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,920
Your Honor.

282
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,160
What happened?

283
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,840
I told you.

284
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,290
There was something.

285
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,790
How did you know?

286
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,630
A thug knows a thug.

287
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,970
- Why aren't you smiling?
- Before...

288
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,410
the person that the defendant
mentioned just now.

289
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,750
Choi Hospital heir Choi Min Guk.

290
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,440
The one who sexually assaulted your sister.

291
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,350
Is it the same person?

292
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,540
It's all okay now.

293
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,600
From now on, the press will take care of it.

294
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,140
Why?

295
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,030
No?

296
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,120
It can't be?

297
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,820
Criminal Law Number 234.

298
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,090
On Number 234...

299
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,350
The recess is over.

300
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,130
Do you have anything more?

301
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,120
I am sorry

302
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,810
and thank you.

303
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,140
Thank you for your bravery.

304
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,570
Have a seat.

305
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,460
The final trial is finished.

306
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,050
But...

307
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,920
I can't decide on a sentencing date.

308
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,290
Please rise.

309
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,350
You. Please rise.

310
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,660
You have the floor.

311
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,260
Criminal Law Number 234.

312
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,900
Please explain it.

313
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,460
Yes.

314
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,150
Criminal Law Number 234, Clause One.

315
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,700
If anyone suspects there is a crime,

316
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,920
they may report it.

317
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,320
Clause Two.

318
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,460
If a public official, while they
are conducting their duties,

319
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,530
suspects there is a crime,
they must report it.

320
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,800
How do they report it?

321
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,970
According to Law Number 237,
either by writing or speech.

322
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,940
One must report to a prosecutor
or the judicial police.

323
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,650
Thank you for the explanation.

324
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:37,920
Have a seat.

325
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,260
Everyone in court heard that, right?

326
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,440
You don't have to write it
down, you can say it.

327
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,750
Prosecutor!

328
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,130
Listen up.

329
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,440
Park Hae Na's final testimony identified

330
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,000
the employee of the bar, Ji Chang Soo

331
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,030
and the owner of the bar, Min Gu Ram.

332
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,270
They are reported for
assaulting a public official.

333
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,870
Also!

334
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,270
O Sung Group's Managing
Director Lee Ho Sung.

335
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,110
Hanguk University
Professor Kang In Gyu.

336
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,610
Choi Hospital Department
Head Choi Min Guk.

337
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,860
I report them for violating narcotics laws

338
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,110
and assaulting a public official.

339
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,010
The person reporting

340
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,060
is Judge Han Soo Ho.

341
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,080
Please respond.

342
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,150
Prosecutor!

343
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,710
Respond.

344
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,680
The report...

345
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,580
has been received.

346
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,590
The trial's over.

347
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,240
We'll head out first.

348
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:30,800
I had forgotten about criminal laws.

349
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,550
You wanted to catch them somehow, right?

350
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,260
The judge is speaking, What kind
of trainee just nods?

351
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:45,920
I...

352
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,180
if I may be so bold,

353
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,360
there's just one thing I want to do to you.

354
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,160
Do it.

355
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,970
You might say it's rude.

356
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,100
Since when have I been afraid of that?

357
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,450
I shouldn't do this, but...

358
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,620
You were amazing, Your Honor.

359
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:23,070
♫ I shouldn't say it,
my inner thoughts... ♫

360
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,660
If you're going to, do it right.

361
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,090
Left foot or right foot?

362
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,720
Any foot.

363
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,680
Let's go!

364
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,700
Yay!

365
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:44,460
♫ We might hurt each other,
and keep living like now ♫

366
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:51,890
♫ I'll bury your sadness in the
graveyard of memories, if it's okay♫

367
00:28:51,890 --> 00:29:00,850
♫ Someday, to me, to you,
they'll come back ♫

368
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:10,100
♫ I see you, who ignored those shouts ♫
