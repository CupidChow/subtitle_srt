[ Judge Han Soo Ho, are you that
kind of person? A judge is humble... ]

2
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,940
A judge is humble,

3
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,280
repeats good deeds,

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,400
must have the courage to make decisions

5
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,630
and have a clean record.

[ From Talmud ]
Judge Han Soo Ho, are you that kind of person?

7
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,800
Wait, who's Talmud?

8
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,370
Cheers!

9
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,470
Who said that earlier?

10
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,220
Said what?

11
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,990
Every hour you're not in love is a waste of time.

12
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,970
That? Well...

13
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,620
Kang Ho.

14
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,670
Do you know why being in jail is a waste of time?

15
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,470
Because you can't make money?

16
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,670
You don't have returns per effort here.

17
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,570
You speck of dust.

18
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,790
Look around you.

19
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,220
See if there's anything to love.

20
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,670
Passing time without loving anyone

21
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,670
is a waste of time.

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,890
Remember that.

23
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,100
Who?

24
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,500
A famous philosopher or poet?

25
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,250
Just a hyung in a group I'm in.

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,550
A group that should never get together again.

27
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,160
How about you, So Eun? Anything fun going on?

28
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,350
When I was...

29
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,890
a prosecutor trainee...

30
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,110
Four records of violence, threatening, and assault

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,050
plus destroying the currency.

32
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,870
Nice resume.

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,670
You melted the coins and sold them, right?

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,430
Here are napkins!

35
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,990
It was my first interrogation, so I felt a bit crazy.

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,380
It was a long time ago, so I don't
really remember his face.

37
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,130
But the moment I saw you, Your Honor...

38
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,720
I thought of his face.

39
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,870
You look so much like him, you could be twins.

40
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,730
- Isn't that funny?
- Very funny.

41
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,870
I'm an only child, a twin...

42
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,040
I know.

43
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,160
A lawyer sunbae from school told me

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,340
that you said you don't have any siblings.

45
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,770
That's what my mom said.

46
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,950
In our family,

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,500
one good judge will do.

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,940
But doesn't it get lonely being alone?

49
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,580
You think you're not lonely with siblings?

50
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,470
I think...

51
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,070
I would have been lonely without my older sister.

52
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,770
I heard an astronaut returning to earth said this.

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,900
Earth is amazing.

54
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,420
Gravity holds us tight.

55
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,390
The feeling of someone holding you tight.

56
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,730
He missed that.

57
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,190
To me...

58
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,050
My sister is gravity.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,080
To me, money is gravity.

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,980
Let's go. I'll treat you next time.

61
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Hold on, I'll clean these up.

62
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,300
You don't need to, everyone leaves it behind.

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,450
- That's why at least I should do it.
- Don't.

64
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,230
If people catch you being kind,
they'll look down on you.

65
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,780
You got caught being kind, too.

66
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,030
I don't even know how to spell "kind."

67
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,630
Is that why you took care of Team Leader Shin's
living expenses and legal fees?

68
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,570
I'm sorry I said I have nothing to learn from you.

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,960
Darn, I had forgotten I did that.

70
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,270
My money!

71
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,970
Dang it!

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,680
Make sure you call a driving service.

73
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:27,670
Don't drink and drive.

74
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,270
She's a judge. Please drive her safely.

75
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,340
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Get home safely!

76
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,730
Go ahead, get me while you can!

[ SBS News ]

00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,780
Hello Sunbae, I'm Ju Eun.

79
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,350
I have something to tell you.

80
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,130
- Is this about the news?
- No.

81
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,160
What do you mean no?

82
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,760
Go talk to the Press Director. We have nothing to say.

83
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,090
I'd like to talk to you about hate
in our society somewhere quiet.

84
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,390
At some point, Korean women
became "kimchi girls"

85
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,820
and Korean men became "losers."

86
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,430
Seniors are "out of touch,"
young people are "elite bugs."

87
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,750
Mothers are called "mom bugs."

88
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,340
Get to the point.

89
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,530
It's obvious why my interview
with Judge Han didn't air.

90
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,260
O Sung Group probably threatened
to pull ads if it aired.

91
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,970
But somehow...

92
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,120
the fight is among the anchors.

93
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,060
Calling me an arrogant newbie trying
to push my face into the main news.

94
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,450
The sunbaes could not let that happen.

95
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,290
Due to internal conflict within anchors

96
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,810
the interview did not air.

97
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,450
I hope...

98
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,320
you're not part of that narrative.

99
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
What about your ambition to
push yourself into prime time?

100
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,460
Isn't that the fact?

101
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,350
- I...
- I won't have an ego battle someone on your level.

102
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,840
I know that.

103
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,480
- Sunbae?
- Yes?

104
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,930
What should we do about her?

105
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,290
You ladies figure it out.

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,060
The Press Director told me you're after my job.

107
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,560
- That's not true.
- I'm aware.

108
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,570
I'm not falling for it.

109
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,770
You want to be like Anderson Cooper, right?

110
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,920
You don't want to be like me.

111
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,430
Anchors in Korea...

112
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,190
deliver the news, not make it.

113
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,340
Will you fight with me to have the interview aired?

114
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,800
I'm just a powerless anchor.

115
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,820
Thanks for the interesting chat.
I'll treat you sometime.

116
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,760
Have you eaten?

117
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,070
Who are you?

118
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,970
I...

119
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,690
I'm a judicial trainee Song So Eun,

120
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,870
working in Judge Han Soo Ho's office.

121
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,270
- So this...
- Hey, really?

122
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,170
I told you not to touch it!

123
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,120
You know how tough it was to get it?

124
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,590
You'll contaminate the fingerprints.

125
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,570
So you want us to get the fingerprint samples, right?

126
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,170
Yeah, very clearly.

127
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,170
But if we don't fill out an official report

128
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,860
they won't get us samples.

129
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,220
Why insist on proper channels?

130
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,280
You know,

131
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,980
people who retired from the NFS open up

132
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,870
private detective agencies, right?

133
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,100
They'll do this for you there.

134
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,600
Thank you for your help.

135
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,730
I already ate. All yours.

136
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,680
Did the judge ask you to do this?

137
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,370
He doesn't want to see me on his commute.

138
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,480
So you are to convince me to quit?

139
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,320
No.

140
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,670
I figured you wouldn't have eaten.

141
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,670
I have no family to eat with.

142
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,690
I know about your case.

143
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,680
I don't know what to say.

144
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,050
You don't have to console me.

145
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,320
All you need to do

146
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,960
is to punish the perpetrator severely.

147
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,080
The judge...

148
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,710
is a good person.

149
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,690
He will give a fair ruling-

150
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,460
What kind of judge is a good judge?

151
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,880
My wife died.

152
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,770
The perpetrator was arrested

153
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,590
but got out on bail after a month.

154
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,230
If...

155
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,290
she looked happy, I was going to say something.

156
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,060
So I looked at her social media.

157
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,760
Found my freedom again!

158
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,960
Repressed joy explosion!

159
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,570
She killed someone while drunk driving.

160
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,070
But she's drinking again and smiling now?

161
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,610
Ahjussi!

162
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,090
I wanted to kill her.

163
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,350
But I can't become a murderer.

164
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,650
So I started following her.

165
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,440
To prove that she is the devil.

166
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,700
Let's go, let's go!

167
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,610
Of course, the judge wouldn't know.

168
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,930
Since she acted like that at the courtroom.

169
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm so sorry.

170
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,620
I will carry that burden for the rest of my life.

171
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,140
I sent all the pictures I took to the court.

172
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,320
But do you know what Judge Han said?

173
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,440
It's illegal to follow someone and take pictures.

174
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,180
Evidence acquired illegally...

175
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,080
cannot be used in a trial.

176
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,830
If you go by the book...

177
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,100
does that make you a good judge?

178
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,070
No, I'll pay.

179
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,270
I don't want to eat a meal...

180
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,370
paid for by you people.

181
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,270
[ A clean, fair Republic of Korea ]

182
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,720
Hey, buddy!

183
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:09,550
What's up? Calling me up first thing in the morning?

184
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,750
You can call up a friend when you miss him!

185
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,000
- What did you do last night?
- Last night?

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Work. Why?

187
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,880
You didn't meet up with someone
and plot to kill me or anything?

188
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,560
What are you talking about?

189
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,470
You want to kill me.

190
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,410
Giving Lee Ho Sung a sentence.

191
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,410
Trying Park Hae Na again.

192
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,250
I don't know how to respond to you.

193
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,540
Did something happen?

194
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,850
Sang Cheol.

195
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,110
Go tell Lee Ho Sung.

196
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,490
I have the evidence in my hands.

197
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,850
We'll see who goes down first.

198
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,770
Don't change the channel, keep watching until the end.

199
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,640
Bye.

200
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,540
We have scheduled an appeal.

201
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,150
When we pay bail tomorrow, you'll be free to go.

202
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,820
You said...

203
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,500
to wait a couple of days.

204
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,070
This is the result of my wait.

205
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,160
My head is on a plate...

206
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,590
while Judge Han is a star.

207
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,750
Doing interviews.

208
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,180
I was in cold sweat...

209
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,830
trying to stop that from airing.

210
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,390
You know I hate sweating, right?

211
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,940
Judge Han ordered a search warrant
for Park Hae Na's phone.

212
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,480
He figured out her relationship with you.

213
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,270
That junkie b****!

214
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,040
That junkie b**** did drugs by herself.

215
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,950
I have nothing to do with it.

216
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,070
That's how the investigation went and
how the trial needs to end. Got it?

217
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,970
Make it so.

218
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,750
That's why I paid you.

219
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,810
Do you understand, Mr. Lawyer?

220
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,470
I just came from seeing Judge Han.

221
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,610
He told me to tell you.

222
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,960
"The evidence is in my hands."

223
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,290
Crazy bastard.

224
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,920
What evidence?

225
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,480
There is no evidence.

226
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,970
I destroyed it all.

227
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:28,770
Tell him to shut his mouth if he wants to live.

228
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,460
When he was at school

229
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,900
my company's scholarship foundation

230
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,610
paid for all his scholarships.

231
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,480
He's a judge thanks to me, and now...

232
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,670
That's not enough to stop the trial.

233
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,330
At this point, not getting him re-hired

234
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,370
is the best route.

235
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,740
Great.

236
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,220
I'll get him cut.

237
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,440
How do I do that?

238
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,320
Should I use my company's entire legal team?

239
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,920
First...

240
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,770
tell them to air the news interview.

241
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,670
- Hey, Lawyer Oh!
- He'll get a disciplinary action against him.

242
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,070
He went on the news during a trial

243
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,320
moving his mouth about law, justice.

244
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,270
The Judicial Personnel Committee will not take it well.

245
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,940
They'll let him go within a month.

246
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,040
If your plan doesn't work,

247
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,790
I...

248
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,900
will bury you.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,480
Air the interview.

250
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,290
Han Soo Ho is a genius.

251
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,070
He's not dragging Lee Ho Sung
into things without a plan.

252
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,180
I thought you guys were good.

253
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,080
Why didn't you make up with him?

254
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,480
My father will never cut him off.

255
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,740
He'll find his weakness and get him on his side.

256
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,140
He sure is the black hole in this field, as they say.

257
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,180
Sucking in even all the young judges to his side.

258
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,470
So.

259
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,360
What are you thinking?

260
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,430
We need to cut off my father first.

261
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,500
Why?

262
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,060
Do you have something going on with my father?

263
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,520
When I was a newbie, he was the
first person to buy me lunch.

264
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,950
He still does.

265
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,640
That's nothing.

266
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,970
I'd like to request an investigation on my father.

267
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,450
Must you really?

268
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,790
Pretty soon you'll inherit everything.

269
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,490
I'll buy your lunches from now on.

270
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,720
I wrote up the ruling you ordered.

271
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,060
Good work.

272
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:51,220
So that's it, right?

273
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,110
There's one I haven't done.

274
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,440
Bae Min Jung's drunk driving case.

275
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,290
Oh, that one is coming up soon.

276
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,150
Where is it...

277
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,170
[ Mom's birthday ]
What a good son.

278
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,250
Marking Mom's birthday...

279
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,550
It's your mother's birthday?

280
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,750
Take your time but write it up as soon as possible.

281
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,350
It's drunk driving, not a big deal.

282
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,190
So I wanted to tell you.

283
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,520
I feel a little uncomfortable writing the ruling.

284
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,270
- Trainee, leave us alone.
- Yes.

285
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:54,030
You...

286
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,280
You're called to the disciplinary committee.

287
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,310
I took care of the bribery charges

288
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,830
but "failing to maintain dignity"
is too broad, I can't touch it.

289
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,420
Just tell them to give me a warning.

290
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,850
Resign before you get fired.

291
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,170
I told you I'll decide after a month.

292
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,700
Right after the disciplinary hearing
is the re-hiring hearing.

293
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,870
Right now, you're unqualified. You won't last a month.

294
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,870
I won't last?

295
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,770
The land bidding evaluation goes for another month.

296
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,470
If you can wrap up the rest of the trials well,

297
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,400
we'll repay you in a big way.

298
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,140
When you say big, how big?

299
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,970
If you confirm Lee Ho Sung is guilty,

300
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,200
I'll give you 1 billion won.

301
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,240
That doesn't work.

302
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,700
I need to last longer than that.

303
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,020
I thought you wanted to quit.

304
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,500
You want to keep doing this job?

305
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,260
There's something I need to do as a judge.

306
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,190
Please help, Hyung.

307
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,740
Are you insane?

308
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,300
I asked we should be like brothers
repeatedly and you said no.

309
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:50,310
Actually, from the moment I first saw you,
I wanted you to be an older brother.

310
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,520
Write down "law" in Chinese characters.

311
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,410
- What?
- Write it.

312
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,390
You like Chinese characters. What's wrong?

313
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,500
- You don't know how?
- Of course I do.

314
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,980
- But why?
- Just do it.

315
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,270
Should I do it in Arial or Times New Roman?

316
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,770
Look.

317
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,660
This is "water," and this is "go."

318
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,020
Meaning, water flows.

319
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,570
A steadfast life, like water.
A fair, unassuming judgement.

320
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,570
That is the meaning behind the
Chinese character "law."

321
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,350
Wow, is that so?

322
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,190
If you want to continue to be a
judge, flow like the water.

323
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,810
Don't stick out with your rulings,
go by the guidelines.

324
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,910
Don't run your mouth at the media.

325
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,970
Even if you're cautious, I can't
always block things for you.

326
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,170
Yes, Hyung.

327
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,970
Flow like water? Don't make waves.

328
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,950
Damn. I need that 1 billion before I bounce.

329
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,460
Who is that?

330
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,290
- What?
- The person behind you.

331
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,250
Who do you mean?

332
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,110
Your interview with Judge Han
is airing, as the top main news.

333
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:46,190
Slow down. You'll get sick.

334
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,360
I need to eat fast and get back.

335
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,720
I have so much to do.

336
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,440
I have so much to say.

337
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,570
Go ahead.

338
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,670
I made a huge decision.

339
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,270
I came out to get your support.

340
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,390
I always support you.

341
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,050
What did you decide?

342
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,300
- I'm starting my own firm.
- Really?

343
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,320
And not inherit your dad's firm?

344
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,920
When I go solo, come to me.

345
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,250
What? I haven't even graduated from the institute.

346
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,010
When you get an office, I'll send flowers.

347
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,020
Come to me.

348
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,480
So Eun.

349
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,760
I don't know what I want to do yet.

350
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,360
A judge not only has the responsibility
of punishing someone by law

351
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,810
but also the emotional responsibility.

352
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,930
You act strong, but have a soft heart. You won't last.

353
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,640
You're not fit to be a judge.

354
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,660
Hold on.

355
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,950
The legal world has been in uproar over the ruling.

356
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,780
We brought in Judge Han Soo Ho to talk to us.

357
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,290
We will now connect to the studio.

358
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,970
The controversial figure who sentenced

359
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,570
seven years in prison to Lee Ho Sung of O Sung Group.

360
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,110
From Seoul Central District Court, Criminal Division.

361
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,890
We have Judge Han Soo Ho here in our studio.

362
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:05,190
Thank you for coming.

363
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,370
From the legal and business sectors

364
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,550
that expected a relatively light sentencing,

365
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,270
you are receiving intense criticism.

366
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,570
What a pretty lady.

367
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,970
I wish she could be my daughter-in-law.

368
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,950
During the presidential election,
people in broad sectors

369
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,540
declare, this is the next president!

370
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,390
You know how they make predictions.

371
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,650
But just because they were wrong,

372
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,880
you don't criticize the voters.

373
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,170
They just made the wrong guess.

374
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,340
Legal experts argue if sentencing
guidelines are not honored

375
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,910
the law and order of our society is at risk.

376
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,310
What do you think about that?

377
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:45,870
I thought you were going to lay low
for a while. You did an interview?

378
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,070
The defendant's crime was severe.

379
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,960
There were no extenuating circumstances of remorse.

380
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,710
Reading your ruling,

381
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,130
the defendant...

382
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,250
You two look good together.

383
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,030
You got a hot, steamy night coming up?

384
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,340
The judicial branch has been accused of

385
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,420
giving free passes to the wealthy.

386
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,970
Chairmen of these corporations,

387
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:08,910
contributed to our economy

388
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,930
and receive free passes during their trials.

389
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,610
I think that is a good tradition

390
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,830
of our country's judicial branch.

391
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,900
So what happened to Lee Ho Sung?

392
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,040
He's not a chairman. He's a managing director.

393
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,780
What if he was a chairman
and not a managing director?

394
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,690
Would the sentence be different?

395
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,930
We'll figure that out later when chairmen are on trial.

396
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,070
I'll write those rulings then.

397
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,540
Last question.

398
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,330
Do you believe...

399
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,840
this ruling was a just one?

400
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,350
For me, the courtroom...

401
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,310
is not a place to get justice.

402
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,140
It's a place to decide if the
facts of the case laid out by

403
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,770
the prosecution are true or not.

404
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,600
Acknowledging facts as facts

405
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,080
is not necessarily just.

406
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,720
"The courtroom is not a place to get justice."

407
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,140
The judge is amazing.

408
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,200
He's a good person, too.

409
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,880
The heat wave is continuing...

410
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,280
I need to run.

411
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,030
I'm about to pull an all-nighter.

412
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,270
Oppa.

413
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,270
I'm not soft at heart.

414
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,680
I have really strong emotions, too.

415
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,300
Sorry I have to go.

416
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,210
I got this.

417
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,960
Did you see the news?

418
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,980
I've acquired the golf course's
booking list, security footage

419
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,260
and the testimonies of the caddies.

420
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,640
I'm about to meet a reporter to pass them on.

421
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,290
This will take care of my father.

422
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,310
Then we can work on Judge Han right away.

423
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,920
Whatever you do, hurry up!

424
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,570
I'm pissed off for the first time in a while.

425
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,130
Joo Eun! Great job!

426
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,310
Nice work.

427
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,720
- Congratulations, we're so proud!
- You were amazing.

428
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,120
- Congratulations!
- You're the best.

429
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,290
You were so good.

430
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,680
I enjoyed your interview.

431
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,950
- It aired?
- You were great.

432
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,690
It's nothing. I couldn't say no.

433
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,590
- I was dragged into it.
- I see.

434
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,560
You have something to say?

435
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,890
Bae Min Jung's drunk driving case.

436
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:09,210
I can't write the ruling.

437
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,400
Why not? It's so simple!

438
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,330
If the recommended sentence
is three years, cut it in half

439
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:18,770
and give her a year and a half in prison.
Three years of probation. That's it!

440
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,730
I know the perpetrator wrote a letter
of remorse and cried at court.

441
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,900
But she doesn't actually feel sorry.

442
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,950
The problem is, there is no evidence to prove that.

443
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,340
Aigoo, if there's no evidence, that's it.

444
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,620
So I can't write it.

445
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,620
We all know it, but there's no evidence.

446
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,040
So we have to give a light sentence.

447
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,770
Let's take it easy.

448
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,920
Like water flows, go by the sentencing guidelines.

449
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,900
Don't let the ruling stand out.

450
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:52,070
How can I explain this better?

451
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,110
Write "law" in Chinese characters.

452
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,760
The symbol meaning "law?"

453
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,970
Do you know why this became the symbol for "law?"

454
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,370
Yes. Water...

455
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,970
and go.

456
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,840
It means, follow where the water flows.

457
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,150
But the symbol "law"...

458
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:21,850
has the three strokes for water...

459
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,480
and the symbol...

460
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,860
with the character that means "go."

461
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,590
Haetae is a legendary animal
that determines good and evil.

462
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,200
When the Haetae symbol got taken out of it,

463
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,570
they say the law is like water flowing
and everything finding its place, but...

464
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,470
like Haetae, I think...

465
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,970
law is determining what is good versus evil.

466
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,350
That's what that means?

467
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,410
I'm sorry. You probably know all this already.

468
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,130
Wow! It's a good point.

469
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,800
The interpretation shouldn't change.

470
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,340
Then what did you think, Judge?

471
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,910
Do you always put this much thought into a ruling?

472
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,710
A ruling determines someone's life.

473
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,880
I'm only a trainee, so I know I don't actually rule.

474
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,580
No one thinks that.

475
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,430
"That person committed a crime.
The prosecutor wants this."

476
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,210
"He got a light sentence."

477
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,230
"If I was a judge, I'd be better."

478
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,030
Lots of people think that.

479
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,070
I've heard that a lot, too.

480
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,180
That's what I'm saying.

481
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,190
People will drag you through the
mud anyway. Just take it easy.

482
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,170
Strangers dragging me through
the mud is fine. But...

483
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,260
I don't want to insult myself.

484
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,000
So you can't write it?

485
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,860
Yes.

486
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,770
Even if you're the real judge?

487
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,570
Then...

488
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,220
I would've written one somehow.

489
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,060
[ Joo Eun ]

490
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,230
Well...

491
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,970
I'm somehow sitting in this seat.

492
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,840
But I think someone like you, So Eun, is a real judge.

493
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,080
So let's write it.

494
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,600
Let's-
