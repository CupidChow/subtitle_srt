Four, three.

Two.

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,060
Happy birthday!

I have a trial tomorrow, I'm busy. Happy birthday.

10

Hold on, hold on. She just got here.

11
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,210
I told her to come just for you. Over here!

12
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,320
Say hello.

13
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,240
This is Joo Eun, my college hoobae.

14
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,880
The only one who won't fall for me.

15

This is...

16
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,570
The only one of my friends from a poor family.

17
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,310

Have fun.

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,580
It'll be hard since you're both so full of yourselves.

21
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,810
You're both so annoying.

22
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,120
Come here, come here.

23
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,190
- Section Leader!
- Yes!

24

Can a trainee refuse to follow the judge's order?

25
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,670
Well...

26
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,410
I don't really know the law...

27
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,270
I've heard O Sung spent...

28
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,840
2 billion, 3 billion won on legal fees.

29
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,380
But the victim received only 5 million won.

30
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,000
He went blind in one eye
and got only 5 million won?

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Even that was paid by the firm,
and not the individual.

32
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,720
Not as Lee Ho Sung's responsibility,
but taken care of as a convenience fee.

33
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,240
To the end, he denies it,

34
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,920
won't acknowledge it, and isn't sorry.

35
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,580
How can you sentence him to nothing?

36
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,710
Shouldn't he at least get the maximum for injury?

37
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,510
Say that again.

38
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,770
What's going on?

39
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,010
I'm asking friend to friend, so answer me honestly.

40
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,670
- How much was your fee?
- You must've heard the rumors.

41
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,170
I did, so how much?

42
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,700
Unless the client makes it public,
we can't disclose legal fees.

43
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,490
Then I'll ask as the judge, not a friend.

44
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,660
How much?

45
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,290
Fifty big ones.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,280
Big ones?

47
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,600
I'm not so good at sizes.

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,060
5 billion won?

49
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,440
5 billion...

50
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,020
They gave you 5 billion won?

51
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,640
Soo Ho, as I told you before...

52
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,260
think of this as a chance to build
a good relationship with O Sung.

53
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,750
Talk to you later.

54
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,640
He still has the habit of hanging up.

55
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,380
As thanks, we prepared you a big one.

56
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,670
He got 5 billion, and I got a measly 100 million?

57
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,890
You're discriminating by size?

60

To throw down money after committing crime...

61
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,180
It's a Korean tradition.

62
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,310
Really?

63
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,770
In the Joseon era, we had
something called "Fast Money."

64
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,270
The criminal pays up instead of punishment.

65
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,630
You pay, you don't get a beating or go to prison.

66
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,690

No, I'm going up.

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,570
Get in. It's going up.

74
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,980
- How is it going as a judicial trainee?
- Yes.

- You got to write a ruling.
- Yes.

What you just said to me...

78
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,750
is clearly sexual harassment.

79

Everyone has a first time,

80

and that's what we call it.

81
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,450
It's a bigger issue that you're interpreting
a common phrase with sexual intentions.

82
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,070
The sexual harassment cases prioritize
the recipient's experience

83
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:49,240
over the perpetrator's intention.

84

Working for the judge has
made you even stiffer.

85

No.

what the prosecutor charges.

Do you know what I'm saying?

89

The prosecutor is king.

Are you very much remorseful?

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,890
Didn't you spend several billion?

137
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,550
You spent a thousand times more
on your lawyers than on the victim.

138
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,450
You think it feels good to be
discriminated by size like that?

139
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,880
No, it just hurts his ego.

O Sung Group heir, Managing Director
Lee Ho Sung got seven years in prison.

153
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,430
No reprieve, just seven years in jail.

154
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,900
It's unexpected for the heir of a corporation.

155
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,290
Print the headline, "Shocking Verdict,"
and write the article.

156
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,970
After the incident, the defendant attempted
to destroy evidence systematically

157
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,820
and showed no remorse.

158
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,470
The defendant's prior contributions
to the national economy

159
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,110
is not an extenuating circumstance in this case.

160
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,320
Hey!

161
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,990
You call this a trial?

162
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,090
- Is this Korean law?
- Be quiet!

163
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,250

Do you know what you're doing?

166
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,970
If you don't shut your mouth,
I'll put you in detention.

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,210
What did I do wrong?

168
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,150
Just because you're a judge? Hey.

169
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,150
You don't know me?

170
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,750
You don't know who I am?

171
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,160
10 days in detention for contempt of court.

172
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,250
Hey!

173
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,050
Watch who wins in the end.

174
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,950
Watch who dies in the end.

175
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,200
The more you talk, the longer
you spend in detention.

176
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,910
Hey, Han Soo Ho!

177
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,430
20 days in detention! Try me!

178
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,450
I'll give you 30 days.

179
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,080
What is this?

180
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,950
Huh?

181
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,030
You should be sorry. Okay?

182
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,710
Justice!

183
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,840
- Let go!
- Stop resisting!

184
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,240
- Let go!
- Stay still!

185
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,410
- You need to stay still!
- What are you doing?

186
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,250
What are you doing?

187
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,350
Don't you know who I am?

188
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,460
Excuse me.

189
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,370
I am his lawyer.

190
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,830
We have a few more steps
on our end, could you wait?

191
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,890
Take this off.

192
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,440
Take this off, motherf*****!

193
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,050
My mentor judge gave me
some homework the other day.

194
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,510
For practice, he had me write a ruling.

195
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,550
- So?
- I thought it was not a big deal of a case

196
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,960
but the petition was edited twice

197
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,410
to lessen the charges.

198
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,160
Typical "let him off easy" tactics
of the prosecution, right?

199
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,170
The case was about an heir to a corporation.

200
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,050
Lee Ho Sung.

201
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,420
You prosecuted him, right?

202
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,220
So?

203
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,330
He got seven years in prison,
the maximum for criminal injury.

204
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,450
I didn't think it would work.

205
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,560
But the judge must have agreed with me.

206
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,650
You know what I'm saying, right?

207
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,740
Don't mess with me.

208
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,950
The judge is king.

209
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,460
Hey!

210
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,730
This is hilarious.

211
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,950
Is this happening?

212
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,390
Is this reality?

213
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Hey. Slap me.

214
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,850
I want to know if I'm dreaming.

215
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,170
I'm sorry. We did our best.

216
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,230
We did our best.

217
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,400
Geez.

218
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,620
My hand hurts.

219
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,220
This is not a dream.

220
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,730
This is the reality.

221
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,580
There are ways to avoid arrest
and delay enforcement.

222
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,800
Are you really...

223
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,470
the best law firm in South Korea?

224
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,290
How much did I pay you guys?

225
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,850
One reason to delay enforcement

226
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,540
is the possibility of a legal dispute
in a superior court.

227
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,700
Or when affairs need to be settled, or if
there is an important impending business deal.

228
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,310
None of those apply right now.

229
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,710
Don't...

230
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,800
talk to me about what you can't do.

231
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,780
Talk to me about what you can.

232
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm explaining this so I can tell
you what is possible.

233
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,780
There is only one way to avoid arrest right now.

234
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,240
Then do that, don't just talk the talk!

235
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,500
You can faint, Managing Director.

236
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,040
- What?
- The emergency room is the only way.

237
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,030
Before we get to the hospital,

238
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,030
you can't open your eyes.

239
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,000
What?

240
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,060
- Are you okay?
- Call an ambulance.

241
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,450
Call an ambulance, now!

242
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,590
The Chief Judge wants you to come up.

243
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,360
Judge, the Chief Justice is calling.

244
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,660
This is a call from Assemblyman Yang!

245
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,760
It's Reporter Shin from Joguk Ilbo.

246
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,870
- Tell them I left.
- Where are you going?

247
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,010
- Home.
- Where are you going?

248
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,520
I said home!

249
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,500
- Hello, Your Honor.
- I'm going home!

250
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,520
Right now?

251
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,030
Thank you.

252
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,270
For what?

253
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,210
For honoring...

254
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,420
the ruling I wrote.

255
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,050
But why did you yell at me if
you were going to do that?

256
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,960
Let's just say a sense of justice.

257
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,050
I thought that was out of style.

258
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,860
I don't really know style.

259
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,350
I knew you were that kind of person.

260
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,360
You bowed to the audience yesterday.

261
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,130
On the afternoon court yesterday.

262
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,230
Rising when the judge is entering or exiting is

263
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,800
is about respecting the law,
not a courtesy to the judge.

264
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,670
But I've heard most judges forget that.

265
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:40,040
But... not you.

266
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,200
I knew you're different.

267
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,540
Do you feel amazing?

268
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,600
Do you feel like a hero?

269
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,450
What?

270
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,060
With that one ruling, how should I put it...

271
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,820
I let a big wad of cash slip.

272
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,850
Let's stop.

273
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,990
If I knew this would happen,
I would've quit the other day.

274
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,060
What?

275
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,340
- Quit?
- I'm leaving now...

276
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,050
so keep working hard.

277
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,490
Keep your sense of justice. Okay?

278
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,920
Fighting!

279
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,800
What are you so happy for high-fiving?

280
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,260
You don't come up when I call for you, don't
answer your phone. Must I chase after you?

281
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,200
Why aren't you bowing?

282
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,280
Who is this?

283
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,000
- Hello, I'm the judicial trainee-
- Why aren't you bowing?

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,520
When would I see you again?
Is bowing really necessary?

285
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,730
Justice!

286
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,530
Hey, where are you going?
Judge Han! Soo Ho!

287
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,710
Soo Ho!

288
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,160
Why are you being so clingy?

289
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,810
I quit being a judge.

290
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,900
Okay, got it, got it.

291
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,490
I'm sorry.

292
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,150
Bring me back the letter of
resignation you turned in last time.

293
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,450
- Letter of resignation?
- Bring it to me, I'll sign it.

294
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,840
- I submitted a letter of resignation?
- It happened three days ago. Why ask?

295
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm really sorry about that time.

296
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,170
[ Letter of resignation ]

297
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,800
- Recruited by a corporation?
- No.

298
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,910
- A law firm?
- No.

299
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,770
- Opening up an office?
- I want to travel.

300
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,470
- Use your vacation days.
- I'm planning to travel for six months to a year.

301
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,370
- Freely.
- Are you crazy?

302
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,440
- I think so.
- Do you have a sponsor?

303
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,050
Do they have something on you?

304
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,250
- Please process my letter of resignation.
- Process?

305
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,950
I'll process it right now.

306
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,910
I shouldn't have ripped it up.

307
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,910
I put the robe on you the day you became a judge.

308
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,190
That's why I fought you,

309
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,500
but I was wrong.

310
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,370
Just because I didn't process
your letter, you delay sentencings,

311
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,790
act out in court,

312
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,640
rule outside guidelines, even refuse to bow!

313
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,600
Were you...

314
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,920
always such a jerk?

315
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,850
Yes.

316
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,280
Get your resignation and come to my office!

317
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,550
I'll process it for real.

318
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,830
What the heck.

319
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,050
Whatever! Figure it out.

320
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,050
I'm sorry. I tried my best.

321
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,260
To call you my son...

322
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,640
You're off the Lee Ho Sung,
Park Hae Na and Ji Chang Soo cases!

323
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,660
I'm sorry...

324
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,770
that I'm your son.

325
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,430
But you were the one...

326
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,140
who dragged this case in.

327
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,100
I just did what you told me to do.

328
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,150
Shut your mouth.

329
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,270
I only followed your orders!

330
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,510
Shut your mouth!

331
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,080
I didn't do anything on my own.

332
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,230
You!

333
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,570
Lee Ho Sung is hospitalized,

334
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,450
and I requested a hold on confinement.

335
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:40,390
Once we finish our petition appeal,

336
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,050
we'll pay bail. He won't go to jail!

337
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,800
Even novice lawyers know how to do that.

338
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,110
I've been following orders

339
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,350
so I've only done things novice lawyers do.

340
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:54,260
So from now on

341
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,950
I'll do my own thing.

342
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,440
You're confident?

343
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,260
Yes.

344
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,790
You'll take responsibility for whatever result?

345
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,720
Yes.

346
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,500
That's why you won't make it.

347
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,150
It doesn't take confidence to
be responsible. It takes power.

348
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,850
Do you have the power to turn this game around?

349
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,390
You don't, so why are you so confident?

350
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,250
Don't smear mud on my face,
my reputation, my authority

351
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,810
and back down quietly!

352
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,040
Add to Breaking News.

353
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,250
It's our top headline so memorize it quickly.

354
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,850
[ Lee Ho Sung receives seven years in prison ]

355
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,850
[ Judge Han Soo Ho ]

356
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,850
A business organization strongly criticized
as an abuse of power of the judicial branch.

357
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,910
Senior legal experts agree this is why

358
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,240
the criminal court is called the cruelty court

359
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,270
and that they should reflect.

360
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:41,300
But netizens are welcoming the sentence
as a sign that the judicial branch is

361
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,450
finally punishing wealthy criminals
instead of letting them off easy.

362
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,190
They have started a petition for the Blue House

363
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,560
asking that the presiding judge
be protected for his decision.

364
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:56,050
We'll connect to the scene at the hospital
where Lee Ho Sung has been hospitalized.

365
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,850
We're here to take you, Your Honor.

366
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,550
Director Choi is waiting for you.

367
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,450
I'm Director Choi Jin Hyun. We've met before.

368
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,610
I apologize for meeting you
here with all the attention.

369
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,410
Apologize with stuff, not words.

370
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,150
Thank you for the trial today.

371
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,430
It's not much, but this is for you.

372
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,140
A big one.

373
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,520
We turned off the black box,

374
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,580
so you can check.

375
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,550
What?

376
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,340
I'll put it back then.

377
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,720
Sure, sure. These, too.

378
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,940
I know we asked you for a firm hand,

379
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,550
but O Sung was so confident

380
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,210
I thought he might get a conditional release.

381
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,520
- Right.
- Actually...

382
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,450
with the recent government-owned
land bidding, we were in a bad spot.

383
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,730
If Lee Ho Sung were to be released
as a nearly innocent person...

384
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,710
it would be hard to change public opinion.

385
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,750
So...

386
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,250
So...

387
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:45,850
Since this is a government-related business,
the corporation image is important.

388
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,520
But you gave him seven years in prison.

389
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,470
Thanks to you, our Han Young Group
is in a great position now.

390
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,330
We'll use this opportunity to beat O Sung

391
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,390
and repay you.

392
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,490
Oh, my...

393
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,690
Wow, you guys really...

394
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,250
You're involving the judicial branch
in the corporate rivalry?

395
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,990
Wow, our country is great!

396
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,150
A country that's good to run
corporations is a good country.

397
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,550
No?

398
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,170
Yes, of course.

399
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,550
But...

400
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,050
Don't you think this is a bit small
for the size of the job?

401
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,130
I'll be frank.

402
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:48,150
We were careful since you have a
prior relationship with Lee Ho Sung.

403
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,050
We should've known when you
delayed Park Hae Na's sentencing.

404
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:58,050
- Park Hae- the idol?
- Yes.

405
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,350
The land bidding evaluation goes for another month.

406
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,730
If you can wrap up the rest of the
trials well, we'll repay you in a big way.

407
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,750
When you say big, how big are you talking about?

408
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,330
I'm bad at sizes, you know.

409
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,310
You can look forward to it.

410
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,550
You make me work hard for it.

411
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:31,850
What do you want me to do
with Chang Soo and Park Hae Na?

412
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,650
Use your best judgment, Your Honor.

413
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,150
Geez...

414
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,890
I hate how you elites talk.

415
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,160
"Best judgment?"

416
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,900
Do humans use their best judgment?

417
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,260
Then human history would have never required laws.

418
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,550
- What I mean is...
- Just say what you mean clearly.

419
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,850
I mean...

420
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,850
Even the Supreme Court Chief Justice makes
backdoor deals. I'm just a lowly judge.

421
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,050
Make it easy for me to interpret.

422
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,780
Just use subject and verb.

423
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,550
Lee Ho Sung messed up
Park Hae Na and Ji Chang Soo.

424
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,770
If you confirm he is guilty,

425
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,100
I'll give you 1 billion won.

426
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,810
If you resign after that,

427
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,950
we'll have a spot for you on our legal team.

428
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,230
Yes. Very...

429
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,710
Very wise suggestion.

430
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,220
A separate gift from the Chairman.

431
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,750
It's your mother's birthday in two weeks, isn't it?

432
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,500
Wow...

433
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,550
To remember my mother's birthday
that I don't even know about.

434
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,190
[ 10 million won ]
Buy her something nice.

435
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,930
Yes.

436
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:24,090
Is he a judge...

437
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,850
or a thug?

438
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,750
Nice.
