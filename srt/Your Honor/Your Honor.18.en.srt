1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,570
He really wants to be a witness in the trial.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,740
I see.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,920
But he said you refused. Why did you do that?

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,830
- Me?
- Yes.

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,450
Why did I refuse that?

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,620
Maybe there was no need for a witness...

7
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,270
is what I'm thinking.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,390
Just take care of it yourself.

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,290
If you think we need him, call him in. If not, don't.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,290
How can I decide that?

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,880
You need to, Your Honor.

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,700
Plus...

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,670
you haven't answered me.

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,110
Answered what?

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,000
That you're not sending me to another judge.

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,530
Sure.

17
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,760
I actually don't even know how to transfer you.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,630
But...

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,170
don't look for me, even if
I suddenly disappear one day.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,850
How is that?

21
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,020
You're saying you're leaving

22
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,970
instead of sending me elsewhere.

23
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,650
Is that right?

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,480
I used to be unwelcome everywhere.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,350
I almost got kicked out of prosecution training,

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,040
and almost got kicked out of defense

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,020
after saying I can't defend evil people.

28
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,570
You're the first one telling me
I'm good at something.

29
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,860
You'll hear that a lot now, wherever you go

30
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,420
even if you're not good.

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,190
Getting validated by one person

32
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,250
feels like everyone is validating you.

33
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,160
Do you know that feeling?

34
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,190
You don't, right?

35
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,310
We're here.

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,600
I need to return your Tupperware.

37
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,380
While you have some tea,
I'll quickly pack them for you.

38
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,000
Kang Ho, have you...

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
really liked someone with your heart?

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,160
Don't, man.

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,170
Bad guys like us...

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
don't deserve to like someone.

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,480
I'll just go.

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,670
So Eun.

45
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,470
Can I ask you something?

46
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,900
If a person likes another person,

47
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,100
do you think they need to be deserving?

48
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,180
What?

49
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,330
If I just liked someone,

50
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,610
do I need to be deserving?

51
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,140
Yes.

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,500
Yes?

53
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,220
I don't know if "deserve" is the right word,

54
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,800
but I think you need to have one thing.

55
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,350
What thing?

56
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,990
Being a really good person.

57
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,040
Who made that kind of law?

58
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,220
I did.

59
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,370
Then, a bad person isn't
allowed to like anyone?

60
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,230
Maybe by liking someone

61
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,890
they could become a good person!

62
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,800
Someone who could change like that

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,480
is not a bad person to begin with.

64
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,330
Keep the Tupperware.

65
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll definitely be back for it later.

66
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,300

67
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,960

73
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,670
[ Sang Cheol Oppa ]

74
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,540
Hey.

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,380
Can I see you?

76
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,380
Next time.

77
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,080
Let's take some time.

78
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,440
How are you feeling?

79
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,840
How did you know?

80
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,000
I heard about it in court.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,510
Are you okay?

82
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,650
Yeah. Maybe I ate something bad.
My stomach hurt. I'm fine.

83
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,590
I'm hanging up.

84
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,590
So Eun, let me say one thing.

85
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,410
This is important.

86
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,100
Don't trust Judge Han Soo Ho so much.

87
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,230
He took a bribe for a trial outcome.

88
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,260
I don't know why you're saying that

89
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,980
but you need to stop.

90
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,840
The judge would never do that.

91
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,420
The fact that you were trained
under that kind of judge

92
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,460
will be a sore spot in your career.

93
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,360
Have you ever cried while studying law?

94
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,350
Have you ever been frustrated?

95
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,090
Have you felt good?

96
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,230
Have you ever

97
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,020
sincerely apologized to someone?

98
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,180
That's not what's important.

99
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,600
It is to me.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,250
But the judge

101
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,150
has shown me all those things.

102
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,390
To me, he's a really good person.

103
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,950
I'm hanging up.

104
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,410
A good person.

105
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,310
A good person.

106
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,690
I'm sorry to keep meeting you late at night.

107
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,670
During the day, there are
reporters and too many eyes.

108
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,410
It's fine with me.

109
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,960
I feel bad for you. You must be tired.

110
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,190
So wouldn't it be nice to finish this up fast?

111
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,120
Does a lawyer close an investigation?

112
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,310
The prosecutor does.

113
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,710
The money you gave to Judge Han Soo Ho.

114
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,580
How much was it exactly?

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,310
A lot.

116
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,800
Adding all of it up...

117
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,620
it should be about half

118
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,830
of what I gave you.

119
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,370
President,

120
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,660
the report we received...

121
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,150
The money you lost intentionally
on the golf course...

122
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,590
12 million won.

123
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,310
Let's just go with that.

124
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,570
I'll wrap things up with the suspension
of an indictment without going to trial.

125
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,990
If you want to end it like that,

126
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,800
you should

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,700
tell me that, too.

128
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,730
Tell you what?

129
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,610
To decide one way or another, I have
to know who started all this.

130
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,710
So I can make a choice.

131
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,240
I told you it was an anonymous report.

132
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,620
Prosecutor Hong,

133
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,970
should I look into it?

134
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,600
Once I start digging up things,

135
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,650
can you handle it?

136
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,300
Sunbaenim,

137
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,860
threatening a prosecutor...

138
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,150
You should save that as your last card, not now.

139
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,600
Leave after you finish eating.

140
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,160
Since you...

141
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,830
scared me today,

142
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,700
I'll interrogate you again tomorrow.

143
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,120
I've never seen you drink this much.

144
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,330
Madam.

145
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,740
Should I fall in love?

146
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,670
What's going on?

147
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,240
I guess I will.

148
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,720
Introduce me to someone. Anyone.

149
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,610
What do you mean, anyone?

150
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,460
The conditions should be met.

151
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,200
Not like that.

152
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,110
Can't I fall in love?

153
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,500
I'd like to experience that.

154
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,280
Falling in love with each other.

155
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,040
If the conditions aren't met,

156
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,980
love that was there can disappear.

157
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,010
Should we stop drinking?

158
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,100
I thought you were upset over your father
being investigated by the Prosecutor's Office.

159
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,670
You're very lonely right now, Lawyer.

160
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,230
I'm just a bit sad

161
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,380
and also a bit angry.

162
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,900
I guess I just want to drink.

163
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,480
Gosh, sorry I made you stop drinking.

164
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,130
Did you hear?

165
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,110
What?

166
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,110
Ohdaeyang law firm's golf ball incident.

167
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,300
It's stifling.

168
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,140
Really?

169
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,560
More stuff keeps coming
up the more they dig.

170
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,960
He used company card to get gift certificates

- What?
- The judge you interviewed.

Let's interview him again
before the news breaks.

177

The star judge turns out to have received
a bribe. That's news, isn't it?

178
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,500
If he didn't? Just as expected of a
star judge. That'd be news, too.

179

Let's work together this time.

committed suicide a few days after.

kneeled in front of the courthouse for
over a month pleading to meet with you.

has dementia spoiled food

so she almost starved to death.

a pillow over her face.

What's that one thing?

308
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,930
National attention was focused on the case.
It was an intense psychological case.

I think the trial moved too swiftly.

310
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,770
The trial was swayed by public opinion?

311

No, not that.

is there any reason for
anyone to have a grudge?

No.

316

I gave him a life sentence.

I wanted to give him the death sentence,

321
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,150
but it was scary for me to
hand down that verdict.

322

It is.

323

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,190
If you come up with the source, Sunbae,

334
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,330
the people's anger will be focused on it.

335
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,650
I think we can make that happen.

336
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,050
Even so, you think the judge will play along?

337
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,230
The judge will hop on the same boat with us.

338
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,110
Here he comes now.

339
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,460
Gathering like this

340
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,410
makes me uncomfortable.

341
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,600
You want to use my trial
to cover up the drug party

342
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,100
thrown by the kids of
politicians and businessmen?

343
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm not saying we want to use it.

344
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,920
Get on the same boat with us.

345
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,590
Let's not do this.

346
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,990
I heard your mother put your
ancestral mountain up for sale.

347
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,990
I'm sure she has her reasons.

348
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:11,440
But you should keep
your father's burial ground.

349
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,700
- Don't say things like that to me.
- Your Honor.

350
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,040
When O Sung is desperately offering his hand,

351
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,010
you should grab it.

352
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,830
If not now,

353
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,090
it will be tough to join the mainstream crowd.

354
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,490
I'll be in charge of my trials.

355
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,980
I'm not asking for something
affecting your ruling.

356
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,390
So that the mood doesn't cool down,

357
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,340
you can progress with the trial swiftly.

358
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:53,300
The Prosecutor's Office made
an additional announcement.

359
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,490
He gave his mom rotten food.

360
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,700
Is that true?

361
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,520
Don't know.

362
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,300
But I think the wording is too harsh.

363
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,020
"The son who fed his mom trash food."

364
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,080
"Since he couldn't starve her
to death, he strangled her."

365
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,690
Feels like the whole world wants to kill him.

366
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,910
Don't you think so?

367
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:20,180
Don't know.

368
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,930
There's something to this, right?

369
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,370
They're trying to cover something up, yes?

370
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,840
How would a judge know about that?

371
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,520
I just rule based on the charges.

372
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,210
When the Prosecutor's Office reveals what
happened, it means there's something to this.

373
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,200
Isn't that right?

374
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,890
Right? There is, huh?

375
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,840
Tell me. Tell me.

376
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,170
Aren't you going to tell me?

377
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,390
Here is the verdict.

378
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,470
Defendant Park Jae Ho.

379
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,530
Death sentence.

380
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,300
Yes.

381
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,580
Judge Han.

382
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,940
You're on the same boat with us now.

383
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,750
Now, now.

384
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,930
To our bright future!

385
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,770
Cheers!

386
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,450
It's all over if you die.

387
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,340
Once the press finds out,
you'll kill yourself anyway.

388
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,190
Wouldn't it be nice to think
of it as us helping you?

389
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,000
[ Park Jae Hyung ]

390
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,680
What about my Soo Ho?

391
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,350
What's going on?

392
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,890
We experienced injustice
and the judge really helped us.

393
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,930
We really want to thank him,
but he won't meet with us.

394
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,110
Gosh, I was wondering.

395
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,130
I worried so much wondering
if it was something bad.

396
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,400
Ma'am, it's linen pajamas.

397
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,810
If you wear them at night, you'll be cool.

398
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:56,450
No, no. I'd get in big trouble if I accept this.

399
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:59,080
It's okay, ma'am. This is very cheap.

400
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,060
I'll get in trouble with my son.
I'll accept the gesture, though.

401
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,070
I can't be helpful as his mom, but at least
I shouldn't cause any problems.

402
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,540
But ma'am...

403
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,490
I saw the judge near the courthouse before.

404
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,410
But he didn't recognize me.

405
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,040
He looked just like him.

406
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,920
My Kang Ho?

407
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,530
Kang Ho...

408
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,480
His twin brother.

409
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,530
I see.

410
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,860
Our lawyer...

411
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,180
said the judge is an only child.

412
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,440
We registered my younger son under

413
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,680
a relative who didn't have a son.

414
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,510
It's like that only on paper. They're
both my sons whom I raised myself.

415
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,560
Why did Kang Ho go to the courthouse?

416
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,480
It's the recording from the
security camera on that day.

417
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,090
Giving you something like
this in this manner is

418
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,960
against our policy.

419
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,560
Geez, I'm a judge.

420
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,200
I determine whether
this is breaking protocol.

421
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,250
We never violate our policy,

422
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,670
but I'm giving it to you
because you're a judge.

423
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,530
You'll be blessed.

424
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,850
How did you endure?

425
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,950
What?

426
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,020
After handing down so many
rulings to so many people...

427
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,860
I don't know how you live with that burden.

428
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,450
You can't give a harsher
verdict even if you want to.

429
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,840
And I'm sure you couldn't release
the person even if you wanted to.

430
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,270
I'm sure sometimes you had
to give rulings like yesterday's.

431
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,240
How did you endure all that?

432
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,740
Just think of it as making money.

433
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,420
Just think of it as making a living.

434
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,080
He walked out with food trash.

435
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,230
And he didn't come home all night.

436
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
I came home.

437
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,320
Where are you?

438
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,090
Han Soo Ho.

439
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,120
Just think of it as making money.

440
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,950
Just think of it as making a living.

441
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,100
You arrogant bastard.

442
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:04,570
♫  I’m closing my eyes,
so the night grows white ♫

443
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:10,840
♫  With the night, I’m going to you ♫

444
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,550
♫  In my heart full of sadness ♫

445
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:24,220
♫  If you shine a warm light ♫

446
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,400
♫ I want to dream again  ♫
