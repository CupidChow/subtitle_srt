1
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,100
Honorable Chairman

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,320
and members of the
Disciplinary Committee, hello.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,500
My name is Song So Eun, a judicial
trainee under the mentorship

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,330
of Judge Han Soo Ho of the criminal branch.

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,360
I heard Judge Han was summoned
to this disciplinary hearing.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,810
Judge Han I know is a warmer
judge than anyone I know.

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,710
If a judge, through interpretation,
fills in the gaps of the law

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,010
Han Soo Ho goes one step further to
fill the pain of those going through the trial

9
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,240
and endeavors to heal them.

10
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,760
The Judge Han Soo Ho I saw was
more passionate than anyone else.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,200
He even takes off his robe
and runs to the crime scene

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,840
to check the authenticity of the petition.

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,080
The Han Soo Ho I saw is more
humble than anyone I know.

14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,920
After every trial, he bows to the audience.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,340
He might be on a high legal pedestal,

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,680
but he lowers himself to show
that laws are not above people.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,590
And the Judge Han Soo Ho I saw...

18
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,930
is a good person.

19
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,970
Okay.

20
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,640
I'm out of here.

21
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,850
Goodbye,

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,170
Han Soo Ho, you bastard.

23
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,180
I'm leaving.

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
Dang it.

25
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,240
Why is my mom here?

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,660
Soo Ho.

27
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,380
Why are you at your hyung's house?

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,660
Where is Soo Ho?

29
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,470
Soo Ho! Soo Ho!

30
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,970
Soo Ho isn't here.

31
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,620
He's on a business trip.

32
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,440
- Where?
- How would I know?

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,260
Why are you in Seoul?

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,960
Today's the ancestral rite for
your grandfather in Bangbaedong.

35
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,100
But I can't reach your older brother's phone.

36
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,560
I keep calling, but it says
I have the wrong number.

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,690
I'm so worried, I can't just stay still.

38
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,160
He must have changed his number.
He'll tell you later.

39
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,830
What are you doing in his house?

40
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,960
I was going to stay a night,
but I'm leaving since he's not here.

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,780
What's this bag?

42
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,470
- Are you stealing something?
- No!

43
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,030
Let me see what you swiped from him.

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,340
Don't!

45
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,590
- Let me see it.
- Seriously?

46
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,430
What is this, stop and frisk?
Are you the police?

47
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,220
These clothes are your brother's, right?

48
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,490
Stay the night, all right?

49
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,530
I'll be home in a few days.

50
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,280
Why are you running away?
Where are you going?

51
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,730
Mom,

52
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,150
if I open a nice restaurant,

53
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,350
do you want to run it with me?

54
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,910
I'll be the chef, and you can be the manager.

55
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,140
I'll pay you a lot.

56
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,550
You're in trouble again, right?

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,700
Bring a resume and a cover letter
and your salary requirement.

58
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,500
Where are you going this late, Kang Ho?

59
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,800
Mom's here, stay the night!

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,410
Hey! Han Kang Ho!

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,360
I don't have your number, so I'm
going home without calling you.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,830
From Song So Eun.

63
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,590
Hello?

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,730
Oppa?

65
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,930
You're not busy?

66
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,010
How come you're here during work hours?

67
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,650
You don't have a trial?

68
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,160
No.

69
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,100
You're resigning?

70
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,530
Really?

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,160
How much did you get?

72
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,720
You really did get paid.

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,350
I'm going to pay it back.

74
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,490
That's weak for a judge's explanation.

75
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:02,130
Sounds like a politician's go-to comment.

76
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,850
"It wasn't a bribe. It was a loan.
I'll be paying it back."

77
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,120
I told them I'd be paying it back.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,630
I was going to.

79
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,100
The golf ball incident is about to blow up
as a bribery scandal of the judicial branch.

80
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,710
There is a bribery list circulating
amongst reporters.

81
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,580
Your name is on it.

82
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,620
Eun.

83
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,400
If it's reported, I have to say your name on air.

84
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,050
What am I going to do?

85
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,070
When I first met you, I thought...

86
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:36,920
A woman like me should
at least date a judge.

87
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,960
But...

88
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,130
while I was dating you, my pride
was severely hurt.

89
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,890
The door was shut so hard.

90
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,920
I want to go in, but you won't open it.

91
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,420
How great could you be?

92
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,230
I wanted to go inside and mess things up.

93
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,850
But once I finally entered,

94
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,660
I saw nothing.

95
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,430
You're an empty person.

96
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,330
I should have left you then, but I couldn't.

97
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,910
I wanted to fill you.

98
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,790
I know.

99
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,810
No.

100
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,130
You don't know

101
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,130
what it feels like to completely
fill another person,

102
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,760
what it feels like to mean
something to someone else.

103
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,100
If you feel the same way,

104
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,690
pay that money back.

105
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,910
I will.

106
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,730
Ask me again after you pay them back

107
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,310
If you deserve to be a boyfriend or a judge.

108
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,110
I'll give you my answer then.

109
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,110
I have to run.

110
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,800
I have a meeting.

111
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,980
And...

112
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,660
don't be mad if I utter your name.

113
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:57,840
I summarized the main points
of the Lee Soon Cheol case.

114
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,710
But the more I think about it,
the more unfair it seems.

115
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,770
I'm sorry about yesterday.

116
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,930
Something came up, and I couldn't call.

117
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,560
You waited long, right?

118
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,010
It's okay. I just worked and went home.

119
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,000
But...

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,670
Is your phone not working?

121
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,970
I have a separate phone.

122
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,480
My real number...

123
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,590
Oh, you do?

124
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:35,500
Can I have it?

125
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,650
Later.

126
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,320
Let's have dinner tonight.

127
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,590
Not soju or beer, but a grand meal.

128
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
You're not going to run away again?

129
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,000
No reason to anymore.

130
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,240
It's all over.

131
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,040
What is?

132
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,880
Oh, sorry.

133
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,730
[ President Sa ]

134
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,500
Hello, Mr. Sa.

135
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,580
What?

136
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,160
One second, one second.

137
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,340
Yes.

138
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,520
Yes, I'm writing it down. One second.

139
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,080
Oh, yes.

140
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,240
Kim...

141
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,580
Yes.

142
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,160
Yes, thank you.

143
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,370
Your Honor, can I...

144
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,660
Can I leave early today?

145
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,150
Did something happen?

146
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,130
Um...

147
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,690
I...

148
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,030
No. It's nothing, but...

149
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,520
I...

150
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,590
So Eun!

151
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,120
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,700
I have to leave early, thank you.

153
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,510
Aigoo, I'm the best at
finding missing people.

154
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,120
The person who sold an
I.D. card to someone

155
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
who looks like your sister

156
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,760
finally contacted me.

157
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,660
[ Gimpo, Hwangung Mi's Club, Strawberry ]
In downtown Gimpo,

158
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,300
there's a club called Hwangung Mi's.

159
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,290
It's a nightclub.

160
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,630
Strawberry. She's going
by the name Strawberry.

161
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,680
She's registered as a foreigner from Harbin.

162
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,470
That's what they said.

163

[ Gimpo, Hwangung Mi's Club, Strawberry ]

164
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,890
I heard the gist from the girls.

165
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,210
- You're looking for your sister?
- Yes.

166
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,820
Her real name is Song Ji Yeon.

167
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,960
She's working here as a
foreigner from Harbin, I heard.

168
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,990
Daughters who left home.

169
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,860
Runaway sisters.

170
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,420
In this world,

171
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,520
that's a tale as old as time.

172
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,730
I don't need a sob story.

173
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,400
Go home.

174
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,100
I heard she goes by Strawberry.

175
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,980
An employee said she does work here.

176
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,900
- Please just call her.
- I...

177
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,470
have a responsibility to protect my girls.

178
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,520
How bad was it

179
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,170
that they left their families
to work here? No,

180
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,000
do you think they want

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,510
their families to know they work here?

182
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,330
Call her, please.

183
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,700
If you want money, I'll give you any amount.

184
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,370
I make a lot of money, lady.

185
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,520
Leave while I'm asking nicely.

186
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,930
Please, I'm begging you.

187
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,340
I...

188
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,240
have been looking for her for seven years.

189
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,410
You don't understand.

190
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,910
I hear many stories like that, I said.

191
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,810
I work in the courthouse.

192
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,600
If I need to,

193
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,440
I can take every legal measure possible.

194
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,170
Get out!

195
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,180
Let me go, I said!

196
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,450
Let go!

197
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,560
Rude b****, you want to talk about law?

198
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,320
Come here!

199
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,190
No, no, please!

200
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,940
You think I don't know any
judges and prosecutors?

201
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,000
Come here!

202
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,600
- Damn it!
- Hey!

203
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,100
- Who are you?
- Me? I'm a thug.

204
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,010
Bastard!

205
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,450
Are you okay?

206
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,650
How did you get here?

207
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,350
Send Strawberry to room number five.

208
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,680
Get them out!

209
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,500
Get her over here now.

210
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,630
She'll be right here.

211
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,460
When you leave

212
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,570
I'll walk you out, Your Honor.

213
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,050
You shouldn't come to
a place like this alone.

214
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,400
Thank you.

215
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,710
Drink.

216
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,480
I...

217
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,620
can be alone now.

218
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,880
Okay.

219
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,800
I'll wait for you at the entrance.

220
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,390
My real number.

221
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:01,140
Call me if anything happens.

222
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,890
You are looking for me?

223
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,650
I'm...

224
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,840
from Harbin.

225
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,870
You have...

226
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,720
news of my family?

227
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,430
I came to Korea alone.

228
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,740
My family was supposed to follow,

229
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,490
but I have no news of them.

230
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,780
My sister...

231
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,450
was sexually assaulted.

232
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,480
I thought he would obviously
be punished. But...

233
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,090
as the trial progressed, things got stranger.

234
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,960
They portrayed my sister as
a vixen who tried to seduce

235
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,090
a med student, failed and tried
to get settlement money.

236
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,680
She tried to kill herself, failed, and left home.

237
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,690
My parents emigrated abroad.

238
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,940
That happened to my family.

239
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,150
But do you know what punishment he got?

240
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,600
A 1.5 million won fine.

241
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,900
He had a team of six lawyers.

242
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,100
Must be from a wealthy family.

243
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,350
Yes.

244
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,350
The son of the famous
CEO of the Choi Hospital,

245
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,030
Choi Min Gook.

246
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,050
You have too much pride.

247
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,340
Dr. Choi Min Gook, the heir
to the Choi Hospital?

248
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,250
He's famous.

249
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:32,760
Now he's a humanitarian
who volunteers all the time.

250
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,680
Everyone is living well,

251
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,410
but where's my sister and what's she doing?

252
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,120
I tried to forget it all,

253
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,890
but I can't forget.

254
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,860
It feels so vivid.

255
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,810
I've been looking for seven years.

256
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,490
I'll find her someday.
I'll see her again someday.

257
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,310
Do you get it now?

258
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,790
How cruel the word "someday" can be.

259
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,120
When I was waiting for my sister by myself,

260
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,220
I prayed that it would be her.

261
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,880
And also wished it wouldn't be her.

262
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,970
Stop drinking.

263
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,270
♫ I've lost myself ♫

264
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:54,170
♫ in a thick fog ♫

265
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,570
Should we take a walk?

266
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:00,130
I'm sorry to show an ugly side of me.

267
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,310
But how did you find me?

268
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,740
♫  In the night sky ♫

269
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,510
Actually, I...

270
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,940
was going to quit today.

271
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,010
Stop joking.

272
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,720
Really.

273
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,380
You promised me.

274
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,260
A guy like me, promise?

275
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,620
I wanted to have dinner
with you one last time,

276
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,870
like the Last Supper.

277
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,610
It's good we didn't, then.

278
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,400
Sure.

279
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,300
It's good.

280
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:45,900
♫ In my heart with so much pain ♫

281
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,360
♫ with your warm light ♫

282
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,960
I'll be in tomorrow.

283
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,740
We need to fight on again.

284
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,260
♫ Shine on me ♫

285
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,050
♫ I close my eyes ♫

286
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,130
Let's go.

287
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,980
♫ Until the night turns white ♫

288
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,060
♫ I'm coming to you in the pouring rain ♫

289
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,590
♫ Shine on me ♫

290
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,450
How much did he put down?

291
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,000
He must have told you.

292
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,220
I don't know. I only heard he's bringing it.

293
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,480
So why did you call us here?

294
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,140
Hey, from Soo Ho's point of
view, we need to clear the air.

295
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,550
Everyone's awkward right now.

296
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,030
Is he going to request a couple
billion won or something?

297
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,720
He knows the rules of this world.

298
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,630
I'm guessing under 1.5 or 2 billion.

299
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,150
You never know.

300
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,220
People who grow up poor

301
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,730
have a beggar complex.

302
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,320
Friends!

303
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,180
Have you had breakfast?

304
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,970
Why aren't you eating?

305
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,960
What are you doing? Since
when do we eat stuff like this?

306
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,690
Why? It's delicious.

307
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,440
You brought the check, right?

308
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,250
Of course I did.

309
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,600
With this, I'll really get the amount I wrote?

310
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,070
Of course.

311
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,060
Cash or transfer?

312
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,230
However you want.

313
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,370
- Bastard.
- Geez.

314
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,600
That's not for the recipient to
decide. The giver is the king.

315
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,590
How much did you put?

316
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,220
Don't be surprised.

317
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,590
I knew you'd be surprised.

318
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,560
Hey, Han Soo Ho!

319
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,600
[ 23,000 won ]

320
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,200
23,000 won? Is that right?

321
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,270
Yeah.

322
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,210
Soondae, spicy rice cakes,
two tempura. 23,000 won.

323
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,990
It was 25,000, but I asked for
2,000 off to not burden you.

324
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,920
If you don't have cash, transfer please!

325
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,520
Are you joking right now?

326
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,490
Isn't it a joke to hand a judge a blank check?

327
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,550
Hey!

328
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,040
Who do you think you are?

329
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,780
Why are you doing this?

330
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,770
Because...

331
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,860
I don't like you guys.

332
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,860
What, a sense of justice or something?

333
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,220
Justice? That's been long out of style.

334
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,050
I don't know anything like that.

335
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,370
I'll say it again.

336
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,390
You.

337
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,100
You.

338
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,410
You.

339
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,100
You.

340
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,250
I really don't like you guys.

341
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,110
You guys are so annoying.

342
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,340
I have to win.

343
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,130
I want to hang out, but I have to
run to my disciplinary hearing.

344
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,730
You guys can clean this up, right? Later.

345
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,670
I'm a fan.

346
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,270
See you in court.

347
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,870
So pretty.

348
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,010
Move it!

349
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,160
What's going on?

350
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,300
I'm not getting executed.

351
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,360
I'm going to win and come back.

352
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,090
The afternoon trials...

353
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,830
I've postponed them.

354
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,490
Section Leader Jo, you're the best!

355
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,310
Off to my hearing!

356
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,540
Your Honor, wait!

357
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,920
Yes, what's up?

358
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,140
Your tie.

359
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,010
What about my tie?

360
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,660
You're being called in for
not maintaining your dignity.

361
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,750
You should maintain your dignity.

362
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,990
I'll be back.

363
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,320
Want to come with me?

364
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,770
Just to the waiting room.

365
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,040
Yes.

366
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,590
Let's go.

367
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:09,940
♫ We might be giving each
other pain, living just like now ♫

368
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:17,380
♫  Burying your sadness in
a grave, saying I'm okay ♫

369
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,460
♫ Someday, to me, to you ♫

370
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:31,030
♫ the morning will come back... ♫
