1
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,490
Hello, Your Honor.

2
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,810
My name is Kim Cho Won.

3
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,380
I have visual impairment.

4
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,900
And my dream is to become a writer.

5
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,430
I have never seen the sunset

6
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,940
nor the stars sparkling...

7
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,540
I've never even seen flowers dancing in the wind.

8
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,560
People ask me how I'll be able to portray the world.

9
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,450
But I can hear the sounds of the world so clearly.

10
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,420
When I was little, I remember waking
up from thunder and crying.

11
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:42,500
Mom took me outside while I was crying.

12
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,050
Even though I cried to her saying I was scared,

13
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,610
my mom wouldn't listen to me.

14
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,900
Not long ago, I read a book.

15
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,000
There was a line that said only
God can judge people.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,560
Your Honor, you get to judge people.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,140
You're sitting at the closest place to God.

18
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,550
I plead with you.

19
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,120
Please punish my mom.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,500
Let her know how wrong she is.

21
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,610
Please tell her in my place, Your Honor.

22
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,680
Hello.

23
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,880
- Drink this.
- Thank you!

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,720
Here you go.

25
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,150
Here you go.

26
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,380
- Thank you.
- Sure.

27
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,990
Is there some good news?

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,210
Yes, a little.

29
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,360
- I think something bad happened to the judge.
- What?

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,490
What is it?

31
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,950
I'm not sure, but he's in a bad mood.

32
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,410
I don't know what happened, but he reeks of alcohol.

33
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,200
If we laugh out loud and be so upbeat,

34
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,050
I'm afraid he'd be upset.

35
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,270
- I'm letting you know in advance.
- Okay.

36
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,470
- Thank you for the drink.
- Sure.

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,650
- So Eun!
- Yes?

38
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,530
I'm sorry. Are you mad?

39
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,730
No...

40
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,220
- You look angry.
- I'm not.

41
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,130
You couldn't go home because of me.

42
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,140
I couldn't help it.

43
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,800
I didn't know your family contact info.

44
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,820
And to call the police...

45
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,470
I thought they'd say a legal official is drunk...

46
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,610
Didn't want to start a scandal.

47
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,830
Should've just thrown me out.

48
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,460
How could I?

49
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,780
See? See?

50
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,950
I told her to watch out. I knew she'd get in trouble.

51
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,640
You have to be quick-witted than
be capable in the working world.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,130
She doesn't know that.

53
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,410
Everyone, watch out.

54
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,810
Don't talk to the judge needlessly.

55
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,550
Section Leader Jo.

56
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,970
Don't talk to me needlessly either.

57
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,250
Tell the judge it's time for the courtroom.

58
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,010
- What? Me?
- Yes, you.

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,960
Did I do anything wrong?

60
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,360
Aside from the fact that you
came to my house drunk...

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,610
You didn't do anything wrong.

62
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
I messed up.

63
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,100
- I'm so sorry!
- It's okay.

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,920
- I said I'm so sorry.
- It's really okay.

65
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,660
Then smile!

66
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,670
That way I'd be fooled into
thinking that you forgave me.

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
Your Honor.

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,600
Mr. Jang Jung Soo left.

69
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,250
Who went where?

70
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,670
The family of drunk driving case victim.

71
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,640
The man who was protesting in front of the court.

72
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,390
Oh, him.

73
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,600
The Talmud...

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,160
He quit his protest and went home.

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,910
Well...

76
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,600
it's hot, you know...

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,380
He'll get a sunburn...

78
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,230
Yes.

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,170
- Your Honor, it's time for the trial.
- Yes.

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,100
Thanks for not throwing me out.

81
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,460
Everyone...

82
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,000
threw me out.

83
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,970
You're the only person who didn't, So Eun.

84
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,100
Next time, I'll buy a nice gift...

85
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,070
and visit you properly.

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,680
Let's go! We have to do trials to make money!

87
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,770
Why is everyone so down?

88
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,670
Let's be happy! Fighting!

89
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,310
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,700
Fighting! Yay!

91
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,200
He's weird.

92
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,900
Is he bipolar?

93
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,240
Park Hae Na and Ji Chang Soo.

94
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,000
- Yes?
- Yes?

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,210
Nothing's changed.

96
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,600
You guys just say...

97
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,080
what we said during the investigation.

98
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,990
When is the trial over?

99
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,570
Is the trial too boring for you?

100
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,060
Of course.

101
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,970
Then do a good job.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,500
Don't fall for leading questions
like last time and be stupid!

103
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,240
Just don't use your head.

104
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,600
Understand?

105
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,780
Straighten your hair.

106
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:36,120
You drank alone at a nightclub

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
and fell asleep at the hotel, right?

108
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,730
You didn't come out even after the check out time.

109
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,290
And the security went up.

110
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,890
And you were unconscious.

111
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,080
Is that right?

112
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,590
Yes.

113
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,240
You checked out at the ER.

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,570
You were tested positive for using drugs.

115
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,590
Is this all true?

116
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,950
Yes.

117
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,290
Park Hae Na.

118
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,430
I told you I'm your fan, right?

119
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,700
Yes.

120
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,620
A celebrity...

121
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,210
can act all happy, not happy,

122
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,080
and pretend anything.

123
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,350
But...

124
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,710
you shouldn't act in front of your fan.

125
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,150
Your fan is...

126
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,380
someone who cheers you on genuinely.

127
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,540
Do you understand?

128
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,370
Yes.

129
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,460
Is everything you said...

130
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,340
true?

131
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,180
You understand what I'm telling you, right?

132
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,030
No, I was with Oppa and his friends last night...

133
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,540
We drank together and a fight started.

134
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,990
I'll tell you again.

135
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:57,770
Some unknown person in the restroom

136
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,820
gave you some medicine to sober up.

137
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,510
You took that and went up to the hotel room alone.

138
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,180
When you didn't come out past the check out time,

139
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,050
the hotel security showed up.

140
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,920
Is that what Oppa is telling me to say?

141
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,980
He won't get me out?

142
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,810
- This is so wrong.
- Park Hae Na.

143
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,650
You want to make commercials

144
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,660
and should start acting again, right?

145
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,700
Everything is in the news already.

146
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,350
You think you can make a comeback
without someone's help later?

147
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,180
Look me in the eye.

148
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,250
You were alone last night.

149
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,430
And you took the drug by yourself.

150
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,420
Right?

151
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,410
Yes...

152
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,400
Everything is true.

153
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,040
- Why don't you seize and search her cell phone?
- We did.

154
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
You didn't submit as evidence.

155
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,620
- There's no evidence to submit.
- What?

156
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,270
At the last hearing,

157
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,030
you brought up her relationship with Lee Ho Sung.

158
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:10,560
After searching through Park Hae Na's phone,

159
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,970
calls, texts, messenger records with Lee Ho Sung

160
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,580
were not found at all.

161
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,500
- So you won't submit as evidence?
- Yes!

162
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,070
There is no evidence to submit.

163
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,390
Your Honor.

164
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,550
Due to a long duration of this trial,

165
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,680
the defendant is suffering from severe depression.

166
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,140
However, considering that she's
deeply remorseful for using drugs

167
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,900
she has refused any type of medicine

168
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,750
and is suffering every day.

169
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,670
In consideration of the defendant's health,

170
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,080
to expedite this trial,

171
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,920
I plead for your generous consideration.

172
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
I will submit medical records
from her psychiatrist and

173
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,570
the doctor's opinion as our reference material.

174
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,500
Darn...

175
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,000
The prosecutor won't even submit the evidence...

176
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,410
and the lawyer wants me to end the trial fast.

177
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,120
You already wrote the ruling on this.

178
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,270
Do you have a reason for a retrial?

179
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,930
How should I say this...

180
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,230
My conscience?

181
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,030
Justice?

182
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,630
But isn't this case really strange?

183
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,350
Well, I'm not sure. It's just...

184
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,040
It's just what?

185
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,690
You may be misunderstood as dragging

186
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,910
a trial without any issues at hand.

187
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,940
What do you mean no issues?
Everything about it is weird.

188
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,380
The defendant and victim's testimonies match.

189
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,410
And it's not like the defendant
changed her testimony in the courtroom.

190
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,590
If you tell me the issue at hand,

191
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,400
- I'll observe and learn.
- The main issue.

192
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,920
I have to come up with one.

193
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,420
Let's go.

194
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,200
Everyone stand.

195
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
Hi.

196
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Everyone be seated.

197
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,300
Ji Chang Soo.

198
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,400
You're a waiter at a nightclub?

199
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,180
Yes.

200
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,610
Please describe what happened.

201
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,300
I...

202
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,820
refilled some ice for customers in a room.

203
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,020
The account manager Min Goo Nam of our nightclub

204
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,840
asked for me.

205
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,570
He usually picks on me for no reason.

206
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,720
Making an issue out of my attitude and attire,

207
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,760
he was bugging me.

208
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,190
I had some drinks that the customers had offered me.

209
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,390
I couldn't control my drink

210
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,560
and became violent.

211
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,100
The victim decided to settle.

212
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,890
And the compensation is...

213
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,240
Wow, you paid a lot!

214
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,600
- Are you rich?
- No, I'm not.

215
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,950
Wow, he beat him up like that

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,500
and get paid this much. I wish I'd get beat up, too.

217
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,300
Do you usually fight a lot?

218
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,400
No, I don't.

219
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,810
Are you a good fighter?

220
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,800
No, I'm not.

221
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,770
From the rumors I heard about that club...

222
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,290
I believe the victim Min Goo Nam
used to be a judo athlete.

223
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,330
If you can beat up a judo athlete,

224
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
doesn't that make you a great fighter?

225
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,340
I do...

226
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,680
a little.

227
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,150
You good?

228
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,350
I'm good.

229
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:37,410
- You said you're not usually violent.
- Right.

230
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,610
If you're not usually violent, how
would you know you're a good fighter?

231
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,520
Tell me honestly!

232
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,580
You usually do go around fighting, huh?

233
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Yes.

234
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,100
Your Honor!

235
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,660
What?

236
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,600
Is there a law that says the judge
can't get out of his seat?

237
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
- No, there isn't.
- Fine then.

238
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,100
You fought with a hand like this?

239
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,400
It's not a hand of a fighter.

240
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,650
You don't know how to fight, right?

241
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,230
- I...
- You can't.

242
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,900
I'm not very good.

243
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
You said you were good earlier.

244
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,900
I'm not sure.

245
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,540
You changed your testimony.

246
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,000
Bring out the victim Min Goo Nam as a witness.

247
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,420
Summarizing the situation, Min Goo Nam

248
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,800
couldn't fight back at an unexpected attack.

249
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,660
The defendant and victim's testimonies match.

250
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,420
So, I shouldn't call him?

251
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,850
Can't the judge call for a witness?

252
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,170
Can't I?

253
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Yes.

254
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,570
I believe that it is possible to
use your direct authority.

255
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,400
Bring in the witness.

256
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,680
We'll continue next week!

257
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,620
The court is adjourned!

258
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,540
Everyone, please stand...

259
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,630
I don't know since I haven't
stood in court for a while.

260
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,800
- Does a judge normally run around like that?
- No.

261
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
It's up to the judge though.

262
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,860
Whether one can fight or not...

263
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,700
- does that count as reversing his statement?
- It doesn't.

264
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,500
That also is up to the judge.

265
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,760
A hoobae far down the chain

266
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,970
runs all over just because he's the judge.

267
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,510
From what I've heard,

268
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,540
he changed drastically after
submitting his resignation.

269
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,500
I heard he's resisting the
request for his resignation.

270
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,250
I'll take care of it.

271
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:42,590
In any case, he'll end up leaving
one day all of a sudden.

272
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,330
Hurry up and do it.

273
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,100
I'm extremely hot.

274
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,700
I'm sorry.

275
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,930
- I messed up the trial, huh?
- Yes.

276
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,460
What do I do?

277
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,650
A person can't defend himself
when he's attacked so suddenly.

278
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,250
Mr. Min will testify to that.

279
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,040
But you know...

280
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,110
I received a check for turning
over the drugs that night.

281
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,290
Thank you! Have a nice time!

282
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:19,750
Lee Ho Sung didn't give that to you.

283
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,810
They were from General Managers
Choi Byun Hun and Choi Min Gook.

284
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,590
That's right, but everyone used the drugs.

285
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,180
Ho Sung...

286
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,730
Hae Na...

287
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,260
Hyung Hun.

288
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,550
Here we go.

289
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,830
You completely get stoned even with one pill.

290
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,040
I think they took a lot of it.

291
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,290
He was out of his mind when he beat me up.

292
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,990
Are you crazy?

293
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,430
Stop!

294
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,300
- What's going on?
- What the heck!

295
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,570
If my boss didn't stop him,

296
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,300
I could be dead.

297
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,580
Why are you telling me that now?

298
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,250
I'm worried.

299
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,780
I hear you receive bigger
punishment if you lie in court.

300
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,700
What if I get caught later?

301
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,900
If you change your testimony now,
you'll be tried for selling drugs.

302
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,400
You know which crime has
more severe sentencing, right?

303
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,900
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm so scared and worried.

305
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,700
The judge may be suspicious,
but can't investigate.

306
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,200
Even if the judge knows everything,

307
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,100
it's useless if there's no evidence.
That's what trial is.

308
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,720
Okay, shall we go?

309
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,170
I'll leave in a minute.

310
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,330
I'll take care of everything,

311
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,730
so don't worry.

312
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,780
Excuse me,

313
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,560
may I ask you a question?

314
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,820
Sure.

315
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,940
You know how you stood
up from the judge seat?

316
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,550
Why did you do that?

317
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,800
I had to check Ji Chang Soo's hand.

318
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,220
Fighters have different hands.

319
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,580
But usually if there's something
you want to check,

320
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,840
you call them to the bench.
You don't actually go over yourself.

321
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,340
I've watched quite a few trials as a student.

322
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,850
But I've never seen anything like that before.

323
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,700
I thought there was no law against it.

324
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Why? Was it weird?

325
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
No.

326
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,300
You were cool.

327
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,630
The judges always sit high up.

328
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:31,340
For the first time, I saw a judge
come down to the level.

329
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,500
Oh... there's a letter and a
petition addressed to you.

330
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,110
Should I put this on your desk...

331
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,480
or should I organize them
according to the category?

332
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,600
- So Eun...
- Yes?

333
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,000
You read it and consider the
