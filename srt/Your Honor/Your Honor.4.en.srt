2

to put food in your mouths.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,870
- Yes, we're always grateful.
- Whose work is that?

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,850
Hey, you guys.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,570
How much did you make from my case?

6
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,870
5 billion won plus bonus, Director.

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,070
Come here.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,670
I'm the managing director plus CEO, call me CEO.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,980
Don't be rude and go call me a director.

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,840
Yes, CEO.

11
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,970
Damn it.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,390
If I gave you 5 billion won,

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,360
you need to tell me what your plan is.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,720
Do I have to ask you, please do this?

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,990
I even got the Prosecutors' Office onboard.

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,430
You can't handle one judge?

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,500
Judge Han Soo Ho isn't even a stranger to me.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,470
I saw him today.

19
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,960
You are so good at your job.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,380
You saw him finally, two days before the trial?

21
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,640
I've been seeing him, keeping it up.

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,170
- I got a final answer today.
- What final answer?

23
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,990
He understands the Group's position.

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,500
Oh, man!

25
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,900
Rude newbie lawyer.

26
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,920
Hey.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,330
Sit up straight!

28
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,710
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,070
So that was the final answer?

30
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,590
I'll...

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,210
get an assault record.

32
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,100
I'll be the subject of controversy
in the new administration.

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,610
The press will be so excited to talk.

34
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,870
Citizen ants...

35
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,070
will type away on the Blue House website.

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,290
What a great picture!

37
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,150
You'll get a good verdict.

What does your father do?

43
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,870
- He's a professor.
- Aigoo.

44
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,770
Everyone is struggling so much.

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,870
Lower your head, dude.

46
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,630
Be humble.

47
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,910
Our CEO...

48
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,680
You're so rough on these newbies tonight.

49
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,680
Master, enough with the whip, give them some carrots.

50
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,110
Noona, are you going to rat me out to my dad?

51
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,870
Hey!

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,270
Now...

The ace of the Law Firm Ohdaeyang.

I'll give you extra cash for the meal.

Please take good care of my case.

57
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,960
Probation?

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,110
Is it a crime to hit someone
who wasn't following my orders?

59
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,470
A fine?

60
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,970
It pains me to pay you all, let alone the country.

61

You know what I mean?

62
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,730
Not guilty.

63
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,410
Or...

64
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,990
conditional release.

Let's get this done, huh?

68
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,230
Do you know about the Lee Ho Sung case?

69
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,140
At first, it was "serious assault."

70
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,140
Then, "violation of laws concerning the assault."

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,990
Finally, "injury." They changed the charges twice.

72
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,450
Yes, it was a typical "let him off easy" investigation.

73
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,670
That's what the news said.

74
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,070
I think that's the issue.

75
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,230
I agree.

76
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,190
I knew I could talk to you.

77
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,710
Honestly, it's not a crime to be rich.

78
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,300
They make our cars, our phones, run our internet.

79
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,600
Build our markets, fly our planes.
How grateful are we?

80
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,320
But whenever a rich person gets into trouble,

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,290
everyone goes nuts.

82
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,980
It's all just jealousy.

83
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,150
They're well off, so they're jealous and want to hate.

84
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,410
If you asked those people,

85
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,280
would you like to be rich?
Do you think anyone would say no?

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,550
I...

87
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,340
meant that the editing of the
charges was the problem.

88
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,790
That's what I'm saying!

89
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,710
During the investigation, they saw he was innocent.

90
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,760
We thought he was a bad guy, but he's not.

91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,270
That's why the charges were changed.

92
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,370
Why is that "let him off easy?" Huh?

93
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,270
That's reverse discrimination against rich people!

94
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,470
Sure.

95
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,620
The trial is the day after tomorrow,

96
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,580
so taking this into account

97
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,490
write up a ruling.

98
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,270
Me?

99
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,170
You haven't done it before?

100
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,100
I... did during class.

101
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,580
But it's a high profile case, is that okay?

102
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,260
It's high profile,

103
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,470
but it's a simple injury case.

104
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,140
But still... for me to practice, it's a big one.

105
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,740
All are equal under the law.

106
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,320
Are you reverse discriminating against the rich?

107
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,730
No. It's not that.

108
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,160
Write it.

109
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,200
Make the exemptions clear,

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,210
and insert the extenuating
circumstances. Conditional release.

111
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,710
Conditional release?

112
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,260
That's essentially the same as not guilty.

113
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,080
But it's not a not guilty verdict.

114
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,320
Let's do this.

115
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm not a judge.

116
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,580
But as a judicial trainee learning under a judge,

117
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,370
write something that doesn't go against
the law and its definitions, right?

118
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,690
Correct.

119
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,880
According to the law and your
conscience, conditional release.

120
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,050
I'll take that into account.

Wait, wait!

171
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,210
Hey!

172
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,270
It's okay. Let's go to the hospital.

173
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,970
Don't.

174
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,570
Get him!

175
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,870
Han Soo Ho!

176
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm going to find you!

177
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,470
Keep your thick skin and have a nice life!

178
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,270
I will find you to the end and kill you!

179
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,810
Stay alive.

180
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,770
I'll come back tomorrow.

181
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,610
When the sun comes out, we'll
get it notarized, get the collateral.

182
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm sure a judge's mom must
have at least 100 million won.

183
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,840
Don't bring Soo Ho into this.

184
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,480
This is between us, why would I bring someone in?

185
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,250
I stamped it,

186
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,960
so drop the charges against Kang Ho.

187
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,960
I will. After you get it notarized.

188
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,070
You said if I stamped, you'd drop the charges.

189
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,470
If you don't bring back the letter of
the settlement, I won't get it notarized.

190
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,880
You sure are a judge's mother.

191
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,000
Wow, you know the law.

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,630
Do not...

193
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,890
bother my Soo Ho...

194
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,200
or Kang Ho...

195
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,560
ever again.

196
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,050
Leave.

197
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,700
I don't know if your sons know

198
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,010
how much their mother loves them.

199
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,770
You sure you don't want to adopt me?

200
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,810
Three sons would be nice.

201
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:28,720
Leave.

202
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,120
Before I rip it all up.

203
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,220
That's a criminal's mother right there. Threatening.

204
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,320
See you tomorrow.

205
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,570
Hello.

206
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,980
You came to see me?

207
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,970
Yes.

208
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,040
Why did someone from the
judge's office come see me?

209
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,800
I was looking through trial records
and wanted to confirm something.

210
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,700
You wrote a letter of support for Director Lee Ho Sung.

211
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,020
I did, why?

212
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,840
Did someone tell you to?

213
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,990
No.

214
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:01,090
So you wrote it on your own will?

215
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,460
Is that important?

216
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,590
Yes.

217
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,450
I wrote it on my own will.

218
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,530
Why?

219
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,180
What do you want to know?

220
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,980
I mean...

221
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,680
You asked the person who assaulted
your father not be punished.

222
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,620
I wanted to know why you would ask for that.

223
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,260
What happened?

224
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,290
Director Lee Ho Sung

225
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,640
came to check on the factory my father was working at.

226
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,590
My father accidentally opened a valve

227
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,410
causing the steam to leak

228
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,580
almost hurting people there.

229
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,550
It was clearly a mistake.

230
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,640
But my father didn't admit to it
and kept making excuses.

231
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,470
- I'm sorry.
- Stop making excuses.

232
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,820
I acknowledge that Executive Lee Ho Sung got upset.

233
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,560
He just shoved him a little bit on the shoulder

234
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,050
but my father fell because of water on the floor.

235
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,510
But that water was from the steam valve.

236
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,980
But there happened to be sharp objects around

237
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,870
and that's why my father hurt his eye.

238
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,820
At first...

239
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,070
I thought he went blind from
Director Lee Ho Sung's assault.

240
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,030
But when I learned the truth

241
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,670
it happened because of my father's mistake.

242
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,610
That's why I wrote it.

243
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,090
What you just told me

244
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,120
exactly matches the petition submitted to prosecution.

245
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,680
I don't know about petitions and stuff like that.

246
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,860
The initial witness testimonies are different.

247
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,330
Do you know that?

248
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,800
I don't need to.

249
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,870
Lee Ho Sung was inspecting
the factory your father worked at.

250
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,000
There was one plastic bottle,

251
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,680
he pointed it out as a hygiene issue.

252
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,670
Your father was the leader of
the section, so he became the target.

253
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,550
Lee Ho Sung is known for having a temper.

254
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,870
What is this?

255
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,030
There were previous reports
of assaults before this incident.

256
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,700
Hey!

257
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,670
He hit your father

258
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:09,600
and threw a camera in his face,

259
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,550
which caused the direct damage on his cornea.

260
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,070
But after some time,

261
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,550
the witnesses started changing their stories.

262
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,090
Even your father, the victim,

263
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,410
admitted it was his mistake.

264
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,430
I have to run.

265
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,130
As his son, because you petitioned
against your father,

266
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,100
Lee Ho Sung will get a lighter sentence.

267
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,980
The law will take care of it.

268
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,060
A week after you submitted the letter of support,

269
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,090
this factory was named a supplier for O Sung Group.

270
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,270
You got a promotion as Shift Manager.

271
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,180
Was it a nice present from O Sung Group?

272
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,730
We all need to live.

273
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,370
He did that to your father.

274
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,370
A few more bucks for your salary and that's fine?

275
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,040
Lee Ho Sung will essentially get a not guilty verdict.

276
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,660
That's fine.

277
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,140
That's what my father wants.

278
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,690
What about you?

279
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,200
Is that what you want, too?

280
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,070
At the cost of your father's justice

281
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:25,720
you'll take a few cheap benefits,
that's how you want to live?

282
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,010
Yes.

283
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,970
That's what I need to do to survive.

284
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,670
When he went in for his interrogation,

285
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,170
he was smiling. Did you know that?

286
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,260
So what?

287
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,620
The judge...

288
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,440
can't give him punishment
heavy enough to make him cry!

289
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,440
It's a battle we can't win.

290
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,850
Why do I have to fight it, huh?

291
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,770
[ The verdict ]

292
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,060
I sentence the defendant
Choi Min Gook to a fine of 1.5 million won.

293
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,820
If the defendant fails to pay the fine,

294
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,170
he will be sentenced to labor

295
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,040
at a rate of 50,000 won per one day.

296
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,360
At the time of this crime,

297
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,410
the victim was not in a state of unconsciousness

298
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,000
yet there is no evidence of physical resistance.

299
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,690
Therefore forced sexual
intercourse cannot be proven.

300
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,950
The defendant has no prior criminal records

301
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,810
and has shown deep remorse and desires to settle.

302
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,880
Considering his future as a medical student,

303
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,920
and other extenuating factors

304
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,870
among the factors the prosecution listed...

305
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,170
[ Defendant Lee Ho Sung ]

306
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,050
I told you to make it conditional release.

307
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,820
I am not a judge, I'm a judicial trainee.

308
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,370
The ruling I wrote has no legal validity.

309
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,550
I wrote it thinking

310
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,940
if I were a judge

311
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,420
what decision I would make with my own standards.

312
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,190
The prosecutor recommended six months.

313
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,970
Not a fine, not probation.

314
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,670
Seven years in prison?

315
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,300
Within the extent of the charge,

316
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,490
it's maximum.

317
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,210
You want to put him behind bars.

318
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,720
The heir of a corporation.

319
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,250
For a simple injury.

320
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,510
All are equal under the law. That's what you said.

321
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,660
If you read the text, there are valid reasons-

322
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,480
How is this valid?

323
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,780
All sentences are subject to guidelines.

324
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,610
Take into account what's necessary

325
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,940
and exempt what's not.

326
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,880
That's how you interpret the law,

327
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,670
you're outside those guidelines!

328
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,950
There is only one rule

329
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,630
to ruling.

330
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,440
The pain of the punishment

331
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,320
must be greater than the benefit of the crime.

332
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:39,690
If the guilty one gets a light punishment

333
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:42,090
and walks out of the courtroom smiling,

334
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,620
that is not punishment according to the crime.

335
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,800
Sure, sure.

336
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,220
Thanks for the wisdom.

337
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,560
Create another version with conditional release.

338
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,920
I can't.

339
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,120
I'm not telling you to edit.

340
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,240
I'm telling you to make another version.

341
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,530
For practice.

342
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,300
Even for practice...

343
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,650
I cannot abandon the law and my conscience.

344
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,280
You're a judicial trainee.

345
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,260
What kind of attitude is that for learning?

346
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,580
You are a judge, your honor.

347
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,370
I want to ask you, is that the
right attitude for teaching?

348
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,070
Trainee Song.

349
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,680
Do you have it by any chance?

350
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,610
What are you talking about?

351
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,620
You know, the...

352
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,190
everyone used to have it.

353
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,820
It's cumbersome, inconvenient, and

354
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,960
out of style so everyone got rid of it.

355
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,520
What is it...

356
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,890
Oh, that.

357
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,570
A sense of justice.

358
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,970
I didn't know it was a trend.

359
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,710
Are you sure you know the trend, Your Honor?

360
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,050
You're just jealous of rich people.

361
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,790
Rewrite it.

362
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,070
I don't want to.

363
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,720
♫ I live another ordinary day  ♫

364
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,470
♫ Leaning on you  ♫

365
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,390
♫ Borrowing the warmth
from our hands together  ♫

366
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,970
♫ Like a miracle  ♫

367
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:37,280
♫ The world is bigger, higher...  ♫
