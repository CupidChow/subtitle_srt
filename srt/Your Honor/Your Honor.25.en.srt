1
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,050
Is everything you said in court true?

2
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,260
Have you been lying this whole time?

3
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,180
Who is the person who
promised you your future?

4
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,580
Did these drug parties happen often?

5
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,440
Who forced you to make
a false testimony?

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,360
Are you admitting to regular drug use?

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,640
We need to move. Please move.

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,490
Why are you doing this now?

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,310
The thing that secures my future

10
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,250
is not someone powerful

11
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,150
but fans who believe in me.

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,590
I had forgotten that.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,070
When I realized that, I came to my senses.

14
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,910
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:09,810
I'm so sorry that I have
nothing more to say.

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,810
Is this fan a man?

17
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,840
- Yes.
- What is your relationship to him?

18
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,920
I am his fan as well.

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,140
I'm sorry. I'll explain everything after
the investigation is over.

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,220
Is he also a celebrity?
Is he a sunbae actor?

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,140
- Did someone suggest a sponsorship?
- Park Hae Na!

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,800
Bravo!

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,540
- Bravo, bravo!
- Applause!

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,550
It's not like I won a gold medal.
What's up with you guys?

25
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,640
I feel like ten years' worth of
constipation was just released.

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,300
My friends in the administrative
and executive departments

27
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,070
kept saying we were making the trial drag,
and asked me what was wrong with you.

28
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,940
That you lost it because it's an actress.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,620
There was much talk.

30
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,160
Isn't it true we become either
proud or ashamed

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,470
of our work depending on
whom we're dealing with?

32
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,950
Was this the last trial you
absolutely had to work on?

33
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,320
Yes.

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,520
All right.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,050
You made a difficult decision.

36
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
Not really.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,080
Of course.

38
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,380
I know it must not have
been easy for you.

39
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,850
I always...

40
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,050
go by the law and my
conscience. For justice...

41
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,110
That's enough.

42
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,140
You're resigning; you don't
need to bring up justice.

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,280
- Resign?
- You just had to hand it to me.

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,330
You came in on a Sunday and
so tenderly put it on my desk.

45
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,590
I know I kept telling you to resign, but now
that you did, I feel strange.

46
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,690
I put this robe on you and now
it feels like I'm kicking you out.

47
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,220
I approved and submitted it, so it
will be processed in a week.

48
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,050
I...

49
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,260
resigned?

50
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,110
I will stake my life on defending you
to the disciplinary committee.

51
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,900
We shouldn't mar the records
of a departed family.

52
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,580
I know, I know. I know
how you feel of course.

53
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,260
I know it's not easy to quit being a judge.

54
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,420
Who wouldn't have regrets?

55
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,010
Don't worry about the other matters.

56
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,070
Let's just wrap up the rulings you have left.

57
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,600
Go take a trip and prepare to
start your career as an attorney.

58
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,270
I might not be a big help, but

59
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,100
I'll help in any way I can.

60
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,080
So Eun,

61
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,000
- a moment, please.
- Yes.

62
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,110
Yes?

63
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,120
- Should we run away instead of working?
- What?

64
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,200
- Where?
- Lunch.

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,100
It's only eleven.

66
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
You never skipped class
in school, did you?

67
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,940
No, I didn't.

68
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,770
I've never not skipped class.

69
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,760
Let's go.

70
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,860
What is this?

71
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,020
I wanted to get you
something nice somewhere.

72
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,830
I've wanted to do something like this.

73
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,930
To get some sunshine,

74
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,690
people-watching, and
have a conversation,

75
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,140
while feeling relaxed.

76
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,860
You can do this any time.

77
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,990
You could do it every lunch hour.

78
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,610
Not like that.

79
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,110
I actually wanted to relax.

80
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,970
I've never really done that.

81
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,570
My sister was a junior in
college when it happened.

82
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,840
I was a freshman.

83
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,850
After she disappeared,

84
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,210
I transferred to study law,

85
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
to get the bastard in court again

86
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,340
and to let my sister come out of hiding.

87
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,600
So...

88
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,070
I have not had time to relax.

89
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,800
I had to study all the time.

90
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,630
It would've been easier to be a killer.

91
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,940
Right.

92
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,200
Every day felt impossible.

93
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,880
But...

94
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,790
today feels different, thanks to you.

95
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,610
Just wait a bit more.
All your wishes will come true.

96
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:22,630
All your wishes will come true.

97
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,700
You'll find your sister

98
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,530
and he'll be punished.

99
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,040
When you are not hurting anymore,

100
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,150
this will break.

101
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,340
It will happen, right?

102
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,420
No matter what.

103
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,690
But instead,

104
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,100
you need to become a judge,
even if it takes time.

105
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,030
In this world, the judge is king.

106
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,690
I want to as well.

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,630
You'll have moved to the
collegiate division by then,

108
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,830
and I'll fight to follow you
and be a fellow judge.

109
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,600
Your Honor, it's certain

110
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,310
you will give me all the work.

111
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,570
I will stay late every day

112
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,230
and you will...

113
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,220
ask me why I work so hard,

114
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,350
say I shouldn't work so hard
for my measly salary.

115
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,030
You'll drag me out to eat and
drink late into the night.

116
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,370
My sister...

117
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,720
will call me to ask when I'm getting home.

118
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,860
Why right now?

119
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,590
For what reason?

120
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,850
Why are you so pretty?

121
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,290
If you say that kind of stuff

122
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,800
all of a sudden...

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,620
Could you repeat that?

124
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,490
No.

125
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,990
Why not?

126
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:46,840
You should've been listening the first time.

127
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,800
Yes. We need to work.

129
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,270
No. We're going to play.

130
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,410
What about work?

131
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,520
Let's play just one last time.

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,940
So Eun, So Eun! It's okay. Stand up.

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,520
I'm taking this off.

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,140
It's okay.

135
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,440
- Trainee Song.
- Yes?

136
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,190
I didn't get scolded much,
and the judge is feeling fine.

137
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,950
And I'm always on your side.

138
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,630
Oh, you gave this to me last time.

139
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,090
Here.

140
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,050
- You have a piece of hair.
- What?

141
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,250
Me, too.

142
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,860
The idol star Park, who has been
under investigation for drug use,

143
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,480
has outed the heirs of a
conglomerate and a hospital

144
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,440
and a son of a prominent political
figure thereby shocking us all.

145
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,150
She has exposed the so-called
"high-class drug parties."

146
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:49,470
For the first time, a judge made allegations
in the middle of a trial.

147
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:55,960
Yes, Press Director.

148
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,040
Yes.

149
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,860
What is this?

150
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,520
Open it.

151
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
They're gift certificates.

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,180
It's from the department head.

153
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,020
Text him and thank him.

154
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,090
Is it a retirement bonus?

155
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,710
- I'll see you on the news.
- Why are you all doing this to me?

156
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,910
The message boards are
blowing up about you leaving.

157
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,150
"Did you fire her because
she delivered real news?"

158
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,520
"I' will petition it before the president."

159
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,760
People called to complain,

160
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,560
so the president's cell and office
phones were ringing all day.

161
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,480
Who are these people online?
Why are they so diligent?

162
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,950
Is that why?

163
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,460
Don't get me wrong. You're not coming back
because of a few online messages.

164
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,030
You're the number one search term,
so we're using you again.

165
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,120
Yes.

166
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,350
Do you even know what
you're agreeing to?

167
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,170
The viewers are saying they want
to see you, not the news.

168
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,250
You make us money, so
we are reinstating you.

169
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,590
That's the main reason.

170
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,680
You want me to make
a lot of money, right?

171
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,610
If you don't, be ready to disrobe.
(Means quit the job figuratively)

172
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,150
Hey.

173
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,250
That wasn't sexual harassment.

174
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,350
I, when I said disrobe...

175
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,030
I meant it symbolically, to the
organization you belong to...

176
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,310
Do I need to keep explaining?

177
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,250
I'll go and earn money.

178
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,750
Wow...

179
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,070
Ohdaeyang, the number one
legal firm in South Korea.

180
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,400
Its top lawyer, Oh Sang Cheol
over there, and his team.

181
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,630
I really liked you, Hyung.

182
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,190
What is this?

183
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,710
I said, what is this!

184
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,550
Did I...

185
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,460
disappoint you guys in some way?

186
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,850
Did I not treat you well?

187
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,450
Hey, you.

188
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,980
Listen carefully.

189
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,800
I won't be investigated.

190
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,840
No, I cannot be.

191
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,160
I will put in all I have

192
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,820
and make sure you waste time
in the middle of nowhere

193
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,630
until you quit.

194
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,280
Mr. President, you too.

195
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,820
You have nothing to say, do you?

196
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,180
My inadequate son made a mistake.

197
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,420
- Let's talk privately.
- I don't need it!

198
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,910
Don't even think about working
with Oh Sung again.

199
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,120
That's between the chairman
and me, Managing Director.

200
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,910
Oh, so you're close with my father?

201
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,880
Do you think my father will be alive forever?

202
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,450
You have no guarantee of
becoming the chairman.

203
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,820
If you don't treat this case with caution,

204
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,410
don't you think your brother,
Lee Ho Jun, will leap forward?

205
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,070
Wow...

206
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,480
The drugs were paid for

207
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,120
with a check under Choi Min Guk's name.

208
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,200
It appears that he committed
the actual crime.

209
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,350
Do you have a right to be sitting here?

210
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,050
Get out.

211
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,880
Please excuse us for a moment, prosecutor.

212
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,980
Geez. S***.

213
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,720
Sunbae, it looks like you will
work regionally and retire.

214
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,100
You have to at least stick the sword in

215
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,230
to have power if you start
an attorney's office.

216
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,850
You mother******.

217
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,060
A lawyer mocking a prosecutor?

218
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,530
What's a prosecutor anyway?

219
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,350
- What?
- What's a prosecutor?

220
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,110
You must be insane.

221
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,550
What is a prosecutor anyway, Sunbae?

222
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,290
Power.

223
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,960
You might be mocked for kissing the government's a**
and backing conglomerates, but in the end

224
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,440
prosecutors have the power to kill an
administration and take down a conglomerate.

225
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,430
Get yourself together.

226
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,930
Sunbae, you own this nation.

227
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,140
Are you comforting me or encouraging me?

228
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,140
Are you kidding me?

229
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:44,990
No matter how big a conglomerate,
they're just businessmen to me.

230
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:49,300
I got slapped by lowly businessmen.

231
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,340
Would I be kidding your right now?

232
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,890
What gives you such confidence?

233
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,350
Drop Oh Sung and align
yourself with Han Young.

234
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,850
You have a hookup?

235
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,500
I will make a spot for you.

236
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,060
So Sunbae, you must handle this case.

237
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,990
To go mainstream, or to leave my
post in some country town.

238
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,350
You want me to gamble.

239
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,940
Is that it?

240
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,910
You have a great deck.

241
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,870
You cannot lose.

242
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,950
I was not able to put in too much.

243
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,740
Aigoo, how small.

244
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:46,100
Things are a bit difficult over
there these days, huh?

245
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,990
It's because I'm still a trainee.

246
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,470
You might make a little now, but when
you are a judge or prosecutor

247
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,940
and earning a lot,
you will feel so satisfied.

248
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,990
So take this for the road,

249
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,470
and treat yourself to some ice cream.

250
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,960
No, please, take it.

251
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,790
You dropped my case in return for
finding your sister. It's a done deal.

252
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,230
Why are you shoving this in my face
when it's been settled?

253
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:12,300
Just think of it as a small gesture.

254
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,490
Small gestures become
big fortunes later!

255
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,900
I've been trying to teach you that a threat
works better than a request in this world.

256
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:23,470
Here.

257
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,270
Okay, fine.

258
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,870
Mr. Sa.

259
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,570
You know your deadline with
me is approaching, right?

260
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,960
If you don't keep your word this time,

261
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,740
I will sue you again for fraud.

262
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,450
Aigoo.

263
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,330
I have already drafted the paperwork.

264
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,040
I just need to submit it.

265
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,480
Legally, once a case is dropped,
it cannot be resubmitted.

266
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,110
Once gone, no more;
that's the golden rule.

267
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,620
Try threatening me when
it's actually effective!

268
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,100
You're looking for my sister, right?

269
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,050
You need to have faith
to have immortal life.

270
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,530
Please keep your promise.

271
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,310
If you find your sister, are you going
to try him in court again?

272
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,630
I am going to submit an appeal

273
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,090
and go all the way.

274
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,920
Miss judge-in-training,

275
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,750
you've never been tried, huh?

276
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,410
No.

277
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,930
Why?

278
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,750
The world is like that.

279
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,080
More important thing than
the guilty being punished

280
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,130
is that the innocent is shielded from pain.

281
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,890
Aigoo, welcome.

282
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,060
For two?

283
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,560
We're here for you, Your Honor.

284
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,820
We collected the black box.

285
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,140
Would you like to check?

286
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,470
Aigoo, not necessary.

287
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,200
We trust people easily.

288
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,450
One must have faith to attain immortal life.

289
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,350
I enjoyed watching the trial and the news.

290
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,600
The word is as out as it can be already.

291
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,350
We have already pretty much
won the bidding.

292
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:20,530
Thank you with all my heart, Your Honor.

293
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,750
I should give this to you when
the guilty verdict is confirmed, but...

294
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,360
you really hurt their image with
the upper-class drug party stuff.

295
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,750
So, it's all but pretty much confirmed.

296
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,130
I'm so happy to have a great
relationship with you, Your Honor.

297
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,610
I really...

298
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,380
did all that only thinking about this.

299
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,210
Do you have any idea what the
last month was like for me?

300
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,940
How could I comprehend
your deep thoughts

301
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,300
and hard work?

302
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,450
You could not.

303
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,150
Is this a billion won?

304
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,450
Yes.

305
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,240
If you give me your key,
I'll put it in your car.

306
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,750
No.

307
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,620
Let me revel in this moment.

308
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,900
A billion won.

309
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,540
A billion won in cash.

310
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,820
Being a judge is great.

311
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,550
Money! One billion won!

312
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,530
You're all dead to me!

313
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,150
I earned a billion won!

314
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,650
[ From Park Jae Hyung ]

315
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,790
Your Honor.

316
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,010
I know you put in hard work
for justice, day and night.

317
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,720
I sincerely respect your efforts.

318
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,820
I am Park Jae Hyung, the younger brother
of appellant Park Ji Ho.

319
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,960
My brother has a developmental disability.

320
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,280
He has a low IQ

321
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,150
and cannot make eye contact with others,

322
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,280
but he is a good son who does
whatever his mother says.

323
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,430
Mom,

324
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,490
the fridge is packed.

325
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,080
Put, put it here?

326
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,230
Or here? Here?

327
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,850
Here? Oh, here!

328
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,490
Like this?

329
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,550
Like this?

330
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,350
Mom, are you sick?

331
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,850
You're always sick.

332
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,610
The side dishes.

333
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,070
Are they from Woo Jung?

334
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,030
I need to die so you two
can live together.

335
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:22,780
How is school?

336
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,260
The teachers are nice

337
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,030
and I'm learning technical skills.

338
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,640
They call me a technician.

339
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,420
Mom, Mom, I don't need money.

340
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,840
Mom... hospital...

341
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,610
You should buy medicine.

342
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,370
Jae Ho...

343
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,540
have a happy life

344
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,600
with your brother

345
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,940
and Woo Jung.

346
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,360
Mom?

347
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,450
Because I'm...

348
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,550
so tired,

349
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,460
I want to sleep.

350
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,310
If I don't answer because I'm sleeping,

351
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,520
don't wake me up

352
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,330
and go to school.

353
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,670
I'm...

354
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,070
cold.

355
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,730
Put the blanket on me.

356
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,310
You're cold.

357
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,260
You're cold.

358
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,150
Cover my face, too

359
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,370
since I'm cold.

360
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,600
Please...

361
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,320
and press down.

362
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,800
Like this?

363
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,800
She's cold. My mom is cold.

364
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,130
More?

365
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,540
How long do I need to do it for?

366
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,360
Mom. Are you still cold?

367
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,220
Are you cold?

368
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,730
Mom.

369
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,720
Are you asleep?

370
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,300
Are you asleep, Mom?

371
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,980
I...

372
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,320
am engaged to be married to
the appellant Park Jae Ho.

373
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,960
My name is Bang Woo Jung.

374
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,700
My fiancé is

375
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,420
accused of murdering his own family.

376
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,140
Everything on here

377
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,080
is true, right?

378
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,440
Yes.

379
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,370
Why did you kill your mother?

380
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,370
Because of money.

381
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,220
Mom, hospital, under her blanket.

382
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,010
because of money.

383
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,840
Good job.

384
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,460
From now on,

385
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,190
no matter who asks, just answer that way.

386
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,260
Then...

387
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,670
the judge will send you home.

388
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,070
Got it?

389
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,230
The judge...

390
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,120
hates people who keep flip-flopping.

391
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,300
You know?

392
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,150
Then...

393
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,470
you'll never go home.

394
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,680
The criminal intent of Park,
under investigation

395
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,200
for murdering a family member,
has been revealed.

396
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,300
According to the prosecution, Park

397
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,840
murdered his mother after an argument
over her refusal to give him money.

398
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,980
The amount was only 200,000 won.

399
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,530
Defendant Park Jae Ho was his mother's,
Lee Young Soon's, caretaker.

400
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,050
He said things like, "I was tired."

401
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,260
"I wish she would die already."

402
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,680
He often revealed his discomfort.

403
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,160
He fed rotten food to his mother,
who could not move.

404
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,210
He attempted to worsen her condition.

405
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,770
When his plan didn't unfold,

406
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,490
he finally murdered her.

407
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,190
The defendant is not such
a cold-hearted murderer!

408
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,830
Not everything that has been
reported in the media is true.

409
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,480
Watch what you say.

410
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,130
I don't rule by public opinion.

411
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,300
The defendant has a
developmental disability.

412
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,310
This was not an intentional crime.

413
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,020
Please accept the diagnosis from
a psychologist as evidence.

414
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,050
The defendant is learning technical
skills at a trade school.

415
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,240
He has already

416
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,150
earned a certificate for the third degree.

417
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:55,160
I cannot accept the opinion that
he is disabled enough to be

418
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,600
unaware of his homicidal act.

419
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,240
That's enough for arguments
on either side.

420
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,940
Is everything on the report true?

421
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,490
Do you have an opinion?

422
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,610
What?

423
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,100
Yes.

424
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,510
Prosecution, please
recommend a sentence.

425
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,020
For the defendant...

426
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,660
I recommend the legal maximum.

427
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,510
The death penalty.

428
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,000
Your Honor.

429
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,990
Please find the truth within the lies.

430
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:57,080
I beg of you.

431
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,430
Please be lenient toward Park Jae Ho,

432
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,140
who is about to be my husband.

433
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,650
I beg you with all my heart.

434
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,580
From Bang Woo Jung.

435
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,990
You want to use my trial to
cover up a drug party

436
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,150
some rich kids had?

437
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,920
There's something to this, right?

438
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,230
They're trying to cover
up something, right?

439
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,770
How would a judge know?

440
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,740
I'm not asking you to rule either way.

441
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,700
Just so the mood doesn't go sour...

442
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,640
you can wrap up the trial quickly.
