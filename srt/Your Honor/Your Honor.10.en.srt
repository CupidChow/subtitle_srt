1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,420
Did you watch the news?

2
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,970
Oppa, you're acting weird.

3
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,270
What?

4
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,390
Your eyes are different.

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,610
How many eyes do you have?

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,440
The interview.

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,270
What happened?

8
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,960
It was supposed to air yesterday.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,470
They canceled it and then aired it.

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,550
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,790
I know I dragged you to the studio on the weekend.

12
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,390
Got it.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,650
You can leave.

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:54,580
I was going to sleep over.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,210
Eun.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,100
You haven't called me that in a while.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,680
Can you give me couple of days, no, weeks?

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,730
Don't contact me.

19
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,150
Don't visit.

20
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,670
Don't see me.

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,210
Why?

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,140
I need to take care of something.

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,620
I'll tell you later.

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,460
Okay.

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,680
But can you give me tonight?

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,710
I have to go.

27
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,500
So annoying.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,560
I told you to stop making me have to be brave.

29
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,480
I don't have tattoos.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,280
I know.

31
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,170
If he has a tattoo...

32
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,500
it's not me.

33
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,380
Just remember that.

34
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:24,520
Lee Ho Sung and Ji Chang Soo.

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,680
[ The defendant is sentenced to... ]

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,400
[ Ruling, drunk driving case, the defendant,
prosecution, defense, verdict ]

37
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,160
Aigoo. We're not open yet.

38
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,990
Have you turned into stone?

39
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,490
If a customer is here, tell me
to have a seat, or lie down.

40
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,760
You can't just have him standing around.

41
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,250
What kind of business is that?

42
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,800
- Have you eaten?
- Huh.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,100
You're worried about me?

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,390
- Are you drinking?
- Aigoo.

45
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,440
Quit a long time ago.

46
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,530
I'm trying to be good.

47
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,450
If you wanted to be good, you
should've quit eating and died early.

48
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,810
Why are you here?

49
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,670
I came here for love.

50
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,650
I told you if we voted on being romantic

51
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,140
I would have been president.

52
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,560
Drink.

53
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,600
Don't ever come here again.

54
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,300
I...

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,820
- got married.
- I know.

56
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,110
I also know you're divorced.

57
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,230
I won't talk for long.

58
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,200
Meeting you ruined my life. You admit that, right?

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,610
Relationship issues...

60
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,890
are mostly mutually caused, you know?

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,950
You admit that, right?

62
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,660
It's too late, but I want to have a good life.

63
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,830
Can you understand that?

64
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,510
I get it.

65
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,150
If not for you, I can have a really good life.

66
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,540
You know that, right?

67
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,530
I went to jail a couple of times,
and now I'm 50 years old.

68
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,460
I have no family.

69
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,710
I wonder why I live like this.

70
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,360
You know.

71
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,920
I can't live like a human without you.

72
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,620
- Get to the point.
- I love you.

73
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,700
Aigoo.

74
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,680
Hello, is this the police?

75
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,040
A crazy man is making a scene this morning.

76
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,650
He had a lot to drink.

77
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,100
Two bottles of soju.

78
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,730
Yes, please come quickly.

79
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,930
This is number 50 in Seochodong. Aigoo!

80
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,090
Aigoo!

81
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,320
You stun me every time I see you.

82
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,810
I'll start working here tomorrow,
you don't have to pay me.

83
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,970
I just need food and shelter.

84
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,290
Don't get up.

85
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,140
You said you loved me, stay.

86
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,240
You know, I'm allergic to the police.

87
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,010
I have to go.

88
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,840
See you tomorrow.

89
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,230
I'm starving. Why didn't she
give me food? I have nowhere to go.

90
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,050
You're up.

91
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,520
I uploaded the ruling.

92
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,460
I saw. It's great.

93
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,200
I knew it.

94
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,800
I thought about it all night.

95
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,900
But that's all I could do.

96
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,940
Why are you thinking so hard
about such a small case?

97
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,020
It's not a small case.

98
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,140
An entire family was destroyed.

99
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,320
Don't get upset.

100
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,990
Your Honor, you've never lost a family member.

101
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,160
The victim's family will forever

102
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,240
live in suffering worse than death.

103
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,210
Not a day.

104
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,530
A year wouldn't be enough time to think about it.

105
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,980
Why is family so important?

106
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,260
You think a family makes everyone happy?

107
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,660
Do you know how many crappy
families there are in the world?

108
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,840
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,110
But it's not a small case.

110
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,680
I'll see you at the courtroom.

111
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,570
That temper.

112
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,000
Defendant Bae Min Jung.

113
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,360
You are sentenced to a year
and six months in prison.

114
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,110
But...

115
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,680
you are released under probation

116
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,520
for three years after today's date.

117
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,370
The defendant is...

118
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,190
also ordered to take
80 hours of driving education.

119
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,500
On May 26th, 2018, around 9:30 p.m.

120
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,410
the defendant, with a 0.08%
blood alcohol content

121
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,820
on a residential road near
Banpodong, Seochogu, House Number 74,

122
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,390
drove at an unknown speed

123
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,520
and hit Kim Young Joo, causing her death.

124
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,890
Taking into account that you
are deeply remorseful,

125
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,880
you have no priors,

126
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,520
and deposited the amount of money

127
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,470
standard to settlements of similar cases,

128
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,790
I sentence the above.

129
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,020
Your Honor.

130
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,040
Why do you forgive her?

131
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,840
Please sit.

132
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,860
- You're just letting her go?
- Please sit.

133
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,610
This isn't right.

134
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,370
How could you make such a ruling? Huh?

135
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,060
Let go!

136
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,320
Quiet!

137
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,020
Let him go.

138
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,660
Speak.

139
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,230
I was a writing instructor.

140
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,750
I've always tried to think logically.

141
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,880
But right now

142
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,980
even after using all the logic I know

143
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,540
I cannot find an answer.

144
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,690
The dictionary definition of murder

145
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,590
is to kill a human being.

146
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,570
Driving while drunk

147
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,670
and unable to control their own body

148
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,400
is no different from an intent to kill.

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,570
Your Honor.

150
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,080
You've made up excuses to forgive

151
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,660
and to return this criminal to society.

152
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,390
No priors?

153
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,800
If it's your first time killing
someone, is that forgivable?

154
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,200
And!

155
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
She is not remorseful.

156
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,600
It's all in the evidence you threw out.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Your Honor.

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
Do you know the name of my dead wife?

159
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,790
You don't know, do you?

160
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,200
Her name was Kim Young Joo.

161
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,890
She conceived after seven years of marriage.

162
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,060
She was three weeks pregnant.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
Your Honor.

164
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,680
You went through a trial
without even knowing who died.

165
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,300
You don't know...

166
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,960
how she wanted to live,

167
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,760
and you're sitting there!

168
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,000
What do you know sitting in that seat?

169
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,020
Do you know what it feels not to have a family?

170
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,110
I...

171
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,780
have nowhere to go.

172
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,510
Nowhere to rest.

173
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,980
No reason to keep on living.

174
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,880
No one to hold me in this world.

175
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,910
So...

176
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,500
how can I live?

177
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,840
If I can't forgive,

178
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,670
what right does the law have to forgive?

179
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,330
My unborn child is dead.

180
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,480
What in the world is the law?

181
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,750
What is the law...

182
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,730
to forgive her, Your Honor?

183
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,050
Your Honor?

184
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,200
If the trial's over, can I go?

185
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,100
You can appeal within a week.

186
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,800
The court is adjourned.

187
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,900
Find out why the evidence was
thrown out in Bae Min Jung's case.

188
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,390
Got it.

189
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,330
Did you cry?

190
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,860
No.

191
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,180
Everyone has a story at a trial.

192
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,110
Don't let it get to you, and...

193
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,950
you did a good job with the ruling.

194
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,000
The picture.

195
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,800
You didn't allow the evidence.

196
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,130
It was evidence acquired through illegal means

197
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,380
so I know it has to be thrown out

198
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,220
but even if the evidence is discarded

199
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,690
I couldn't let go of the feeling.

200
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,680
I don't think I'm qualified to be a judge.

201
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,800
Go home. Don't work today.

202
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,500
And...

203
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,770
I'm the one who's not qualified.

204
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,860
[ Older son ]

205
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,600
What's going on? You must be busy.

206
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,270
Have you eaten?

207
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,940
I'm sorry I can't make it.

208
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,770
Happy birthday.

209
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,760
You're busy, don't worry about my birthday.

210
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,630
Anyway, why did you send so much money?

211
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,900
I know you don't have much.

212
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,030
You still have loans to pay back.

213
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,670
Why are you quiet?

214
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,090
What are you doing?

215
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,470
I'm watering the flowers.

216
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,450
Why are you doing that at night?

217
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,020
Watering during the day makes the leaves burn.

218
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,200
The water drops act like a magnifying glass.

219
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,710
Sure.

220
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,550
Goodnight.

221
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,320
Hey, Soo Ho.

222
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,220
I can't get in touch with Kang Ho.

223
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,220
I talked to him a couple days ago.

224
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,690
He's well, so don't worry about him.

225
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,320
You talked to him?

226
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,360
He's asking for money again, right?

227
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,280
He didn't try to hurt you?

228
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,380
No, he doesn't do that all the time.

229
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,280
I'm sorry that I always make you worry

230
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,030
about Kang Ho, Soo Ho.

231
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,330
You're not sorry to Kang Ho?

232
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,220
What would I be sorry to him?

233
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,310
I should have just had you.

234
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,530
Do you need any more side dishes?

235
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,120
I'll make more and come by.

236
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,150
I'm busy. Goodnight.

237
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,790
Sure, sure. I know you're busy.

238
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,580
I watched the news.

239
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,740
My son is so handsome.

00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,300
Okay. Bye.

Right now?

244
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,100
Your Honor!

245

My brilliant Trainee Song!

246
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,240
Awesome judge!

247
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,000
- Master of Chinese characters!
- Careful!

248
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,800
Are you okay?

249
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,600
You told me not to let it get to me.

250
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,100
But are you upset, too?

251
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,180
You're funny.

252
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,000
Family...

253
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,400
is worse than strangers.

254
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,300
You know how funny family is?

255
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,690
Even if you don't see them
your whole life, they hurt you.

256
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,040
Even if they're not there, they hurt you.

257
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,710
Even if you can't see them, they hurt you.

258
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm so sick of it!

259
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,640
When I see you...

260
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,060
I don't think I can be a real judge.

261
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,360
It's such a hard job.

262
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,720
You know the astronaut story?

263
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,680
You said he was happy
when he came back to earth.

264
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,600
- About the gravity.
- Yes.

270
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,200
- I'm leaving.
- Sure, careful.

272
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm sorry.

Your Honor?

274
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,760
Please get up.

275
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,900
You need to get home.

276
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,700
I...

277
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,190
have no gravity.

278
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,960
I have no one.

279
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,780
I slept elsewhere, see you at work. Song So Eun.

[ Judge Han Soo Ho, are you that kind of person? ]

282

So who's Talmud?

283
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,330
I'm not standing here so you can mock me.

284
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,020
You think...

285
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,620
judges will blink an eye at this?

286
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,930
It's okay.

287
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,760
I'm going all the way to the Supreme Court.

288
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,880
After the third trial

289
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,330
I'm going to fight to create a drunk driving murder law.

290
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,800
That's far away.

291
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,810
The prosecutor is going to appeal.

292
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,990
You need to prepare for that first.

293
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,100
The next court won't be a thug like me.

294
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,500
Real judges will be in charge.

295
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,070
If you argue that the perpetrator

296
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,750
tricked the first court with fake remorse,

297
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,430
she'll get a heavier punishment than this time.

298
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,490
Aren't you the one who threw out the evidence?

299
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,860
That evidence is unusable!

300
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,360
But...

301
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,300
I'll give you something else instead.

302
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,260
I checked this yesterday.

303
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,150
The perpetrator's letter of remorse

304
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:41,970
and the police report testimony
have different handwritings.

305
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,060
She probably paid someone else to write it.

306
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,920
50,000 won per page.

307
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,250
Hiring someone to write for you isn't illegal.

308
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,080
But in the records for the initial cross-examination

309
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,650
Bae Min Jung testified that she wrote it herself.

310
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,010
She perjured, so...

311
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,610
you can push that at the appeals.

312
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,060
Why are you doing this after the trial's done?

313
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,590
I'm sorry...

314
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,710
that someone like me was in charge.

315
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,400
Drink some water.

316
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,000
You'll pass out.

317
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,740
Take this umbrella.

318
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,270
You'll get a sunburn.
