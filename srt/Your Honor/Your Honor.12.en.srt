1
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,650
Wow! The great Sa Ma Gui hyungnim...

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,660
Working part-time passing out flyers?

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,450
How much do you get per hour?

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,750
Here. You pass them out, too.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,150
Please come in and enjoy.

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,510
- Hyungnim, you want to work for a lump sum?
- No, I don't.

7
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,670
- I have to look into someone.
- I won't.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,480
- You're the best in Asia as far as tracking people down.
- No, I'm not.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,220
A nightclub owner who used to be a judo athlete.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,440
He got beat up by a waiter.

11
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,380
That doesn't make sense.

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,700
If you find out what happened that night,

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,710
I'll double the amount you want.

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,590
I'll start living a good, clean life, man.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,750
You need money to live like that.

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,590
I'm telling you, I'm out!

17
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,500
What's wrong with you?

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,360
I heard you're still poking around

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,510
looking for someone.

20
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,720
Where did you hear that?

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,450
Ever since you were born, have
you ever contributed anything

22
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,640
to this world?

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,880
The world didn't help me. Why should I contribute?

24
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,350
You know, something I contributed in my life...

25
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,750
You know when you breathe...

26
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,060
you let out carbon dioxide.

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,550
That's all I contributed.

28
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,590
I'm a carbon dioxide producer.

29
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,100
You deserve to be arrested for
filling up the earth with that.

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,130
Let's not talk about that.

31
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,080
Double the amount and

32
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,390
10 million won on top. Deal?

33
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,620
Give me a freaking break. What deal?

34
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,350
You know,

35
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,520
my dream is to become a husband of one woman.

36
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,290
To become a father of a child.

37
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,800
And if I get lucky enough to see my grandchild,

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,890
I'd want nothing more.

39
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,250
This is my first time having such a grand dream, man.

40
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,450
Are you retiring?

41
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,320
You must have some dream and

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,890
something you want to make of yourself, don't you?

43
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,680
- I do.
- What?

44
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,790
A judge.

45
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,320
Hey, you should come to your senses

46
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,550
when I gave you so many advice!

47
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,650
You're still going around spewing nonsense, man.

48
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,800
A judge?

49
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
Hyungnim,

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,780
if the amount is too little...

51
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,390
Here, I'll add another 10 or 20 million won. Hyungnim!

52
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,620
Is this the police station?

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,640
It's a brand new restaurant.

54
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,990
I'm going crazy because someone
is interfering with my business.

55
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,780
Yes, yes, yes. Yes!

56
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,800
Yes, he's gone. Don't come.

57
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,350
If you become a judge, I'd be an emperor!

58
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,250
And pay before you go!

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,750
Use this for your opening.

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,550
It's your comment, Sunbae.

61
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,350
- They want you to say it.
- Who?

62
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,320
- The press director.
- Why?

63
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,580
People are saying, "Why are men always
the main and women the support?"

64
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,200
"She was pushed out because she's a woman."

65
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,950
Comments like that were posted.

66
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,750
You feel that way, too? You were pushed
aside because you're a woman?

67
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,980
I can't say I didn't experience
disadvantages as a woman.

68
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,910
But I have no intention to gain
just because I'm a woman.

69
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,670
You sure know how to shut me up.

70
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,360
On July 8th, a lawyer from
the biggest law firm in Korea

71
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,900
gifted golf balls worth 85,000 won as bribes

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,460
to Kim, Lee, and Park who work
for the Ministry of Justice.

73
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,900
Could a golf ball worth 85,000 be called bribe?

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,490
I don't know! I'll have to quit golf.

75
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,610
Min Goo Nam is a good fighter.

76
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,520
Ji Chang Soo can't fight.

77
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
Can't win.

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,980
Can win.

79
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,460
Sa Ma Gui retires.

80
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,320
Background check by whom?

81
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,160
Yes, Your Honor.

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,190
What are you doing?

83
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,240
You know that Go Yang Ja case?

84
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,650
The assault and business
interference at an amusement park.

85
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,740
Is there such a case?

86
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,290
You presided over the hearing three times already.

87
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,420
I did?

88
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,430
Yes.

89
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,220
Oh, I see.

90
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,440
Right, I remember.

91
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,320
The defendant's daughter sent in a letter.

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,220
Asking for us to punish her mom.

93
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,150
- What?
- Her mom has five previous convictions.

94
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,960
Aigoo, she's a professional.

95
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,900
In this field, there's a pride experienced
by someone with five convictions.

96
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,370
"We have five stars," something like that.

97
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,780
I see.

98
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,510
But there's a story there.

99
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,090
I think you should read the letter.

100
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,300
Geez...

101
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,450
I have my story, too.

102
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,450
I have no time to care for small cases.

103
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,930
I shouldn't say that, huh?

104
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,720
There's no such a thing as small trials.

105
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,350
Let me look.

106
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,130
Let's see...

107
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,530
She went to an amusement park and

108
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:14,410
she threw a fit for not getting on the roller coaster.

109
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,270
She pushed a part-timer, and he fell into the track.

110
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,030
Hospital treatment for three weeks?

111
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,040
Indictment without detention with a settlement.

112
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,170
Since she has previous
convictions, 2-3 million won in fine.

113
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,150
As for business interference, don't make it
so obvious as to you're siding with the corporate.

114
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,860
Six months in prison and a year on probation.

115
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,200
Trial adjourned!

116
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,510
Let's go home.

117
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,570
We should go home on time, too.

118
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,740
No.

119
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,260
Besides this one, I have to finish
everything here by tomorrow.

120
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,450
Move, move, move.

121
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,430
Let's not overwork. Let's go.

122
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,700
- I'll give you a ride home.
- It's okay.

123
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,340
You couldn't even go home because of me.

124
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,290
This way please.

125
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,180
Oh, no, Your Honor!

126
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,280
Did you always live away from your parents?

127
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,110
They emigrated to Singapore.

128
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,840
Oh, Singapore! Nice!

129
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,300
Someone I know...

130
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,900
runs a small casino in Manila.

131
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,070
He tells me to come and visit all the time,
but haven't been able to.

132
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,250
Manila is in the Philippines.

133
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,440
Right, Philippines.

134
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,210
It's near Singapore.

135
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,570
Your Honor.

136
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,080
When you finish a very tough trial,

137
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
do you drink like that?

138
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,790
Well, the trials...

139
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,300
The one receiving the ruling faces
hard time, not the one presiding it.

140
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,560
How did you endure?

141
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,780
Endure what?

142
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,920
You gave out so many rulings to so many people.

143
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,680
I don't know how you live with such a burden.

144
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,520
You can't sentence a harsher
sentence even if you want to

145
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,530
and you can't release someone
when you want to, I'm sure.

146
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,960
You had to give a ruling like yesterday even.

147
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,840
How did you endure that?

148
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,910
Just...

149
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,850
think of it as a job that pays.

150
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,480
Think of it as making a living.

151
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,050
I used to think to be a judge must be a lonely job.

152
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,150
But seeing you yesterday...

153
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:40,250
made me think it's a sad job.

154
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,950
What's so sad?

155
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,930
A judge is the king in this field.

156
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,060
You know you're not.

157
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,880
I think Go Yang Ja case will be like that, too.

158
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,790
Her daughter is visually impaired.

159
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,070
They were out together when she was young.

160
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,610
She bumped into a pedestrian.

161
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,510
And she said she's sorry...

162
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,330
and do you know what he said?

163
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,670
What did he say?

164
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,890
"Why is a blind roaming around at night?"

165
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,370
So she got into a fight and had to
pay fine for suing each other.

166
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,530
That's how she got her first conviction.

167
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,970
People think it's hard, but

168
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,070
getting a criminal record is easier than you think.

169
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,890
When she went to buy a computer,

170
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,070
someone said, "Why buy a computer for a blind?"

171
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,700
And she got into another fight.

172
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,960
Even the incident at the amusement park is similar.

173
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,770
I'm asking you why you're isolating us!

174
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,320
If the roller coaster breaks down or there's an accident,

175
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,330
it's hard to evacuate a visually impaired
person, so we give a safety review.

176
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,920
[ Caution ]
Oh, this? I know how to read.

177
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,000
As long as I read it, it's good, right?

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,640
In front of everyone,

179
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,030
you're trying to embarrass her!

180
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,920
That's not it.

181
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm doing this to ensure safety.

182
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,400
Not safety...

183
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,780
It's uncomfortable with a disabled person.

184
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,050
You're trying to scare us and not have us ride this!

185
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,180
Everyone's waiting!

186
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,340
If you pick her out and give her a safety tip here,

187
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,550
don't you realize she becomes a spectacle?

188
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,850
You're hurting her! Why can't you consider that?

189
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,460
Bring your supervisor.

190
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,750
The manager orders us to do a safety review.

191
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,140
I'm not talking to you anymore!

192
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,960
Bring your supervisor!

193
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,050
Stop it already!

194
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,650
I'll never go anywhere with you again!

195
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,070
Cho Won, you sit down.

196
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,790
Bring your supervisor!

197
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,350
She was always looked down upon

198
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,650
and was discriminated against.

199
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,410
Even so, the part-timer who was
trying to save up for college...

200
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,520
what wrong did he do?

201
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,600
I mean...

202
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,600
this much fine and these many years in jail.

203
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,450
I have to write like that.

204
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,440
He's explaining nicely in case of danger.

205
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,320
What did he do so wrong?

206
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,480
People who have been hurt a lot

207
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,350
feel kindness as discrimination at times.

208
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,850
Do you consider all that over a ruling?

209
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,550
Yes.

210
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,550
But they're thoughts

211
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,130
that aren't helpful for writing ruling at all.

212
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,540
You make it so difficult.

213
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,050
I'm not fit to be a judge, huh?

214
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,430
No, you're not.

215
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,450
But I'm still curious.

216
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,450
Is it that dangerous to do a special safety review...

217
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,980
Is punishment the only thing that's doable by law?

218
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,420
Coming home when it's still so light out

219
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,230
makes me feel I'm doing something wrong.

220
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,540
Rest up. You can be tardy tomorrow.

221
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,780
What?

222
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,390
He leaves without saying bye.

223
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,080
I didn't say bye.

224
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,090
- I've never driven anyone. Bye.
- Bye.

225
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,850
[ Joo Eun ]

226
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,980
The call is not going through. You'll be
connected to the voicemail.

227
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,260
It's urgent. Should I come to the courthouse?

228
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,160
Oppa, I have to see you.

229
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,550
You don't have time to come to the station, huh?

230
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,650
I'm really busy.

231
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,450
Okay. I'll come to the courthouse.

232
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,780
Oh, no!

233
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,390
I'm busy,

234
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,760
but I'm home.

235
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,570
Okay, I'll come to your place.

236
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,790
No.

237
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,150
I'll come.

238
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,250
How is it?

239
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,760
This is how they distort people's kindness.

240
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,090
There's no problem with that?

241
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,760
It's just a box of golf balls.

242
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,470
Our Chief Justice got a worse
bribe from the Blue House.

243
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,580
Are there any laws that can be applied?

244
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,660
Article, code, and whatnot.

245
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,280
A professional legal opinion would be better.

246
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,450
A phone call.

247
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,120
Unlawful referrals and

248
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,180
prohibition of transmission of money...

249
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,360
It's against the Code of Ethics.

250
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,020
Kim Young Ran law.

251
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,290
Right.

252
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,240
It can influence carrying out their duty,

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,310
so shouldn't gift anything above 50,000 won.

254
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,850
85,000 won...

255
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,240
It's 35,000 won above per person.

256
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,520
I believe it's illegal.

257
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,400
It's only 105,000 all combined.

258
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,280
"That much is okay" or "That can't be..."

259
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,080
I'm sure there'd be vast opinions.

260
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,730
I believe the ruling on this case will

261
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,660
affect the ethical values of our society.

262
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,900
Of course! A budding legal professional!

263
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,440
I told you to go home early. Sorry to call you.

264
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,130
See you tomorrow.

265
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,710
A man who stole a pack of
cigarettes at a convenience store

266
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,970
received a 8 months prison sentence.

267
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:10,220
It's above 35,000 won per person.

268
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,700
Total of 105,000 won.

269
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,570
In violation of Kim Young Ran law.

270
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,730
Some may say that's not much.

271
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,420
But the ruling will be the guiding light

272
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,530
to our ethical values in our society.

273

[ Song So Eun ]

274
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,950
And a man in his 20s went into a convenience
store and stole a pack of cigarettes

275
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,250
received a 8 months in jail.

276
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,140
No, I mean, he got that.

277
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,450
A man in his 30s who stole 2 packs of
cigarettes received a year in jail.

278
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,850
For an amount that's worth less than 10,000 won,

279
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,170
a year in prison was sentenced. So could 105,000 won

280
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,400
be considered small?

281

Who is it?

282
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,910
The man who stole cigarettes? Wait...

283
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,330
No.

The one you called.

00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,320
A trainee learning about the judiciary.

286
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,670
- It was a woman's voice.
- Yeah.

287
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:14,360
She's smart. She's good at her job, too.

288
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,570
Is she pretty?

289
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,520
Totally.

290
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,520
Her temper is catty and docile both.

291
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,770
She flips back and forth. Charming.

292

She's not my style though.

293
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,110
I know she's not your style.

294
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,450
But I don't want to misunderstand.

295
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:37,610
I'd hate to be jealous as well.

296
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,920
Don't make me be childish.

297
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,580
She's just a trainee.

298
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,750
You sounded so affectionate.

299
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,350
I've never heard that from you.

Don't change your glance back and forth.

Bye.

00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,690
I must look put together today.

Put together.

I'm not sure.

316
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,180
We should do it now. When else would we do that?

317
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,470
- The procedure is...
- How come?

318
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,250
A judge wants to do it. Can't I?

319
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,890
No, you can.

320
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,230
You can, but...

321
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,570
If you do this so suddenly...

322
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,860
The procedure is so... This is too much, Your Honor.

323
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,610
I can't be too much as a judge?

324
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,040
No, you can.

325
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,320
But for me to take care of this within a few hours...

326
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,550
That's really...

327
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,440
- You can do it, right?
- I can.

328
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,140
Because of that today...

329
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,550
I'm dressed to look all put together. You know?

330
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,250
Please.

331
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,350
I'll be back.

332
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,850
- Fighting!
- Fighting!

333
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,470
You took this from me yesterday.

334
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,530
Yes.

335
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,790
That's why I'm giving them back.

336
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,150
Am I doing all this again?

337
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,350
I realize this whenever I see these documents.

338
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,440
So Eun, you're so precious.

339
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,210
For me to do all this before I go home,

340
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,980
I really might die.

341
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,410
You should've made me work late last night.

342
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,850
You'll work late tonight.

343
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,160
Fighting!

344
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,360
You can sleep. It's okay.

345
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,030
No, it's okay.

346
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,010
I'm not sleepy at all.

347
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,140
♫ The world has never once  ♫

348
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,350
♫ listened to me  ♫

349
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,790
♫ I speak and I speak  ♫

350
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,320
♫ but it just comes back to me in a low echo  ♫

351
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,280
♫ We all live weary days  ♫

352
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,200
♫ Is it okay to lean on each other?  ♫

353
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,160
♫ You brought me small
comfort, a shadow in my life  ♫

354
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,780
♫ Like a giant ♫

355
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,080
♫ The world wants everything I have ♫

356
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,580
♫ wants to take away much more ♫

357
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,390
We're here.

358
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,910
I'm sorry! I dozed off.

359
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,370
Let's go.

360
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,750
I thought you were meeting a lawyer.

361
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,790
I'm supposed to meet him here.

362
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,340
In an amusement park?

363
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,200
You said you're not sure.

364
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,600
Whether kindness can be
considered discrimination.

365
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,200
A judge is here. They should light fireworks.

366
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,280
Geez!

367
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,000
Thank you for your cooperation.

368
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,950
The date for the ruling is close. Please excuse us.

369
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,390
This is Judge Han Soo Ho.

370
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,750
They're the amusement park
manager and the management team.

371
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,680
And this is Lawyer Oh Sang Cheol
who's representing their case.

372
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,880
Your Honor?

373
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,410
I'm sorry to bother you this late at night.

374
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,100
You sued Go Yang Ja for business interference, right?

375
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,830
If the roller coaster stops on the track,

376
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,270
is it difficult for a visually impaired to be moved?

377
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,350
We determined that it won't be as
easy compared to a normal person.

378
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,650
In line with safety guidelines,

379
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,950
we provide more than enough
explanation to the defendant.

380
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,250
Is it that hard to evacuate a disabled person?
To give a safety review separately?

381
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,550
- Yes, that's right.
- Have you tried?

382
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,050
We've arrived at a deductive reason
for similar regulations as customary.

383
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,300
Deductive reasoning isn't enough.

384
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,200
I'll go up, cover my eyes, and try to evacuate.

385
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,540
I have to know how dangerous it is to
see if the safety review is justified.

386
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,960
I...

387
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,840
came prepared.

388
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,070
Judge...

389
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,670
let's talk for a moment.

390
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,250
Soo Ho.

391
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,450
That's not the issue in business interference.

392
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,530
Educating a disabled person in a public place

393
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,700
can be felt as discrimination.

394
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,950
That's a civil case no matter how you
look at it. This is a criminal case.

395
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,190
A civil or criminal case between friends?

396
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,450
Let me talk to my client.

397
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,130
Come... come down from there?

398
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,000
Aigoo, I'm not going alone.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,500
Section Leader Jo will come with me.

400
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,690
Me?

401
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,620
Why me?

402
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,620
I'll cover my eyes. I need help.

403
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,450
Why are you doing this to me?

404
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,120
And I'm allergic to roller coasters.

405
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,130
Then, do you want to be
blindfolded? I'll be your guide.

406
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,890
Your Honor.

407
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,870
Even if we understand the defendant's perspective,

408
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,630
the woman brought her daughter
who is visually impaired

409
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,630
and should be moved to safety
in case of an emergency.

410
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:29,720
Even if you cover your eyes,

411
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,990
a healthy adult man evacuating

412
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,990
is not close to the real experience.

413
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,810
When a roller coaster stops, everyone's the same.

414
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:41,030
Why can't it be a man?

415
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,200
We believe it's an unfair reenactment.

416
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,710
And if I insist?

417
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,740
It's not the same experience

418
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,010
so we won't accept.

419
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,180
I'll do it.

420
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,790
You can't.

421
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,110
It's dangerous.

422
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,950
So Eun.

423
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,070
You...

424
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,780
can't go up high.

425
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,950
Acrophobia.

426
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,150
He's my college sunbae.

427
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,350
Then...

428
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,050
Okay...

429
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,110
Get on this, right?

430
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,900
Darn...

431
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,270
Okay.

432
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,650
It's not an escape. It's an evacuation.

433
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,540
No need to put your life on the line.

434
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,940
If you're scared, quit in the middle.

435
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,570
I...

436
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,160
really wanted to do this.

437
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,020
You know how they rent the entire amusement park

438
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,550
and going on a date. It's the same thing.

439
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,650
Of course, we're not on a date.

440
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,670
I'm so excited!

441
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:48,200
In case of an emergency, I'll be standing here.

442
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,780
I'll do exactly as I'm supposed to guide.

443
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,260
Passengers!

444
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,120
Due to problems we can't identify,

445
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,170
we have stopped for an emergency.

446
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,250
Please don't be nervous

447
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,940
and follow the instructions.

448
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,350
I'll hold you from now on.

449
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,450
Please come down the emergency stairs.

450
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,450
Do not run and

451
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,860
move slowly.

452
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,970
You can follow me down.

453
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,450
Let's go.

454
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,540
Slowly.

455
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,260
Are you okay? So Eun. You're okay.

456
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,170
Here.

457
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,270
So Eun. So Eun.

458
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,700
It's okay.

459
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,240
You did good coming thus far.

460
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,660
Okay, I'll take off the blindfold.

461
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,030
Oh, wait.

462
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,050
Wait.

463
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,430
I...

464
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,150
I can do this.

465
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,570
I'm... I'm not scared.

466
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,170
You can quit.

467
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,430
No.

468
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,750
I'm not scared.

469
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,260
Okay.

470
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,480
I'm going.

471
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,020
Now.

472
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,970
So Eun. So Eun?

473
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:02,910
Whether a person or a thing, you become
more fearful if you hold on too tightly.

474
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:05,530
Scared that everything would disappear.

475
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,500
It's better to loosen up.

476
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,700
Got it?

477
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,070
Relax a little bit.

478
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,830
There.

479
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,950
Relax a little more.

480
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,650
A bit more.

481
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,140
This is good.

482
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,050
Next...

483
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,250
Should we lift your left foot or right foot?

484
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,450
Left foot...

485
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,680
No, no, right foot.

486
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,120
Okay, okay, okay. It doesn't matter.

487
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,580
Okay, any foot will do.

488
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,150
I'll go with you.

489
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,090
Let's go.

490
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,260
There...

491
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,770
About 30 meters to the stairs.

492
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,550
Wow...

493
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,350
It's nice to rent out an amusement park.

494
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,490
I wonder how much it costs.

495
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,050
25 meters to the steps.

496
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,670
When I make about 1 billion won,

497
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,830
I'll try to rent it.

498
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,210
Okay...

499
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,750
♫ No matter how much I fill up ♫

500
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:25,480
♫ I keep becoming less than ♫

501
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,580
♫ My wandering days ♫

502
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,280
♫ I just wanted to give up ♫
