1
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,670
Just think of it as making money.

2
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,670
Just think of it as making a living.

3
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,040
Arrogant bastard.

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,740
Where are you?

5
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,770
Han Soo Ho.

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,350
Survey for the students of the
Judicial Training Institute

7
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,960
Which legal expert would you like to
invite for a special lecture?

8
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,450
You know the 30th and last
question on the survey?

9
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,610
Yeah, the special guest lecturer.

10
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,970
If you haven't filled it out yet,
list the judge I work for.

11
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,770
Judge Han Soo Ho.

12
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,480
He's been on the news. Haven't you seen?

13
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,040
Yes, that's correct, Unni.
He put Lee Ho Sung behind bars.

14
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,750
He's the judge mentoring me.

15
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:55,780
It would be nice to attend
his lecture together.

16
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,240
If Noona tells you to nominate
someone, just do it.

17
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,250
If you don't listen to me...

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,680
I'll tell everyone you fainted
at the autopsy observation.

19
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,600
Why would you ask that?

20
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,250
Yes, he's handsome.

21
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,150
Oh, c'mon!

22
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,290
It's not like that!

23
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,970
Hello, Your Honor.

24
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,680
- Did you sleep okay?
- Yes.

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,300
Wow, I was almost late.

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,040
Oh, I see! Go ahead inside.

27
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,880
Aren't you going inside?

28
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,050
- You go first.
- Sure.

29
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,590
- Are you waiting for someone?
- Yes!

30
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,630
I mean, no.

31
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,030
You're here.

32
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,210
Is the judge still out there?

33
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,920
He's standing outside.
Did something happen?

34
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,780
We don't know.

35
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,970
He's been out there since 8:20 a.m.

36
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,190
He was like that when I arrived at 8.

37
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,900
I don't know why.

38
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,400
Is he waiting for someone?

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,780
Hello, this is Judge Han Soo Ho's office.

40
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,580
Han Soo Ho, you bastard.

41
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,810
If you show up...

42
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,640
Your Honor!

43
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,130
The Chief Judge is calling.

44
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,740
Tell him I'm in the bathroom.

45
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,360
I did, but...

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,190
What happened to your cell phone?

47
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,290
What about my phone?

48
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,560
Your Honor!

49
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,310
What happened to your cell phone?

50
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,010
My cell? I have it.

51
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,050
The calls won't go through.

52
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,450
Here you go.

53
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,710
This number has been deactivated
by the customer's request...

54
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,120
Everyone's calling the office
because they can't reach you.

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,380
Did you change your number?

56
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,930
The number... I...

57
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,880
I need to take care of one thing.

58
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,430
It's not like he has debt
collectors chasing him.

59
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,950
What's going on?

60
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,100
- Can you see if this works?
- What?

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,400
Can't you check whether
the card works or not?

62
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,500
No, but if you buy something, I can run it.

63
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,970
The pads will be 7,700 won.

64
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,290
It's buy one get one free,
so you can get another one.

65
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,480
Just run the card!

66
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,530
Okay.

67
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,840
It's declined.

68
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,970
Han Soo Ho, you bastard.

69
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,650
What are you doing behind my back?

70
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,850
Good morning!

71
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,340
Where have you been?

72
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,700
The Chief Judge waited for you and left.

73
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,380
No one else came by?

74
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,160
Who else?

75
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,940
I didn't come by, did I?

76
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,650
What?

77
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,950
Nothing.

78
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,780
Fighting today as well!

79
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,650
Is it me?

80
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,840
Me?

81
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,960
This is Han Soo Ho's personal safe?

82
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,320
What do you want? What? What?

83
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,810
It's not what you think.

84
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,780
The hole looked very big.

85
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,180
I need to see if it has to get checked out.

86
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,600
It's not what you think, So Eun!

87
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,670
Yes.

88
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,460
I knocked but you didn't answer.

89
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,550
You were so focused, so I was waiting.

90
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,150
Right.

91
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,720
Here.

92
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,320
What is this?

93
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,450
It's the appeals petition by Hwang Tae Yeol
from the 911 responder assault case.

94
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,450
I think you should call him in as
a witness and talk to him.

95
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,050
Oh, sure. Let's do that.

96
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,450
Also, they did a survey at the Training Institute.

97
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,900
We had to nominate a legal expert
to invite as a special lecturer.

98
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,030
I chose you.

99
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,450
Thank you.

100
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,230
I told all my classmates to nominate you, too.

101
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,210
But after promoting Team Han for a while,

102
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,760
it felt like I was running a political campaign.

103
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,590
My classmates had all heard about you too

104
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,850
and really like you.

105
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,580
So I was really happy.

106
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,850
Thank you.

107
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,230
If you are selected,

108
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,700
please agree to give a lecture.

109
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,990
Of course, I will since it's your request.

110
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,180
A special lecture?

111
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,750
- You want me to give a lecture?
- Yes.

112
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,360
To students at the Judicial Training Institute?

113
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,320
Yes.

114
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,350
For someone like me...

115
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,030
That makes no sense.

116
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,040
You don't know what you're saying!

117
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,310
Why, Your Honor?

118
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,360
No, absolutely not!

119
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,060
You want the country to collapse?

120
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,090
Never! My goodness!

121
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,300
Instead, I'll make another wish come true.

122
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,140
What wish?

123
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,460
Anything! Whatever!

124
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,050
The lecture.

125
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,700
Except that! Anything but that.

126
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,110
But I called all my classmates

127
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,460
until late last night.

128
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,180
I told them you were the best.

129
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,650
I...

130
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,060
So Eun...

131
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,150
I...

132
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,360
I don't know that much about law.

133
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,380
Same here.

134
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,770
When I was in school,
everything seemed clear.

135
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,950
But in the real world...

136
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,010
I really don't know what law is.

137
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,660
But...

138
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,050
I've never met anyone who admits that.

139
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,300
You're the first to say you
don't know much about law.

140
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,390
Actually, the person who
wants to hear your lecture...

141
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,680
is me.

142
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,250
I see.

143
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,590
I can't for other people

144
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,000
but someday, I'll tell you everything.

145
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,960
All of it.

146
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,260
Although that...

147
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,300
will not be a lecture.

148
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,740
Thank you.

149
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,570
You promise, right?

150
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,180
Yes.

151
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,410
Someday.

152
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,880
The judge said he'd give
me five years in prison

153
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,000
and have me arrested in court.

154
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,340
I think he means it.

155
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,670
Right.

156
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,170
What do you mean by "right"?

157
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,870
We can't accept this.

158
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,460
If I took this on by myself,

159
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,020
you said you'd get me out on probation.

160
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,660
Lee Ho Sung got seven years
and was out in a week.

161
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,430
Even if you're arrested in court,

162
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,430
I'll get you out in a week or two.

163
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,390
What about my reputation?

164
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,800
My reputation takes me to heaven and hell.

165
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,590
What about my life?

166
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,870
Do you want to tell the truth, then?

167
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,090
If we add on perjury
and chronic drug use...

168
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,870
is it better...

169
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,600
for your reputation?

170
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,580
You promised.

171
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,600
You said you'd take care of it.

172
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,730
I can't trust you

173
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,910
nor Ho Sung oppa anymore.

174
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,870
Trust whom then?

175
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,050
Huh?

176
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,440
Is that judge going to hand you a commercial?

177
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,650
Is Han Soo Ho going to invest
in a project you star in?

178
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,650
Why are you so naive

179
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,520
about whom you should trust?

180
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,700
Let me meet with Ho Sung oppa.

181
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,060
I want a clear answer.

182
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,140
I'm his legal representative.

183
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,880
You can just talk to me.

184
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,850
Please save me. I don't want to die like this.

185
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,800
Miss Park Hae Na,

186
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,540
this is really the end.

187
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,890
Just do what you've been doing.

188
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,370
Next week...

189
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,990
it'll all be over.

190
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,060
If we continue this way,

191
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,410
I might actually die.

192
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,370
I don't want to die like this,

193
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,270
but I really want to die.

194
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,750
I'll try to reach him.

195
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,120
Now...

196
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,210
see you in court.

197
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,940
Hey, Hae Na.

198
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,930
These guys are snakes.

199
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,200
If a frog cries,

200
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,930
would a snake not eat it?

201
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:39,300
You had the wrong strategy.

202
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,060
Your tears...

203
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,950
are not a weapon.

204
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,630
Based on my calculations,

205
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,930
I think it's over 60 percent.

206
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,260
What is?

207
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,710
My classmates who nominated
you for the special lecture.

208
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,670
Wow, you don't seem it,
but you're persistent.

209
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,850
I promised to give only you a special lecture.

210
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,280
Yes, but you didn't say when.

211
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,640
I will. Someday.

212
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,730
Do you know how cruel
the word "someday" is?

213
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,160
Between hope and despair,

214
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,990
it tortures you until the end.

215
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,150
Someday will come

216
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,220
but I wish it wouldn't.

217
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,870
Hello, Hyung.

218
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,210
You should have resigned when I told you to!

219
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,760
Get ready to be summoned.

220
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,470
See you later, Hyung.

221
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,100
What is it?

222
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,260
Why? What is it?

223
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,850
[ Summoned to the
Judicial Disciplinary Committee ]

224
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,510
You are summoned to the
Judicial Disciplinary Committee.

225
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,440
It's happening after all.

226
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,340
This is a ridiculous gesture.

227
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,820
Why you?

228
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,780
Negligence of duties.

229
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,460
Maintenance of dignity.

230
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,900
I've observed a lot of trials

231
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,710
and never seen anyone who
works harder than you.

232
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,730
Plus, as for maintaining dignity...

233
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,080
it's more important for
a judge to maintain

234
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,410
their true heart than their dignity.

235
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,590
Don't worry.

236
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,110
No matter what wrongs they
commit, judges don't get fired.

237
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,010
A long time ago,

238
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:09,770
who got caught drunk driving, right?

239
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,820
Yes.

240
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,260
I believe he got a warning
from the Disciplinary Committee.

241
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,880
What about the judge who took
creepy pictures on the subway?

242
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,870
He was suspended for four months.

243
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,600
Prostitution.

244
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,530
There was even a judge who
got caught at the scene, right?

245
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,300
If my memory serves correct,

246
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,490
his pay was cut for three months.

247
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,930
See?

248
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,880
If it were anyone else, they would
have been fired and arrested.

249
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,320
This is why being a judge is great.

250
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,820
I mean, you don't even

251
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,650
have to appear. You can just
send in a letter of apology.

252
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,410
I've been hearing

253
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,780
from classmates who are
training in other offices

254
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,120
that you would get a disciplinary hearing
for putting Lee Ho Sung behind bars.

255
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,320
It seemed so ridiculous.

256
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,830
I didn't believe it.

257
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,780
There are many unbelievable
stories in Korea's judicial branch.

258
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,770
After the disciplinary hearing...

259
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,680
they'll exploit that

260
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,940
to prevent you from being rehired, they said.

261
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,090
I told you, I'm leaving anyway.

262
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,860
Before the disciplinary hearing,

263
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,520
I just need to finish up one trial.

264
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,760
Even if you are leaving anyway,

265
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,450
this can't be how you go.

266
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,520
It's okay.

267
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,290
It's not okay with me.

268
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,090
If they decide you're not
qualified to be a judge,

269
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,900
what does that say about me
who said you were the best?

270
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,950
That...

271
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,480
means you were wrong.

272
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,650
- Your Honor!
- Stop it.

273
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,160
Let's just go eat.

274
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,910
You promised to be with me

275
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,640
until the end of my training.

276
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,080
You have to fight.

277
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,950
As a judge with nothing to be ashamed of,

278
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,630
you have to fight until the very end.

279
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,660
It's pointless to fight with the judges.

280
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,550
You have to win.

281
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,090
If you get disciplined,

282
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,780
it's as if I'm being punished, too.

283
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,370
I know I'm a lowly trainee.

284
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,610
I can't help you even if I want to.

285
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,960
But because I can't do anything,

286
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,140
I feel that much more desperate.

287
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,270
I request an answer, Your Honor.

288
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,790
You're persistent.

289
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,350
What do you feel like eating?

290
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,200
Soju.

291
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,640
And appetizers?

292
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,020
Beer.

293
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,400
Let's go.

294
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,670
Beer is best with soju.

295
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,960
Hold on.

296
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,050
Hello?

297
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,200
Right now?

298
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,020
What threat are you making today?

299
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,750
- Let's go.
- Where?

300
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,460
Our friends are all gathered.

301
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,930
I don't have any friends.

302
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,660
I knew you'd be like this,
so I came to get you.

303
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,880
Let's go.

304
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,270
If you tell me to go, do I have to?

305
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,730
We need to finish up Park Hae Na's case.

306
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,010
Let's go.

307
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,290
Hello, Your Honor.

308
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,940
You know how many times I've called?

309
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,550
Give me your new number.

310
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,420
They're all inside.

311
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,030
I'll go in first.

312
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,230
What?

313
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,170
I need your time today.

314
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,250
What time?

315
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,810
You promised to meet the pianist lady.

316
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,190
I already told her about it.

317
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,750
Told her what? I have a girlfriend.

318
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,110
The anchor lady must be fun to date

319
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,910
but she's not wife material.

320
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,960
Ahjumma,

321
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,760
don't waste your time.

322
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,240
Who's in there?

323
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,530
Why are you calling me ahjumma?

324
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,720
Why are you talking like that?

325
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,830
Who's in there?

326
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,020
Hey, f***er.

327
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,670
Public official!

328
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,620
Hey, Judge Han, why is it
so hard to see you?

329
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,150
- Have a seat.
- You made it.

330
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,680
I know you're busy, but...

331
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,370
You never come to our gatherings.

332
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,000
Hey, Soo Ho.

333
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,590
I'll call you by name in private.

334
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,060
You and I are friends?

335
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,430
What's wrong with you?

336
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,050
We all decided to be friends.

337
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,860
Hey, alcohol could make
his memory fuzzy.

338
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,800
Have a drink and let's take it slow.

339
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,870
The night is young. Cheers!

340
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,500
I did drugs with these guys.

341
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,860
Hae Na was there. You know that.

342
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,400
But...

343
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,920
why are you doing this to me?

344
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,760
Be more specific.

345
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,170
Although I don't know if
I'll answer specifically.

346
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,720
Specifics?

347
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,710
I know we're friends, but you're just a judge.

348
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,850
Ho Sung, let's calm down a bit.

349
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,080
I'll calm down when he makes some sense.

350
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,600
Min Gook will inherit Choi Hospital.

351
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,510
In Kyu partied because he's taking
over his father's business.

352
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,940
Did drugs, too.

353
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,810
Lawyer Oh made a hot issue of
reporters going in and out

354
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,770
and you hastened the mood, and off we went!

355
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,400
All you need to do is not let things cool down

356
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,360
and wrap up the trial very quickly.

357
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,310
I...

358
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,910
thought you were onboard our boat for sure.

359
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,700
The defendant is not a cold-hearted criminal.

360
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,390
What has been reported in
the media is not all true.

361
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,050
Watch what you're saying.

362
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,320
I don't rule with public opinion.

363
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,450
The defendant has a
developmental disability.

364
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,500
It was not an intentional murder.

365
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,450
Please accept as evidence the
opinion of the psychologist.

366
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,710
You didn't accept it as evidence.

367
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,640
You determined that the mistake
by the mentally challenged was murder.

368
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,370
You sentenced him to death.

369
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,820
The press sang a happy song.

370
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,600
Thanks to you, our scandal
became old news. Hey!

371
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,030
At that...

372
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,810
You're not a friend, but an accomplice.

373
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,170
Just say he's a friend.

374
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,840
- For an accomplice, he's...
- Be quiet!

375
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,630
But now.

376
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,730
You have me arrested in court.

377
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,810
You threaten Hae Na.

378
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:36,000
Why are you being like this?

379
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,980
Look at me.

380
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,550
Are you repenting or something?

381
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,560
Enough of this.

382
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,120
Just leave it alone.

383
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,440
They need to talk it out.

384
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,890
You threatened Hae Na with five years,
and now she wants to commit suicide.

385
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,380
Her death would be bad enough.

386
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,810
What if she mentions my name
in her suicide note?

387
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,380
How could I hold my head
up with that shame?

388
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,440
You...

389
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,760
How much are you getting from Han Young?

390
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,290
You're not...

391
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,920
betraying us for a mere billion won, are you?

392
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,780
Wrap up the trial.

393
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,260
Resign from your judge post
and join our company.

394
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,290
You all can be partners
in the legal department.

395
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,960
We'll negotiate your salary later.

396
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,470
I'll throw in an advance signing fee.

397
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,450
Blank check.

398
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,830
Write down the amount you want.

399
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,150
We'll process it right away.

400
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,870
Soo Ho,

401
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,210
let's fly freely together

402
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,920
over this vast world.

403
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,600
Hey.

404
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,970
What are you doing?

405
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,480
Our runaway friend is back,
so we should toast!

406
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,620
Hey, drink this.

407
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,500
Hey, hold this.

408
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,450
I have to prepare for the trial tomorrow.

409
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,900
If it's a blank check...

410
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,010
how much can I ask for?

411
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,520
You have too much pride.

412
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,850
I'm leaving.

413
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,240
That damn judge's pride.

414
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:27,240
Oh, my Hae Na!

415
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,070
Hello, Your Honor.

416
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,730
Judge Han,

417
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,010
have one more drink.

418
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,800
I thought you liked her.

419
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,420
You said you were a fan.

420
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,890
Huh?

421
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,260
Long time no see.

422
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,080
Are you done?

423
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,290
I get why you said I couldn't win.

424
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,480
I told you.

425
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,100
Your group and my group are different.

426
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,710
Are you here to laugh at me?

427
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,010
The day after tomorrow is the
disciplinary hearing, right?

428
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,310
You're going to get suspended
and won't be rehired.

429
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:35,030
That's the way it's planned.

430
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,020
But you know why today happened?

431
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,170
Until the day you get disciplined

432
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:45,760
you need to lay low and not go crazy.

433
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,450
Write the amount you want
and bring it to me.

434
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,160
Then I'll cancel your disciplinary hearing
and let you resign honorably.

435
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,710
Then...

436
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:02,660
you can just work under me.

437
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,410
A judge's face.

438
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,870
Go on in.

439
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,010
I know it's a blank check, but
don't go writing 22 trillion won.

440
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,890
Got it?

441
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,440
I did it.

442
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,310
I accomplished something big.

443
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,300
All right, okay.

444
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,950
Making money is easy.
