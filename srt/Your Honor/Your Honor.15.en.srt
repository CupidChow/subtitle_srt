1
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,350
- You said it's your friend's birthday.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,140
A birthday party at a place like this?

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,680
How rich is he?

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,970
He's not rich. His father is.

5
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,830
Just like you, Oppa.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,450
Hi, long time no see.

7
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,920
How are you?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,760
This is Kang In Gyu.

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,370
This is my hoobae, So Eun. Song So Eun.

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,900
- Is she your hoobae or girlfriend?
- I'm still a hoobae.

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,230
I don't know about in the future.

12
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,630
Can I put myself into your unclear future?

13
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,580
Hey... No, you can't.

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,800
She's studying for the bar.

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
- She has no time.
- Hey!

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,700
How are you?

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,340
- Long time no see.
- Hi.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,500
Hey, brother...

19
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,380
Wow, long time no see.

20
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,100
How have you been? I want to introduce you to...

21
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,090
What's wrong?

22
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,940
So Eun.

23
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,520
Are you all right?

24
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
I would've made you some galbi
if I went grocery shopping.

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,330
Can you stay a little longer?

26
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,540
I can go buy some real quick.

27
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,000
This is enough.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,420
What do you mean? When
will you come home again?

29
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,020
This is marinated potatoes.

30
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,530
This is radish kimchi.

31
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,760
I made them this morning. Wait a few days.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,930
And this has meat and...

33
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,600
stir-fried peppers. Eat when
you don't feel like eating.

34
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,790
It will bring back appetite.

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you so devoted?

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,980
What? Take them to your hyung.

37
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,470
How about me? How about me?

38
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,940
Take them to your brother
and take some for yourself.

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,260
You want it separately?

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,470
Forget it! I won't take them!

41
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,880
- Am I a delivery man?
- You!

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,090
Go to your hyung directly. Put these
in the fridge as soon as you arrive.

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,910
- You got it?
- I got it.

44
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,520
And you...

45
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,110
You're borrowing the car, right?

46
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,730
You didn't take it from your hyung, right?

47
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,010
Don't you feel bad for saying that to me?

48
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,250
Answer me!

49
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,730
You didn't beat up your brother
and took his car, did you?

50
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,630
How can I steal the judge's car?
Do I want a death sentence?

51
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,280
Go inside. It's hot. You'll get heatstroke.

52
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,680
- What?
- Drive carefully.

53
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,230
Got it?

54
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,460
Don't scratch your brother's car.

55

Geez!

56
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,650
Yes, Judge.

57
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,500
Sorry to bother you on your
day off. Where are you?

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,550
Yes...

59
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
I'm home.

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,380
My mom packed lots of food
for me, and I can't finish it all.

61
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,890
Can you come out to the front for a second?

62
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,760
No, I can't.

63

Are you okay? Are you very sick?

75
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,340
You've got the cold sweats.

76

something for me to do?

pain in her upper abdomen.

Yes.

Fluids and painkillers are being administered.
She'll be better in three to four hours.

90
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,840
Acute gastritis?

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,480
Did she eat something bad?

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,730
That could be or a side effect to her medication.

93
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,720
Or from exhaustion or stress.

94
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,770
You can have acute gastritis over that?

95
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,930
She should eat cooked food for a while.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,700
She must finish her prescribed
medication even if she feels better.

Wait.

see if something else's wrong?

101
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,300
Tell her to finish her medication.

Oh, the family can't be here. Leave.

No, I don't think so.

No.

I didn't take any medication recently.

I made you work too much, huh?

It's not because of you, Judge.

131

Where?

There wasn't a bed nor chair for the family.

You were standing there for several hours?

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,900
But once you become the main anchor,

334
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,440
the TV station provides you with
the makeup artist and stylist.

335
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,040
I really envied that.

336
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,250
I wanted to make it to that position.

337
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,790
But I'm just a wartime anchor.

338
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,880
So useless.

339
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:31,590
It's nice to have some kind of position though.

340
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,320
If a war breaks out,

341
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,890
my voice will become their only hope.

342
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,660
It's an amazingly important position.

343
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,700
But I thought it was useless.

344
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,890
Why am I so bad?

345
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,090
Why am I so lowly?

346
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,340
I knew you'd stay quiet.

347
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,610
You don't know how to comfort people.

348
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,910
But why did you want to see me?

349
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:07,220
I missed you, but it's childish
trying to hold back.

350
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,980
By pretending to be okay when I miss you,

351
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,770
it's not like I'm valued more.

352
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,650
Why would you miss me?

353
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,100
What do you like about me?

354
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,900
I told you.

355
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,160
I liked you because you're a judge at first.

356
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,960
And next...

357
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,800
for a judge,

358
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,400
you looked so sad. And I was attracted to that.

359
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,870
But this isn't the time to talk about this.

360
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,080
You should be saying whatever you can to me.

361
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,150
Everything will work out.

362
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,390
I don't feel consoled.

363
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,600
You'll be promoted to a better position in time.

364
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,500
I'm not encouraged either.

365
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,800
Stay strong! Fighting!

366
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,020
I don't feel the love.

367
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,620
There's this person I know.

368
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,910
She doesn't fear anything.

369
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:03,470
You're a judge, Your Honor.

370
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,380
I want to ask you if that's a
proper attitude for teaching.

371
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,830
She's very good at rambling on about stuff.

372
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,030
Your Honor, you're...

373
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,470
a really bad person.

374
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,680
She's great at lying.

375
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,510
I can do this.

376
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,410
I'm not scared.

377
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,010
But...

378
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,590
she's honest about everything.

379
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,410
She's like water.

380
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:34,560
When you look at her outside,
you can also see her inside.

381
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,880
So, do you mean that I'm different inside out?

382
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,080
Yeah.

383
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,210
That comforts me.

384
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,810
Geez, cry if you want to.

385
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,000
Curse if you want to curse.

386
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
Wartime anchor?

387
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,450
The people will have hope hearing your voice?

388
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:00,630
That's after a war breaks out.

389
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,060
What's so bad about wanting a good position?

390
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,650
Receiving all kinds of benefits
climbing to the top...

391
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,500
What's so lowly about that?

392
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,690
You have to break it through
if you want to survive.

393
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,970
So unexpected.

394
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,120
I thought you'd lecture me.

395
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,700
They should take responsibility
if they led you on.

396
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,680
Hey, go up to the president's
office and let it out.

397
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,810
I'd get fired if I do that.

398
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,090
So what if you do?
Han Soo Ho will take care of you.

399
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,920
How would you do that?

400
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,440
Why are you asking me that? Ask later.

401
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,770
What will you say if I ask you later?

402
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,780
Probably that he'd take care of you!

403
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,360
It wasn't comforting, but

404
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,270
I feel somewhat comforted strangely.

405
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,100
Then, should I just go into the
president's office and throw a fit?

406
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,250
There'll be additional penalty if you
create a scene at night. Do it during daytime.

407
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,880
And if you can, don't use any weapons.

408
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,690
Oppa.

409
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,410
You keep flip-flopping from a scholar
and troublemaker these days.

410
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,490
I have to go. I have too much work to do.

411
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,590
Yeah. Okay.

412
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,480
What are you doing? We're in public.

413
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,790
Is it illegal to kiss in a public place?

414
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,730
The judge shouldn't mess up the public order.

415
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:33,170
Does it cause disarray if we kiss?

416
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
- Let's run!
- What?

417
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,730
Let's run to the parking lot.

418
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,070
It's a perfect weather for a run. I feel stuffy, too.

419
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,240
Let's go! Come!

420
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,810
C'mon!

421
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,300
Yes, Your Honor.

422
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,510
Are you feeling better?

423
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,910
Yes, much better.

424
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,020
Do you have some work for me to do?

425
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,750
- Did you eat the porridge?
- Yes.

426
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,600
I enjoyed it thanks to you.

427
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,680
I took all my medicine, too.

428
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,000
If you finished the porridge,

429
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,240
how about for tomorrow?

430
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,320
I know how to make porridge.

431
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,790
Even though I'm not that good.

432
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:33,560
I'll drop off some porridge for
you to eat tomorrow.

433
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,110
No, it's okay. I'm fine.

434
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,650
You don't like that?

435
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,520
No, it's not that.

436
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,280
I feel bad.

437
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,310
It's okay then. Wait just a bit. I'll be there soon.

438
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,820
You don't have to.

439
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,370
But I can, too.

440
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,790
Yes.

441
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,440
See you in a bit.

Raise your head.

444
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,870
Don't pretend to be remorseful. Raise your head!

445
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,280
Don't you remember?

446
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,920
Hello.

447
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,360
I'm Song So Eun. I'll be your judicial trainee.

448
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,720
I'll do my best.

449
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,540
Excuse me, but do you have a boyfriend?

450
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,160
That question isn't appropriate.

451
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,720
If I asked you despite that,
you should answer me.

452
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,300
How about you, Your Honor?

453
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,150
How could I...

454
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,310
