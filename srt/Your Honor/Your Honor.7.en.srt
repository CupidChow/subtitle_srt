1
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,430
- You scared me.
- It's okay.

2
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,190
What's wrong?

3
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,640
No one's here, everyone's out to shoot.

4
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,840
You're so cute.

5
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,310
Let's go outside, it's stuffy in here.

6
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,250
Let's go inside.

7
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
- I said let's go inside.
- What are you doing?

8
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,740
- Let's go.
- Don't!

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,110
- Let's go.
- Let go!

10
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,040
Just come with me.

11
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,140
I thought you liked me.

12
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,190
That doesn't mean I want this.

13
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,490
Well...

14
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,960
maybe someday we can sleep together

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,750
but not yet.

16
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,430
Especially not today.

17
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,970
You make me sound like a bad guy.

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,590
- Come here.
- Don't!

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,410
We'll have fun. Shh...

20
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,860
We'll have fun.

21
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,990
You are saying your legs

22
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,640
were up in a V-shape while
he sexually assaulted you.

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,680
That's what you testified.

24
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,090
Is that correct?

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,330
Yes.

26
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:05,390
Normally when victims of sexual assault resist,

27
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,830
they are not able to lift their legs up in a V-shape.

28
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,240
Did you actually resist?

29
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,260
Could you explain the
circumstances more in detail?

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
Miss Song Ji Yeon.

31
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,590
Miss Song Ji Yeon!

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,800
One thing that's clear is

33
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,300
the law is the standard with
which we divide the world.

34
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,200
Let's say this is average.

35
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,900
If you are scared of the law,

36
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,620
it means you're down here.

37
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,790
If you laugh at the law,

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,100
you're...

39
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,000
way up there.

40
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,280
This is a wish bracelet.

41
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,690
When it breaks naturally, your wish will come true.

42
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,300
- What if I break it on purpose?
- No.

43
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,340
- If someone else breaks it?
- Probably not.

44
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,540
If it doesn't break, my wish will never come true?

45
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,690
Probably not.

46
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,960
Then this is a cursed bracelet!

47
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,910
What if it never breaks?

48
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,920
Then we'll wear them forever.

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,870
No way.

50
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,890
I'll make a wish.

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,900
- Right now? Here?
- Let's do it together.

52
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,240
Unni!

53
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,570
Unni!

54
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,660
No!

55
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,670
No!

56
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,680
No, Unni!

57
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,750
Unni, you're horrible.

58
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,700
You were going to leave me alone?

59
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,090
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,110
I told you I'm going to kill him.

61
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,460
It's me, Lawyer.

62
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,810
Can we get coffee?

63
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,430
Thank you for the trial today.

64
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,240
This is for you.

65
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,320
A big one.

66
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,590
I lost my pension, too.

67
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:56,090
My family is going to starve to death.

68
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,750
Please help me, Your Honor.

69
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,120
I don't know a way out.

70
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
Please help me, Your Honor.

71
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,630
Geez!

72
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,760
He probably thought, who
dares to put me behind bars?

73
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,140
But how can he not pay for
the victim's eye surgery?

74
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,110
He even let his son lose his job.

75
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,570
Isn't that so petty?

76
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,380
That's not revenge, that's just misplaced anger.

77
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,810
The criminal is lying in a hospital
bed because he's in shock.

78
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,130
While the victim comes to me begging for his life.

79
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,610
How can this not make you angry?

80
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,760
Some people have no choice other than to die.

81
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,230
Do you know what that feels like?

82
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,080
I feel you.

83
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,060
But there's nothing we can do for them legally.

84
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,400
He hit someone and made them go blind in one eye.

85
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,570
Wouldn't be enough if he offered an eye of his own.

86
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,610
He thinks seven years is unfair?

87
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,310
In the history of homo sapiens,
humans beings never have

88
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,640
been fair.

89
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,540
We never will be, and same with the law. Why?

90
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,310
Because we made them.

91
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,780
That's what Team Leader Shin said.

92
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,780
Now that it's happened to him, he's scared.

93
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,750
That's how I feel right now.

94
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,350
I'm scared of you.

95
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,550
I know you called me up because of Lee Ho Sung.

96
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,520
But I came here to see you.

97
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,460
Let's stop talking about work.

98
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,690
Then you can go.

99
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,830
- I'll stay and finish my drink.
- So Eun.

100
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,300
I liked you, Oppa.

101
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,000
I even thought how nice it would be
to have you by my side forever.

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,650
But no.

103
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,620
You know everything.

104
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,680
You know what your father did.

105
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,590
Your friend...

106
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,600
You know what he did to my unni.

107
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,100
Is that sin...

108
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,270
on me?

109
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,710
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,610
If it's too much, you don't see me anymore.

111
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,000
Drink.

112
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,250
- Hello?
- Team Leader Shin?

113
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,760
Who is this?

114
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,440
How can you be asleep right now?

115
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,560
Listen to me.

116
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,060
Between the lettuce and the
peppers, there's money.

117
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
It's not for your living expenses.

118
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,660
It's for you to fight.

119
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,410
Take it and sue Lee Ho Sung.

120
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,870
It'll take a year or two to get to trial

121
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,480
but should be enough for your family to live on.

122
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,520
This much money...

123
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,840
who are you?

124
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,100
If I tell you, will you pay me
back? You have money?

125
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,860
Are you the judge?

126
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,900
Are you crazy?

127
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,850
Why would a judge give you money?

128
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,530
- You sound like...
 - I said no!

129
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,460
Anyway, my whole net worth
is 100 million, I gave you half.

130
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,430
I gave you half of my life.

131
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,650
So, hire the most expensive
lawyer you can, and don't give up.

132
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,550
Don't give up until the end.

133
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,700
Let us live in peace, okay?

134
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,430
Have a good night.

135
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,240
My money!

136
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,840
Who is this?

137
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,740
Hello?

138
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,620
Your Honor!

139
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,210
Are you drunk?

140
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,310
Yes.

141
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,340
I had a bit to drink.

142
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,080
It's so funny.

143
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,030
If you're scared of the law, you're way down here.

144
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,800
If you laugh at the law,

145
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,040
you're way up there.

146
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,660
So?

147
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,430
That doesn't mean anything. It's just wordplay.

148
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,740
Where are you?

149
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,220
Did you get home okay?

150
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,130
Don't pretend like you're a nice guy.

151
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,440
You abandoned someone who came to die.

152
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,830
What do you care if some trainee gets
home okay or passes out in the streets?

153
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,700
Why won't this come off?

154
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,240
You are home, right?

155
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,360
Your Honor.

156
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,920
Your Honor, you are...

157
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,570
a terrible person.

158
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,900
I have nothing to learn from you.

159
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,250
I don't want to, really.

160
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,880
Good morning.

161
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,340
One second!

162
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,750
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,640
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,690
Sorry I'm late.

165
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,390
Where's the judge?

166
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,760
In there.

167
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,100
- Trainee Song.
- Yes?

168
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Take this.

169
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,600
Why?

170
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,480
You smell like alcohol.

171
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,730
- Is it bad?
- You reek.

172
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,440
Oh, my gosh.

173
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,590
Thank you.

174
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,800
These are new cases.

175
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,530
These are the main points I summarized.

176
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:41,990
Oh, and...

177
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,270
I'm working on writing rulings for
the cases with finished defenses.

178
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,590
I'm sorry I'm late.

179
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,200
You had a lot to drink.

180
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,500
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

181
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,600
For calling you in the middle of the night.

182
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,550
Do you remember what you said?

183
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,930
Yes.

184
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,990
- I'm sorry.
- It's not a crime to be honest.

185
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,130
To be honest as well...

186
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,370
I'm an a**hole.

187
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,180
Don't learn from me.

188
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,820
One more thing!

189
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,120
I am a bad person.

190
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,190
So don't expect me to be good.

191
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,940
Lastly!

192
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,600
You did nothing wrong.

193
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,790
I made that ruling.

194
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,580
Don't be upset.

195
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,760
Take this.

196
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,600
- Dong Soo, let's move the paperwork.
- Okay.

197
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,730
- Let's go, Trainee Song.
- Yes.

198
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,750
It's time for the morning trial.

199
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,520
Sweetie, it's me.

200
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,580
I got two red lines.

201
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,120
They're so pretty.

202
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,340
I'm pregnant.

203
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,700
Let's eat at home. I'll make something good.

204
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,590
Take your time.

205
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,230
Drive safe.

206
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,300
Why aren't you saying anything?

207
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,240
Drive safe.

208
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,150
While your Blood Alcohol Content was 0.08%

209
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,770
you drove

210
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,850
and hit a pedestrian, killing her.

211
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,870
Yes.

212
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:33,650
After the accident, you did not contact the
police or make attempts to resuscitate.

213
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,580
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,130
You did not come to a settlement
with the victim's family.

215
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,300
No.

216
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,670
Did you know the victim was four weeks pregnant?

217
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,750
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,910
Nothing further.

219
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,280
Go ahead and cross-examine.

220
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,610
Defendant, after the incident

221
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:59,510
you did not take any action. Why was that?

222
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,760
You fainted from the shock
and could not take any action.

223
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,020
Yes.

224
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,790
To settle with the victim's family,

225
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,770
you attempted to contact them several times

226
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,770
but the family refused to meet.

227
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,500
It's my fault.

228
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,620
Nothing further.

229
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,000
Recommend the charges, please.

230
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,260
According to specific criminal
laws on specific crimes

231
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,830
chapter five, clause eleven

232
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,400
manslaughter by reckless driving, please sentence

233
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,850
the defendant to three years in prison.

234
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,810
Closing argument, please.

235
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,040
The defendant could not reach a settlement

236
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,410
but after the incident, she has sent letters of apology

237
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,820
to the victim's family every single day.

238
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,750
But she did not receive any responses from the family

239
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,220
so she made an effort to deposit
to the court the number of funds

240
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,380
normally rewarded in the event of death.

241
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,770
Her crime is severe

242
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,600
but she has shown deep remorse and sincere regret.

243
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,050
She has no priors or records.

244
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,860
I ask you to make a reasonable
decision so that she may

245
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,460
contribute to society in the future.

246
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,640
Sure.

247
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,940
Defendant.

248
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,520
Closing statement, please.

249
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,590
I...

250
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,520
killed a person.

251
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
I will...

252
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,500
carry that burden for all my life.

253
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,730
I am so sorry.

254
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,550
I am...

255
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,100
I...

256
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,000
I'll sentence her on the 27th, next week.

257
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,140
Stop crying.

258
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,510
Get her out of here.

259
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,490
Your Honor.

260
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,360
I am the victim's husband.

261
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,830
Please.

262
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,170
I want to tell you something.

263
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,780
Go ahead.

264
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,390
That woman...

265
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,360
is the devil.

266
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,800
Every day.

267
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,810
I fantasize about killing her.

268
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,900
If not for the law

269
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,580
I want to kill her.

270
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,660
You can't say that in the courtroom.

271
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:25,070
Recess for 15 minutes.

272

Write the ruling.

274
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,650
- Me?
- Too hard?

275
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,630
We must give a punishment that fits the crime

276
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,400
but not forget the purpose of the punishment.

277
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,510
But this one is really tough.

278
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,090
I feel bad for the victim.

279
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:14,170
But I felt for the perpetrator when she cried.

280
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,170
Little cases like this, it's best
to go with the guidelines.

281
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,910
They didn't settle, but...

282
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,040
she has no priors and deposited a lot of money.

283
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,790
Three years in prison, with good behavior

284
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,390
a year or two probably.

285
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,410
That's true.

286
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,430
But I feel weird.

287
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:33,020
You don't rule with your feelings. You do it with the law.

288
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,000
Wow, I really have nothing to learn from him.

289
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,930
You can stop crying.

290
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,180
The tears won't stop.

291
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,900
Where's this one from?

292
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,180
It's so strong.

293
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,990
Can I keep this?

294
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,900
Sure.

295
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,350
Really?

296
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,030
This is a tear stick.

297
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,590
You can apply it on your hand.

298
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,360
Before the trial, rub your eyes
and the tears will come.

299
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,560
It's important that you cry to the end today.

300
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,150
How much?

301
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,060
Five to ten minutes.

302
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,050
When the trial gets boring?

303
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,410
Watch your social media until the sentencing.

304
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,820
Drinking, going out, smiling,
seeing your boyfriend...

don't post anything.

But...

307
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,680
I heard it was easier to settle if the victim is dead.

312

I got drunk and messed up once.

313

I already spent a month in jail.

314

I'll...

315
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
get out on probation, right?

316
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,200

You told me to work on the ruling.

I'm reading the letter of remorse

- Let's go.
- No thank you.

323
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,230
You should eat.

If he works to re-try Park Hae Na

339
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,410
we can use that as a reason to not re-hire him.

340
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,560
When are you going to grow up?

341
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,220
How dare you to bring up firing a judge?

342
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,380
Aigoo.

343
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,810
I'm sorry that I raised my son all wrong.

344
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,700
Young people these days.

345
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,380
They're all straight shooters.

346
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,900
I think of it this way.

347
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,620
The judge is the Han River.

348
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,190
The prosecutor is the River Geum.

349
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,880
Us lawyers are the Nakdong River.

350
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,960
We might flow separately, but
meet in the ocean eventually.

351
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,150
We can take sides and fight

352
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,850
but we should keep a spot for
a colleague before we do.

353
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,010
Hoobaes these days don't have that attitude.

354
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,460
Like what happened with the
Supreme Court transaction scandal.

355
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,000
The young judges were asking to investigate.

356
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,430
Does that make sense?

357
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,310
Young prosecutors are the same way.

358
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,930
They're even jumping on the #metoo wagon.

359
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,900
Such an embarrassment to the organization.

360
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,580
Judge Han.

361
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,910
If he keeps flying off the handle,

362
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,210
we can submit a recusal request.

363
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,830
We're all just trying to get by.

364
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,720
We can't cut him off completely.

365
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,210
A recusal request going through...

366
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,070
is shooting for the stars.

367
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,000
Have I ever not shot a star I wanted, Hoobae?

368
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,870
You have something on him.

369
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,240
Right, Sunbae?

370
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,400
What are you doing?

371
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,200
Serve him.

372
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:40,080
You gave seven years to the heir of a corporation.

373
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,920
You delivered justice way too hard.

374
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,180
You're the number one wanted
on broadcasts, I heard.

375
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,030
I need a favor.

376
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,460
Why did you break up with your anchor girlfriend?

377
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,380
I'll give you any amount of money you want.

378
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,110
I need you to get some information.

379
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,410
I know Anchor Joo can be a little uppity

380
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,100
but she has a good reputation.

381
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,800
But maybe Your Honor prefers
more innocent types?

382
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,610
Don't change the subject.

383
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,690
When you talk like that, you seem so cold.

384
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,250
We didn't break up.

385
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,880
We had an argument.

386
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,090
We just need some time apart.

387
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:18,010
Because you resigned?

388
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,230
How do you know that?

389
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:24,330
Her judge boyfriend resigned all of a sudden.

390
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,420
That seems reason enough for an argument.

391
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,580
So.

392
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,950
What can I do for you?

393
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,570
Everything about me.

394
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,750
Good rumors, bad rumors.

395
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,960
Everything.

396
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,710
Such a wide range.

397
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:42,480
Who hates me.

398
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,070
Can't be just one or two.

399
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,100
Who hates me enough to kill me.

400
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,240
Who might really try.

401
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,180
Look out for a woman with a limp.

402
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,350
You must have an enemy in your own house.

403
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,040
Someone has been leaking information about me.

404
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,910
I don't know who the enemy is.

405
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,760
If you're really in danger,

406
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,700
why don't you go somewhere
quiet and rest for a bit?

407
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,180
I don't need to do that.

408
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,200
I got a bait that I didn't even think of.

409
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,250
Bait?

410
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,160
There's someone who I truly despise.

411
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,500
He's showing off as if he
wants to die instead of me.

412
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,100
You lost a lot of belly fat.

413
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,600
Did you work out or starve?

414
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,320
Hold on!

415
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,070
Don't come! What are you doing?

416
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,940
Hold on!

417
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,980
Stop right there.

418
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,140
What are you doing?

419
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,350
What are you doing in someone
else's house so early?

420
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,160
"You?"

421
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,170
"Someone else's house?"

422
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,970
If you were going to be so petty,
why didn't you change the passcode?

423
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,280
I'm busy!

424
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,000
What are you doing?

425
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,230
Who are you, really?

426
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,200
Me?

427
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,900
Why?

428
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,340
Are you a good person or a bad person?

429
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,060
I...

430
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,440
am sometimes good, sometimes not.

431
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,030
You're still warm.

432
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,910
Come. Let's eat.

433
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,100
Didn't we break up?

434
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,380
I have a question.

435
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,710
How much of it is true?

436
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,670
What?

437
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,770
You said you resigned, but looks like you didn't.

438
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,630
- That...
- You were going on a trip, but looks like you're not.

439
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,800
I...

440
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,040
- That...
- You said you couldn't rule because of the bribes.

441
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,760
But became a star judge.

442
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,110
Sure. Yeah.

443
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,970
You were sick of your family,
work and wanted to get away.

444
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,960
Was that an excuse to break up with me?

445
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,450
I... at the time, I...

446
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,680
Did I say that?

447
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,350
Just say you're sorry.

448
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,490
That it's all your fault.

449
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,850
Then I'll let it go.

450
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,500
Let's talk about this later.

451
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,200
I have something important...

452
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,510
I'm sorry.

453
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,800
That's not good enough.

454
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,300
It's my fault.

455
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,320
That's not good enough!

456
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,640
That's what you told me to say, so if that's not enough-

457
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,450
Don't turn me into a brave woman.
