1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
is being investigated.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,600
In a notable gesture, the prosecution
immediately requested arrest warrants.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,700
Right now, Oh Sung Group Managing Director
Lee Ho Sung, Choi Hospital's Choi Min Guk

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,640
and Hanguk University Professor Kang In Gyu
have arrived in court for their interrogation.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,830
At the scene...

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,400
Wipe it away with this, and
get those guys out.

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,280
Is it true that you fabricated the testimony?

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,960
Let's talk inside, okay?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,940
Is it true you regularly used drugs?

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,260
Who provided the drugs?

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,920
I heard you tried to destroy the evidence.
What do you say to that?

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,340
Please tell us something.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,860
We will hand out press packets later.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,460
Let's go already.

15
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,570
Wow, it's sweet.

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,490
Remember when I was on the run?

17
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,410
You got me a Korean-Chinese ID.

18
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,240
It was super useful to avoid checkpoints.

19
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,820
Thanks to you, I also got an extra conviction.

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,910
[ Han Kang Ho ]

21
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,370
You owe me half a million won.

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,970
The market price is 1.5 million won,
and you asked for two.

23
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,710
Why are you playing me?

24
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,080
I told you to take it super slow.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,330
But you rushed to get it for me.

26
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,770
You need to work on your impatience.

27
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:02,230
Hey, bring me a weapon or a heavy object,
something to cause fatal injury.

28
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,780
Big or small?

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,240
No worries, what are you
talking about? We don't need it.

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,080
I'm your little brother who's come
to repay his thanks.

31
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,430
If you let this one go, you will regret it.

32
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,500
Show me.

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,460
What is this?

34
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,690
The long-term search team

35
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,030
even gave up on her.

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,830
No matter how hard I think,

37
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,030
I think she is living under a different identity.

38
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,670
Would she have bought an
American or African ID?

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,150
A Chosun one, obviously.

40
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,900
Are you asking me to show
you whose ID she bought?

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,580
Yes.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,890
You are one step ahead of me.

43
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,810
I'll do the finding, so just give me the list.

44
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,080
Those of similar age, similar
appearance, all of it.

45
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
We...

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,910
buying is anonymous and
selling is anonymous, too.

47
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,450
If I show you the records,
I'm showing you my neck.

48
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,320
You want my neck right now?

49
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,090
You know my brother

50
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,900
is a judge, right?

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,810
Oh, I know.

52
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:31,280
You fooled everyone saying he could reduce
sentences through sneaky means.

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,480
This time...

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,100
my brother...

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,190
is going into the Presidential House's
Department of Foreign Security.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,640
The refugee issue...

57
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,810
and crimes against foreign laborers...

58
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,550
and illegal immigrant raids.

59
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,590
This country is so complicated.

60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,070
My brother...

61
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,030
will get a prosecuting position
and wipe it all clean.

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,190
Organizations that sell foreign identities
is his number one priority.

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,880
But...

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,250
if you find her, my brother
promises not to touch you.

65
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,460
How... how can I trust that?

66
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,500
She...

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,190
is the sister of my brother's girlfriend.

68
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,830
He wants to find her through any means.

69
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,220
This is a secret mission. No one knows.

70
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,020
He even resigned, fearing rumors.

71
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,020
If you don't believe me, call the court
and ask for Judge Han Soo Ho.

72
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,160
What did they say?

73
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,510
They said he resigned, right?

74
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,150
Your brother is really going
to work for the president?

75
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,400
If you don't have faith, you have no future.

76
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,850
If these records get handed to prosecutors,

77
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,350
I am basically signing up to go to hell.

78
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,580
I know. I'll keep quiet, so copy the list.

79
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,670
If you mess up,

80
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,020
I will kill you before I go to hell myself.

81
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,750
You're doing a good deed.
You're going to heaven.

82
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,210
Here, let me pay for the copying fee.

83
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:42,230
One million won.

84
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,140
Give me the lawyer's number.

85
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,810
I want to appeal.

86
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,410
Even if Hyung did that to mom,

87
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,660
it's better to be an idiot who doesn't know.

88
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,160
I can't let him be a murderer.

89
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,830
I'll take care of it,

90
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,020
so no matter where you go,

91
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,830
have a good life.

92
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,460
How do I live?

93
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,120
What do I do?

94
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,980
Figure it out.

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,960
Jae Ho died because of me.

96
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,280
Right?

97
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,960
We're done talking.

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,550
- I'm leaving.
- He died because of me.

99
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,570
I should die, too.

100
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,990
But I guess I wanted to live.

101
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,310
So I found a reason to stay alive.

102
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,680
Killing Han Soo Ho.

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,590
There isn't a stronger motivation
to live than killing someone.

104
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,360
After I realized that...

105
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,260
my guilt disappeared like magic.

106
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,950
Stop saying useless things.

107
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,230
So how do I live now?

108
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,970
Go to the spa, and sweat it out.

109
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,920
Go into ice cold water.

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,680
You'll come to your senses.

111
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,760
Then observe

112
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,790
how other people live.

113
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,050
You can live like them, too.

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,480
I'll call you when I meet with the lawyer.

115
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,770
We did nothing wrong.

116
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,260
The fact that we didn't kill anyone

117
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,700
might be the best thing we did.

118
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,250
Are you going to run for
office somewhere?

119
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,350
Why are you aggressively eating
like you're running for president?

120
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,230
Hey, Hyung.

121
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,030
Can I get a job here?

122
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,370
I can sleep in the same
room as you inside.

123
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,380
I can get paid minimum wage.

124
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,300
Instead, if I invent a menu
item and it's a hit,

125
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,000
I want a bonus.

126
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,190
I'll give you an extra bowl,
so shove it and leave, man.

127
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,280
Hyung,

128
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,660
you're the manager here, right?

129
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,760
I mean, you could say that, sure.

130
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,690
What about that?

131
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,820
After the manager interview,
isn't the owner interview next?

132
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,750
You are way out of your mind, man.

133
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,440
Did someone repeatedly
strike you in the head?

134
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,000
Owner?

135
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,920
Can I interview to cook here?

136
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,250
You were cellmates with him, right?

137
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,440
Mates? I am his sunbae by many years.

138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,490
I have experienced some injustice.

139
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,070
I lost my temper and got into some fights.

140
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,150
I threatened people to collect their debt

141
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,990
and got caught, too.

142
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,330
I may have criminal records.

143
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,140
But they were not brutal

144
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,760
or of the inhumane genre.

145
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,900
I don't even want your genre as a customer.

146
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,410
Just leave, please.

147
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,890
If you're going to keep hanging out
with these kinds of people, you go too.

148
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,180
She's telling you to leave, man!

149
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,400
I am confident about cooking well!

150
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,570
I will come up with daebak
new menu items.

151
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:43,190
I have the vision for the company's growth.

152
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't trust whatever he says.

153
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,610
Besides the fact that he
breathes, everything is a lie.

154
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,260
He has a wicked tongue, that one.

155
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,960
I don't want to curse you out
of my own restaurant.

156
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,690
Leave.

157
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,080
A little while ago, I got some
encouragement money

158
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,930
from a huge corporation.

159
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,150
I have 30 million won.

160
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,370
I will purchase 30 million
won's worth of soup.

161
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,950
Up front.

162
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,070
I don't care if it's a nursery
or a nursing home.

163
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,090
Donate a hundred bowls every day.

164
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,010
Like a socially responsible company.

165
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,720
We ensure that our kitchen is spotless,

166
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,520
but I don't know if it's worthy of you, sir.

167
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,570
Would you like to look around?

168
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,560
What are you doing? You don't even
know where this money came from!

169
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:48,220
I will support you so that you have
no issues developing new menu items.

170
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,380
I'm going to clean up the kitchen,
so bring him over a bit later.

171
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,530
Sir? What sir? Is he
important or something?

172
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,420
Also, what kind of money is that?

173
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,230
Is it black money or white money?

174
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,370
Go ask Managing Director Choi
of Han Young Group.

175
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,540
It's probably whiter than snow.

176
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,420
Why do you keep showing up and
butting into my life, man?

177
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,090
Until I become a good guy,
please take me in, Hyung.

178
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,680
Help me not have an ounce
of bad thoughts.

179
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,520
Are you in love?

180
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,560
Crazy bastard.

181
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,380
I'm busy.

182
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,980
Lee Ho Sung got an arrest warrant.
The newsroom is on fire.

183
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,270
Want to come over after work?

184
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,120
Why?

185
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,740
I have something to tell you.

186
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,680
And there's something
I want to hear from you.

187
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,260
Me, too.

188
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,580
Come over?

189
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,430
No. All I need to say are curses

190
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,940
and all I think I'll hear are excuses.

191
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,830
Don't you think our relationship is
too fragile for an emotional war?

192
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,060
- Let's talk in person.
- I'm not coming.

193
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,140
Eun...

194
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,460
Oppa.

195
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,860
Later.

196
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,190
Not just when you miss me,

197
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,570
but on a day when you miss
me to death, I'll come over.

198
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,640
Got it. I'll wait for you.

199
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,650
It might be a while.

200
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,140
It might be your whole life.

201
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,090
It's okay.

202
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:17,090
If I can't stand waiting, I'll come to you.

203
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,850
The Judge Han Soo Ho I know

204
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,410
is a good person.

205
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,130
Excuse me.

206
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,580
From here to there, can I
get one of everything?

207
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,440
Yes, sir.

208
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,700
What's this?

209
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,180
I didn't know what you would like,
so I emptied the shelves.

210
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,140
This one is a really nice one.

211
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,620
This one is really popular.

212
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,220
This one is scented.

213
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,340
And this one is...

214
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,660
This is wasteful.

215
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,240
Why did you buy so much?

216
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,490
I feel like I just got a lifetime's
worth of gifts all at once.

217
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,920
I said I just wanted one
thing I really liked.

218
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,860
Now tell me.

219
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,110
You said you would tell
me everything today.

220
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,100
Let's eat first.

221
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,960
Then, we'll do the dishes,
and take an evening walk.

222
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,800
I'll tell you over a beer at a bar.

223
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,700
Tell me what?

224
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,210
I'm saying let's eat first.

225
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,010
Tonight's dinner menu!

226
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,490
Go sit down.

227
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,040
Let's do it together.

228
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,960
You know how to cook?

229
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,210
Have a seat.

230
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,630
Let's do it together.

231
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,140
What should I do first?

232
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,790
This one?

233
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,950
- Careful.
- Yes!

234
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,360
Oh, I'm sorry!

235
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,790
Wipe it, wipe it.

236
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,080
Spicy!

237
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,290
The head of the Taxation department called.

238
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,110
Someone made an allegation against me.

239
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,690
What kind of allegation?

240
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,490
I don't know how they knew.

241
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,390
My taxes got a bit complicated.

242
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,220
Is it serious?

243
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,240
I could not stop Lee Ho Sung's arrest.

244
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,040
There's the golf incident,
and now this tax issue.

245
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:48,560
I did not realize such a crisis
would befall Ohdaeyang.

246
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,910
Don't worry. There are fifty tax
experts in our office alone.

247
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,090
You take it.

248
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,750
Which...

249
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,980
My defense.

250
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,850
You do it.

251
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,400
Conduct the legal team.

252
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,970
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,230
- Is this funny to you?
- Yes, it is.

254
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,010
You don't trust me.

255
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,390
You've never actually put me
in charge of anything.

256
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,950
You always treat me like a child.

257
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,490
You treat me like a dummy.

258
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,050
Now you want me to
conduct a legal team?

259
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,040
Stop whining.

260
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,990
Why not?

261
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,820
Now you trust me?

262
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,500
You're my son.

263
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,730
I'm asking if you trust me.

264
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,660
Assign this to a lawyer you can trust.

265
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,100
Careful, careful!

266
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,440
[ Sang Cheol oppa ]

267
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,060
It's about your sister.

268
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,020
If you want to hear
about it, come outside.

269
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,650
- Your Honor.
- Yes?

270
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,090
I need to go outside for a second.

271
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,540
Hurry up. We just need to
put it on the table.

272
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,150
Yes, I will.

273
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,030
What about my sister?

274
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,680
I need to talk about myself first.

275
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,280
Okay.

276
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,530
Everything went the way I wanted it to.

277
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:29,640
Work. The company. My future.

278
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,160
Everything.

279
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,760
Except one thing.

280
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,740
What is that?

281
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,770
You.

282
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,010
Stop it.

283
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,710
If you come to me,

284
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,410
everything will be perfect.

285
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,060
I am not an accessory that completes you.

286
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,060
We are all someone else's accessory.

287
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,720
You, me.

288
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,640
We are a part of someone else.

289
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,750
I came outside because you said
this was about my sister.

290
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,690
If you have nothing to say,
I'm going back in.

291
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,100
Who is Han Soo Ho to you?

292
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,750
I'm leaving.

293
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,350
You and Han Soo Ho are
not a match, anyway.

294
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,130
Do I need to be treated like this
by someone like you?

295
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,140
Why?

296
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,510
Because I'm such a lowly accessory?

297
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,130
Are you guys really...

298
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,660
How could you do this to me?

299
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,370
Han Soo Ho testified
at your sister's trial!

300
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,640
You didn't know that, did you?

301
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,160
I had completely forgotten, too.

302
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,250
Han Soo Ho and Choi Min Guk.

303
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,730
They were classmates.

304
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,790
Witness.

305
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,390
What is your relationship
to the defendant?

306
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,900
In the student group organized by
med students and law students,

307
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,920
people interested in photography formed
a subgroup. We became friends there.

308
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,840
He probably got an allowance
from Choi Min Guk.

309
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,230
If so, you must have heard
the victim resisting

310
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,340
or screaming, something like that?

311
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,230
I did not.

312
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,120
You're lying!

313
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,960
It's all lies!

314
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,790
I screamed and screamed,
but no one came.

315
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,580
I said I didn't want to.

316
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,110
"No. Stop."

317
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:45,020
- You're sure you didn't hear that or any screaming?
- Yes.

318
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,420
You devil!

319
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,440
You evil bastards.

320
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,930
Let go!

321
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,260
Let go! Unni!

322
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,720
That testimony

323
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,520
resulted in the not guilty verdict.

324
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,900
You trust that guy,
admire him, and like him?

325
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,670
Isn't that funny?

326
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:42,420
I didn't know you knew
how to be a comedian.

327
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,670
Never thought that.

328
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,940
Are you abandoning everything?

329
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,740
Your future in the legal industry.

330
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,000
Your dignity as a woman.

331
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,500
Your comfort as a human being.

332
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,710
I told you that if you have me,

333
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,090
you'll have all of those things.

334
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:12,910
♫ Me without you, I'm breaking
apart in the thick fog ♫

335
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:26,720
♫ Like a fading star, in the
empty night sky, I'm there ♫

336
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:40,400
♫ Oh baby, please tell me
that tomorrow is coming ♫

337
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,240
♫ I'm walking through
the endless darkness ♫

338
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,460
♫ I'm coming to you
at the end of this road ♫

339
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:00,270
♫ In my wounded heart ♫

340
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:07,190
♫ With your warm light, shine on me ♫

341
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,750
♫ Shine on me ♫

342
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:28,490
♫ I close my eyes until
the night goes white ♫

343
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:34,390
♫ In the rain, I'm coming to you ♫

344
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:41,280
♫ In my sad heart ♫

345
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:48,090
♫ With your warm light,
if you could shine on me ♫

346
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:56,390
♫ I want to dream one more time ♫

347
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:01,220
♫ My only star ♫

348
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:09,540
♫ Someday the darkness will break apart ♫

349
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,600
♫ At the end of this road,
I will meet you ♫

350
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,480
♫ In my wounded life ♫

351
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,180
♫ With your warmth, embrace me ♫

352
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:35,720
♫ Shine on me ♫

353
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:52,590
♫ The memories that await me there ♫

354
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:59,660
♫ Like a dream,
the loneliness pierces me ♫

355
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:06,290
♫ In my heart that misses you... ♫
