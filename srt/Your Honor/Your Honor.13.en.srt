1
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,180
How much more do I have to go?

2
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,720
A long way to go.

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,390
Attorney.

4
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,230
The judge almost made it down.

5
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,990
Thank you for your cooperation.

6
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,810
Thank you for guiding us down safely.

7
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,860
As for the result of our reenactment today...

8
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,920
I'll reference it to my ruling.

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,750
And...

10
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,600
you worked hard.

11
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,910
One, two...

12
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,230
What's this?

13
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,350
It's a selfie for evidence. Smile.

14
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,240
We can't use this for evidence.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,810
Again. Let's do it again.

16
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,550
One, two, three.

17
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,680
Let's go, everyone!

18
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,040
How much does it cost to rent out
the entire amusement park?

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,970
Including the fireworks and everything?

20
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,230
So Eun.

21
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,800
Weren't you scared?

22
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,050
But you did well.

23
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,540
Thanks.

24
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,920
You did great, but don't do that again.

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,910
I was scared, too.

26
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,700
I...

27
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,960
know for sure now.

28
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,120
The service offered here isn't discrimination.

29
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,290
I can write the ruling confidently now.

30
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,610
Of course, the judge will write the real verdict.

31
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,360
See? You're not suited to be a judge.

32
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,970
Take a warm shower. You were tense.
You might be achy.

33
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,060
Yeah. Drive carefully.

34
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,480
I can hear the sound of the wind
much louder with my eyes closed.

35
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,180
And it felt like the steps were shaking, too.

36
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,210
You know the scratchy noise?

37
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,640
The noise coming from a rusty tower
right before it's about to collapse.

38
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,270
I wasn't scared to fall.

39
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,810
I thought, "Whoa, is it going to collapse?"

40
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,580
I was more scared of such a thought.

41
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,100
You know in the movies...

42
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,770
you know how you hear
strange noises in the dark?

43
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,710
The ominous feeling something
terrible is about to happen.

44
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,790
The guide was rambling on
about something and

45
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,870
you kept saying something to me.

46
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,270
But I was so out of it that

47
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,500
I couldn't hear anything at all.

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,780
But when you asked to hold your hand,

49
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,300
I finally came to.

50
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,510
Wow... but if I were told to do that again,

51
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,280
seriously...

52
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,600
I can never do it.

53
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
But...

54
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,830
it made me wonder how
I would feel if I were blind.

55
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,930
How scary it would be.

56
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,130
How upsetting it would be.

57
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,030
Other people's circumstances...

58
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,020
Don't try to understand everything.

59
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,990
How can you live doing that?

60
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,210
It's tough enough to take care of myself.

61
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,100
And you came out...

62
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,180
wanting to ride the roller coaster blindfolded?

63
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,250
While I was at it, you know.

64
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,530
If I didn't have my title as judge,

65
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,630
how could I even rent out that place entirely?

66
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,110
That's when I should use my power.

67
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,870
Why do you keep doing that?

68
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,210
You don't feel that way, but you act
as if it's a hassle, be cold,

69
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,900
and act as if money is everything.

70
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,740
I apologize.

71
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,860
I'm not talking back to you.

72
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,130
Talking back? Who?

73
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,350
Section Leader Jo said...

74
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,950
Other trainees don't behave like this,

75
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,420
but I tend to talk back to you a lot.

76
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,000
I see...

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,460
I'm not so sure about that.

78
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,600
Well, you're my first trainee.

79
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,230
I heard there were a few other trainees before.

80
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,680
You're one of a kind. That's what I meant.

81
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,970
What kind of trainee am I?

82
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,300
You're pretty.

83
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,510
What made you want to
become a judge or prosecutor?

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,540
Actually,

85
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,020
I wanted to become a killer.

86
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,460
But that means I have to be a good fighter.

87
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,130
I have to handle guns and weapons well.

88
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,120
Where would I learn that?

89
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,710
So, I just studied.

90
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,860
I'm used to doing it and came easily to me.

91
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,360
That's what I hate the most.

92
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,330
"Studying came easily to me."

93
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,690
How could studying be easy for a person?

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,400
I didn't think you were like that,
but you're rambling now.

95
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,300
I've ranked number one in
my school at times, but

96
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,750
I've never placed number one
in the country before.

97
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,940
Was studying that easy for you?

98
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,770
How could someone place
number one in the nation?

99
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,900
You graduated from the
training institute at the top, too.

100
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,000
Teach me your secret in studying.

101
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,450
Judge?

102
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,500
Later...

103
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,890
when you have time, forget studying.

104
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,800
I'll teach you how to be a killer.

105
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,200
Oh, okay.

106
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,390
I'm not kidding.

107
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,630
Yup.

108
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,800
Now, look.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,060
I want to...

110
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,200
kill that guy.

111
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,010
Stand up.

112
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,640
Get closer to him.

113
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,430
- Then he'd say, "Who are you?" and look, right?
- Yes.

114
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,420
At that moment, hit him fast!

115
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,310
Easy, huh?

116
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,330
No.

117
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,580
It's easy.

118
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,180
But if he blocks your attack,

119
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,600
this is what you do then.

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,190
- Try punching me.
- What?

121
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,290
Hit you?

122
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,360
It's okay. There's a move I do as I block you.

123
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,340
But still, how can I hit you?

124
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,600
Hit me.

125
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,920
Your Honor, are you okay?

126
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,200
I'm sorry.

127
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,420
How come you're so fast?

128
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,790
- I'm sorry.
- You attacked me before I can get ready.

129
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,390
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,020
The way I see it, you're more talented
to be a killer than a judge.

131
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you.

132
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,180
Huh?

133
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,810
Geez!

134
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,460
When you hit, I can block, then
hit you back like this, bam!

135
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,900
We're here.

136
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,870
I learned a lot tonight.

137
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,500
Especially this. Bam!

138
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,590
I'll leave now.

139
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,720
"Fighting" tomorrow, too.

140
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,140
I'm sorry.

141
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
For dragging you to a dangerous place.

142
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,320
Thank you.

143
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,640
For holding me safely.

144
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,520
I learned a lot tonight.

145
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,510
I really thank you.

146
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,360
You went through a lot. Goodnight.

147
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,120
Have a restful night.

148
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,340
I'll work harder.

149
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,300
I'm sorry for making you work so much.

150
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,140
I'll always remember tonight.

151
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,400
You said this when you proposed to me.

152
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,510
That you'd quit being a gangster.

153
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,690
I believed you.

154
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,600
Even after you went to jail several times,
I believed you to the end.

155
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,710
Because you promised me, Oppa.

156
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,480
Geez, I came back to you anyhow.

157
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,690
Even though it took several years.

158
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,940
You'd beat up people all the time,
doing background checks...

159
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,710
Catch debtors and blackmail them...

160
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,700
- I'm sick of it just thinking about it.
- I wasn't...

161
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,920
going to come back to you either.

162
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,480
But I couldn't help but think of you.

163
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,620
But you know...

164
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,810
all day long...

165
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,130
I was scribbling your name.

166
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,750
I had forgotten your name though.

167
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,430
Don't pass out the flyers tomorrow.

168
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,110
No one walks around because it's too hot.

169
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,140
Come into the restaurant and work.

170
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,050
There's a room attached to the kitchen,

171
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,350
so sleep there.

172
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,330
Don't misunderstand.

173
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,550
I was going to hire a part-timer anyway.

174
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,170
But if I have to kick you out in less
than a month, I won't pay you a penny.

175
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,590
Be polite to the customers at all times.

176
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,810
Be accommodating even if
someone makes a scene.

177
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,590
I don't have any expectations though.

178
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,400
So...

179
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,000
I came prepared.

180
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,430
What?

181
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,900
[ Court ]

182
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,530
Judge.

183
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,790
Did you read the letter from the defendant's
daughter on the amusement park case?

184
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,130
I thought she wanted me to punish her mom.

185
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,540
Geez, she must be at her wit's end.

186
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,840
I feel for her.

187
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,900
I don't think she means for us
to punish her severely.

188
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,830
Of course, a letter won't influence the ruling.

189
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,300
But considering the sentencing goal,

190
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,590
it would be good for you to read...

191
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,490
I'm not talking back to you.

192
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,390
Sit down.

193
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,210
What?

194
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,440
Sit down and let's talk.

195
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,580
Oh, no. How can I sit across from you...

196
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,810
Sit.

197
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,610
Okay.

198
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,480
Nice.

199
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,010
At our eye level.

200
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,280
Now, where were we?

201
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,900
So...

202
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm uncomfortable this way and can't talk.

203
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,060
If you stand, it's uncomfortable for me!

204
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,930
This is my office. I'll do as I please.

205
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,700
Continue.

206
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,800
So...

207
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,050
And...

208
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,000
If you don't want the defendant
to commit repeat offense,

209
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,380
I'm not sure what kind of ruling I should give.

210
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,500
Well...

211
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,680
hit her with a huge fine and

212
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,400
make her come to her senses.

213
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,500
You may not know since
you grew up pampered.

214
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,530
If a mom acts like that, the kid
will completely go astray.

215
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,450
You were pampered, too.

216
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,050
Getting hurt by your mom hurts

217
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,960
a hundred times more than
getting hurt by other people.

218
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,360
I'll read her letter.

219
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
Get back to work.

220
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
Okay.

222
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,150
I was worried!

223
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,190
Why did you come out alone
without telling me?

224
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,570
I told you I'm not going out
with you ever again.

225
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,060
I got it. I'll never do that again.

226
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,310
What do you mean?

227
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,900
Just be that way.

228
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,840
Fight and make a scene.

229
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,090
I got it.

230
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,340
Don't follow me.

231
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,530

00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,440
Walk slowly, please?

233
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,040
Don't hold onto me.

234
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,850
I feel more like a blind person
whenever you do this.

235
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,130
You know that?

236

I received a call from the
Court Administrative Office.

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,540
For a prospective position for
the disciplinary committee.

Boy, you were called on by
the higher-ups. Congratulations!

00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,850
As an encouragement.

299

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,250
Father tried to compromise
with the judge for your sake.

336
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,260
But I'm trying to get rid of the
judge who did this to you.

337
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,110
Who is the one you need more?

338
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,300
You, Hyung.

339
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,670
Sang Cheol hyung.

340
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,340
I've become such a fan of yours this time.

341
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,550
I want to push my father aside

342
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,760
and climb to the top, too.

343
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,350
But he's not the one to be easily pushed aside.

344
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,740
Hey, a**hole.

345
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,610
Have you gone crazy not driving for a few days?

346
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,160
Shut the rear view mirror.

347
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,210
How dare you look me in the
eye, you rude bastard!

348
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,610
- Look ahead.
- I'm sorry.

349
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,220
- Look ahead!
- I'm sorry!

350
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,010
- Are you crazy?
- I'm sorry.

351
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,360
- Look ahead, you a**hole!
- I'm sorry!

352
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,600
Do it right! You!

353
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,000
More than 5 million people
play golf in the country.

354
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,770
It means one out of ten people play golf.

355
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:13,220
What kind of issues are there over
golf balls that are gifted on the grass?

356
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,920
- According to the report... 
- But...

357
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,350
I'm watching the news right now.

358
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,380
Half of the TV station's executives
are our golf club members.

359
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,360
Of course, they know.

360
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,800
Aigoo.

361
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Oh, no...

362
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,270
I'll have to show up personally tomorrow.

363
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,160
It's in the news. But if I stand my ground...

364
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,100
our colleagues who are like family will suffer.

365
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,400
Okay.

366
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,240
I don't know who,

367
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,800
but someone is extremely jealous.

368
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,680
He's dying to kill me.

369
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,430
It will get quiet after a few days.

370
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,830
Is there a need for you to appear yourself?

371
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,970
It's more embarrassing to hide
over a bribe worth 105,000 won.

372
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,490
I'll go in smiling and walk out smiling.

373
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,270
This doesn't even make the news.

374
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,940
This isn't bad news to me.

375
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,230
It's good news.

376
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,720
I'll be out of the office for a few days.

377
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,250
You take care of Park Hae Na
and Ji Chang Soo's case.

378
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
Don't do anything different.

379
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,260
Just keep the status quo.

380
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,460
Yes, Father.

381
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,670
Did you ask for me?

382
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,430
President Min Goo Nam?

383
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,680
Yes...

384
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,780
I see. Sit down.

385
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,250
How can I help you?

386
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,400
I said sit down.

387
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,500
You came to the wrong place
if you came to pick a fight.

388
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,000
There's no way I'm at the wrong
place when I used the GPS.

389
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,420
Who are you?

390
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,700
Were you in judo?

391
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,230
You were in judo.

392
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,400
Give! I give! I give up!

393
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,870
Sit down.

394
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:36,290
Are you a thug?

395
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,950
Lee Ho Sung sent me.

396
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,880
Should've listened to me sooner.

397
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,030
- Does he have a message for me?
- You don't know?

398
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,440
I did everything he told me to do.

399
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,780
I made sure my guys are
keeping their mouths shut.

400
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,320
There is no problem on my end.

401
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,500
What kind of problems were there

402
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,400
that you say you don't
have any problems now?

403
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,390
- Are you a cop?
- No.

404
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,650
Someone higher.

405
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,630
- The Prosecutors' Office?
- No.

406
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,620
The person at the highest place.

407
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,900
The Blue House?

408
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,990
Geez! You'll get me in trouble!

409
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,220
Why would those people come here?

410
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,200
[ Han Soo Ho, Supreme Court of South Korea ]

411
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,610
I'm the one who gave seven
years to Lee Ho Sung.

412
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,570
I apologize.

413
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,680
I've behaved very poorly.

414
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,890
What brings you here, Your Honor?

415
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,080
You're a good fighter.

416
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:08,750
You're not the type to get
beat up by Ji Chang Soo.

417
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,250
Well...

418
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,810
He's so compliant usually

419
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:15,060
that I never thought he'd
do that out of the blue.

420
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,940
I attacked you out of the blue, too.

421
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,130
I didn't know someone
under me would do that.

422
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,700
Well, that could happen.

423
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,030
What's up with Lee Ho Sung?

424
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,950
Nothing, sir.

425
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,430
What's wrong with everyone?

426
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,890
Is he that scary?

427
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,310
He has nothing to do with me.

428
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,040
You didn't get your subpoena
to be a witness yet, huh?

429
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,030
Am I going to the courtroom?

430
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,580
I called you.

431
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,040
I really have nothing to say.

432
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,210
Show up even if you don't.

433
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,520
That person who's on your back...

434
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,540
I'll get rid of him for you.

435
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,600
I don't know who's so jealous of me.

436
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,150
I'll have to quit golf now.

437
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,440
You're just hitting a ball with a stick.

438
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,130
Why does everyone look with
suspicion when golf is mentioned?

439
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,230
That's what I'm saying.

440
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,800
You have your receipts for the golf balls, right?

441
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,400
Yes, of course, I have all that.

442
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,200
How about the receipts for gift certificates?

443
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,660
Gift...

444
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,370
What gift certificates?

445
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,310
We received a report that you
purchased gift certificates

446
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,570
on your company card and
lost your golf bet intentionally.

447
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,000
The stake per game was over 10 million won.

448
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,680
Finish your tea.

449
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,370
Take your time and let's move
to the interrogation room.

450
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,470
Considering your pride,

451
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,850
I'll be sure to stop this
information from leaking out.

452
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,070
1.5 million won for assault and injury.

453
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,340
1.5 million won for business interference.

454
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,320
3 million won total for the fine.

455
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,600
This won't do.

456
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,370
I considered the fact that
she settled with the victim

457
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,140
and it was a special circumstance.

458
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,240
Go Yang Ja committed the same types of crime

459
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,580
and she'll continue to.

460
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,690
She can be arrested next time.

461
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,870
3 million won in fine won't change a person.

462
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,680
I'm not saying your ruling
was completely wrong.

463
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,960
I...

464
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,810
thought that I kept missing something.

465
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,240
But I didn't know what that was.

466
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,970
But now I know.

467
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,910
Thank you, Your Honor!

468
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,200
I'll be back.

469
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,060
Where are you going?

470
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,210
- I'll be back.
- What's wrong with her?

471
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,510
I told her to make her pay a higher fine.
