1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,800
Pessimists have never
discovered secrets of stars.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,150
They have never opened up
a new heaven for souls.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,620
Who are you?

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,250
- Are you Cho Won?
- Yes.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,810
Who are you?

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,640
Do you like hamburger by chance?

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,480
If you're a judicial trainee,

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,640
you're not a judge?

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,830
Yeah...

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,050
I'm still a student.

11
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,870
But since you're working with a judge,

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,890
that means you have power.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,560
Please give my mom a small fine.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,790
Dad sends her child support, and she works, too.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,000
But she says we don't have much money.

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,390
Cho Won.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,390
You wrote a letter asking us to punish her, huh?

18
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,360
Do you hate her that much?

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,950
Mom...

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,850
is angry with me all the time.

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,810
She didn't seem so at all.

22
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,150
She's angry with me, but...

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,900
she can't let it out because she feels sorry for me.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
Instead...

25
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,850
she's letting it out on other people.

26
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,330
And then...

27
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,090
she says she fights for me.

28
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,570
So annoying.

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,450
I see.

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,030
It's because I was born the wrong way.

31
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,020
I don't have anything else to say.

32
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,060
Can I tell you about me now?

33
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,060
My mom...

34
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,450
is very, very far away.

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,780
In Singapore.

36
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,480
Did she go there alone?

37
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,020
Why didn't you go?

38
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,450
A long time ago, my older sister...

39
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,340
had an accident.

40
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,150
And she got hurt a lot.

41
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,490
I...

42
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:14,750
thought my parents would fight against
the person who caused the accident.

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,620
- Didn't they?
- No.

44
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,950
My unni is the one who got hurt.

45
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,910
But they said it was her fault.

46
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,910
They'd be ashamed if people heard about
my sister and wanted to move.

47
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,870
And they left.

48
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,820
I hate that.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,980
I did, too.

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,380
But I'm okay now.

51
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,170
How come?

52
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,350
It must've hurt my mom, too.

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,580
I guess I didn't like that.

54
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,680
I thought mom is...

55
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,900
someone who shouldn't get hurt.

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,750
So, I got angry at her a lot.

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,800
Maybe I drove my mom out.

58
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,280
What are you saying?

59
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,760
I don't understand.

60
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,990
I seldom...

61
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,130
regret it.

62
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,100
Without getting angry...

63
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,380
Couldn't I have done something else? I wonder.

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,160
Are you saying it's all my fault?

65
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,810
No. That's not what I'm saying.

66
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,380
Then what?

67
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,280
You're saying all that happened
because I got angry at my mom!

68
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,570
That's not what I meant.

69
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,320
That's what I heard.

70
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,350
Please do a good job at tomorrow's trial.

71
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,680
Your Honor.

72
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,370
It's time for the trial.

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,420
Defendant Go Yang Ja.

74
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,730
I sentence you to 3 million won fine.

75
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:35,380
On June 21, 2018, defendant Go Yang Ja...

76
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,460
Why did you do that?

77
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,030
This isn't the first time. Why do you do that?

78
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,860
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,060
How many times have you done this?

80
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,910
Aren't you ashamed to face your daughter?

81
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,140
It's fine to fight against unfair discrimination.

83
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,060
If that's being just, you must
fight justly. Don't you think so?

84
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,630
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,390
What did that part-timer student do wrong?

86
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,130
I tried the emergency evacuation
on the roller coaster.

87
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,990
It was super scary.

88
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,750
As for safety training,

89
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,350
it has to be expanded including
disabled and healthy people.

90
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,510
I'm very sorry.

91
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,720
I'll never do that again.

92
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,910
Please I beg you.

93
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,300
Build fond memories with your daughter!

94
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,380
Not your criminal record!

95
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,020
Your Honor!

96
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,820
Don't scold my mom.

97
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,340
Your mom?

98
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,310
Are you Cho Won?

99
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,380
Yes.

100
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,570
That Cho Won who sent me that letter?

101
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,180
Yes.

102
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,490
You told me to punish her.

103
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,710
Don't do that.

104
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,130
You asked me to scold her.

105
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,640
You don't have to.

106
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,800
Cho Won, you shouldn't do this.

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
Why do you flip-flop?

108
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,220
Don't scold her!

109
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,300
She's my mom.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,420
Okay. I won't. Got it.

111
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,090
Defendant Go Yang Ja...

112
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,330
On June 21, 2018...

113
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,600
assaulted part-timer Lee Young Pil
at the amusement park.

114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,100
His injury required three weeks of treatment.

115
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,700
Yet she didn't show any remorse.

116
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,660
Cho Won.

117
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,280
You shouldn't talk back like that to the judge.

118
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,540
They'll take you away.

119
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,940
We won't have to come back here again.

120
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,620
All right.

121
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,310
You say that all the time, but you do it again.

122
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,330
For real this time. I promise.

123
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,190
Didn't you promise me before?

124
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,490
Mom.

125
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,300
I wasn't born wrong, right?

126
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,990
Of course not.

127
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,670
I've never thought that.

128
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,140
You know that I think that all the time, right?

129
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,870
I do.

130
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,450
But Cho Won...

131
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,900
I thought it over yesterday.

132
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,930
I'm glad I was born.

133
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,950
I got to meet you.

134
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,450
I'll never think that I was born wrong again.

135
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,510
So...

136
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,850
don't fight for me anymore.

137
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,910
Okay.

138
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,270
Why would you fight with other people
when your daughter is so well?

139
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,670
Just ignore them.

140
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,990
Okay.

141
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,040
I got it.

142
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,780
Don't do that. You're messing up my hair.

143
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,610
I said don't.

144
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,250
Geez, that little. Turning on me already.

145
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,050
I scolded her since she asked.
And she talks back to me?

146
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,010
But still, it was nice to see that.

147
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,440
I don't think they'll ever come back here.

148
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,110
Geez, people don't change that easily.

149
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,420
You said Go Yang Ja wouldn't change over a fine.

150
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,860
I realized it then.

151
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,520
Perhaps the law isn't going to change the mom.

152
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,940
- You think that's what I meant?
- Yes.

153
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,020
So, I went and met the defendant's daughter.

154
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,000
I was going to talk to her
about her mom, but I couldn't.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,240
She didn't want to hear me.

156
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,160
Of course, she wouldn't want to.

157
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,100
She was so hurt by her mom.

158
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,090
But the strange thing is...

159
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,140
you suddenly start missing your mom
when you start talking about her.

160
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,810
You were fine just a minute ago.

161
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,220
That's not the case for everyone.

162
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,180
Yes. You're right.

163
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,400
So many people sell emotions
saying, "Mom, Mom..."

164
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,700
I really hate that.

165
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,990
Me, too.

166
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,630
Mom... who cares.

167
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,280
You're quite rebellious.

168
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,850
Did you argue with your mom?

169
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,230
There's not much to argue about anymore.

170
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,280
She's too far away.

171
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,050
I'll get back to work.

172
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,450
Oh, and...

173
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,140
This chair is so comfortable.

174
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,920
Thank you.

175
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,420
Is all of this yours now?

176
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,420
It's still Father's.

177
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
How is my father doing?

178
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,560
What a veteran.

179
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,130
He's eating well and evades evidence.

180
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,230
His network is everywhere.

181
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,250
Your father's network is legal royalty.

182
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,350
Isn't it time for all of them to retire?

183
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,900
Have a seat.

184
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,560
This is how finance records
were kept internally

185
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,660
versus the actual expenses.

186
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,360
It's all here.

187
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,820
Are you confident?

188
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,460
Your father's shadow is much
larger than I thought.

189
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,810
Sunbaenim, are you afraid by chance?

190
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,560
A**hole...

191
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,960
You know my father knows
everyone in the legal world, right?

192
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,590
I know well.

193
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,650
I only know you, Sunbaenim.

194
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,620
Sang Cheol, you're so straightforward.

195
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,300
I like that.

196
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,560
Lee Ho Sung gossip.

197
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,760
Park Hae Na gossip.

198
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
[ Lee Ho Sung and Park Hae Na
dating? Believe it or not... ]

199
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,060
I found this by the door.

200
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,580
Song So Eun.

201
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,100
[ Im Geum Mi, Han Soo Ho ]

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,310
Kang Ho.

203
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,930
What brings you here without calling me?

204
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,900
Feed me.

205
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,370
Did you get yourself in trouble again?

206
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,280
What trouble?

207
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,270
I just stopped by.

208
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Wait.

209
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,700
Wearing a suit...

210
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,530
You're not conning people, are you?

211
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,020
Don't you have any meat?

212
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,510
What did you do to deserve meat?

213
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,380
If you called me, I would've gone to the market.

214
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:04,160
You should normally eat some.
No money for meat?

215
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,130
- Do you want another egg fry?
- Forget it.

216
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,400
You'll show off after making me an egg fry.

217
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,070
Is something wrong with your hyung?

218
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,260
He used to call at least once a week.

219
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,660
But no calls.

220
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,540
You should try calling.

221
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,840
He's probably too busy.

222
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,300
Why do you mind your son so much?
Did you do something wrong?

223
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,000
Of course I did.

224
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,170
I heard it's good for a judge
to come from a wealthy family.

225
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,060
I can't be of any help.

226
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,010
Soo Ho is doing just fine.
His house is super nice, too.

227
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,730
If you want to help, help me.

228
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,540
Fine.

229
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,430
How should I help you?

230
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:47,240
How much do you need?

231
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,100
How much money would it take
to come to your senses?

232
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,900
Tell me. I'll sell myself if I have to.

233
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,050
We're eating. What's with you?

234
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,200
Where are you going?

235
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,600
To make an egg fry!

236
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,350
It's okay. I'm fine.

237
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,670
Make lots of it then.

238
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,400
- You're sleeping over, right?
- I'm busy. I have to go.

239
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,780
Sleep over.

240
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,970
Why two beddings?

241
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,400
Do you have a man?

242
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,560
It's for you!

243
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,600
I'll sleep in my room. It's uncomfortable.

244
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
Get rid of your tattoo.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,620
I hate that.

246
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,940
What do you like about me?

247
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,950
Get rid of it. I hate it.

248
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,270
What makes you happy anyway?

249
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,430
This one.

250
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,380
When you guys were little...

251
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,290
I walked you both to school every day.

252
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,950
I loved walking with my sons'
hands in both hands so much.

253
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,460
You'll be punished if you lie.

254
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,280
I still remember it.

255
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,900
You carried Soo Ho and I walked.

256
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,600
That was when you were in 6th grade.

257
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,990
You beat up your hyung...

258
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,370
and fractured his leg. I had to
carry him for a month.

259
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,250
That's when I got a disc
and is bothering me still.

260
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,080
Thinking back to how I suffered...

261
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,400
You always say it was my fault.

262
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,530
Geez, geez, geez.

263
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,370
Since then...

264
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,890
I've never walked with both
of your hands ever again.

265
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,290
Go to sleep.

266
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,450
Do you know what my wish is?

267
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,940
To be rich?

268
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,150
Later...

269
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,770
my Soo Ho and Kang Ho...

270
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,040
I want to hold your hands and go on a picnic.

271
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,270
Soo Ho is here when I look this way.

272
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,910
When I look that way, Kang Ho is there.

273
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,900
How nice would that be?

274
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,490
Even if we can't go on a picnic,

275
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,760
I wish you guys...

276
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,440
would visit me once a month.

277
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,110
How nice would that be?

278
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,800
When I look this way, my older son is lying down.

279
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,140
When I look that way, my
younger son is lying there.

280
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,840
All night long...

281
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,140
I'd look this way and that way.

282
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,010
I wish I couldn't sleep all night.

283
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,060
Kang Ho.

284
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't go back to prison ever again.

285
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:11,020
Okay?

286
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,290
I'm sleepy.

287
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,820
Don't make me talk.

288
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,270
Fall asleep looking at me.

289
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,400
Since it's just us.

290
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,410
Darn it.

291
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,530
I'm about to fall asleep.

292
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,810
That temper...

293
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,820
Get a job anywhere...

294
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,660
Make some money even if it's little.

295
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,770
Get a girlfriend.

296
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,370
Get married.

297
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,840
Okay?

298
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,540
Kang Ho.

299
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,860
I have work to do. I have to go soon.

300
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,820
What's going on?

301
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:41,650
I asked you to make time for me.

302
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,850
Is today a special day?

303
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,210
The day I'm going to propose.

304
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,550
- Who?
- I am.

305
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,050
To you.

306
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,040
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

307
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,370
Don't do this.

308
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,980
I only had eyes for you since college.

309
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,880
Since graduation, too.

310
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,020
I'm not doing this all of a sudden.

311
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,210
I...

312
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,170
don't want this.

313
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,920
You know I don't.

314
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
What can I do?

315
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,460
What do I need to do for you to want me?

316
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,000
Oppa...

317
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,570
You're a great sunbae to me.

318
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,920
So...

319
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,230
I have no feelings beyond that.

320
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,910
My father was the defendant's
lawyer in your sister's case.

321
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,900
He sexually assaulted you

322
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,570
with your legs in a V-shape position.

323
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,600
That's what you testified.

324
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,250
Is that correct?

325
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,890
Did you truly fight back?

326
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,300
He did an amazingly shrewd job
and found him not guilty.

327
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,330
I don't want to talk about that.

328
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,350
Ever since you found out he's my father...

329
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,590
you looked at me different.

330
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,590
I won't deny that.

331
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,140
But your father is your father...

332
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,950
and you're you.

333
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,410
You can't forgive my father.

334
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,490
Yeah.

335
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,670
I can't.

336
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,940
I can't either.

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,400
He's being investigated
by the Prosecutors' Office.

338
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,530
I know. The golf ball case.

339
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,330
That's not all.

340
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,370
There are lots of hidden things.

341
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,390
The things I only know.

342
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,410
Perhaps did you...

343
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,770
I won't forgive my father either.

344
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,300
But he's still your father.

345
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,560
I told you.

346
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,340
You're the only one I see as human.

347
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,120
If anything interferes with
my relationship with you,

348
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
I'll get rid of them all.

349
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,610
Oppa.

350
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,900
Wait...

351
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,660
you're not like that.

352
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,840
I thought of this earlier at the office.

353
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,720
I couldn't own anything
if waiting is all I did.

354
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,760
Waiting longer...

355
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,530
doesn't mean I can have you.

356
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,750
I thank you for everything.

357
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,820
I'm really nothing...

358
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,810
yet you cared for me so much.

359
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,470
All this time...

360
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,760
The reason I couldn't thank
you every time for everything...

361
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,120
isn't because I took for granted

362
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,230
the things you did for me.

363
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,280
I felt bad.

364
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,250
So, why?

365
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,790
How much more should I give?

366
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,790
What would it take for you to come to me?

367
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,170
Right now...

368
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,800
I feel like something just fell out from here.

369
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,770
It lived there a long time

370
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,410
and felt comfortable

371
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:23,860
but I'm parting with it.

372
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,090
For you, I don't know...

373
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,970
how you will remember this day.

374
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,630
But for me...

375
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,650
it will be remembered as
one of the most lonely days.

376
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,180
If you reject me today,

377
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,500
I'll never give you my heart again.

378
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,430
Goodbye.

379
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,450
I said goodbye.

380
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:41,830
♫  I’m closing my eyes,
so the night grows white ♫

381
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,710
♫  With the night, I’m going to you ♫

382
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:54,340
♫  In my heart that had a lot of sadness ♫

383
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:01,250
♫  If you shine a warm light ♫

384
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:09,350
♫ I wanna dream again  ♫

385
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,660
♫  My one and only star ♫

386
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:22,700
♫ Some day, the darkness
will crumble away ♫

387
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:28,590
♫  When you and I meet
at the end of this road ♫

388
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:35,570
♫  In my scarred life ♫

389
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:42,340
♫ I hope your warmth
can wrap around me ♫

390
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,970
♫  Shine on me ♫

391
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,730
♫ We all live weary days  ♫

392
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,410
♫ Leaning on each other,
asking if we’re alright  ♫

393
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:14,470
♫  With small comfort, you
gave my life a shadow ♫

394
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,010
♫  Like a giant ♫

395
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,530
♫ The world has so much more  ♫

396
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:25,450
♫  it’s so much higher,
it’s so much bigger ♫

397
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,110
♫ All of me  ♫
