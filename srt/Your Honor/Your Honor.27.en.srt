1
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,070
Stay over.

2
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:42,860
♫  Story, my story ♫

3
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:50,490
♫ I keep shouting but you cannot
embrace my wounds ♫

4
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,920
♫ I want to be without you ♫

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:04,020
♫ I remember our times together ♫

6
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,240
My entire life,

7
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,100
I've never had such a thing as a goal.

8
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,180
If I made it through the day,

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,600
that was the ultimate goal.

10
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,700
But...

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,900
I have a goal now.

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,400
To go on a trip with you.

13
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,110
And...

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,700
making you breakfast.

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,100
Having the table ready so you can eat
right away when you wake up.

16
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,970
And...

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,070
making you dinner

18
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,260
so that you can eat right after work.

19
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,640
Getting it ready, waiting for you.

20
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,090
And...

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,880
going on a walk with you after dinner.

22
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,280
What kind of goals...

23
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,260
are that amazing?

24
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,640
They are so amazing that

25
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,220
we can't fulfill them now.

26
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,740
Why not?

27
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,010
You're not a judge, and I'm not a trainee.

28
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,780
When I feel more confident about myself,

29
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,790
when that time comes,

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,360
I will reach those goals.

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,910
It might take some time,

32
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,890
but will you wait for me?

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,680
Are you confessing your feelings for me

34
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,630
or saying farewell?

35
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,670
Because I like you so much, So Eun,

36
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,790
I keep hating myself more.

37
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,770
I don't understand what that means.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,970
I will tell you everything tomorrow.

39
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,330
All of it.

40
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:22,890
♫ I'm still crying, everything is still hard ♫

41
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:30,260
♫ Like my tough days, my small
dreams are becoming distant ♫

42
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,640
♫Like my boring worries ♫

43
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,840
♫The foggy skies ♫

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:52,050
♫  are just as lovely, they are
like a transparent dream ♫

45
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:59,520
♫ No matter how much I fill,
I keep becoming plain ♫

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,810
♫ Those wandering days,
I wanted to fall down ♫

47
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,900
♫ But when I close my eyes,
the nights are colored ♫

48
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,440
♫ with our story, when I find it ♫

49
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,220
♫ You will be smiling like a dream ♫

50
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,420
Mom said you should come down
this weekend. Have a good life.

51
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,460
I'm leaving you a month's
worth of hotel fees.

52
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,030
The assault and injury caused
by the defendant Lee Soon Cheol is true.

53
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,690
It is also true that a watch was damaged.

54
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,390
The judge...

55
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,800
is only employed through the week.

56
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,040
He's only coming in today
and taking vacation days.

57
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,050
But it's like a retirement vacation.
You know what I mean?

58
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,230
- Yes.
- No.

59
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,820
Google "retirement vacation."

60
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,530
Nothing changes for us even if he leaves.

61
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,950
Don't cry or make a big scene.

62
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,160
Be calm. Okay?

63
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,630
Yes.

64
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,330
Are you crying?

65
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,920
No.

66
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,730
But why is he not in?

67
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,600
He's being investigated
at the Prosecutors' Office.

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,310
For what?

69
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,550
He made allegations in court, remember?

70
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,430
He needs to be interrogated.

71
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,930
You should've investigated
like this from the start.

72
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,210
It's a case where you made an allegation
yourself, and it's on the news.

73
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,010
We need to save face for each other.

74
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:17,520
Lee Ho Sung, Choi Min Guk
and Kang In Gyu.

75
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,180
I'm requesting warrants for
their arrest. Don't you get it?

76
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,940
Wow, nice work. You work hard.

77
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,020
So this...

78
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,110
will be it for your interrogation.

79
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,910
Let's get this done.

80
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,170
I'll be watching you until the end.

81
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,660
I have something personal to say to you.

82
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,980
We don't have a personal relationship.

83
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,780
You should still listen!

84
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,410
You are not a judge anymore.

85
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,950
How are you going to feed yourself
after being so rude to your sunbae?

86
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,490
On top of that,

87
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,320
I'm a prosecutor.

88
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,570
Oh. So scary.

89
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,640
Don't go lawyering in my neighborhood.

90
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,650
I will step all over

91
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,350
every case you take on.

92
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,740
Wherever I go,

93
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,550
I will make you avoid even my shadow.

94
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,520
Destroying one lawyer?

95
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,420
You know how easy that is, right?

96
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,880
- Is it?
- Feel it, Your Honor.

97
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,280
What it feels like to be called "Your Honor"
and then become a low-rate lawyer.

98
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,980
I should go rip up my resignation letter.

99
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,950
It has not been processed yet.

100
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,220
I shouldn't retire. I'll have
to be a judge forever.

101
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,840
When a judge holds a grudge,
it may become a snow storm.

102
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,020
You want to find out?

103
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,260
Go ahead.

104
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,750
Don't try to threaten just anyone.

105
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,780
Your face is threatening enough.
Scarier than a knife.

106
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,050
Let's stay out of each other's way.

107
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,630
Let's see each other often.

108
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,970
Practice smiling, please!

109
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,630
You are cute when you smile.

110
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,620
Bye.

111
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,760
In the legal community, no one
has not played golf with my father

112
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,420
nor failed to eat sushi with him.

113
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,700
Because there are too many involved
in the golf ball incident,

114
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,750
we can't investigate.

115
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,710
What are those?

116
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,330
Records of my father's tax evasion.

117
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:20,130
When he bought his land and building,
he avoided paying millions in taxes.

118
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,530
And he didn't report the consulting
fee he received in cash...

119
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,450
which is around another billion won.

120
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,130
Why are you doing this?

121
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,180
He defended Lee Ho Sung.

122
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,780
Wouldn't it be nice to send
them off together?

123
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,650
I'm asking why through us,
rather than doing it yourself.

124
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,540
How could a son get rid of his own father?

125
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,290
That would be immoral.

126
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,650
The timing is good for us to resolve it.

127
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,280
Let's have dinner with the chairman.

128
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,770
Let's do that.

129
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,610
It is true that Lee Soon Cheol
committed assault in the ambulance

130
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,710
and caused injury.

131
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,190
It is also true that a watch was damaged.

132
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,950
The victim was inebriated, but

133
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:26,180
it was not an urgent enough
situation to justify...

134
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,040
intoxicated...

135
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,850
Is it really different from what you wrote?

136
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,770
- I didn't write the ruling.
- What?

137
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,400
You need to go to the trial.

138
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,590
What are you going to do?

139
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,250
I'm just going to read this as is.

140
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,590
Something a trainee wrote? As is?

141
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,200
This is...

142
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,650
the best ruling I have ever read.

143
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go.

144
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,080
Today is really your last day, right?

145
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,580
This is my last ruling as a judge.

146
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,620
Please rise.

147
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,460
Yes.

148
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,610
Please have a seat.

149
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,040
I will now announce the sentence.

150
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,450
Case Number 2018.

151
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,350
The 237th court.

152
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,270
Defendant Lee Soon Cheol.

153
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,070
It is true that Lee Soon Cheol committed
assault in the ambulance and caused injury.

154
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,650
It is also true that a watch was damaged.

155
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,350
The victim was inebriated, and if

156
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,920
it was not an urgent enough situation
to justify a desperate intervention,

157
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:50,130
his actions for subduing a drunk
person can be viewed as extreme.

158
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,860
However.

159
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,800
The entire process

160
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,990
was the action of an emergency responder

161
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,560
committed to citizens' safety and well-being.

162
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,480
His good intentions of doing the best
he could, cannot be doubted.

163
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,010
The defendant

164
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,400
experienced many cases
similar to this incident.

165
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,050
He was aware that his actions could

That justification

that a thankful act should be thanked.

♫ I won't break apart ♫

330
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,210
♫ The memories that await me there ♫

331
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:01,760
♫ Like a dream, the loneliness
pierces into me ♫

332
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,400
♫ I miss you, I can't fill up
the loneliness inside ♫
