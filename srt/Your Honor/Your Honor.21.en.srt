1
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,289
Your Honor...

2
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:40,549
My name is Hwang Tae Yeol,
a 911 responder.

3
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:45,419
Responder Lee Soon Cheol
just began his career.

4
00:00:45,419 --> 00:00:49,119
Over his guilt that he couldn't save
someone's life on the scene,

5
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,169
I heard he started receiving
treatment for depression.

6
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,269
Someone like that

7
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:56,829
is facing a false report by a drunkard.

8
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:00,019
During the transport,

9
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,809
he says Lee Soon Cheol assaulted him.

10
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,699
But we believe it was

11
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,899
an inevitable action to calm him down.

12
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:11,119
I know that from my numerous
onsite experience.

13
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,639
I'd like to say a word on his behalf in court.

14
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:17,119
Please...

15
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,869
call me to court.

16
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,609
I plead with you.

17
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:23,199
From Hwang Tae Yeol.

18
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,930
Do a good job.

19
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,340
I'll be waiting for you.

20
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,240
Why wait? I don't know when it will end.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,610
- Go home.
- No.

22
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,990
When you were watching me,

23
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,220
you were standing at the
hospital for several hours.

24
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,050
Let's grab some pork belly
and soju after this.

25
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,480
And go to karaoke, too.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,940
The two of us?

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,630
No, I mean...

28
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,820
All of our team members.
The department dinner.

29
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,430
I thought you were saying
just the two of us.

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,520
Shall we?

31
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,100
I wish we could.

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,470
But everyone's worried for you.
Let's all go together.

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,290
Hello, Judge.

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,070
Trainee Song.

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,490
You got prettier.

36
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,590
What brings you here?

37
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,300
I was selected as one of the
disciplinary committee members.

38
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,380
I kept refusing, but

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,220
the Chief Judge who is the
chair is my sunbaenim.

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,900
I couldn't refuse in the end.

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,730
Is a prosecutor allowed in a
judicial disciplinary committee?

42
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,410
They can appoint one person who has

43
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,910
a vast knowledge and experience.

44
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,500
All the disciplinary committee
members are good people.

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,280
You don't need to worry.

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,230
You got chubbier.

47
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,690
Looking good.

48
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,150
Skinny women... that's not so attractive.

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,380
I wish you'd stop talking about
my appearance, Prosecutor.

50
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,960
You always get so upset
when I compliment you.

51
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,120
I'm saying you're sexy.

52
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,130
Prosecutor.

53
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,420
- Saying things like that...
- It's a compliment.

54
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,560
A compliment.

55
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,680
That a**...

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,590
That a**hole! Is he crazy?

58
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,520
He looks like a serial killer.
How dare he talk about appearance?

59
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,170
He should wash his face.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,190
- You knew him through prosecution training, right?
- Yes.

61
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,590
He's a repeat offender, huh?

62
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,250
I'm not sure.

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,750
Why not? He looks like it.

64
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,620
A face like that makes a regular
appearance on the Wanted List.

65
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,850
I think so.

66
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,300
Do you remember?

67
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,600
The killer training. Bam!

68
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,910
Yes.

69
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,410
If he does that again,

70
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,670
just throw a punch.

71
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,260
That's faster than the law.
And you feel better.

72
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,280
Yes. I got it.

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,090
I'll go in and take revenge for you.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Okay.

75
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,420
Have a seat.

76
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,210
Yes.

77
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,480
Seoul Central District Court,
Criminal Division 40.

78
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,130
Judge Han Soo Ho, correct?

79
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,720
Yes, sir. I am.

80
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,400
We all know each other, so we'll
wrap up identity questioning here.

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,730
Let's address the issue at hand.

82
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,060
You reviewed all the documents, right?

83
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,960
Yes, I did.

84
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,690
Let's review your negligence on duty first.

85
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,790
- Let's review the reason for disciplinary action.
- Okay.

86
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,420
Judge Han Soo Ho...

87
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,650
Since August 6, for no reason or advance notice

88
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,930
you postponed hearings and trials for a week.

89
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,020
Since then, on the 11th, 19th, and 20th

90
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,820
you postponed total of 36 trials.

91
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,660
You neglected your duty

92
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,630
and numerous complaints about the
trial procedures were submitted.

93
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,880
That's all.

94
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,350
- Please explain.
- Yes.

95
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,420
Postponing trials...

96
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,050
Yes, I did that often.

97
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,010
Is that very wrong?

98
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,640
Are you not acknowledging
that you neglected your duties?

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,230
Please allow me to speak a
few words to respected judges.

100
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,940
Sit down and talk.

101
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,160
Okay.

102
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,710
A long time ago,

103
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,330
I used to think the trials took too long.

104
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,860
But after I became a judge,

105
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,880
there's too much work to do.

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,390
Why don't they give a judge so much
work instead of time to think?

107
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,160
Don't you think that's wrong?

108
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,370
There are about 3,000 judges in our country.

109
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,720
Does it make sense for one person to
take care of two to three cases per day?

110
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll ask you respectfully.

111
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,430
For the sake of the judicial branch,
don't you want to select more judges?

112
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,640
You should give answers that
are relevant to the question.

113
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,990
What? This is totally relevant!

114
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,160
By chance,

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,980
you're not picking more judges because
you'll have less power, are you?

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,100
Judge Han!

117
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,300
Choose your words wisely.

118
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,940
My apologies.

119
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,150
I needed time to think
through to do the right thing.

120
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,780
A person's life depends on a verdict.

121
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,490
Even if I have to postpone a few days,

122
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,750
I wanted to give a good ruling.

123
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,540
What you're saying is

124
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,210
that the judges who come up
with rulings without postponing

125
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,850
isn't being considerate.

126
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,450
Is that what you mean?

127
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,330
That's not what I'm saying!

128
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,770
Yes, I got it.

129
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,570
I heard enough of your defense.

130
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,610
- Next.
- Next item.

131
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,210
Judge Han Soo Ho appeared in
a TV interview on August 17.

132
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,230
You didn't go through proper
channels beforehand

133
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,150
and didn't report after the interview.

134
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,780
As a judge, the interview content

135
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,610
reveals to have damaged the dignity
according to the insiders and outsiders.

136
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,290
Please explain yourself.

137
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,470
As for that interview...

138
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,370
I'll tell you honestly.

139
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,620
I was sleeping in...

140
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,540
and a TV personality came to my house
all of a sudden in the morning.

141
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,990
And...

142
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,430
I need...

143
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,030
a judge today.

144
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,300
I was dragged there.

145
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,900
It was unavoidable.

146
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,140
It's like I was kidnapped.

147
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,690
Are you playing around here?

148
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,390
Is this a place for your jokes?

149
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,150
It's true!

150
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,980
- I have a witness.
- That's enough.

151
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,160
If you have nothing more to
say, you can go now.

152
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,500
Is it over?

153
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,330
We heard enough of your explanation.

154
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,690
What?

155
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,310
Do you have more to explain?

156
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,250
How should I explain this...

157
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,330
The outcome has been decided already

158
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,860
and this hearing seems
like just a procedure.

159
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,350
How dare you say that?

160
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,200
It's over too soon.

161
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,380
Judge Han, step outside.

162
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,710
Actually, I...

163
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,980
made a deal over a trial.

164
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,020
Hey!

165
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,960
What? Am I the only one?

166
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,540
They say a fish rots from the head down.

167
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,820
I'm only a tail. What couldn't I do?

168
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,700
This is just like a courtroom.
Respect this forum.

169
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,020
Yes.

170
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,750
I accepted the bribe with dignity.

171
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,760
There were so many who were offering it to me.

172
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,910
Last night, the Oh Sung Group heir

173
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,570
even offered me a blank check!

174
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,890
You're still under the current law
for what you just said.

175
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,930
The sexual harasser prosecutor
should keep his mouth shut!

176
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,610
How dare you speak that way?

177
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,710
You look like a montage #1 on a Wanted List.

178
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,040
You say, "You're sexy, attractive" to a woman.

179
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,360
You really want to do that?

180
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm here as the member
of the disciplinary committee.

181
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,830
Keep your composure!

182
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,730
I don't want to be disciplined
by someone like you!

183
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,200
Stop this and get out!

184
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,390
Negligence on duty, loss of dignity...

185
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
What ridiculous reason for this hearing.

186
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,470
To be honest,

187
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,400
you're doing this because I had
Lee Ho Sung arrested in court.

188
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,700
Are you that afraid of the conglomerate?

189
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,360
How much money did you
take from them, you all?

190
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,080
Why are you all so cautious?

191
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,330
Stop this and get out!

192
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,640
I'll accept any type of disciplinary action.

193
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,230
I don't care if I don't get paid
for the entire year.

194
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:24,700
However, if you won't let me hold
the last trial by suspending me,

195
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,230
you'll see a crazy judge just lose it!

196
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,860
I will...

197
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,150
become the biggest shame
in the judicial branch.

198
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:35,620
I'll reveal everything I know!

199
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,950
We'll resume in 30 minutes.

200
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,700
I plead with you!

201
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,970
Please!

202
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,180
Keep the last shred
of pride of judicial branch!

203
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,360
Good going.

204
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,270
Crazy bastard.

205
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,880
Your Honor.

206
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,770
Did you do okay?

207
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:36,580
Cheer up. You didn't do anything wrong.

208
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,650
Why do you think I've done nothing wrong?

209
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,010
I don't think you'd do
anything wrong, Your Honor.

210
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,470
Let's go.

211
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,820
Geez, I want to make a time machine
with some smart people.

212
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,050
Why?

213
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,840
Did you say something wrong?

214
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,830
I should've threatened them more harshly.

215
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,180
Threaten?

216
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,860
That's my major.

217
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,130
I guess.

218
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,280
Someone said this.

219
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,270
Rather than a request,

220
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,700
we live in a world where a threat works better.

221
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's go out for a team dinner!

222
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,300
How was the Prosecutors' Office investigation?

223
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,610
You know it well.

224
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,390
Someone is choking me using an insider.

225
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,290
The chief prosecutor and Prosecutor Hong, too...

226
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,240
They can't be too hasty.

227
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,950
They're people you've nurtured.

228
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,790
Try watering the garden all you want.

229
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,800
Do the flowers remember who watered them?

230
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,430
It will just fade away in a few days.

231
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,150
Sang Cheol.

232
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,810
See who's choking my neck.

233
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,500
Why don't you find out?

234
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,690
Me?

235
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,320
I have to know who's trying
to kill me to fight back.

236
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,290
If it's someone who's powerful enough to do that,

237
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,960
I'd cut off my neck and offer it to him.

238
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,910
Don't say that.

239
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,350
We're the best law firm in the country, Father.

240
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,910
You go to the courthouse often, right?

241
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,920
When you go up the hill,

242
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,880
and at the top of it...

243
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,870
The courthouse in the east and the

244
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,740
Prosecutors' Office is on the west side.

245
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,890
They call themselves Easterner
and Westerner amongst themselves.

246
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,950
Do you know what that means?

247
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,650
That means they're

248
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,130
the essence of this country.

249
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,940
Easterners and Westerners have

250
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,210
dominated this country
since the Joseon dynasty.

251
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,900
If you look down on their power
just because they seem silly,

252
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,800
he will die whomever he may be.

253
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:56,520
Even if that person is the
president of the country.

254
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:00,840
That's...

255
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,110
the power of prosecutors and judges.

256
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,360
Please present your opinions.

257
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,180
We're currently investigating
Ohdaeyang Law Firm.

258
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,850
It's been revealed that Judge Han Soo Ho
accepted a bribe from them.

259
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,990
Looks like it will be in the press soon.

260
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,130
A strong disciplinary action beyond the suspension
is necessary for future prevention.

261
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,680
I agree with Prosecutor Hong's opinion.

262
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,910
For coming back and not quitting...

263
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,660
I thank you.

264
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:42,610
I'll cheer you on as well.

265
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,910
♫ In this darkness, ♫

266
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:55,200
♫ I'm looking for a path ♫

267
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:02,800
♫ The memories that awaits for me there ♫

268
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,200
♫ The endless loneliness that ♫

269
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,030
♫ digs deep in me like a dream ♫

270
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:14,290
♫ And the longing in my heart ♫

271
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,790
♫ like the thirst that can't be quenched  ♫

272
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,270
♫ For me... ♫

273
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,070
How did it go, Your Honor?

274
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,160
Something is bound to happen.

275
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,310
Let's go eat!

276
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,910
You have to go to a trial.

277
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,890
Gauze!

278
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,660
Are you okay?

279
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,040
How many minutes left?

280
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,730
10 minutes.

281
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,140
More gauze.

282
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,600
The defendant is an emergency responder working

283
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,390
at the Samsungdong branch in Gangnam.

284
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,640
On June 13, around 23:00,

285
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,380
you were dispatched to Seonjeongneung, right?

286
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,510
Yes.

287
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,640
What was the victim Jo Jeong Man's
condition when you arrived?

288
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,520
He was heavily drunk.

289
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,560
He asked to be taken to a hospital.

290
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,820
The victim refused to be measured for
blood pressure inside the ambulance.

291
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,250
- Did you try to tie him to the stretcher?
- Yes.

292
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,290
Did you become violent
when the victim refused?

293
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,050
Yes.

294
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,910
Facial cuts, abrasions of the rib cage,

295
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,260
including bruising on the arms and legs.

296
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,290
Did you cause injury that's worth
seven weeks of treatment?

297
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,810
Yes.

298
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,500
You also damaged the wrist watch
that the victim was wearing

299
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,110
worth 5 million, right?

300
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:51,890
Yes.

301
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,750
Did you settle with the victim?

302
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,310
No, I couldn't.

303
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,630
That would be all.

304
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,420
- Please cross-examine.
- Yes.

305
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,840
When you arrived, victim Jo Jeong Man
cried out in pain, correct?

306
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,640
Yes.

307
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,990
You didn't have to measure his blood
pressure since he refused, right?

308
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,090
Our duty is...

309
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,760
to do our best.

310
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,500
You didn't exercise violence, but

311
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,400
tried to calm him down on the stretcher.

312
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,000
It was an unexpected incident, right?

313
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,230
I said no, bastard.

314
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,100
You a**hole!

315
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,380
- Hey...
- I have to check your current stats.

316
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,710
Hey! Are you a doctor?

317
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,040
You a nurse? Who the hell...

318
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,740
For your safety, I'll tie you down.

319
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,410
For safety my butt...

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,150
Who the hell are you to...

321
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,600
You shouldn't do this.

322
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,510
Hey, hey! Let go! You a**hole.

323
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,610
Stay still!

324
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,560
Hey, you!

325
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,970
I...

326
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,390
pressed him down with my strength.

327
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,250
And I heard that's called an "assault."

328
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,450
Why couldn't you settle with the victim?

329
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,520
He won't answer my calls.

330
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,130
The victim...

331
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,210
"You rude bastard. Deserve to be fired."

332
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,290
"I won't settle, you a**hole."

333
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,670
That's the last text from him
and cut off all contact.

334
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,450
Did you receive that text?

335
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,680
Yes.

336
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,090
That's all.

337
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:10,530
I'll hear the reference witness testimony.

338
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,280
Is Hwang Tae Yeol present?

339
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,920
He did not attend.

340
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,010
Huh?

341
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,110
Please stop here. Here's the fee.

342
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,000
[ Seoul Central District Court ]

343
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Excuse me!

344
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,240
Give your sentencing.

345
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
Please sentence the
defendant a year in prison.

346
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,740
Your closing argument please.

347
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,050
While doing his best to perform
his duty, the defendant

348
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,020
caused unintentional injury.

349
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,500
But he's deeply regretful.

350
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,570
I ask for your generous ruling
considering his volunteer efforts.

351
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,470
Is that it?

352
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,340
Yes.

353
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,170
Why is it so simple?

354
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,040
You must defend him the best way
you know how. You're his lawyer.

355
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,560
I'm...

356
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,850
The defendant...

357
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,940
acknowledges...

358
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,970
his wrongdoing and

359
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,030
is deeply regretful.

360
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,740
I ask for...

361
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,460
your generous ruling.

362
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,110
Is that wrist watch really 5 million won?

363
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,970
Is there a receipt for its purchase?

364
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,060
I have the authenticity certificate for it.

365
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,770
One of the people I know

366
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,700
makes several hundred fake
authenticity certificates a year.

367
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,400
Be sure to obtain the purchase receipt.

368
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,710
Yes, sir.

369
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,210
And...

370
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,080
I ask you.

371
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,530
Please do a good job of defending him.

372
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,880
Asking for a generous ruling
because he's regretful...

373
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,530
- That's not all there's to it.
- Yes.

374
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,040
Make your final statement.

375
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,970
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,950
I have nothing more to say.

377
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,350
You've experienced this a lot before, huh?

378
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,670
You said the duty of an emergency
responder is to do your best, right?

379
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,950
Yes.

380
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,520
It's the same for me.

381
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,350
I have the duty to do
my best in this seat.

382
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,840
You can say anything you want.

383
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,960
If you have something to say, go ahead.

384
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,840
I...

385
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,750
don't like this country.

386
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,660
The people of our country...

387
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,510
They scare me.

388
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,290
So...

389
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,950
I'm not qualified

390
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,350
to uphold the number "911."

391
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,460
The reference witness just arrived.

392
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,460
Please stand from your seats.

393
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,970
Yes, sit down.

394
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:30,980
Please take your seats.

395
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,590
Witness, your testimony please.

396
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:41,580
Sure.

397
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,870
Your Honor,

398
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,450
I'm here to say something very important.

399
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:51,540
I'm not worthy of your respect.

400
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,890
Go ahead.

401
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm indebted to Lee Soon Cheol.

402
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,850
Last year April,

403
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:03,850
I dispatched after an emergency call.

404
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,910
But he wasn't an urgent patient.

405
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,320
When we arrived,

406
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,240
we learned that he couldn't find
his home from being too drunk.

407
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,030
In the meantime, a real emergency
had occurred in our precinct.

408
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,870
We were during transport.

409
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:22,200
So, responder Lee Soon Cheol nearby
had dispatched in our place.

410
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,740
While the ambulance...

411
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,910
was serving as a taxi to a drunkard,

412
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,340
the person who truly needed our help

413
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,790
ended up dying.

414
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,330
I hear he could've survived only if
we had arrived 10 minutes earlier.

415
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,680
There was a delay because he
came from a different precinct.

416
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,880
But responder Lee Soon Cheol

417
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,620
felt guilty about the man's death.

418
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,920
He suffered from serious depression.

419
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,770
But he's unable to receive
treatment from lack of time.

420
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,230
We...

421
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
must get hit if someone hits us!

422
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,470
Because he's drunk,

423
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,460
someone suffering from deep pain,

424
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,170
because he's a patient,

425
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,720
because he's a patient's family
who is feeling hurried.

426
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,910
We accepted the beating
even if we got beat up.

427
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,460
We determine whether to tie him up
to the stretcher or not for his safety.

428
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:34,240
Anyone can make a mistake
in the midst of doing so.

429
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,400
And because of that mistake,

430
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,340
if he has to pay even a small fine...

431
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,950
According to...

432
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,570
the Firefighting Officers Service Act,

433
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,800
we'll be called to the disciplinary committee.

434
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,730
As for responder Lee Soon Cheol...

435
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,700
Because of this trial,

436
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,410
the disciplinary action against
him will be decided.

437
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,970
A colleague...

438
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,680
being punished by another colleague.

439
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,730
It's a pain that's hard to bear.

440
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,250
Responder Lee Soon Cheol...

441
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,540
I heard he gave up everything
early on predicting that pain.

442
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,440
Your Honor.

443
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,450
That great man...

444
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,400
Please don't let him stand in front
of the disciplinary committee.

445
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,310
Please don't let him leave us.

446
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,370
With all my heart,

447
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,730
I plead and beg you.

448
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,650
I daresay for us prosecutors who
went through numerous trials,

449
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,010
we believe Judge Han Soo Ho
isn't qualified to be a judge.

450
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,450
There's no need to consider outside opinions.

451
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,370
But we've heard that a lot, too.

452
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,330
Now, let's wrap this up by
submitting your opinions.

453
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,250
Before we close, I'd like to
ask you all a question.

454
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:33,600
Enough to punish one of us with our hands,

455
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,560
do we have clear conscience?

456
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,730
I don't have anything
specific to reflect upon.

457
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,720
I believe everyone in this room
feels the same way.

458
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,120
Jung Soo.

459
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,490
You've gotten audacious.

460
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,800
What are you saying, Hyungnim?

461
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,400
- We're in our official positions here.
- Stop it already.

462
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,410
Don't forget to stop by the administrative office to

463
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,830
sign up for additional pay for working on this committee.

464
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,690
They're busy, so don't make them do their work twice.
