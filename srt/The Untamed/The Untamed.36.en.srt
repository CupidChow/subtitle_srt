1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 36

3
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
Lan Zhan, sit.

4
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,000
and drink the liquor.

5
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:50,840
Second Childe Lan,

6
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,480
call me Brother Wei.

7
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,480
Brother Wei.

8
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,320
What's wrong?

9
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,760
Your headband is tilted.

10
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,000
Tilted!

11
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,560
It's been 16 years.

12
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,080
Lan Zhan's capacity for liquor didn't change.

13
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,960
Small capacity still.

14
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,280
Lan Zhan.

15
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,240
Lan Zhan.

16
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,240
Wen Ning, it's really you.

17
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,520
Why don't you recognize me?

18
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,280
What the hell are you wearing?

19
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,360
Stand straight.

20
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,160
Hand.

21
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,360
Wen Ning can twist the steel with bare hands,

22
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,240
he will not let the chain wrap on him.

23
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,160
The chain,

24
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,640
is used by someone to trap him.

25
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,440
Whoever keeps Wen Ning alive,

26
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
won't allow him to think himself.

27
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,160
To make him obey the orders,

28
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,360
one must destroy him mind first.

29
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,400
If so,

30
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
Then...

31
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,160
That day,

32
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,120
my sister and I went to Jinlintai together

33
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,840
and were locked up by Clan Leader Jin.

34
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,840
Then my memory blurred.

35
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,720
It was just like

36
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,000
that I was locked at a dark place.

37
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,640
Someone came to check occasionally.

38
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,480
Until,

39
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,640
I heard your flute.

40
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
Who locked you up?

41
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
When did you controlled by the skull-piercing nail?

42
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,120
Do you remember any of these?

43
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,240
Wen Ning.

44
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
What are you doing?

45
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,080
Childe.

46
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,520
Sorry.

47
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
For all these years,

48
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,400
do you insist doing so?

49
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,240
Fine.

50
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,440
Childe.

51
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,679
Look at you.

52
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,640
Isn't it good to stand straight and talk

53
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,480
like this?

54
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,880
But,

55
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,000
all chaos were started by me.

56
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
If not for me,

57
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,800
Childe and sister won't suffer.

58
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
All chaos were started by you,

59
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,400
You are so 'great'.

60
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,640
If that is true,

61
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,720
It's not enough to burn you

62
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
thousands of times.

63
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,960
How can you be alive till today?

64
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,280
I... I...

65
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,120
Wen Qing was right.

66
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
You are a blade,

67
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
a precious one.

68
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,160
Who isn't interested in such a treasure?

69
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,680
Back then, Jin clan of Lanling announced

70
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,240
that they had burnt down you and your sister.

71
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
Now, you, the ghost general

72
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,720
are still alive anyway.

73
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,400
It's strange to keep the chains on you

74
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,520
which jingle all the time.

75
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,160
I should find a sword to cut it off.

76
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,520
Well,

77
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,080
wait me here.

78
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,360
I go back to inn first.

79
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,840
If Lan Zhan is awake,

80
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,240
then forget it.

81
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,880
If he falls asleep,

82
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,670
I'm going to borrow his Dirt-eschewing (sword name).

83
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Lan Zhan.

84
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,240
You wake up.

85
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,600
I am saying to borrow your Dirt-eschewing.

86
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
definitely not steal.

87
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,760
Lan Zhan. You...

88
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,160
Lan Zhan.

89
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,240
Lan Zhan, look at yourself.

90
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,880
You shouldn't go out when you are drunk!

91
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,120
Go back to sleep.

92
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,000
Don't move.

93
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,800
Lan Zhan,

94
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,160
I'm sorry.

95
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,520
It seems that I can't find our way back...

96
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,680
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

97
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,240
Lan Zhan, what do you want?

98
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,960
Lan Zhan.

99
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,600
Lan Zhan, you...

100
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,880
Take it.

101
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,120
Why do you give a rooster?

102
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,120
What are you doing?

103
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,640
These roosters were others'.

104
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,280
Do you know you are stealing?

105
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,840
Are they good or not?

106
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,360
Yes, really good.

107
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,480
You are really good.

108
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,520
For you, it's all for you.

109
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,400
Poor Lan Zhan, born in a gentry family

110
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,400
and was regulated strictly by three thousand clan regulations.

111
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,920
Now he's drunk and becomes even crazier than me.

112
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,240
Lan Zhan.

113
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,600
Now what?

114
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,880
= Lan Wangji visited here. =

115
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,960
Lan Wangji

116
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,920
visited here.

117
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,760
Lan Zhan,

118
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,680
let's stop making a mess,

119
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,120
go back and sleep.

120
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,480
Good boy.

121
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,320
Go, let's go.

122
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,440
Move, now.

123
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,880
Lan Zhan

124
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,160
Wait for me.

125
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,600
Don't move.

126
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,400
Lan Zhan, all settled, let's go.

127
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,760
Come on.

128
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
= Lan Wangji visited here. =

129
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,070
=Wei Wuxian also visited here=
= Lan Wangji visited here. =

130
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,200
Lan Zhan, have you put out the light?

131
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,800
So familiar with Lan Zhan's swordmanship...

132
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:29,760
Does it mean...

133
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
He's one of Lan clan?

134
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,440
Thanks.

135
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,360
Portal Talisman.

136
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:07,960
Lan Zhan.

137
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,840
Lan Zhan, he's gone.

138
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,040
Lan Zhan, calm down, he's gone.

139
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,920
Let me tell you,

140
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
you really exhausted me.

141
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,440
I dare not to let you drink again.

142
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,280
Thirsty.

143
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Water.

144
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
OK. I will serve you.

145
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,480
Hold it.

146
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,840
What?

147
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,520
I want you to drink the water.

148
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,400
Ok, enough.

149
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,120
Look at you,

150
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,840
Lan Zhan.

151
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,080
I think when you are sober,

152
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,120
you'd better forget all these.

153
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,120
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll feel too ashamed.

154
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,360
Lan Zhan,

155
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,840
what's this figure?

156
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,120
Two.

157
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,760
So now it's Q&A time.

158
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,319
Have you ever taste

159
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,160
Emperor's Smile at Cloud Recesses

160
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,160
No.

161
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,520
Have you ever broken any regulation?

162
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,319
Yes.

163
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,160
Do you like rabbits?

164
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,200
Yes.

165
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
Lan Zhan, you admit it finally.

166
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,120
Why do you help me?

167
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,920
I have my regret.

168
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,600
What regret?

169
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,320
At Nevernight,

170
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,000
I wasn't by your side.

171
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
So these years,

172
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,480
You've been looking for me?

173
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,200
Lan Zhan,

174
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,560
Remember this.

175
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,720
The whole thing has nothing to do with you.

176
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,680
Defecting

177
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,520
and studying crafty tricks

178
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,800
are my own choices.

179
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,960
Do you understand?

180
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
Lan Zhan, what are you doing?

181
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
Lan Zhan, do you understand or not?

182
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,360
It's 9 PM, rest.

183
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,640
Stop, you stop.

184
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,040
Stop running, stop!

185
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,880
Stop.

186
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,480
The 'Sun' falls down.

187
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
We are not start to shoot it yet, it falls.

188
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,520
Now who's the leader?

189
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,120
Of course it should be me, I'm Jin Guangyao.

190
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,840
I killed the devil of clan Wen.

191
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm Nie Mingjue.

192
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,360
I won most battles

193
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,200
and subdued most prisoners.

194
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,520
That makes me the boss.

195
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,360
But I play his Excellency.

196
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,760
So what? You're still my third junior brother.

197
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,080
You're afraid of me when seeing me.

198
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,800
You're a short-lived guy.

199
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,480
Jin Zixuan, you died before me and lived shorter than me.

200
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,960
Short-lived, yes, but I ranked the third.

201
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,240
Ranked third in terms of face.

202
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
OK, let's stop arguing.

203
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,320
I'm Thrice Bane Master (Jiang Cheng). I'm the best.

204
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,680
Let me be the leader.

205
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
What do you say, Hanguang Jun?

206
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,680
Pooh!

207
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,520
Gentries,

208
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,080
can I ask you a question?

209
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,880
What?

210
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
I wonder,

211
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,400
Why there's no Yiling Patriarch?

212
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,960
Er Wa and San Pang, do you want a sound beat?

213
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,360
Playing instead of going home for meal?

214
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,640
Come back, make good speed!

215
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,200
Run! Yiling Patriarch is coming!

216
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,880
Come back! Stop running!

217
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,800
let's run.

218
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,560
Lan Zhan, you wake up.

219
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,000
Last night, I...

220
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,240
You, you didn't do anything last night

221
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,080
You just talked much.

222
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,840
What did I say?

223
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
Actually, there's nothing about it.

224
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,880
Actually, you were saying...

225
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,120
For example,

226
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,360
I like...

227
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,840
I like rabbits.

228
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,720
What's wrong with liking rabbits?

229
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,040
Rabbits are so cute, and everyone loves them.

230
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,240
I like them, too

231
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,680
I like to eat them.

232
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,600
What exactly did I do last night?

233
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,200
No, nothing.

234
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,120
Really, you didn't do anything last night.

235
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,200
I was just teasing you.

236
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,080
Lan Zhan.

237
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,960
I'm going to talk about real business.

238
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,280
Say it.

239
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,240
Do you remember the Ghostface Man last night?

240
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,480
His cultivation is really good.

241
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,120
Good enough to support him

242
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,920
to use a Portal Talisman.

243
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,040
He cast spells on his sword and face.

244
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,440
I can understand why he cast a spell on face.

245
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,920
Cause he's afraid of being recognized.

246
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,120
But cast a spell on sword?

247
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,560
Usually the unknown cultivators

248
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,080
won't cast spells on their swords.

249
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,720
Because it's not necessary.

250
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,920
Unless his sword,

251
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,480
is really famous in cultivation world.

252
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,320
So once somebody recognized his sword glare,

253
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,160
his identity is exposed.

254
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,280
Therefore he had to cover it up.

255
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,760
And I saw your fight yesterday.

256
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,760
He seems to know well of swordmanship of clan Lan.

257
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,600
Lan Zhan.

258
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,120
Think carefully,

259
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,320
is he someone you are familiar with?

260
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,880
Moreover,

261
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,760
can he be one of your clan?

262
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,800
No.

263
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,000
Trust me.

264
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,800
You always disdain to lie,

265
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,560
so I believe the answer given by you.

266
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,640
It's just getting more and more complicated.

267
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,280
No matter how,

268
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,600
this man must be related to

269
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,960
the death of Red Blade Master.

270
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,880
Otherwise,

271
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,440
he won't go after your evil-subdue Qiankun pouch.

272
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,680
We must hurry up.

273
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,640
in case he forestalls.

274
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,000
But where are we going?

275
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,840
East of Shu.

276
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,600
Lan Zhan.

277
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,680
Are you sure our good brother pointing at this direction?

278
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,960
So strange.

279
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,000
This road doesn't look like frequently used.

280
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,760
Lan Zhan.

281
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,760
How about asking the villagers?

282
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,480
Excuse me, I would like to ask

283
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
where does the road lead to?

284
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,680
To Coffin Town.

285
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,080
It's a doomed place.

286
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,320
Whoever lives in this town,

287
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,240
lives a short life or dies an unnatural death.

288
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,480
As time passes,

289
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,160
it is called Coffin Town.

290
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,080
Thank you.

291
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,240
Be careful on the road.

292
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,920
Lan Zhan, let's go.

293
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,240
What did he say?

294
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,520
That road leads to Coffin Town.

295
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,120
The Chinese character on the stone is Yi.

296
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,400
Yi that means chivalrous?

297
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,000
Right, but also wrong.

298
00:26:59,320 --> 00:26:59,920
Why?

299
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,800
The character is Yi.

300
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,520
But not the one that means chivalrous.

301
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,390
but the one means Yi Home(Coffin Home), an ominous place.

302
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,760
He said,

303
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,520
for a long time,

304
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,480
Whoever lives in the town,

305
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,320
most of them lives shortly.

306
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,240
they either died young or died in unnatural ways.

307
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,640
So there are many coffins in the town.

308
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
Furthermore,

309
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,720
this place abounds with coffins and joss paper for funerals.

310
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,400
Local people have excellent skills on

311
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,760
making coffins and paper doll

312
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,320
So they took this name.

313
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,600
He also said,

314
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,720
fewer people went to Coffin town recently.

315
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,760
Except for those who deliver goods, nearly nobody comes out.

316
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,920
There's almost nobody around.

317
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,840
This road was discarded for years.

318
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,320
Really a poor one.

319
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:56,920
Be careful.

320
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,160
Bad geomantic omen.

321
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,040
A dire place.

322
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:40,720
Lan Zhan.

323
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,680
If someone sneaks between us

324
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,120
now in the fog,

325
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,920
we might not

326
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,160
discover him.

327
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,680
Shh, be careful.

328
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,680
It's a paper head.

329
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,280
Looks like a stygian malla.

330
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,280
Heed, be cautious.

331
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,120
Who?

332
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,560
Jin Ling. Sizhui.

333
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,560
It's you again.

334
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,440
I also wonder why it's you again.

335
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,640
Childe Mo, you're here too.

336
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,240
Does it mean Hanguang Jun is here as well?

337
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,240
It must be him, that's his sword Dirt-eschewing.

338
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,080
Yes, he's here. He's here.

339
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,600
But tell me

340
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,640
why you are here first.

341
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,880
Don't tell me

342
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,880
that you company each other

343
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,400
here for night hunting.

344
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,360
It's so strange here.

345
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,760
No residents around.

346
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,760
In broad daylight, but was teemed with pathogenic mist.

347
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,480
And none of the shops opens.

348
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,880
That's not the point.

349
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,840
Tell me why you're here first.

350
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,760
That's a long story.

351
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,080
After we entering the town,

352
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,440
we worried about getting lost,

353
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,520
so we gathered together.

354
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,480
Suddenly, we heard this sound.

355
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,160
At that time, it's not that quick.

356
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
One by one, slowly.

357
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,520
We seemed to see a small figure

358
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,240
in the fog, walking slowly.

359
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
It disappeared once we run to it.

360
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,520
The sound followed us all along since then.

361
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,920
We went on this road after entering the town,

362
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,040
and never changed our direction.

363
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,480
But we still couldn't get out of here.

364
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,520
Have you tried maneuvering the sword?

365
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,360
We tried.

366
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,240
I felt I've flew upwards for a long distance.

367
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,240
But actually it's not very high.

368
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,280
There are some shadows

369
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,520
flying hither and thither in the sky.

370
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,840
Since I don't know what that is,

371
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,320
worrying about being unable to cope with it,

372
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,240
I came to the ground.

373
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,240
Is the fog toxic?

374
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,880
It's not.

375
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,920
We did not die yet as we stayed here for so long.

376
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,760
I should have bring my Fairy.

377
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,600
It's all because of your dumb donkey.

378
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
We haven't put blame on your dog Fairy.

379
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,800
It bit Lil' Apple first

380
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,200
and got kicked by Lil' Apple.

381
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,880
Whose fault?

382
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,600
Now neither of them can move.

383
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,440
Wait.

384
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,120
My Lil' Apple was bitten?

385
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,800
Can that donkey be compared with my Fairy?

386
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,880
My uncle gave me Fairy as a gift.

387
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,200
If something happens to it,

388
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,880
It's worth more than ten thousand donkeys.

389
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,360
OK, tell you what.

390
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,320
Don't use the name of Lianfang Zun to frighten me.

391
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,080
My Lil' Apple is the gift

392
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,760
from Hanguang Jun.

393
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,920
How could you take Lil' Apple out of Cloud Recesses?

394
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,760
and even get it injured?

395
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,360
You lie!

396
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,800
Hanguang Jun won't give out such a gift.

397
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,640
Sorry, Childe Mo.

398
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,840
Your Lil' Apple

399
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,440
made noises at Cloud Recesses everyday.

400
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,200
Predecessors have complained it for long

401
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,960
and asked us to sent it away,

402
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,120
while we are having night hunting.

403
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
So we...

404
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,280
I dislike that donkey at first sight.

405
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,720
And named it Lil' Apple?

406
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,920
So dumb.

407
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,120
What's wrong with Lil' Apple?

408
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,400
It likes eating apples so it was named Lil' Apple.

409
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,360
Not pretending at all!

410
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,080
It is a name way better than Fairy,

411
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,640
which refers to your fat dog.

412
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,840
Fairy is not fat at all.

413
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,160
Can you find a wonder dog more robust than her?

414
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,680
Why don't you speak?

415
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,560
The silencing charm.

416
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Stygian Tiger Amulet.

417
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,120
How come?

418
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,080
It's not my Stygian Tiger Amulet.

419
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,440
My puppets

420
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,320
won't be cut into pieces so easily.

421
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,400
I think my guess is right before.

422
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,440
Somebody recovered Stygian Tiger Amulet.

423
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,400
But just a half of it.

424
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
So it's not that powerful.

425
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,640
What happened to you?

426
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,920
These powder mixed in the fog

427
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,400
are bitter and sweet with fishy smell, disgusting.

428
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
We should leave here first.

429
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,040
But we can't see anything.

430
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,080
Which direction then?

431
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,800
Wanna take my Qiankun pouch?

432
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,639
Unfortunately your eyesight is bad.

433
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,560
Why do you take my Spirit-capture pouch?

434
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,520
Lan Zhan.

435
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,239
Here comes the ghost pretender.

436
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,400
Lan Zhan, you are hurt.

437
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,520
Impossible.

438
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,120
Right.

439
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,320
Let's go this way.

440
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,320
How are the people who inhaled the powder?

441
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,160
They can barely stand straight.

442
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,400
Show me your tongues.

443
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,240
Those puppets are poisoned.

444
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,960
Congratulations, you got poisoned.

445
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,840
Congratulate for what?

446
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,600
Regard it as something

447
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,920
you can boast about later.

448
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,560
Childe Mo,

449
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,320
Will they be OK?

450
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,560
They are good for now,

451
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,840
however,

452
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,640
after poison flows into blood,

453
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,280
and all over the body into the heart

454
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,240
then no one can save them.

455
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,680
What will happen?

456
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,560
What happens to the dead, then what happens to them.

457
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,720
Well, what should we do?

458
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,840
What should we do?

459
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,480
Want to get treatments?

460
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,680
OK.

461
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,960
Then listen to me.

462
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,360
From now on,

463
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,320
everyone must listen to me.

464
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,240
Each one of you.

465
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,960
OK.

466
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,080
Good, stand straight.

467
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,600
Those who are not poisoned carries the poisoned.

468
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
While lifting

469
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,440
remember to keep head and heart upturned.

470
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,560
I can walk, why lift me up?

471
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,960
Dude,

472
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,840
if you walk around,

473
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,200
the faster your blood flows,

474
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,520
the faster poison flows into your heart.

475
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Therefore, you must be motionless, understand?

476
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,960
Understand.

477
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,240
Go.

478
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,640
This way.

479
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,600
Senior Mo, where are we going?

480
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,920
Since we can't get out of the town, knock some doors.

481
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
You want us to get into the house?

482
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,800
It's quite dangerous outside.

483
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,520
What if there are something hidden

484
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,760
in the house to ambush us?

485
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,000
True.

486
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,080
It's hard to say it's more dangerous

487
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,680
outside or inside.

488
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,920
But the outside is already dangerous enough,

489
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,240
the inside can't be worse.

490
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,880
Let's go. They need to be detoxicated in time.

491
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,240
Go.

492
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,280
This house is empty, come.

493
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,880
Who ask you to find an empty one?

494
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,120
Find one with people in it.

495
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,040
Keep searching.

496
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,160
Can't you say it earlier?

497
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,280
Anyone?

498
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,800
Is anybody there?

499
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,240
Madam.

500
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,840
Are you the shopkeeper?

501
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,400
Yes.

502
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,600
Madam.

503
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,080
It's the first time we visited here.

504
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,920
We lost our direction because of the thick fog,

505
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
and we are all tired .

506
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,920
Would you mind allowing us to be here

507
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,120
to rest for a while?

508
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,200
My shop

509
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,400
is not a place for resting .

510
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,200
But Madam,

511
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,840
the rest shops of this place

512
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,120
are all empty.

513
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,840
Would you please be so kind?

514
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,280
She really would let us in?

515
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,840
Of couse, my feet stuck here.

516
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,600
Even she want to close the door, she can't.

517
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,320
If you refuse to let us in,

518
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,160
I will kick the door.

519
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,040
Madam.

520
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,640
Why don't you light up the candle?

521
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,600
Candle is on the desk.

522
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,920
Help yourself.

523
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,520
Are these all your works?

524
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,040
Brilliant skills.

525
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,480
This old women is of quirkiness.

526
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,800
You...

527
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,360
You are not a madman indeed.

528
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
Who said I'm a madman?

529
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,040
Then why you wear mask?

530
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,960
I like.

531
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,480
The shape of mask is so unique.

532
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,560
Why don't you light up the candle while threading the needle?

533
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,000
Allow me.

534
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,480
Madam,

535
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,040
can we borrow your kitchen for the moment?

536
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,880
Kitchen is in the rear.

537
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,760
Help yourself.

538
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,480
Thanks a lot.

539
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,640
Don't go there.

540
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,840
Though there's no danger in it,

541
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,360
the place is full of weirdness.

542
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,760
We'd better behave ourselves

543
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,520
when we're in other people's domain.

544
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,720
I need someone to help me,

545
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,120
Any volunteers?
