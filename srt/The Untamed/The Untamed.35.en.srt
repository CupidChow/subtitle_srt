1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 35

3
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,480
How dare you hit me!

4
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
Never did my uncle do it to me!

5
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,160
Really?

6
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,360
But your uncle keeps saying

7
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,760
that he'll break your leg everyday.

8
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
He's just saying that.

9
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,280
What on earth do you want?

10
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,160
Let me tell you...

11
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,400
Hanguang Jun!

12
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,720
Hanguang Jun, I was wrong!

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Hanguang Jun, I can explain!

14
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,560
Hanguang Jun!

15
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,360
This matter ain't over yet. I'll be back for you!

16
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,120
Little stupid.

17
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,640
I always thought

18
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,960
that Jiang Cheng would always stand on my side,

19
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,120
and Lan Wangji would be our opposite.

20
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,080
It never came to me

21
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,040
that things today

22
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,880
would turn out to be such a reversal of that.

23
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:34,880
Lan Zhan,

24
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,040
I'm fine.

25
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,240
What happened?

26
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,040
This is a common trace of evil spell.

27
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
When it comes to find me

28
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,880
I will make it dispersed anyway.

29
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,520
But you have to help me then.

30
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm unable to cope with it alone.

31
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,960
By the way,

32
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,240
did you find him?

33
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,960
Where is him?

34
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,600
Is him the one we are looking for?

35
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,880
It's transferred from Jin Ling, isn't it?

36
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,680
You met Jiang Wanyin.

37
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,760
As long as we two are alive in the world,

38
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,640
we'll meet sooner or later.

39
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,880
Let's go. Let me carry you on my back.

40
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,200
Just a whipp by Purple Lightening.

41
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,890
Legs just feel a little numb. They aren't broken.

42
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,440
Besides,

43
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,200
I'm a adult man.

44
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,680
It's so embarrassing!

45
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,160
Embarrassing?

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,400
Not embarrassing?

47
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,400
You once wanted to carry me on your back.

48
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,640
No way did I want that.

49
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
You must have mistaken it.

50
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,240
It's impossible.

51
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,070
Never would you try to remember these.

52
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,680
Lan Zhan,

53
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,240
You... How's your leg?

54
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,440
Fine.

55
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,360
Don't pretend it's fine in every case.

56
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,560
Or,

57
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,120
I can carry you.

58
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,040
Everyone says that I have a bad memory.

59
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,600
Well, let it be so.

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,530
No carrying me.

61
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,400
What are you doing?

62
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Lan Zhan,

63
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,800
you have recognized me in Dafan Mountain.

64
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
How did you notice it?

65
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,200
Want to know the reason?

66
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,200
You told me that yourself.

67
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,160
I told you that?

68
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,440
Because of Jin Ling?

69
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Or Wen Ning?

70
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,560
I guess neither.

71
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,760
Think by yourself.

72
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,480
Just tell me. Please.

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,280
Put on the mask.

74
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,600
So it's really that old friend of ours, huh?

75
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,280
I don't know. I don't know. I...

76
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,520
I don't know anything.

77
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,360
I really don't know anything.

78
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,280
Hanguang Jun.

79
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
It's truly not me!

80
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,560
Hanguang Jun,

81
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,880
I was just passing by.

82
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
I know nothing at all.

83
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,640
Since you don't know,

84
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,440
let me tell the story.

85
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,400
Maybe you'll recall something

86
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,600
when I'm telling the story.

87
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,200
Who's this Childe?

88
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,560
Hanguang Jun,

89
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,920
is there any liquor?

90
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,120
About Walker Ridge,

91
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,800
there's rumor about the Man-eating Ridge and Man-eating Bunker,

92
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,360
but no real victim was ever found.

93
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,160
Thus they are all merely rumors.

94
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
And these rumors will keep people away from Walker Ridge.

95
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,360
So it was used as a defense line.

96
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,920
And it's only the first defense line.

97
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Childe,

98
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,440
I feel we have met somewhere before.

99
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,520
Since there is the first line, surely there will be the second line.

100
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,560
The second line,

101
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,920
is the evil beings in Walker Ridge.

102
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,160
If some ordinary people intrude Walker Ridge,

103
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
fearless of the rumors,

104
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,160
or accidentally,

105
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
they'll run away in terror

106
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,560
after seeing the evil beings.

107
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,600
As for the third line,

108
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,360
it is the Disorientation Trap nearby the stone bunker.

109
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,960
If the first two lines

110
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,400
were set for the ordinary ones,

111
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,440
then the third,

112
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,800
is for those cultivators.

113
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,640
But only those ordinary cultivators.

114
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,800
If the cultivator possesses some spiritual tool or wonder dog,

115
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,240
or he specializes in disorientation trap,

116
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,120
or he is a well-known high-rank cultivator as Hanguang Jun,

117
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,400
then the last line

118
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,520
will be breached anyway.

119
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
The only function of these three defense lines

120
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,030
is to prevent the Man-eating Bunker

121
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,580
in Walker Ridge from being discovered.

122
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,640
As for who built the stone bunker,

123
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,040
the answer is clear.

124
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,000
The place is within the boundary of Nie clan of Qinghe.

125
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,680
Except Nie clan,

126
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,880
none can set these three barriers easily

127
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,680
within the boundary of Qinghe.

128
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,920
Besides you happened to appear near the stone bunker

129
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,680
and left an evidence.

130
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,080
What's Nie clan's aim to set stone bunker

131
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,880
in Walker Ridge?

132
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,080
Why are there so many corpses inside the wall?

133
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,840
Did it eat people?

134
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,240
Clan Leader Nie,

135
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,720
if you don't make it clear today,

136
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,560
you should expect when one day it's exposed

137
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,720
the other clans come together to confront you.

138
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm afraid nobody would hear you

139
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,400
or believe you,

140
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,720
even if you want to explain then.

141
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,320
It's not Man-eating Bunker at all

142
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,760
but ancestral grave of my family.

143
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,520
Ancestral grave?

144
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,840
Your ancestral grave isn't for corpses

145
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,960
but for blades?

146
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
Hanguang Jun,

147
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,360
before I tell you,

148
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,960
would you please swear.

149
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,080
Since we two clans are friends for generations

150
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,720
and your big brother and mine are sworn brothers,

151
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,040
no matter what I'm going to say

152
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,680
you

153
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,080
and your friend

154
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,040
can never leak even one word to the public.

155
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
Even if it should be exposed one day,

156
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,720
please be my witnesses

157
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,040
and say something for me then.

158
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,800
Hanguang Jun.

159
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
Since you never lie,

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,120
I will trust you

161
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,840
if you swear.

162
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,080
As what you said.

163
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,200
Answer my question.

164
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,640
You said it isn't a Man-eating Bunker,

165
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,480
so whether did it eat human or not?

166
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,040
Yes.

167
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,280
No, no, no.

168
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,440
But...

169
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,440
It's not what you are thinking about.

170
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,440
These things

171
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,720
shouldn't blame my clan.

172
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
It's dozens of years ago,

173
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,240
when the rumor came up

174
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,160
that there was a Man-eating Bunker in Walker Ridge.

175
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,000
I only exaggerated the rumors

176
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,480
to spread them widely.

177
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
Please elaborate it.

178
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,800
Hanguang Jun,

179
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,480
you all know

180
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,160
that our clan is different from the other clans.

181
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,960
Decent cultivators all practice sword

182
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,450
as cultivation since the ancient time.

183
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,000
But...

184
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,960
Surely, not including Wei...

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,720
You know who...

186
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,680
He practice talisman as cultivation.

187
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,520
The founding progenitor of our Nie clan was a butcher.

188
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,840
So we all practice blades.

189
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,600
The blades carried by our previous clan leaders

190
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,680
all showed strong hostility and killing will.

191
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,520
Almost every previous clan leader

192
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,560
ended up possessed by the devil and died a violent death.

193
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,520
Besides, their fractious temperaments

194
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,080
also have a lot to do with it.

195
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,480
When previous clan leaders were alive,

196
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
the agitation of blades could be controlled by their owners.

197
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,720
Yet after their owners died, without control

198
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,240
they would become ominous weapons.

199
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,760
This sounds like wicked tricks.

200
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,000
Different. Different.

201
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,760
Wicked tricks are called so

202
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,720
because they are wicked and they murder.

203
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
Our blades don't need human sacrifices,

204
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,000
but ghost or spirit etc.

205
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,560
They have killed so many evils

206
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,480
in their whole life.

207
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,520
If no evil beings

208
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,400
were left for them to kill,

209
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,920
they would be restless

210
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,520
and haunt our clan.

211
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,520
Moreover, each blade only recognizes one owner.

212
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,480
Hence they can't be wielded by the others.

213
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,040
Offspring like me can't melt down the blades.

214
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,360
First, it's a great disrespect to progenitors.

215
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,040
Second, the problem may still remain.

216
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,720
They are such arrogant existence!

217
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,200
Tell me about it.

218
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,920
Those blades which followed my ancestors

219
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
through countless battles

220
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,360
and accompanied their cultivation

221
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,120
are arrogant existences indeed.

222
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,920
As the cultivation achievement of our clan leader

223
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,800
increased gradually,

224
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,640
the problem became worse and worse.

225
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,160
Until our sixth clan leader

226
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,040
he brought up a method.

227
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
Build a Man-eating Bunker?

228
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,880
Similar to it.

229
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,480
But at first what he came up with wasn't this one.

230
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,080
He just built two coffins and a stone bunker

231
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,200
to place the blades of his father and his grandfather.

232
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,240
What's strange is

233
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,080
that even if nothing valuable was placed inside the bunker,

234
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,880
hundreds of evil beings were oppressed there.

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,800
Hanguang Jun, let me explain.

236
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,760
We collected those evil beings out of no spite.

237
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,600
Our sixth clan leader said

238
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,280
since these blade spirits

239
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,000
wanted to fight with something wicked,

240
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,520
then we would give them something wicked

241
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,800
to fight with.

242
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,280
So we buried them together

243
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,400
as funerary objects

244
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,040
to reduce the agitation of the blade.

245
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,800
In this way,

246
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,920
the following generations could lead a peaceful life.

247
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,640
Then why you call it man-eating?

248
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,920
Not man-eating.

249
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,840
Even if it did eat someone

250
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,840
but not as what you think about.

251
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,680
What they built first was a big tomb for blades.

252
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
So it's quite a common tomb.

253
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,319
But later,

254
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,280
it was unearthed by a group of grave robbers.

255
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
It's bearding the lion in his den.

256
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,040
Exactly!

257
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,780
The grave robbers heard that there was

258
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,079
a big tomb of previous dynasty in Walker Ridge.

259
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,640
So they surveyed it first

260
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,720
and came prepared.

261
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,000
They rummaged around inside it

262
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
to find gold or jewelry.

263
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,600
But the blade spirit oppressed inside was aroused.

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The blade spirit was wakened.

265
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,640
Right!

266
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,840
That's to say,

267
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,800
the evil beings oppressed broke trough the wall,

268
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,920
so sacrifices became less.

269
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,760
The group of robbers were taken as sacrifices.

270
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,160
You are right!

271
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,240
Since they entered Walker Ridge,

272
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,640
no one saw them out.

273
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,240
Even corpses.

274
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,360
Thus rumors came

275
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
that something inside Walker Ridge was man-eating.

276
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,080
Our clan thought

277
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,240
it's beneficial to spread the rumors.

278
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,480
In this way no one would near that place again.

279
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,600
Hence,

280
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,760
we polished the rumor about a man-eating bunker.

281
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,160
You two can look at this.

282
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,400
As for little Childe Jin,

283
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,760
I don't know what method he took

284
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,080
to explode a hole in the wall.

285
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,760
At the same time,

286
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,840
a skeleton of a robber was also smashed by the explosion.

287
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,880
Thus instantly after he entered

288
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,800
the Disorientation Trap inside was triggered off.

289
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,440
When he became dizzy,

290
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,240
he was instructed to bury himself inside the wall.

291
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,000
I often go there to check it up regularly

292
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,520
and I saw it when I just arrived today.

293
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,040
When I picked up this stone,

294
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,360
a dog came after me and bit me.

295
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,040
I was really...

296
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,720
This Blades Shrine

297
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,840
is kind of our ancestral grave.

298
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,760
Ordinary cultivators won't go there for night hunting

299
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,280
after knowing it's within our boundary.

300
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
Who knows...

301
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,840
Who knows that you could be so unlucky

302
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,720
to meet Jin Ling, an undisciplined boy.

303
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,520
Tell me about it.

304
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,320
Hanguang Jun,

305
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,040
and this Childe,

306
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,280
necessary or not,

307
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,400
I've told you everything today.

308
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,960
You must keep it as a secret!

309
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,760
I'll keep my promise.

310
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,160
Thanks a lot. Hanguang Jun.

311
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,000
So...

312
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,480
Can I take leave first?

313
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,760
Wait!

314
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Brother Nie!

315
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,970
What's so interesting? Let me have a look.

316
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,920
Be careful!

317
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,680
This one is my favorite folding fan.

318
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,360
Look. It is exquisitely painted and uniquely constructed.

319
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,760
How's it? It is of the highest grade, isn't it?

320
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,840
In my opinion,

321
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,680
it's just so so.

322
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,720
What do you mean "just so so"!

323
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,160
The folding fan is exquisitely painted and uniquely constructed.

324
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,480
It is of the highest grade in the world.

325
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,960
Childe, you have a good taste!

326
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,360
I shall leave.

327
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:01,720
Lan Zhan,

328
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,600
what are you doing?

329
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,680
Clean the evil spell.

330
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,080
It has come to the upper thigh.

332
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,400
We should play the Requiescat.

333
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,760
Play it well.

334
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,680
You must have felt uncomfortable,

335
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,320
when enduring my noise so long that day.

336
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,920
What happened?

337
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,600
Is it used to the noise

338
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
and can't accommodate to my beautiful tune this time?

339
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,760
In these days,

340
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,280
I've never seen

341
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,240
it was so restless as today.

342
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,200
As if it was stimulated by something.

343
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,320
It's the thing on your leg.

344
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,920
Trace of evil spell.

345
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,080
Jin Ling got it when he was trapped in the stone bunker.

346
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,080
The sword ghost

347
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,240
reacts so intensively to the evil spell.

348
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,480
Does it mean...

349
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,040
Could it be that

350
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,800
Blades Shrine of Nie is the place

351
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,280
where the sword ghost is leading us.

352
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,360
Mending the wall over there. Over there.

353
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,720
Be careful. Careful.

354
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,800
Hanguang Jun and this Childe...

355
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,440
Clan Leader Nie,

356
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,800
you are mending the wall?

357
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,440
Yes. Yes. Yes.

358
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,320
I'm sorry

359
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,400
that you may have to

360
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
mend it again later.

361
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,320
Fine. Fine. Fine.

362
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,760
Wait!

363
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,040
Clan Leader Nie, don't worry!

364
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,040
We just want to

365
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,200
check the things buried inside your Blades Shrine.

366
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,760
We'll return them soon.

367
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,680
Help.

368
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,040
You...

369
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,040
This...

370
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,320
Use the Evil-subdue Qiankun pouch.

371
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,640
Later.

372
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,120
We don't know

373
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,280
what's the thing the sword ghost is leading us to.

374
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,760
Too dangerous to unseal it now.

375
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,760
You... What are you finding after all?

376
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,120
Could it be that we assumed it wrongly?

377
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,960
The sword ghost was not leading us

378
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,120
to the murder.

379
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,000
The sword ghost

380
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
is pointing out its owner.

381
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,520
No, no.

382
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,640
You must make a wrong assumption.

383
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,000
None of us in Nie clan practices sword.

384
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,600
We all practice blade.

385
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,960
Han... Hanguang Jun.

386
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,520
I'm not lying to you.

387
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,640
You...

388
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,800
Clan Leader Nie, you surely aren't lying to us.

389
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,840
We made a mistake.

390
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,360
And it's a big one.

391
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,760
The wicked spirit can attach to the sword

392
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,720
which can only prove that it's a spiritual weapon

393
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,480
But no one can say it's definitely sword ghost.

394
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,880
Clan Leader Nie,

395
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,560
another thing needs to bother you.

396
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,760
A... Another?

397
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,640
Nothing tricky.

398
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,760
Please help us

399
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,360
take all blades

400
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,800
out of the Blades Shrine.

401
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:09,800
What?

402
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,960
Hanguang Jun. Doesn't it cross the line?

403
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,640
Please. Clan Leader Nie.

404
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,160
Open it. Open it.

405
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,480
Yeah.

406
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,080
This is the last one.

407
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,280
So strange!

408
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,880
All these blades here.

409
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,400
Neither do they have trace of Stygian Tiger Amulet,

410
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,280
nor did the blade spirits leave them.

411
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,400
Could it be...

412
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,400
Brother Nie,

413
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,000
all your blades in Nie clan

414
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,680
are here?

415
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,240
All are here!

416
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,080
What?

417
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,080
You haven't done digging the ancestral grave of others?

418
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,880
I'm afraid not.

419
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,880
You... What do you mean?

420
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,320
Baxia.

421
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,120
You mean

422
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,880
Baxia the blade owned by Red Blade Master isn't here?

423
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,840
Big brother!

424
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,600
Big brother!

425
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,840
Big brother!

426
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Big brother!

427
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,280
I'll kill you!

428
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,000
Huaisang!

429
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,440
Big brother!

430
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,120
Don't go there!

431
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,080
Big brother can't recognize us!

432
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,080
Big brother!

433
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,440
Big brother!

434
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,120
Big brother! Big brother! Big brother!

435
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,680
Big brother! Big brother! It's me. Big brother!

436
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,200
Big brother!

437
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,760
Big brother! Big brother!

438
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,320
It's me.

439
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,520
Big brother!

440
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,800
Big brother!

441
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,360
That's to say Red Blade Master broke all his tendons

442
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,920
in Jin clan's Floral Banquet

443
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,560
but fled away anyway.

444
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,520
Besides no one has ever seen his body.

445
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,840
Exactly.

446
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,920
This is similar to my case.

447
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,200
Lan Zhan,

448
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,880
if the blade spirit

449
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,800
is Baxia the blade owned by Red Blade Master,

450
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
then it leads us here

451
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,720
to inform us

452
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,040
who's its owner.

453
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,960
Say,

454
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,160
where could it take us next?

455
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,160
To west.

456
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,280
It seems the blade spirit won't let us off.

457
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,160
What do you say?

458
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,520
Do you think it'll take us to find Red Blade Master?

459
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,080
Makes sense.

460
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,800
Whoever left this blade spirit

461
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,760
in Mo's Manor,

462
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,680
he wants us to find Red Blade Master.

463
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:01,920
Hence,

464
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,400
his being possessed by the devil wasn't an accident.

465
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,280
Besides the blade spirit seems so uneasy

466
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,560
I'm afraid Red Blade Master

467
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,800
was murdered.

468
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,000
But,

469
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,480
even if he was murdered

470
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,240
how was I...

471
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
my Stygian Tiger Amulet involved?

472
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,960
Is there anyone who wants to frame me up again?

473
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,880
Time will tell.

474
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,640
Clan Leader Nie,

475
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
we brought you trouble just now.

476
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,280
Sorry for that.

477
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,760
You exaggerate it.

478
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,680
If it's really

479
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,840
my big brother's Baxia who committed the crimes,

480
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,320
we Nie clan won't sit idly and watch.

481
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,199
After I finish mending our Blades Shrine,

482
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,840
I'll come to see you

483
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,320
Hanguang Jun and Childe Mo.

484
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,120
If...

485
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,719
if big brother's body can be found,

486
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,080
then I..

487
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,000
I'll have...

488
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,040
Clan Leader Nie,

489
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,600
if we make sure it's his body,

490
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,239
Hanguang Jun will send you an urgent letter.

491
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,520
Let's go.

492
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,640
How's your trace of evil spell?

493
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,880
Almost healed.

494
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,840
A little remains.

495
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,600
I'm fine.

496
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,160
It's not this trace of evil spell that troubles me.

497
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,920
What do you mean "a little"?

498
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,040
A little means a little.

499
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,280
How can I tell you that?

500
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,600
Or let me undress to show you that?

501
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,800
Lan Zhan, let me ask you.

502
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,280
Do you think

503
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,440
those who unleashed the blade spirit in Mo' Manor

504
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,280
and those who killed Red Blade Master

505
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,360
are the same group?

506
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,640
Not the same.

507
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,720
I agree with you.

508
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,520
If he is the one who killed Red Blade Master

509
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,800
and doesn't want the body of Red Blade Master found by us,

510
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,680
it's impossible for him to have used the blade spirit

511
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,120
to hurt the people of Lan clan.

512
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,200
Because it's easy to be investigated

513
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,360
and discovered.

514
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,360
One tries hard to hide,

515
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,120
yet the other wants everyone to know it.

516
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,640
So they aren't on the same side.

517
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,680
The man who killed Red Blade Master

518
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,800
seems to know a lot secrets of Nie clan.

519
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,560
The man who left us the blade spirit

520
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,520
however knows a lot of our activities.

521
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,480
Both of them must be tricky to deal with.

522
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,960
Secrets are becoming more and more.

523
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,440
Step by step.

524
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,560
Then how did you recognize me?

525
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,240
Think it by yourself.

526
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:38,880
Lan Zhan!

527
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,600
It's late. Let's find an inn first.

528
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,920
= Qiting Tavern =

529
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,570
= Qiting Tavern =

530
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,840
Good liquor. Lan zhan. It's good.

531
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,520
Sir,

532
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,160
the haunted house of Chang clan is there for years,

533
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,720
you'd better not go there!

534
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
Very dangerous!

535
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,480
I heard

536
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,400
scores of people of Chang clan

537
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,920
were all killed overnight.

538
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,000
These ghosts

539
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,600
trapped in the mansion

540
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
kept haunting around at night.

541
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,000
It happened about more than ten years ago.

542
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,200
Nothing like this happens nowadays.

543
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,840
Just because several cultivators passed by this place

544
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,640
and rested in our inn.

545
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,360
I remember they sat just at the seats where you are.

546
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,600
Cultivators?

547
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,160
Lan Zhan,

548
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,800
it's so unbelievable

549
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,960
after going here and there

550
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,320
we're back here again.

551
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,600
Lan Zhan,

552
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,600
you did it on purpose.

553
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,920
You don't know that at that night

554
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,040
the sky was tainted into red

555
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,480
so bloody

556
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,520
and the whole night resounded the sound of door-knocking.

557
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,080
So scary!

558
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,880
What happened later?

559
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,200
Later, several sword cultivators came

560
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,680
and took a guy away.

561
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,680
Who was taken away?

562
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,960
I don't know that.

563
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,040
Please enjoy.

564
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,840
You guys don't know?

565
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,600
It's Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan

566
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,200
who caught Xue Yang,

567
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,920
the courtier of Wen clan here.

568
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,760
But now he's a courtier of Jin clan.

569
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,280
- Drink. - Let's Drink.

570
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,800
The little jerk didn't die

571
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,840
and became a courtier of Jin clan?

572
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,320
Not a courtier.

573
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,080
Sixteen years ago,

574
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,240
Xue Yang appeared at the Jinlintai suddenly.

575
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,120
All clans agreed with punishing Xue Yang.

576
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,640
Only Jin Guangshan objected.

577
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,360
You said that he murdered about fifty people of Chang clan

578
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,480
did anyone see it in person?

579
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,480
I can't even guarantee the life of one guy?

580
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,680
What happened later?

581
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,160
Later,

582
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,440
the only survivor Chang Ping of Chang clan

583
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,640
withdrew his confession.

584
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,120
Really?

585
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,240
Chang Ping declared

586
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,080
the massacre of Chang clan

587
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,560
had nothing to do with Xue Yang.

588
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,560
That was to set the tiger back to mountain.

589
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,560
It's not until Jin Guangshan died

590
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,480
and Lianfang Zun Jin Guangyao became the clan leader

591
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,480
that Xue Yang was punished.

592
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,720
That Xue Yang should have died later, right?

593
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,880
I heard he was pursued by his enemy.

594
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,360
Who cares!

595
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,960
Anyway he was never seen later on.

596
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,120
Even if he didn't die, he won't come for us anyway!

597
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,680
Come on. Drink.

598
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,080
I heard he had some association with Yiling Patriarch.

599
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,440
Really?

600
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,520
Drink. Drink. Drink.

601
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,520
Me again!

602
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,480
Drink. Bottom up.

603
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,840
It never came to me that after sixteen years

604
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,000
people still hold deep hatred

605
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,280
to Yiling Patriarch.

606
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,440
All bad things have connections to me.

607
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,160
Strange!

608
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,520
When Xue Yang was set free that time,

609
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,120
didn't my senior uncle and Song Lan

610
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,120
appear?

611
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,800
Xiao Xingchen disappeared

612
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,360
and Song Lan wandered faraway.

613
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,960
They were not seen again.

614
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,160
So many years passed.

615
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,400
Not even any news about them?

616
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,160
Lan Zhan.

617
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,720
Sixteen years ago

618
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,800
Chang Ping died of slow slicing

619
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,720
and lost his eyes overnight.

620
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,560
The weapon used to slice him

621
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,400
is

622
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,160
Xiao Xingchen's sword Frostwork.

623
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,240
What? Impossible!

624
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,320
So,

625
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,800
people all believe

626
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,560
it's the disappearing Xiao Xingchen who killed him for revenge.

627
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,360
Since we parted at Yueyang

628
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,920
I only met Song Lan once.

629
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,000
And I thought we would meet again,

630
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,760
but the world was turned upside down now.

631
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,800
I've never seen him since we parted.

632
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,960
To be honest,

633
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,760
I actually admire Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan.

634
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,800
We had the mission of tracking Yin Iron then.

635
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,560
But neither were they from big clans,

636
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,040
nor were they acquainted with Chang clan.

637
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,680
They ended up so miserably

638
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,560
only for what have nothing to do with them.

639
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,480
I just want to say things are...

640
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,040
Things are so unpredictable.

641
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,520
Yeah, things are unpredictable. Quaff down the liquor!
