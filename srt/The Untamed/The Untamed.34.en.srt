00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 34

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,520
Fairy!

4
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Lan Zhan, help me!

5
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
Glad you're here in time.

6
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
Moral degeneration!

7
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,440
How flatulent the disciple of big clans are!

8
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,760
Flatulent!

9
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,320
Friend,

10
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,680
thank you for what you did just now!

11
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,040
Take these as my reward please.

12
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,080
You can discount them.

13
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,720
Three cents per paper. They're still worth a lot.

14
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,360
What kind of reward are these?

15
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,959
If you really want to reward me,

16
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,800
please draw him better.

17
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,120
Well. Well. Well.

18
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,160
However you speak of these,

19
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,280
they are all yours now.

20
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,760
Wait a second.

21
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,480
I want to ask you about something.

22
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,160
Since you said you've doing business here long,

23
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,600
did you hear of anything strange recently

24
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
or see anything strange?

25
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,040
You're wise to ask me.

26
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,520
I've settled in here for many years.

27
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,840
People call me Mr. All-knowing of Qinghe.

28
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,440
What kind of strange things you want to ask about?

29
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,920
Something like the evil haunting,

30
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,800
dismemberment murder,

31
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,520
family massacre and so on.

32
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,280
None here.

33
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,240
But if you proceed five or six miles further,

34
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,400
there's a place called Walker Ridge.

35
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,400
But I would advise against going there.

36
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,720
Why?

37
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,800
This Walker Ridge

38
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,560
has a nickname as Man-eating ridge.

39
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,760
You tell me why.

40
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,480
So it's because there's cannibal monsters along the road?

41
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,040
Come closer.

42
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,840
It's said that there's a Man-eating Bunker in the Ridge.

43
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
Monsters there eat only human.

44
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,000
If someone wandered into there,

45
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
he would definitely be eaten up

46
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,520
with no bone remains to be found

47
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,280
even no corpse to be found.

48
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,240
No exception.

49
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,560
Isn't it horrible?

50
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
It sounds really horrible.

51
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,520
But if there's no remains,

52
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,680
how did you know they were eaten?

53
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,240
You're...

54
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,600
Somebody saw it anyway.

55
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
And you just said,

56
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,400
since intruders were all

57
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,320
eaten up with no corpse to be found

58
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,120
and no exception,

59
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,440
then who is this powerful guy that

60
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,840
could walk in and walk out with the information?

61
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,560
You are... Anyway, that's how rumors say.

62
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,520
I don't know it for sure.

63
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Do you know

64
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,200
how many people were eaten there,

65
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,320
when they were eaten,

66
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
their ages and genders,

67
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,720
their family names and surnames,

68
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
and where did they live?

69
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,160
I really don't know that.

70
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,600
Mr. All-knowing of Qinghe?

71
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,720
Please. Please don't.

72
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,640
Please don't go.

73
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,760
One final question. Final.

74
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,760
Isn't Walker Ridge in Qinghe?

75
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,600
And isn't Qinghe under administration of Nie clan?

76
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
If there's man-eating monsters

77
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
in Walker Ridge,

78
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
how could Nie clan ignore that problem?

79
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,560
Nie clan?

80
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
If it were Nie clan in the past,

81
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,320
they would surly attend to it immediately.

82
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,080
They would rush over where

83
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,000
monsters are haunting and destroy them

84
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,400
the second day news came out.

85
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,960
But nowadays the Clan Leader Nie

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,320
is that Mr. Know-nothing.

87
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,040
I don't know.

88
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I don't know.

89
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,040
I really don't know.

90
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,240
= Nie Huaisang from Nie clan of Qinghe =

91
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,880
Please. Please don't ask me.
= Nie Huaisang from Nie clan of Qinghe =

92
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,320
Please. Please don't ask me.

93
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,640
I really don't anything.

94
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
What can he accomplish?

95
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,000
Mr. Know-nothing?

96
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,080
I can hardly imagine

97
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,400
that bro Huaisang could make it to be the clan leader of Nie.

98
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,760
And he also got a nickname Mr. Know-nothing.

99
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,200
But how could

100
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,440
that courageous and mighty Red Blade Master

101
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,720
have died without clear account?

102
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,760
I didn't witness it.

103
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,480
I just know his cultivation went wrong.

104
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,040
He dropped dead in public.

105
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,200
Dog!

106
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,760
Dog! Dog! Dog!

107
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,240
Wei Ying. No dogs here.

108
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,160
Don't look at me like this.

109
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,080
Why are you afraid of dogs?

110
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
Don't ask me why either.

111
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,640
Lan Zhan.

112
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,400
Alright, I'll tell you.

113
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,320
I'll say it.

114
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,320
I...

115
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,240
I used to be a tramp when I was little,

116
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,600
and often fought with dire dogs for food.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,320
It was lucky that uncle Jiang came to take me to Lotus Cove.

118
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
But it also

119
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,680
made Jiang Cheng send away his Xiaoai,

120
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,000
Feifei and what.

121
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,480
Just like what I made Jin Ling do...

122
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
They really live up to their blood.

123
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,480
He hates me so much

124
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,240
just like Jiang Cheng.

125
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,640
Lan Zhan,

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,480
let's go.

127
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,240
This, this is really a dog. Right?

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Still far. Hide for what?

129
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
It, it doesn't matter.

130
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,160
Just, just, just let me hide.

131
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,600
It sounds like Jin Ling's wonder dog.

132
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,960
It's barking. Something must have happened.

133
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,880
Let, let, let,

134
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,400
let us to take a look?

135
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,360
Hanguang Jun, move.

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
How can I move if you don't?

137
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,240
Let go of me first.

138
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,650
There is Disorientation Trap.

139
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,760
It should have been set by human.

140
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,600
It seems legends about Walker Ridge

141
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,080
are not groundless.

142
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Lan Zhan. Look.

143
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,960
Why I can only hear barking

144
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,480
but see it?

145
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,240
No matter how wonderful wonder dog is,

146
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,680
it can't breach the wards.

147
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,800
It might be kept out of Disorientation Trap.

148
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,560
What about Jin Ling?

149
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,880
Might he also be kept out of the trap?

150
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,600
If Jin Ling is out,

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,320
it can't be so restless.

152
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
It makes sense.

153
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
But how can we get in?

154
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,320
Lan Zhan, wait for me.

155
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,600
It must be that Jin Ling cracked the stone bunker

156
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,320
but something happened after he entered.

157
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,640
Let's go.

158
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,800
How is it?

159
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,160
Noisy.

160
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,600
There's spirits.

161
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,120
Jin Ling.

162
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
= Blades Shrine =

163
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:40,840
Jin Ling.

164
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,360
Jin Ling!

165
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,040
Jin Ling!

166
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Jin Ling!

167
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,000
Weird.

168
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,520
Why are there all blades?

169
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,800
Associate with spirits?

170
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,600
He's here.

171
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,400
Ask him for me.

172
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,760
Where is here?

173
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Built for what?

174
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,640
By who?

175
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,360
What did he say?

176
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,840
Don't know.

177
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,360
It said

178
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,160
it doesn't know.

179
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,480
Good for you, Lan Zhan.

180
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,240
You even know how to make me speechless now.

181
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
I know it!

182
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,960
It still said it doesn't know. Right?

183
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,520
What did you ask?

184
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,400
Died of what?

185
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,440
But if it was assassinated,

186
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
it surely doesn't know what it died of.

187
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,880
Lan Zhan. You can ask it.

188
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,839
Killed by who?

189
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,280
A spirit confined here

190
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,000
doesn't know where here is,

191
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,080
what it died of

192
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,320
or who killed it.

193
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,880
It's the first time I ever see a spirit

194
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,720
like this.

195
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,760
Lan Zhan,

196
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,360
can it be Nie Huaisang?

197
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,400
I was joking. Please don't mind.

198
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,520
Lan Zhan,

199
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,080
how about asking its gender?

200
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,160
This should be known by him despite the else.

201
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,000
Male.

202
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
Finally a decent answer.

203
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,640
Lan Zhan. Ask him.

204
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,080
Was there a teenager aged 15 or 16

205
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,160
who entered here?

206
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,200
Yes.

207
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,600
Where he is now?

208
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,000
Spirit says he's here.

209
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,360
You mean he's in this stone bunker?

210
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,120
But we've searched here carefully just now.

211
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,200
Nothing was found.

212
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,760
Lan Zhan. Can the spirit be lying?

213
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,640
I'm here. He can't lie.

214
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,120
What did you ask again?

215
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,640
How old he was and where he was from.

216
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,360
So?

217
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,080
Sixteen, from Lanling.

218
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
He is Jin Ling?

219
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,000
Jin Ling.

220
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Jin Ling.

221
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,120
Jin Ling!

222
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,680
Jin Ling!

223
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,480
Lan Zhan, where is he?

224
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,880
Stand where you are. Face towards southwest.

225
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,200
Listen to my music.

226
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
One sound. One step forward.

227
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,000
When music stops,

228
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
he'll be in front of you.

229
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,680
He's in the wall?

230
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,960
Jin Ling.

231
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,320
Jin Ling.

232
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,520
Jin Ling!

233
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
Lan Zhan. Look.

234
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,760
Above head.

235
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,240
Beneath feet.

236
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,240
Southeast, northwest.

237
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,040
Standing.

238
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,200
Sitting.

239
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,800
Lying.

240
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,400
Crouching.

241
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,560
What is this place?

242
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,480
Jin Ling.

243
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,600
Lan Zhan. We can't stay here long.

244
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,320
Strange outside.

245
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,720
Let's go out.

246
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,120
Lan Zhan. Catch up!

247
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,320
I'll go to catch.

248
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,440
You and Jin Ling...

249
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
I'll take him down the ridge.

250
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,120
You can find a place to stay in Qinghe.

251
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,160
Right.

252
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,080
there's a tavern where we met the doctor.

253
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,040
Wait for me there.

254
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,880
Catch up now!

255
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,600
He'll be gone any second.

256
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,520
I will go there.

257
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,240
Lan Zhan!

258
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,760
Take care!

259
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,200
Young as you look, you're quite tough.

260
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Trace of evil spell.

261
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,760
Who would cast evil spell on him?

262
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,280
Or it's left when we're in Man-eating Bunker?

263
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,480
So lucky it hasn't reached his chest.

264
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
What are you doing? Why took off my clothes?

265
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,880
Where is my sword? And my dog?

266
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,520
Why are so nervous?

267
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I made great efforts to get you out of the wall.

268
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,520
You don't know how to say thanks?

269
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,960
But for that,

270
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,440
you've been dead for million times.

271
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,160
Don't.

272
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,400
Listen.

273
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,760
One death has been enough for me.

274
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,680
Be good. Put the sword down.

275
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:45,640
Jin Ling.

276
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,760
The jade pendant...

277
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,400
My mother left it to me.

278
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,640
Don't touch it.

279
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,480
Xian.

280
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,600
This is what I later found

281
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,320
in father's study at home.

282
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,000
It should be prepared for you.

283
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,600
Take it.

284
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,320
What are you doing? Why are you running?

285
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,080
Jin Ling!

286
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,480
Outrageous!

287
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,840
What an outrageous boy!

288
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,960
I just scolded you for a little while.

289
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,360
Are you a defiant lady?

290
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,040
Look how bad your temper gets.

291
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,600
Oh. No. It's Jiang Cheng.

292
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,960
I have come back safely.

293
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,440
Can you stop your lecture?

294
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,440
Safely?

295
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,520
Look at yourself.

296
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
I don't think you were safe since you're covered with mud.

297
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,760
Wearing the uniform of your clan. How shameful!

298
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Go change it when we get back.

299
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,680
Say it. Who have you run into today?

300
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,680
I've said it. I haven't run into anyone.

301
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,120
Just a fall and a vain trip.

302
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,720
Don't hold on me like this.

303
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,880
I'm not a three years old child.

304
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,880
You think I can't discipline you now?

305
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,520
Tell you what. Even if you're thirty years old,

306
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,680
I can still discipline you.

307
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,400
If you dared to run off without saying anything again,

308
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,600
you would taste my whip.

309
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,400
Just because I don't want any help

310
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,560
either control,

311
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,360
I went there alone.

312
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,440
Except other comments,

313
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,680
Jiang Cheng is quite right saying he has a temper

314
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,280
of a defiant girl.

315
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,400
So what did you

316
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,520
catch there?

317
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,280
Where is the black-mane wonder dog your uncle gave you?

318
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,320
It must have been driven away to

319
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,280
where nobody knows by Lan Zhan.

320
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,640
You... You... Please don't.

321
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,120
You want to take it off yourself

322
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,240
or want another whip from my Purple Lightening?

323
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,520
Don't you

324
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,120
have any words to say?

325
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,480
I really don't know what to say to you.

326
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,600
You really didn't repent even a bit.

327
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,640
You're the one who made no progress!

328
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,160
Well,

329
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
let's find out

330
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,040
who really made no progress.

331
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,720
Senior sister! Drive it away!

332
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:46,920
Senior sister!

333
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,080
Who did you call?

334
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,800
How dare you mention her before me?

335
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,680
Right,

336
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,320
you're that Yiling Patriarch who has no taboo.

337
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,720
And you never mind

338
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,360
associating with those decent clans.

339
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,560
Sixteen years.

340
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,800
Lan Wangji still wants to shield you.

341
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,320
However, he might not be doing this to shield you.

342
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,080
No one from Lan clan of Gusu

343
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,600
doesn't remember what you and Wen Ning had done.

344
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,640
A person

345
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,920
whose integrity is highly praised by everyone like him

346
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,000
can tolerate you in no way.

347
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,080
Maybe he had a deal with

348
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
the guy who saved you.

349
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,400
Jiang Cheng!

350
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,960
Watch your language!

351
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,760
I never did.

352
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,240
You forgot that?

353
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,240
You got that right.

354
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,080
And what's your place to tell me to watch language?

355
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,560
That day at Dafan Mountain,

356
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,360
did you watch your language facing Jin Ling?

357
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,240
I can see you lack in some maternal education.

358
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,760
You!

359
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,880
Lack in maternal education.

360
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,880
You really know how to curse.

361
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,720
How smart you are.

362
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,000
It's all your work that Jin Ling is always

363
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
picked on with his mother's thing.

364
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,720
Great wits have short memories. Huh?

365
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,520
You forgot what you said.

366
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Forgot your swear.

367
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,080
But don't you forget

368
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,800
how his parents died.

369
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,720
I didn't! I just...

370
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,840
Just what?

371
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,480
I just...

372
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,000
Can't speak it out?

373
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,640
No matter.

374
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,880
You can go back to Lotus Cove.

375
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,200
Kneel down before my mother

376
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,760
and talk it slowly.

377
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,360
Who doesn't want to go back?

378
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,280
I want to go back to Lotus Cove even in my dream.

379
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,960
What are you mumbling about?

380
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,840
Nothing.

381
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,560
Where is he?

382
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,760
Who?

383
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:53,920
Where is Wen Ning?

384
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,600
Where is he?

385
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,280
I don't know.

386
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
You don't know

387
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,600
where your dog is?

388
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,040
I think I'll buy it?

389
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,760
Believe it or not,

390
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,080
I really don't know where he is.

391
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,000
Well.

392
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,840
That day at Dafan Mountain,

393
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,960
so many people saw you with him.

394
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,040
Jiang Cheng.

395
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,920
It's been so long.

396
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,600
You still hate him so much?

397
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:17,760
Wei Wuxian,

398
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,280
you ask me if I hate him?

399
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,000
You should ask me if I hate him?

400
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,239
But for him,

401
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,800
would Jin Zixuan have died?

402
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,199
Would my sister have died?

403
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,440
If there weren't you...

404
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,520
What have we Jiang clan done so wrong

405
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,040
that we deserve you doing that to revenge?

406
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,120
Jiang Cheng!

407
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,639
Please calm down.

408
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,480
Have you ever thought about

409
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,440
why Wen Ning can live till now?

410
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,040
Uncle.

411
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,640
Uncle.

412
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,360
I told you to stay where you are.

413
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,280
What you come here for?

414
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,960
I have a very important thing to tell you.

415
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,720
What thing?

416
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,080
You didn't tell me when I was scolding you.

417
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,000
And have to tell me now?

418
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
Just because you were scolding me just now.

419
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,000
You want hear or not? I'm leaving.

420
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,480
Say it and beat it.

421
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,120
I indeed found

422
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,520
a troublesome thing today.

423
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,760
I think I saw Wen Ning today.

424
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,640
When? Where?

425
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
This afternoon.

426
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Dozens of miles way in south.

427
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,480
There is a shabby house.

428
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,440
I went there because it was said to be quite weird.

429
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,200
But actually it's somebody was living there.

430
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,400
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

431
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,160
I wasn't sure.

432
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,360
That guy was so fast.

433
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,680
In the blink of an eye,

434
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,120
I could only see

435
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
his back vaguely.

436
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,240
But I heard

437
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,480
the chain sound like his chain sound back at Dafan Mountain.

438
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,120
So I guess maybe it was him.

439
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,600
If you hadn't scolded me despite whatever I said,

440
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,080
I could have told you

441
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,320
when I was back.

442
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,080
So if you couldn't

443
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,880
catch him this time,

444
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,480
your bad temper is to blame.

445
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,320
Not me.

446
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
I'll talk to you about this later. Now get lost.

447
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,640
You didn't go to Lotus Cove when you revived.

448
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
On contrary,

449
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,240
you went to find that murderer who killed Jin Zixuan first.

450
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,120
He's already a puppet.

451
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,520
And I can somehow count as having died once.

452
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,480
You do you want from us?

453
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,000
What I want?

454
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,600
Let me tell you,

455
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,240
Even if you and he could die a thousand times more

456
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,400
my hatred still can't be quenched.

457
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,680
Jin clan failed back then.

458
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,080
Well.

459
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,440
I'll catch him by myself today.

460
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,720
Bring him to you.

461
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,120
Then I'll burn you and

462
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,080
scatter your cremains.

463
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,640
Clan Leader. Clan Leader.

464
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,280
Uncle.

465
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,600
Keep a close eye on the guy upstairs.

466
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,640
Don't listen to a single word from his mouth.

467
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,680
And don't let him make any sound.

468
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
If he dares whistle or flute,

469
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
you just gag him.

470
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I know. I know.

471
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,760
Can't I guard a single guy?

472
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,280
You must keep him here.

473
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,800
If I found him gone when I get back

474
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,080
I would break your legs.

475
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,920
You guys. Come with me.

476
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,480
Understood.

477
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,240
You two guard the gate.

478
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,040
You two guard the stairs.

479
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,800
Understood.

480
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,000
I will meet him myself.

481
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,560
Let's go.

482
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,680
Dog! Dog! Dog!

483
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,000
How shameful.

484
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,000
Fairy never bites people.

485
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,040
You think it's an ordinary dog?

486
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,480
Wa...Wait a second.

487
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,880
What did you call it?

488
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,720
Fairy.

489
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,920
Its name.

490
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
You name a dog by that?

491
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,320
What's wrong with that?

492
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,000
It used to be Little Fairy when it's a puppy.

493
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,000
I can't still call it like that since it's grown up.

494
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,560
The problem is not if it's big or little...

495
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,520
The method of naming...

496
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,800
You must have learned it from Jiang Cheng.

497
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,080
A man should not stick to trifles.

498
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,600
Why do you care so much?

499
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,080
You've offended my uncle.

500
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,470
It should cost you half of your life.

501
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,960
But I let you go now.

502
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,280
And we're even.

503
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,600
Jin Ling.

504
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,560
Do you know why your uncle wanted to catch me?

505
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,840
Yes.

506
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,600
He suspects you're Wei Wuxian.

507
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,000
What about you? Don't you suspect?

508
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
My uncle

509
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,720
is always catching those who could probably be him.

510
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,800
And Purple Lightening has tested you.

511
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,080
I may say that you're not the one for now.

512
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
I don't care who you are.

513
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,360
Yet...

514
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,360
What?

515
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,400
If you want to wear a mask,

516
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,040
you'd better not wear Mo Xuanyu's mask.

517
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,920
He's really...

518
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,600
barefaced.

519
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,640
He also pestered... No. No. No.

520
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Anyway, we're even now. Just go.

521
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,120
Why don't you go now?

522
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,760
Waiting for my uncle to catch you?

523
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,760
I tell you,

524
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,480
you have saved me indeed,

525
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,720
but I won't thank you.

526
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:17,640
Not to mention,

527
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,000
some disgusting words.

528
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,720
Young man.

529
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,920
For a person's life,

530
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,440
he must learn to say two sentences.

531
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,760
Which two?

532
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,720
Thanks and sorry.

533
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,800
I just don't want to. What can you do with that?

534
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,960
You will say it while crying someday.

535
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,920
Jin Ling.

536
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm sorry.

537
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,520
For what?

538
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,840
For what I've said

539
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,080
to you back at Dafan Mountain.

540
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,840
Sorry.

541
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,000
Not a problem.

542
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,640
You're not the first one

543
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,760
who said that to me anyway.

544
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,640
That's right.

545
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,160
I truly lack in some maternal education.

546
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,440
But,

547
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,840
that doesn't make me inferior to anyone else.

548
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,800
Instead,

549
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,920
I'll make them open their eyes to see

550
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,240
that I'm much more powerful than any of them.

551
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,320
Jiang Cheng! Please! I can explain!

552
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,400
Luckily,

553
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,520
I maybe can't erase some kind of trace of evil spell.

554
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,920
But I can transfer it to myself.
