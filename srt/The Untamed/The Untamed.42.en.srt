1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 42

3
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,640
It's said Lan clan of Gusu take etiquette most important.

4
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,000
Judging from this case,

5
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,360
it seems it's just being said, not done.

6
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Forcing one's way to the bedroom of a clan leader,

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,400
does it fit with etiquette?

8
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,520
Su She.

9
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,720
Hanguang Jun.

10
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,800
Su She.

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,040
You defected from Lan clan,

12
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,200
but still imitate Hanguang Jun.

13
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,040
He wields Qin. So do you.

14
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,600
How could you scold Lan clan of Gusu?

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
You...

16
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,880
Who do you think you are?!

17
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,520
Enough.

18
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,720
Clan Leader Su.

19
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,760
It's not as though

20
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,040
there are some disreputable things in there.

21
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
Since second brother is so intent on it,

22
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,920
then I must open it for everyone to see, mustn't I?

23
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:05,800
= Fragrance Hall =

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,320
Why is madam Jin here?

25
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
All of our possessions are shared.

26
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,000
Su often comes in here to admire things as well.

27
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,480
Second brother.

28
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,640
Everyone.

29
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,160
This is my small treasure vault.

30
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,720
What do you want to see?

31
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Please help yourself.

32
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Jin Guangyao didn't transfer her somewhere else or kill her?

33
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Isn't he afraid that Qin Su might say something?

34
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,880
Mrs. Jin.

35
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,840
Mrs. Jin.

36
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,560
So Childe Mo took us into the hidden chamber

37
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,440
is to see Mrs. Jin.

38
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,720
Yao.

39
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,640
What is that?

40
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,520
This

41
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,000
is something rare.

42
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,840
The dagger

43
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,640
killed countless people

44
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,560
and it's extremely sharp.

45
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,240
Look at the blade of the dagger.

46
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,720
If you look closely,

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,160
you'll see that the reflection inside it isn't yourself.

48
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,360
Sometimes it's a man,

49
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,080
sometimes it's a woman,

50
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,040
sometimes it's an elder.

51
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,880
Every one of those reflections

52
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,760
is a spirit that had died in the assassin's hands.

53
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,040
Its resentful energy is too strong,

54
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,400
which is why I hung a curtain there

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,600
to seal it.

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
This must be...

57
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,320
That's right.

58
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,960
It belonged to Wen Ruohan.

59
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,320
Then it was given to Wen Qing.

60
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,600
Mrs. Jin!

61
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,720
Su!

62
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,560
Su!

63
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,760
Su!

64
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,840
Su?

65
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Su.

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,400
Su.

67
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,640
Wake up, Su. Su.

68
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
Su.

69
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,720
Yao,

70
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,840
I am sorry.

71
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Second brother,

72
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,080
what is going on?

73
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,560
Why would Su suddenly take her own life?

74
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,400
And,

75
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,320
why would you gather in front of the Fragrance Hall

76
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
and demand me to open my treasure vault?

77
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,720
Is there anything that you haven't told me?

78
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,000
What's going on?

79
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
Some time ago,

80
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
some of the Gusu's disciples

81
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,800
were on a night hunt.

82
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
When they passed Mo's Manor, they were met with

83
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,600
the attack of a blade spirit.

84
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,760
Both its resentful energy and its killing intent were heavy.

85
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
The disciples dared not neglect it,

86
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,160
and rushed back to Gusu to tell us.

87
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,080
So Wangji

88
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,560
had been investigating it.

89
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,520
Finally, in a place called Coffin Town,

90
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
the body of the blade spirit's owner was found.

91
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,550
The body has no head, so we cannot

92
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,910
recognize the identity.

93
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,960
But the blade spirit became visible.

94
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,150
The shape is like

95
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Baxia.

96
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,080
Baxia?

97
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Was the corpse our big brother?

98
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,000
How could that be possible?

99
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,240
Big brother has been missing for so many years.

100
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,640
How could that be possible?

101
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Brother Xichen?

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,320
The one you're referring to

103
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,520
is my big brother

104
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,880
and also your brother, right?

105
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,280
Clan Leader! Clan Leader!

106
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,280
Clan Leader!

107
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,840
Where's the doctor?!

108
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,360
Dismembering the body.

109
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,200
Taking the head away from the corpse.

110
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,840
Who in this world could have done such an insane act?!

111
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,000
I do not know.

112
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,360
When we started to search for the head,

113
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,480
the clues disappeared.

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,520
The clues disappeared...

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So

116
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,240
you came to search my place?

117
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,800
You wanted me to open the treasure vault,

118
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,200
because you were suspecting...

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,480
that big brother's head is at my place?

120
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
Well.

121
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,680
Let's drop the matter.

122
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,000
But second brother and Hanguang Jun, how did you know

123
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
that such a treasure vault

124
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,440
is inside my bedchamber?

125
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
And how did you make sure that

126
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,880
big brother's head is at my place?

127
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,920
What should I do?

128
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,040
How can I explain that I sneaked into the hidden chamber

129
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,080
and I saw Nie Mingjue's head?

130
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
How could I tell them about

131
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,120
the odd letter since Qin Su has died?

132
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Xuanyu,

133
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,880
is it you who told my second brother and those people that?

134
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,400
What's the use of making up this sort of

135
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,680
flimsy lies?

136
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,320
Mo Xuanyu.

137
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,640
Back then, because of your indecent harassment to Mrs. Jin,

138
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,200
you were kicked out of Jin clan.

139
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,280
Yet, speaking from the hearsay nowadays,

140
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,400
you somehow got favored by Hanguang Jun,

141
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,320
followed him

142
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,320
wherever he goes

143
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,680
and became close friends.

144
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,840
Why would Hanguang Jun, who has always been known for his

145
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
grace and righteousness, keep such a notorious person

146
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,160
by his side?

147
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,960
It truly is difficult to understand.

148
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,440
I won't bring up anything from the past,

149
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,720
but please explain in all honesty.

150
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,600
About Su's suicide for unknown reason,

151
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,520
are you

152
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,720
involved in this incident?

153
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,400
Hands off.

154
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,800
You're the one who should keep your hands off. Hanguang Jun.

155
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,440
Lan Zhan.

156
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,960
Step aside.

157
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,720
It's the Yiling Patriarch!

158
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,520
You are the Yiling Patriarch!

159
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,720
You...

160
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,480
You are him!

161
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
I didn't know that Yiling Patriarch has returned

162
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
and paid us your precious visit.

163
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,160
Apologies for the lack of reception.

164
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,200
Third brother,

165
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,480
what did you call him?

166
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,480
Isn't he Mo Xuanyu?

167
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,080
Ling, come over.

168
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,760
Everyone, please be careful.

169
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,760
Since he pulled his sword out,

170
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,800
he's most definitely the Yiling Patriarch,

171
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,360
Wei Wuxian!

172
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,400
Is it that whoever pulls out the sword

173
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,360
must be the Yiling Patriarch?

174
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,560
Third brother, Hanguang Jun.

175
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,320
Is there any misunderstanding between you guys?

176
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
No misunderstanding at all.

177
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,160
He's Wei Wuxian for sure.

178
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
The simplest way to prove it is

179
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,760
to ask him to take off his mask.

180
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,240
Wait! Uncle Jin.

181
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,440
Uncle Jiang,

182
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,560
didn't you hit him with Purple Lightening

183
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,320
back at Dafan Mountain?

184
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
But nothing happened to him.

185
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,000
Isn't it that those possessing others' bodies

186
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,080
would show themselves once whipped by Purple Lightening?

187
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,800
So

188
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,320
he may not be Wei Wuxian, right?

189
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,080
Dafan Mountain?

190
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,960
That's right.

191
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,840
Ling, now that you reminded me,

192
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,760
I've also remembered just what had

193
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,000
appeared in Dafan Mountain.

194
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,680
Wasn't he the one who summoned

195
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,440
Ghost General, Wen Ning as well?

196
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,120
You people might not know that,

197
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,360
when Xuanyu was still at Jinlintai,

198
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,320
he had seen a copy of the

199
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,800
Yiling Patriarch's manuscript at my place.

200
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,360
The manuscript recorded a evil trick

201
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,400
named "Sacrifice Summon".

202
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,280
With the price of one's own spiritual cognition, it can save

203
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,760
who are seriously injured.

204
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,840
Clan Leader Jiang

205
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
wouldn't be able to find out such evil trick,

206
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,080
even if you hit him with a hundred more strikes.

207
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
Yiling Patriarch,

208
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,320
ever since you jumped off the cliff of Nevernight,

209
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,320
your sword

210
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,440
was collected by the Jin clan of Lanling.

211
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,680
But, not long afterwards,

212
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,440
the sword sealed itself.

213
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,680
I believe that I don't need

214
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,880
to explain how a sword seals itself.

215
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,920
This sword is spiritual.

216
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,240
It refuses to let anyone except Wei Wuxian use it,

217
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,120
which was why it sealed itself.

218
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,840
Aside from the Yiling Patriarch himself,

219
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,440
nobody can pull it out.

220
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,240
Sealed itself?

221
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,800
But "Mo XuanYu" here, in front of everyone,

222
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,280
pulled out the sword that

223
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,520
had been sealed

224
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,680
for sixteen years!

225
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,050
= Fragrance Hall =

226
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,320
Your Excellency, shall we chase?

227
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,640
Yes.

228
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,240
Ling,

229
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,680
we could never expect that he was Yiling Patriarch, Wei Wuxian.

230
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,880
He has tricked us all. So I don't blame you

231
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,680
for treating the murderer of your father as a friend,

232
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,000
and protect him all the way.

233
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,560
Go after them!

234
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
Go after them!

235
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
Go after them!

236
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,830
Get Wei Ying!

237
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,350
Get Wei Ying!

238
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,830
Take Yiling Patriarch alive!

239
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,350
Get him!

240
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,280
- They're ahead! - Don't let him go!

241
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,920
Get him.

242
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,160
Lan Zhan, stay away.

243
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,040
Yiling Patriarch,

244
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,960
at this moment,

245
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,520
why do you still wear the mask?

246
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,520
Yiling Patriarch, you are worthy of the title.

247
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,360
Returning to the world after sixteen years,

248
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,480
you can still make all of us look like idiots.

249
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,600
Not only Jin Ling,

250
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,360
but Hanguang Jun was also fooled by you.

251
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,560
You're right.

252
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,440
Not right.

253
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,120
I have already known he was Wei Ying.

254
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,000
Lan Zhan.

255
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,400
Lan Zhan, you don't have to do that.

256
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,280
I've been used to this for a long time.

257
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,560
Let's go first.

258
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,600
You just say you were deceived by me.

259
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,160
Others dare not say anything about you.

260
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,280
Wei Ying,

261
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,960
Do you remember

262
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,080
what you asked me in the Cloud Recesses?

263
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,520
Lan Zhan,

264
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,080
but did you really

265
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,440
believe in me back then?

266
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,520
The feeling of sticking to the single-log bridge

267
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,680
til it's dark is indeed not bad.

268
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,920
Who cares about the crowded, broad avenue?

269
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,800
I'll stick to my single-log bridge till it's dark.

270
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
Lan Zhan. You fuddy-duddy.

271
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:12,840
Lan Zhan.

272
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,520
I'll give you one more chance.

273
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
Think carefully.

274
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,080
After you walk out this door,

275
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,200
your reputation will be ruined.

276
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,080
Are we going to fight or not?

277
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,640
Too much talk.

278
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,360
Let's fight!

279
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,960
Go!

280
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,160
You're Wei Ying?

281
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,120
You really are Wei Ying, Wei Wuxian?

282
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,000
Jin ling.

283
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,200
I'll tell you

284
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,880
about this in the future.

285
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:12,800
Are you okay?

286
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Why did this kid

287
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,200
stab the same place like his uncle?

288
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm hanging in.

289
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,640
Let's go.

290
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,320
Stygian Tiger Amulet is not orthodox after all.

291
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,040
Once you get restless,

292
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,520
you will lose control.

293
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,200
Lan Zhan.

294
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,040
You're worried that I'll be like Wen Ruohan

295
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,520
who was controlled by Yin Iron.

296
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,760
But Stygian Tiger Amulet is not Yin Iron.

297
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,360
Nor am I Wen Ruohan.

298
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,200
Wei Ying,

299
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,320
why laugh?

300
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,200
Nothing.

301
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,920
Just

302
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,400
something funny.

303
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
When everyone admired my power and wanted to flatter me,

304
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,400
you're the only one who scolded me.

305
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,080
But right now,

306
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,880
when everyone wants me to die

307
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
and hates me,

308
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,920
you're the only one

309
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,000
standing by me.

310
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:44,900
= Cultivation Chamber =

311
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,920
The wound at your stomach?

312
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,240
The wound?

313
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,880
It's fine.

314
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,080
It's caused by Sacrifice Summon.

315
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
How to undo it?

316
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Now I know

317
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,880
who is Mo's last enemy.

318
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,760
As soon as he's dead,

319
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,400
the curse will lift naturally.

320
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,040
It's Jin Guangyao.

321
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,840
Now, in any case,

322
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,920
I would not believe that Mo Xuanyu

323
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,000
was expelled from Jinlintai

324
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,880
because he harassed madam Jin.

325
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,920
I'm afraid he knew

326
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,800
what Jin Guangyao's secret was

327
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,680
and wanted to tell Qin Su,

328
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,680
but Jin Guangyao took the initiative to kick him off.

329
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,200
Why did he do that?

330
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,320
But I am sure that

331
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,560
the person who let Mo Xuanyu know the secret

332
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,200
must be the same person who wrote the letter.

333
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,040
It's very likely that

334
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,720
this man has been leading us

335
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,840
to trace the cause of Red Blade Master's death.

336
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,240
This person seems to

337
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,720
know a lot about Jin Guangyao

338
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,760
and hates him deeply.

339
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,880
Do you think

340
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,240
this person will be Jin Guangyao's lover?

341
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,280
The hate originated from love.

342
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,240
Your sword.

343
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:49,250
= Whatever =

344
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,600
Thank you.

345
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,960
It really did seal itself?

346
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,840
Is there the

347
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,480
Cultivation Chamber?

348
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,480
Yes.

349
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,080
You took me back to Cloud Recesses?

350
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,680
What if your brother finds out?

351
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,280
I have found out already.

352
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,320
Sorry to bother you,

353
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,400
Zewu Jun.

354
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,880
It was me who let Wangji take you back.

355
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,440
Before we get to the bottom of this,

356
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,120
Childe Wei could live here.

357
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,960
As long as I am there,

358
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,920
they dare not come to Cloud Recesses for searching you.

359
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,640
Zewu Jun,

360
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,400
May I ask

361
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,560
where's Red Blade Master's body?

362
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,760
The many sect's have already seen

363
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,000
with their own eyes Brother's body.

364
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,840
It is being kept by Huaisang for the moment.

365
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,240
I have sent those I trust to watch over it as well.

366
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,280
What's Jin Guangyao's reaction?

367
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,120
Flawless.

368
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,120
He said that he would

369
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,950
definitely get to the bottom of the matter

370
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,240
and give everyone an account.

371
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,480
Now that

372
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,360
Childe Wei is awake,

373
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,440
then, Wangji, isn't it time

374
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,240
for you to give me an account as well?

375
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,840
Brother.

376
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,240
You're more than I can handle.

377
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:22,760
Brother,

378
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,480
Jin Guangyao indeed has

379
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,960
Red Blade Master's head.

380
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,200
You saw with your own eyes?

381
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,360
He saw with his own eyes.

382
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,120
You believe in Childe Wei?

383
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,320
I do.

384
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,480
What about Jin Guangyao?

385
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,720
Not credible.

386
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,800
Wangji,

387
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,720
then how do you judge

388
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,240
whether someone is credible or not?

389
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,400
You trust Childe Wei,

390
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,160
while I trust Jin Guangyao.

391
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,200
Whether my big brother's head is in his hands.

392
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,480
Neither of you and me saw it with our own eyes.

393
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,440
We could only judge one based on how much I know him

394
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,080
and his words that we trust.

395
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,680
You think that you know about Childe Wei,

396
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,840
so you trust him.

397
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:08,600
Also,

398
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,000
I think that I know about Jin Guangyao,

399
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,360
so I trust him as well.

400
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,520
You believe in your judgment,

401
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,120
then am I not allowed to

402
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
believe in my judgment?

403
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,720
Clan Leader Lan.

404
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,800
Childe Wei, no need to worry.

405
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,040
Before the truth is entirely revealed,

406
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,680
I will not be partial to either side

407
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,800
or reveal your whereabouts.

408
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,760
Or else, I would not have allowed Wangji to take you back

409
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,720
or helped with your injuries.

410
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,000
Clan Leader Lan, I'm grateful

411
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,080
that you gave me this opportunity.

412
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,360
The fact that Red Blade Master's head is inside Jin's hidden room

413
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,240
is nothing but true.

414
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,400
Not only have I seen it,

415
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,280
I've also seen some other things.

416
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,760
Maybe this could offer some proof?

417
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,360
Childe Wei,

418
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,560
perhaps you have seen some things indeed.

419
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,240
However, you cannot prove that

420
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,360
you saw those things within the hidden chamber of Jinlintai.

421
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,680
That's true.

422
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
Then how about something else?

423
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,160
The direct cause of Red Blade Master's death

424
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,240
was indeed because he was possessed by the devil,

425
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,920
but, Clan Leader Lan,

426
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,300
don't you think that

427
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,970
the timing was a bit too much of a coincidence?

428
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,720
The doings of the blade spirit

429
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,800
is one of the reasons,

430
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,520
but have you ever thought that

431
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,920
there might be another cause to it?

432
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,760
What do you think the other cause is?

433
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,720
The Cleansing Music.

434
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,880
Childe Wei,

435
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,880
did you know that his Cleansing Music

436
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,240
had been taught by me personally?

437
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,400
Then, Clan Leader Lan, could you please listen

438
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,560
if there's anything strange with the music?

439
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,350
= Cultivation Chamber =

440
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,360
Is this piece of music

441
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,880
the one you taught to Jin Guangyao?

442
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,400
Yes.

443
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,200
The music is obscure.

444
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,440
It is difficult as well.

445
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,080
Did Jin Guangyao choose this piece himself?

446
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,560
That is correct.

447
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,720
Since it is really difficult,

448
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,160
then why did Jin Guangyao choose this piece

449
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,000
instead of something easier?

450
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,200
Because I have told him that

451
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,600
although it is difficult to master,

452
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,320
its effects are excellent.

453
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,780
The Cleansing Music is indeed difficult. Childe Wei,

454
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,440
you played one passage wrong as well, did you not?

455
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,440
I played it wrong?

456
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,480
One passage of it is wrong.

457
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,400
Wrong?

458
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
Is it...

459
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,000
Wei Ying.

460
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,800
Right.

461
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,840
It's wrong!

462
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,320
It's not that I was wrong.

463
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,600
Jin Guangyao is the one who was wrong!

464
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,200
When I was conducting the Empathy,

465
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,520
this really was how he played it.

466
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,840
I can promise that

467
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,880
I repeated that without any mistake at all.

468
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,840
Then he learned it wrong?

469
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,360
That would be impossible.

470
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,720
That would indeed be impossible.

471
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,120
Lianfang Zun is that clever.

472
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,440
His memory is uncommonly good,

473
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,520
how could he remember the melody wrong?

474
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,080
It's likely that it was on purpose.

475
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
I'll play it again.

476
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,000
This time, you two

477
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,760
please listen carefully to the passage that I "played wrong".

478
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,720
Stop.

479
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,480
This is it.

480
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
As I expected.

481
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,440
But I don't find this passage

482
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,920
inappropriate at all.

483
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,200
It does sound appropriate.

484
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
But it definitely is not part of Cleansing Music.

485
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,960
You two can follow me.

486
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,830
= Library Pavilion =

487
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,240
Clan Leader Lan,

488
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,120
would we be able to find the source of the melody here?

489
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,560
Not here.

490
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,120
But here.

491
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,000
This is...

492
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,920
Forbidden Chamber.

493
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,200
This section is all books of strange music.

494
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:42,875
= The Collection of Turmoil =

495
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,360
What is "The Collection of Turmoil"?

496
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,920
A music collection of Dongying (Ancient Chinese address of Japan).

497
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,960
Legendarily, it is a collection of evil music gathered by

498
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,640
one of the Lan clan of Gusu's cultivators

499
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,680
during his years of wandering when he was

500
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,480
traveling in Dongying.

501
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,600
Music in this book,

502
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,680
if played with spiritual power channeled in,

503
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,520
are able to harm others,

504
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,120
weaken the body,

505
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,040
irritate the mind,

506
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,960
agitate the spirit

507
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,320
or shut the senses…

508
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,360
Those with great spiritual power

509
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,920
could take others' lives

510
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,320
in just three notes.

511
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,560
This is the one!

512
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,040
Clan Leader Lan,

513
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,200
within the Collection,

514
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,560
is there any that can disturb

515
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,960
a person's temperament,

516
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,480
making them irritated,

517
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,200
agitated, violent,

518
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
easily-angered?

519
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,240
There should be.

520
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,760
It's so obvious to take someone's life

521
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,080
with just three notes.

522
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,520
He definitely

523
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,200
wouldn't have chosen a song so fatal.

524
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,120
But, if he had adopted

525
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,960
the reason of playing the Cleansing Music for Red Blade Master,

526
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,440
in the name of calming him down,

527
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,800
to play it for three months,

528
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,480
would the song

529
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,920
be able to act as a slow poison and catalyze

530
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,240
Red Blade Master's outburst?
