The Untamed

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 47

3
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,080
Hanguang Jun,

4
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,800
are there female cultivators

5
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,280
who are affable and flexible

6
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
and

7
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,960
doesn't mind puppets in your clan?

8
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:24,920
What for?

9
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,600
It's not for me.

10
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,440
It's just...

11
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
Wen Ning is an adult now.

12
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,000
I mean...

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,640
Childe!

14
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
Wen Ning can't follow me like this all the time.

15
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,440
He is not my servant after all.

16
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,360
Besides,

17
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,120
after this matter is over,

18
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
he indeed can't follow me any longer.

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,160
He following me like this

20
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,640
is not appropriate life for him.

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,360
As a friend,

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,760
I need to find him a good company.

23
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,520
Hanguang Jun, what do you think?

24
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,760
At least,

25
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,960
he needs to make some friends.

26
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
Lan Zhan,

27
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,280
I think Sizhui is a perfect candidate.

28
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,400
Enough, kids.

29
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,520
Quit teasing him.

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Wen Ning,

31
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,080
it's kinda inconvenient for you to walk on the street.

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,160
You might as well have a rest in the inn.

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,560
Lan Zhan and I will go have a look.

34
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,800
But...

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,720
Take it easy.

36
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,960
It's gonna be fine.

37
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Lan Zhan, wait for me.

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,120
= Oil lamp and candles store =

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,360
Sachets on sale!
= Oil lamp and candles store =

40
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,000
Have a look!

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,600
Have a look!

42
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,960
Look at those sachets.

43
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,760
Childe, have a look.

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,200
= Yunping City =

45
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,800
The place bought by Jin Guangyao

46
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,279
turned out to be a Guanyin Temple.

47
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:05,000
= Guanyin Hall =

48
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,520
What do you think?

49
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,960
There is a magic circle

50
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,280
suppressing something.

51
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,040
I knew Jin Guangyao

52
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,920
couldn't put the address in his hidden chamber for nothing.

53
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,480
Can it be cracked?

54
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,320
Not easily.

55
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
We need to wait till night when there's none.

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,360
Let's leave right now then

57
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,160
before we get others' s attention.

58
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,160
Thanks to your medicines,

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,000
without it my husband's disease

60
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
couldn't have been cured so quickly.

61
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
Madam, please don't come tomorrow.

62
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,000
What happened?

63
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
Since tomorrow,

64
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
our temple will be closed for three days.

65
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,560
Great Master,

66
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,920
I hear that the temple will be closed tomorrow.

67
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,560
Could you please tell me what happened?

68
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,880
Thanks for your concern.

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,360
Everything is fine in the temple.

70
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,890
It's just that the utensils and tiles in the temple

71
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,080
have a long history.

72
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,760
So they require some renovation.

73
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
I see.

74
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,760
By the way, Great Master,

75
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,680
usually temples are located in mountains.

76
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,440
It's rare to see a temple in a city.

77
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,300
People in the cities

78
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,520
run back and forth to strike for their life.

79
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,160
Aren't they more in need of such Guanyin Temple

80
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,360
to make wishes

81
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,840
and seek for tranquility?

82
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,280
But doesn't the bustle of people

83
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,560
annoy Guanyin Tuas?

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,360
Tuas saves people from bitterness.

85
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,280
How could Tuas be annoyed by people?

86
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,520
It makes perfect sense.

87
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,880
So this Guanyin Temple

88
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,440
only enshrines Guanyin Taus?

89
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,560
Right.

90
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,720
Great Master, you are so talented

91
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,720
for knowing Buddhist doctrines without being ordained.

92
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,700
= Benevolent God will bless you all =

93
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,360
There is a ward.

94
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,720
We get in through the courtyard.

95
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,480
Wen Ning,

96
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,680
stay outside and sentry for us.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If Lan Zhan and I get in without getting out,

98
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,280
go to Yunmeng for Jiang Cheng.

99
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,960
Understand?

100
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,240
Childe.

101
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm just preparing for the worst.

102
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm half a wreck

103
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,280
but we still have Hanguang Jun.

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,080
= Yunping City =

105
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,680
Fairy, shut up.

106
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,960
It's midnight.

107
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,800
Do you want to wake up the whole street?

108
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,880
Fairy!

109
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,600
Zewu Jun.

110
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,400
Zewu Jun. Zewu Jun.

111
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,200
Zewu Jun.

112
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,880
Fairy!

113
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,280
If you won't stop, I will stew you!

114
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
Where are you going?

115
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,320
Why is Jin Ling here?

116
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,160
Why didn't Wen Ning stop him?

117
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Why do you take me here?

118
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,400
Is anybody here?

119
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Anybody here?

120
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,160
Anybody here?

121
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,120
Open the door.

122
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
Please don't hurt him.

123
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Anybody inside?

124
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,120
Fairy.

125
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,840
Why do you run back?

126
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,440
Naughty kid,

127
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,320
leave quickly with the dog,

128
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,640
please.

129
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,640
Jin Ling, run.

130
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,840
I advise Childe Wei not to whistle.

131
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,040
It doesn't matter if the flute is broken.

132
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,920
But if a finger or tongue is lost,

133
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,960
that'd be so tragic.

134
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,200
You have a very good point.

135
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,880
Please.

136
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,500
= Guanyin Hall =

137
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Hanguang Jun,

138
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,560
you'd better not make any attempts.

139
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,880
Wangji.

140
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,960
Brother.

141
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,400
Shamefully,

142
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,040
I was cheated,

143
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,240
stepped into his trap

144
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,560
and lost my spiritual power.

145
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,320
With even my swords Crescent and Ice Crevice,

146
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,920
I can do nothing.

147
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,720
No need to feel ashamed.

148
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,320
Isn't Lianfang Zun

149
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,360
best at cheating?

150
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Childe Wei,

151
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,280
I have underestimated you.

152
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,640
By the way, I haven't asked you

153
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,400
that how you knew this place.

154
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,570
Don't tell me you and Hanguang Jun

155
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,560
were making a sightseeing tour,

156
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,600
and happened to be here.

157
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,720
Lianfang Zun,

158
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,520
don't you forget that you hid a large title deed

159
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,280
in your hidden chamber in Fragrance Hall

160
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,880
with the head of Red Blade Master?

161
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,360
Remember that?

162
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,680
That's my negligence indeed.

163
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
They should be put in different places.

164
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,400
In any cases, we are

165
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,320
at your mercy now.

166
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,440
So Lianfang Zun,

167
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,120
could you please satisfy my curiosity?

168
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,600
What kind of treasure on earth is stored

169
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,600
in Guanyin Temple?

170
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,520
The price to satisfy your curiosity is high.

171
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,720
Are you sure you wanna try, Chlide Wei?

172
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,320
Not a big...

173
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,200
Uncle Jin!

174
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,480
Hi, Ling.

175
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,480
What's wrong with you kid?

176
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,040
Why do you come here at night?

177
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,240
None of your business.

178
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,800
The black-maned wonder dog is very ferocious

179
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,720
and bites whoever it meets.

180
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,520
Sorry for my incapacity.

181
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,440
I let it run away.

182
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,760
Chase and kill it.

183
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,160
This wonder dog is extremely smart.

184
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,520
If it attracts people, there will be trouble.

185
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,360
Yes.

186
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,240
Uncle Jin.

187
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,960
Fairy was the gift from you.

188
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,360
You really want to kill it?

189
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,360
Ling,

190
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,600
what are you doing here?

191
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,960
Clan Leader Jin,

192
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,280
Ling is just a kid.

193
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,520
I know.

194
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,920
And he's your nephew.

195
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,400
Second brother,

196
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,359
what are you thinking about?

197
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,200
Of course I know Jin Ling is a kid

198
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,640
and my nephew.

199
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,680
What do you think I would do to him?

200
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,200
Kill him?

201
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,640
Ling,

202
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,480
you hear me.

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,960
If you run about or shout,

204
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,320
maybe I would do something terrible to you.

205
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,160
It's up to you.

206
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,280
Haven't you dug it out?

207
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,200
Let people inside do it faster.

208
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,280
Understood.

209
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
What is he digging?

210
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,840
Tunnel?

211
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,080
Stygian Tiger Amulet?

212
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,600
Or the suppressed thing?

213
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,920
It's close.

214
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
It's so close.

215
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,760
I could have seen

216
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,720
a good show as before again.

217
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,960
Back then you two

218
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,240
are a Yiling Patriarch

219
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,840
and a righteous role model.

220
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,920
Both of you were winning all the attention at that time.

221
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,360
But at last, you had to point your weapons at each other.

222
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
Isn't it the same today?

223
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,240
Hanguang Jun,

224
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,400
put down Dirt-eschewing now.

225
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,640
Do you really want to kill Childe Wei?

226
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,120
Lan Zhan,

227
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,440
don't listen to him.

228
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,440
I have never blamed you.

229
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,480
Lan Zhan,

230
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,360
you go first

231
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,160
to find reinforcement.

232
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,440
Great.

233
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,520
Then next,

234
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,560
please sheathe Dirt-eschewing.

235
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,160
Lan Zhan, no.

236
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,240
Jin Guangyao,

237
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,680
don't go too far.

238
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,840
It's too far for you already?

239
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,600
Next I

240
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,560
even want Hangguang Jun to

241
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,360
seal his own spiritual power by himself.

242
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,080
What should you call that?

243
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:00,880
You...

244
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,400
Lan Zhan.

245
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Zewu Jun,

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,120
it's going to rain.

247
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,840
Let's take shelter inside.

248
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,480
Please take it easy.

249
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,760
As long as you follow my order,

250
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,240
I will not hurt you.

251
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,160
Lan Zhan,

252
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,200
actually you don't have to do this.

253
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,560
That year...

254
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
In a nutshell, you owe me nothing.

255
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,520
I don't think I owe you.

256
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,840
So why did you do that?

257
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,280
It's what I should do.

258
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,200
Which one?

259
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,120
Clan Leader, it's me.

260
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,600
Come in.

261
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,000
What happened?

262
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,480
I ran into him on the way.

263
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I supposed he was useful

264
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,840
and caught him passingly.

265
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,040
Did you hurt him?

266
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,840
No.

267
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,840
He passes out in shock.

268
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,400
Minshan,

269
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,480
don't go too hard.

270
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,160
He can't take threats and being thrown.

271
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:10,920
Noted.

272
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,040
Why do you hold Huaisang in custody?

273
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,720
With one more clan leader,

274
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,400
it always could make others feel more fearful.

275
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,720
But please don't worry, second brother.

276
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,400
You know

277
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,800
how I treated Huaisang in the past.

278
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,000
When it's the right time,

279
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,200
I surely will set you free uninjured.

280
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,200
Should I believe you?

281
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,720
Do it as like you.

282
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,280
Believe it or not.

283
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,840
You don't have choices anyway.

284
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,880
Hanguang Jun.

285
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,720
Yiling Patriarch.

286
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,560
I can't believe

287
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,640
that we meet again so soon.

288
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,960
Moreover, the situation is reversed.

289
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,520
How about it?

290
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,520
What's your feeling now?

291
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,960
How can you say "reversed"?

292
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,400
In Burial Mounds, you are the one who fled away.

293
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,840
And now

294
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
your Clan Leader Jin

295
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,200
is so eager to dig for valuables.

296
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,880
Isn't he anxious to flee away?

297
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,560
Under such a circumstance,

298
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Hanguang Jun is still standing his dignity with calm

299
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,000
I'll see

300
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,640
how long you can last.

301
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,240
Clan Leader Su,

302
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,200
when you were a disciple in Lan clan of Gusu,

303
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,160
we never treated you unfairly.

304
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,120
Why do you have to aim at Wangji?

305
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,800
How dare I aim at

306
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,280
Second Childe Lan who was born talented?

307
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,000
I just can't stand

308
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,640
his self-important face.

309
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,960
When did Lan Zhan

310
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,200
say he is important?

311
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,560
If my memory serves me right,

312
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,080
in the principles of Lan clan of Gusu,

313
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,880
there is one "don't be arrogant and prideful".

314
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,040
How do you know the principles of Lan so well?

315
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,080
I have transcribed it so many times that I memorized it.

316
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360
Why did you transcribe the principles of Lan?

317
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,440
Do you think it's my choice?

318
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,520
That...

319
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,280
That was my punishment.

320
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,520
Shame on you.

321
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,560
You...

322
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,960
Clan Leader Su,

323
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
is it that Lan Zhan has worn

324
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,760
an indifferent face from birth

325
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,360
which makes you think so?

326
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,520
If that's so,

327
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,640
Lan Zhan gets a bum rap.

328
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,400
Obviously he shows everyone

329
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,320
an indifferent face.

330
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,680
Clan Leader Su,

331
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,000
you should feel blessed

332
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,760
that you didn't apprentice in Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

333
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,960
Why?

334
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,480
Or else you will be pissed off by me.

335
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,840
When I was young, I always regarded myself

336
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,640
as a prodigy beyond question.

337
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,560
And I didn't confine that thought inside.

338
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,840
I talked about it everywhere.

339
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,880
Shut up.

340
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,040
Clan Leader Su,

341
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
I advise you not to hurt us.

342
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,280
Lianfang Zun

343
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,560
respects Zewu Jun a lot.

344
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,240
If you hurt Hanguang Jun,

345
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,920
do you think that wouldn't piss off Lianfang Zun?

346
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,240
I have never expected

347
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,280
legendary Yiling Patriarch whose name frightens

348
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,200
both the just and evil

349
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,160
is also afraid of death.

350
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
You flattered me.

351
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,040
But I'm not afraid of death.

352
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,040
I just don't wanna die.

353
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,000
Playing with words.

354
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,480
Hilarious.

355
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
Are "be afraid of death" and "don't wanna die"

356
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,080
different?

357
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,840
Of course it's different.

358
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,480
My destiny is up to me and loss and gain don't concern me.

359
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,400
"My destiny is up to me" means I don't want to die.

360
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,960
"Loss and gain don't concern me" means I'm not afraid of death.

361
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,560
Is that clear?

362
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,120
How eloquent.

363
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,360
Great.

364
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,960
Since you are not afraid of death,

365
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,520
I'll let you be.

366
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,360
Who?

367
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,200
Uncle Jiang.

368
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,320
You call me?

369
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,680
You know to call me now?

370
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,040
Why did you run away a while ago?

371
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,840
Lan Zhan.

372
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,760
Fairy.

373
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Fairy, bite him.

374
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,680
Bite him. Bite him.

375
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,320
Bite him, Fairy.

376
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,000
Fairy, bite him.

377
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,520
Clan Leader Jiang, be careful with the music.

378
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,320
Lan Zhan, what do we do?

379
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Clan Leader Jiang,

380
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,240
the lethality of your attack

381
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,400
makes me wanna throw in the towel.

382
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
How did you find here?

383
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,240
Is it that Ling ran about carelessly

384
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,040
so you followed him here?

385
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,960
Fairy must have led the way for you.

386
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,560
It was me who gave him the dog.

387
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,640
But it's so relentless to me.

388
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,760
Seriously,

389
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,560
he talks the same way as like Xue Yang.

390
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,760
Clan Leader Jiang,

391
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,240
what's wrong?

392
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,480
Since a moment ago,

393
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,920
your eyes are always avoiding something

394
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,600
and dare not to see that direction.

395
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,600
Is anything in that direction?

396
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,720
You are the leader of all clans.

397
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,040
Just fight

398
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,440
and show you're equal to that.

399
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,960
Stilling avoiding?

400
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,120
Nothing horrible there.

401
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Only your senior brother.

402
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,880
Are you really following Ling here?

403
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,400
What else?

404
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,000
Who else should I come for?

405
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,560
Clan Leader Jiang,

406
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
don't answer him.

407
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,160
He is good at talking.

408
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,920
Once you start to talk with him,

409
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,840
your attention will be averted

410
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,360
and emotion stimulated.

411
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,080
Second brother,

412
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,160
you know me so well.

413
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,640
Childe Wei,

414
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,720
do you see?

415
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,880
Your junior brother didn't come for you.

416
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,480
He doesn't even want to cast a glance at you.

417
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,640
Clan Leader Jin,

418
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,000
your words sounds wired.

419
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,560
It's not the first day for Clan Leader Jiang to treat me like this.

420
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,120
Do I need you to remind me?

421
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,680
Clan Leader Jiang,

422
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,200
look,

423
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,720
being your senior brother

424
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,320
is not easy.

425
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,840
Clan Leader Jin,

426
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,920
Isn't being your senior brother even harder?

427
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,080
Clan Leader Jiang,

428
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,239
Yesterday I heard in Lotus Cove,

429
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,040
you made a mess out of no reason.

430
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,719
Carrying sword used by Yiling Patriarch before,

431
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,440
you ran everywhere

432
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,880
and asked anyone you met to draw it.

433
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
My sword?

434
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,840
Didn't I give Whatever to Wen Ning?

435
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:31,840
No.

436
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,840
Truly I didn't see him holding it today.

437
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,880
But how could it end up in Jiang Cheng's hands?

438
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,639
Why did he ask others to draw the sword?

439
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,480
Have him drawn it by himself?

440
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,800
Wei Ying,

441
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,080
clam down.

442
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,080
I heard that no one could draw that sword out.

443
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,760
But you drew it out.

444
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,440
That's strange.

445
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,320
16 years ago,

446
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,280
when I collected this sword,

447
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,720
it has sealed itself.

448
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,640
Expect Yiling Patriarch himself,

449
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,400
others can never draw it out.

450
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,760
Shut up.

451
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,280
So I am reminded

452
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,920
Childe Wei was really a carefree

453
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,000
and arrogant figure that year.

454
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,160
He went anywhere without his sword

455
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,480
and found different excuses every time.

456
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,600
I have found it very strange.

457
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
What do you think?

458
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,760
What on earth do you want to say?

459
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,120
Clan Leader Jiang,

460
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,200
you are so marvelous.

461
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,800
The youngest clan leader,

462
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,480
who rebuilt Lotus Cove on his own.

463
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,360
I admire you very much.

464
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,320
But I remember you were no match for

465
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,280
Childe Wei in every aspect before.

466
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,680
Can I ask you

467
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,760
how did you catch up from behind after Sunshot Campaign?

468
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,360
Did you

469
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,880
eat any golden core or panacea?

470
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
Uncle, be careful!

471
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,000
Uncle Jiang.

472
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,280
Please don't move.

473
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
Help him to sit down gently.

474
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,520
Get lost.

475
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,720
Fairy, run now!

476
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,920
They are going to kill you.

477
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,240
Clan Leader.

478
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,160
What? You haven't got it?

479
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,240
Sorry for my incapacity.

480
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,600
This dog is spineless.

481
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,480
When it has someone's back, it is aggressive.

482
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,760
But when it knows the situation is bad, it runs quickly.

483
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,080
And it runs faster than anyone.

484
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,400
Clan Leader, we have dug it out.

485
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,640
One part is shown.

486
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,280
Dig it out quickly.

487
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,440
Yes.

488
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,400
Be careful.

489
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,400
Uncle Jiang,

490
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,320
thanks for you stopping that string,

491
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
or else it would be terrible.

492
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,320
Shut up.

493
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,960
You know it?

494
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,160
When

495
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,880
did Wen Ning tell him?

496
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,440
While you were in a coma.

497
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,280
That's how we left Lotus Cove?

498
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,000
He's very sorry for that.

499
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,560
I've told him time and again

500
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,160
that never speak it out.

501
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,640
Never what?
