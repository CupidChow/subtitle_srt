00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 45

3
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,200
If you don't believe it,

4
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,320
you're welcome to ask old Master Lan

5
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,160
if there is such book in the Forbidden Chamber

6
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
of Cloud Recesses.

7
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,920
Granted that there is,

8
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,120
when I was apprenticing in Lan clan of Gusu,

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,760
I was never allowed to enter there.

10
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,880
Who said you have to get in there yourself?

11
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,390
As long as the man behind you

12
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,800
could get in without limitation it'll do.

13
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,120
I suppose your way of altering the music

14
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
was taught by him too, right?

15
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,960
A man of high position who could access

16
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,520
Cloud Recesses freely.

17
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,760
I believe it won't need more hints

18
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,080
before everybody can get it.

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,080
According to his word,

20
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,680
can it be...!

21
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,360
You guys really made a genius decision.

22
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,760
Gathered so many disciples of various clans,

23
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,600
and brought a big bunch of people here in Burial Mounds.

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,200
The mantis is catching the cicada, not aware of a bird behind.

25
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,760
Under an excuse of injury, he didn't come here

26
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,920
in order to avoiding suspicion

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760
and collaborating with your from outside.

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,560
In the end, hundreds of people all fall in my den.

29
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,120
Nobody would believe it's not

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,440
my work at that time.

31
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,560
And you guys are not afraid of running into me.

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,320
As notorious as I am,

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,040
with old scores and new hatred welling up,

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,360
all of you

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,960
would be too indignant to listen to my explanation.

36
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,280
Ridiculous!

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,120
Lianfang Zun, His Excellency, commands all clans now.

38
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,320
He doesn't need to strive for throne.

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,440
What benefit could he get for

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
letting so many people die here?

41
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,800
I can take it when you slander me.

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
How could you even slander His Excellency?

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,280
Since you're confident that I'm slandering you,

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,680
then can you play the battle music you just played

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,480
for driving those puppets

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,600
once again.

47
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah, play it again.

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,800
- Yeah. Again. - Once again.

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,480
- Play it. - Play it now.

50
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,000
- Once again.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,320
- Come on. - One more time.

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,440
Unwilling to?

53
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,120
Alright. It's OK.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,920
How about tell me

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,720
what are these?

56
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,680
You really think we left Jinlintai

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,280
without anything found?

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,800
In the hidden chamber behind the bronze mirror in Fragrance Hall,

59
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,240
Jin Guangyao got two torn pieces

60
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,320
of the Soul-chaos Script.

61
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
We found them.

62
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
We can just show them to old Master Lan,

63
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,079
and let him to tell,

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,680
whether there is the melody you just played.

65
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,400
The truth will be clear then.

66
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,560
Watch out!

67
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,720
Did my eyes go wrong?

68
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,640
You still got some spiritual power in you.

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,480
Congratulations.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
But

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,440
if there's no malicious intention

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,160
why did you conceal the truth

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,840
that you still got spiritual power?

74
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Damn. He's going to ruin the magic circle!

75
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
He is the Ghostface Man!

76
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,360
He's got Stygian Tiger Amulet.

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,000
It won't work.

78
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,120
Don't try.

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,880
Wei Wuxian.

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,680
You haven't tell everybody

81
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,840
why Su She could have Stygian Tiger Amulet?

82
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,920
This Stygian Tiger Amulet was forged by Xue Yang.

83
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,760
We met Xue Yang in Coffin Town.

84
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,120
A Ghostface Man showed up when we're fighting him

85
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,520
and tried to save him

86
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,080
but failed.

87
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,280
However he took Xue Yang's Stygian Tiger Amulet away.

88
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,600
And the Ghostface Man is Su She.

89
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,800
- This is... - How...

90
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,440
Wh... Which means

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
all puppets here are controlled by Clan Leader Su?

92
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,600
Childe Wei! I can't hold back them all!

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
What should we do?

94
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,040
What should we do now?

95
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,200
Ghost General! Let me help!

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,400
Wait.

97
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,320
Uncle.

98
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,840
Don't lose the Purple Lightening!

99
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Do remember!

100
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,920
Jin Ling!

101
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
You little fool!

102
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,720
Come back?

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,760
Do you hear me?

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,240
You should go back.

105
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I won't!

106
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,200
We're done. We're done. We're done.

107
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,280
What can we do?

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
What can be done?

109
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,720
Dad, what shall we do?

110
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,720
What is he going to do?

111
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
When the second wave rush in,

112
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,440
I'll draw them to the blood pool.

113
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,640
Hanguang Jun do the killing.

114
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
Here. I'm the bait.

115
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,560
Don't be bellicose then.

116
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,880
Just run to the outside.

117
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,880
They won't attack you.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
Let me draw a Lure Flag on my body too.

119
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
Don't be fool, OK?

120
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,840
One bait is far enough.

121
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
And I only need Hanguang Jun to do the killing.

122
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,520
Rest of you don't make trouble for me.

123
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,440
Listen to him.

124
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,200
Wen Ning. Get them out of here.

125
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,160
We finally made it.

126
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,160
- Yeah. - Finally.

127
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,400
My spiritual power has recovered to twenty percent.

128
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,880
I just got ten percent. So slow.

129
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,880
Everyone.

130
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,800
As far as I'm concerned,

131
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,120
while our power hasn't fully recovered,

132
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,200
we should find a safe place and

133
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,920
rest there till we got eighty percent.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,160
Then we can go home

135
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,640
in case of other incidents

136
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
or danger.

137
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,280
- Agreed. - Good.

138
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,680
How about we go to Lotus Cove?

139
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,320
It's the nearest.

140
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
- OK. - Agreed.

141
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,440
Clan Leader Yao.

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,440
We just leave... like this?

143
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,480
Or what?

144
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
Stay here?

145
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,280
What if those puppets come at us again?

146
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,240
They haven't got back!

147
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
They won't be back!

148
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
I think so.

149
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,280
Nonsense!

150
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,600
Sizhui. What are you doing?

151
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,480
You're out of your mind?

152
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
- Come back! - What is he doing?

153
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,720
Senior Wei.

154
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Sizhui.

155
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,240
Senior Wei. Senior Wei.

156
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,320
Are you OK?

157
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,440
Sizhui.

158
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
We are OK.

159
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,640
Don't be afraid.

160
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
I'm not.

161
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
I... I'm just...

162
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,880
I don't know why either.

163
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,520
I just...

164
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,280
Did this boy

165
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,920
become numb?

166
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,440
Senior Wei!

167
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,320
Senior Wei!

168
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
Senior Wei!

169
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,920
Senior Wei. Wake up.

170
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,120
Senior Wei. Senior Wei.

171
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,000
Yuan.

172
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,880
Yuan?

173
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,280
I couldn't imagine

174
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,520
Su She

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,640
is that kind of people.

176
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
Yeah.

177
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,680
I could never imagine that.

178
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,240
However,

179
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,400
it doesn't make sense.

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why did he do that?

181
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
Just for framing Wei Wuxian up?

182
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,400
Consider

183
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,240
what Wei Wuxian had said in Jinlintai

184
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,880
at that time?

185
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
Can it be...

186
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,920
Lianfang Zun?

187
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,360
This Wei Wuxian.

188
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,080
Bad as he is,

189
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,000
he can't always tell lies.

190
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,200
I just heard that...

191
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,320
Is it real?

192
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
I also heard...

193
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,600
Yeah. I heard the same.

194
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,520
No wonder. No wonder now.

195
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,120
Sizhui.

196
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,400
There's still a while before departure.

197
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,760
If you worry about seasickness,

198
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,040
we can stay on the pier a while longer.

199
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,560
OK.

200
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,440
Brother Sizhui.

201
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
You're seasick too?

202
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,160
Aren't you from Gusu?

203
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,840
How can you be seasick since you're not a northerner?

204
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,120
I have no idea.

205
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,600
I've been like this since I was about four or five years old.

206
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,040
I might have been born like this.

207
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's go.

208
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Gho... Ghost General.

209
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,200
What does he want?

210
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,520
Why is Ghost General here?

211
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,920
Can it be that he's going to share the boat with us?

212
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,040
Who knows.

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Shouldn't he be with senior Wei?

214
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,040
He's coming.

215
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,080
Wha... What's your name?

216
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,680
I'm a disciple of Lan clan of Gusu.

217
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,920
My name is Lan Yuan.

218
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
Lan Yuan...("Yuan" of "Wen Yuan")

219
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,320
Do you know

220
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,320
who gave you

221
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,160
your name?

222
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,520
Naturally, it's from my parents.

223
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,040
What is he doing?

224
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,880
Are your parents still alive?

225
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,520
My parents

226
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,880
passed away when I was little.

227
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,000
Bro Sizhui, don't say too much

228
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,160
in case it's a trap.

229
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,080
How is it going?

230
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,640
Sizhui.

231
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,080
Sizhui is your courtesy name?

232
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,040
Correct.

233
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
Who gave you that?

234
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,360
Hanguang Jun.

235
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,560
Gho...

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,840
Mr. Wen.

237
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,840
Anything wrong with my name?

238
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,280
No.

239
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,040
Not at all.

240
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
You just look

241
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,600
very similar to one of my

242
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,760
distant relatives.

243
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,840
I didn't know Ghost General can naturally engage with others.

244
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,640
Yeah.

245
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,360
Where have I met

246
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,200
this face before?

247
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,080
Childe Lan.

248
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,360
Childe?

249
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,040
Can I call you Yuan?("Yuan" of "Wen Yuan")

250
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,240
Of course.

251
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,480
Yuan.

252
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,640
How have you been these years?

253
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,440
I've been living well.

254
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,440
Hanguang Jun must be very nice to you.

255
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,600
He's like a brother and father to me.

256
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,120
He taught me how to play Qin.

257
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
How old was you

258
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,880
when Hanguang Jun started to

259
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,320
take care of you?

260
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,880
I can't remember.

261
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,480
About four or five maybe.

262
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,160
But when I was even younger,

263
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,280
he couldn't have taken care of me then,

264
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,680
because he seemed to be isolating himself

265
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,000
for that few years.

266
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,640
What is he gonna do?

267
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,920
I bought it when I was passing by the wharf.

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,320
I thought you'd like it.

269
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Please take it.

270
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,640
Yuan.

271
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,760
Childe Jin Rulan.

272
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,320
What did you call?

273
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,760
Young Childe Jin Ling.

274
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,760
Childe Jin.

275
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,520
Step aside.

276
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
None of your business.

277
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,520
Jin Ling.

278
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,920
Put your sword away first.

279
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,040
Get out of my way!

280
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,280
Sizhui.

281
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,120
Childe Jin.

282
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,440
If you are angry

283
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,520
come at me and I won't protest.

284
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,800
But Yuan,

285
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,160
Childe Lan is inn...

286
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,560
Jin Ling, how could you act like this?

287
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,200
Has Sizhui done anything to piss you off?

288
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Yeah.

289
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,440
He was caring for you.

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,760
How could you push him

291
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,800
ignoring his kindness?

292
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,160
How undisciplined.

293
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,040
Ill-bred.

294
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,760
Right!

295
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,520
I'm just that awful!

296
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,560
So what?

297
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,120
Why abruptly burst out?

298
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,520
Unreasonable.

299
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,880
What a temper of young mistress.

300
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,920
Erupt without notice.

301
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,360
Ill-bred.

302
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,800
Who did you take us as?

303
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

304
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,200
Jin Ling.

305
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,480
Jin Ling.

306
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,360
Wei Ying.

307
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
Jin Ling.

308
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,200
Lan Zhan.

309
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
What happened?

310
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,800
You passed out.

311
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,400
Not me.

312
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I mean Jin Ling.

313
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,640
What happened to them?

314
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,760
It was you who started this.

315
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,680
Why you act like a furious victim?

316
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,800
Stop it.

317
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,160
I'm indeed ill-bred.

318
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,840
But you're not the one who can discipline me!

319
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
What's going on?

320
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,280
What happened, Wen Ning?

321
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,920
Childe, I'm sorry.

322
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,720
It's all my fault.

323
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,600
I couldn't control myself.

324
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,720
I just wanted to see him...

325
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,480
Don't put up a play like this!

326
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,160
Jin Ling.

327
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,320
Put your sword down.

328
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
I won't!

329
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,040
Jin Ling!

330
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,560
No!

331
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,920
Quit it!

332
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,240
Well. All because I'm misbehaving!

333
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,400
Because I'm so childish! Satisfied?!

334
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,400
This is my dad's sword.

335
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,840
I won't put it down.

336
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,920
Ling!

337
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,320
Ling!

338
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,320
Why are you crying?

339
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,160
Come here now!

340
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,360
What's wrong?

341
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,280
Who made you cry?

342
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,800
Wei Wuxian!

343
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,800
What's your intention standing on the shore?

344
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,680
Clan Leader Yao,

345
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,880
why do you have to speak in that tone?

346
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,920
If senior Wei had any intention,

347
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,560
I'm afraid we couldn't have made this far, right?

348
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,440
You!

349
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,720
Zizhen is right.

350
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,120
Clan Leader Ouyang.

351
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,760
If I remember it right,

352
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,240
that talking kid is your son, right?

353
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,840
He's so good at talking.

354
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Zizhen.

355
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,200
Come to father!

356
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,120
Now!

357
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,040
Dad,

358
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,160
you said don't disturb you guys there.

359
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,560
Enough.

360
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,600
Haven't you pushed yourself forward far enough?

361
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,640
Come over!

362
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,920
I won't.

363
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,840
You. You...

364
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,760
You disobey me more when you grow up, huh?

365
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,440
I'll go there for you if you don't come over now!

366
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,680
Dad!

367
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,360
Just have some rest there!

368
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,800
Your spiritual power hasn't recovered yet!

369
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,680
Just get inside!

370
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,160
Clan Leader,

371
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,920
we're leaving.

372
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,880
Back to Lotus Cove?

373
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,600
You're barefaced enough to go back there?

374
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,920
Shove off!

375
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,080
Back to Lotus Cove!

376
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,560
Childe,

377
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,760
I'll wait outside.

378
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,680
Sizhui.

379
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,560
Mr. Wen.

380
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,080
Let me keep you company.

381
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,880
Keeping me company?

382
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,200
Right.

383
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,280
Those seniors are going to have

384
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,560
an important meeting there.

385
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,120
I'm not needed anyway.

386
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,680
Let's continue our chatting.

387
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,320
Where did we stop the chat?

388
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,720
Did Childe Wei really put a five-year-old child

389
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,440
in the soil like a turnip?

390
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,840
Just like this.

391
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,920
Let him be.

392
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,570
= Lotus Cove =

393
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,440
That kid was poor.

394
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,960
But

395
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,680
I actually remember when I was little,

396
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,800
Hanguang Jun also

397
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,520
had raised me among a bunch of rabbits.

398
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,280
Really?

399
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,240
And I ate the same as those rabbits.

400
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,720
Therefore

401
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm fond of carrots since I was little.

402
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,720
Clan Leader.

403
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,440
Not now.

404
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,200
I can meet them at another day.

405
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,960
Don't you see what's going on here?

406
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,400
I've said that to them.

407
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,040
But those two girls said

408
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,800
they came just for today's event.

409
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,280
And they also had

410
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,400
brought some rare medical herbs.

411
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,880
They seem to have known several clan leaders were wounded.

412
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,640
Everyone, please suit yourself.

413
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,960
And excuse my temporary absence.

414
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,880
I'll be back soon.

415
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,920
So humble of you, Clan Leader Jiang.

416
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Lan Zhan.

417
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,200
Sit please.

418
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,760
No misbehavior.

419
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,920
Jiang Cheng has been gone for so long.

420
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,600
Why he is still not back?

421
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,880
Come on in.

422
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,600
You shall tell that here and now.

423
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,040
Once again.

424
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,680
Clan Leader Jiang.

425
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,520
What's going...

426
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,400
This is an appalling case.

427
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,200
I didn't dare to be reckless.

428
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,240
So I took a while

429
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,840
to interrogate them.

430
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,840
Everyone, please stay quiet.

431
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,160
Listen to their words.

432
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,960
Which of you two want to talk first?

433
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,040
I...

434
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,920
= Sisi = = Bicao =

435
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,840
I'll talk first.
= Sisi = = Bicao =

436
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,280
= Sisi = = Bicao =

437
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
I'm going to tell

438
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,240
an old incident about eleven years ago.

439
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
My name is Sisi.

440
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,840
I used to be a prostitute.

441
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,080
I was kind of popular for a while.

442
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,750
About dozen years ago,

443
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,240
I wanted to find a rich merchant to marry.

444
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,760
But I didn't expect that merchant's wife

445
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,960
was such a vicious snake.

446
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,880
She hired a group of thugs

447
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,120
to have cut my face with knife.

448
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,360
Then my face

449
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,960
became like this.

450
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,520
With my face ruined

451
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,360
no one would pay a visit to me.

452
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,200
So the old business couldn't last.

453
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,520
And the brothel kicked me out.

454
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,720
I didn't have any other skill.

455
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,960
So I grouped up with those sisters who

456
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,440
got too old.

457
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Their clients didn't ask for much.

458
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
They would take me in whenever there's a deal.

459
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,840
And I coped with that with my face veiled.

460
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
One day,

461
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
a sister of my place

462
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,360
suddenly got a deal.

463
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,560
She ordered many of us.

464
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,480
And we were shipped to a place by wagon.

465
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,960
Ordered so many of us for a time.

466
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,640
He must be a rich client.

467
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,920
He just is!

468
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,720
Payment's been given.

469
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,080
Look at how happy you are.

470
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,080
I got my gold ingot,

471
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,760
but felt something wrong.

472
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,560
Why would they come to us since they're so rich?

473
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
More frankly,

474
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,000
how could it be so convenient to earn that fortune?

475
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,320
- Are we there? - Are we?

476
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,000
I think so.

477
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,960
We're there.

478
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,920
Let's go. Come on.

479
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,560
Move.

480
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,160
Hurry up.

481
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,280
Really ugly enough.

482
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Bring them in.

483
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,320
Let's entertain that old bastard.

484
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,680
Move.

485
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,240
Get in.

486
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,440
Where are we?

487
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,560
What should we do?

488
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,080
- I don't know. - You be the first.

489
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,679
Why are you still standing there?

490
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,800
I think it's no need

491
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,960
to teach you what to do, right?

492
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,080
No.

493
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,720
Father,

494
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,680
I've got you your favorite women.

495
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,520
Many of them.

496
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,000
Are you pleased?

497
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,280
It's Jin Guangyao.

498
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,240
Well... You mean...

499
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,360
The lying man was...

500
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
He was...

501
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,600
Continue.

502
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,960
Then... What else could we do?

503
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,080
That middle-aged man was struggling and yelling.

504
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,160
But his body lacked in strength.

505
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,560
We hadn't even finished the first course.

506
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,680
He... He just seemed dead.

507
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,280
He...

508
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,360
He just died like that?

509
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,480
Exactly.

510
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,480
We had never been in that kind of situation.

511
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,280
All extremely terrified.

512
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,680
We sought to

513
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,840
call that deal off.

514
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,320
However,

515
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,280
the man behind the curtain said...

516
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,240
He said...

517
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,360
- Said... - What?

518
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,440
He said...

519
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,800
Don't stop even if he's dead.

520
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,120
You tell me.

521
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,080
What, what, what...

522
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,040
What kind of thing is that?

523
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,440
After all Jin Guangshan

524
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,000
was his own father.

525
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
If this is true,

526
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,120
it's so...

527
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,320
so...

528
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,680
- Yeah. - Excessive.

529
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,320
We knew we were done for

530
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
when that man died.

531
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,000
Not surprisingly,

532
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,440
when it's done

533
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,440
those about twenty sisters of mine were

534
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,640
all killed.

535
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,120
None survived.

536
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,800
Why did they leave only you alive?

537
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
I don't know.

538
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,920
I implored them that

539
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I wouldn't take the money

540
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,600
and I would never speak that to anyone.

541
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,400
Then they really didn't kill me.

542
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,000
They confined me in a residence

543
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,960
for eleven years.

544
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,560
I just got rescued by someone recently.

545
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,200
So I escaped.

546
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,000
Who rescued you?

547
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
I don't know.

548
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,440
I have never met the savior directly.

549
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,560
But after hearing my story,

550
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,520
he decided to stop this sanctimonious

551
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,880
degenerate from fooling everyone any longer.

552
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,240
Even if Jin Guangyao's power is beyond our imagination now,

553
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,840
what he had done must be exposed.

554
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,440
It's for the justice of those who got killed by him,

555
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,120
and it also will bring peace to my deceased sisters.

556
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,720
Is there any proof

557
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,200
of what you've said?

558
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,440
No.

559
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
She filled his speech with many details.

560
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,640
It can't be a lie.

561
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,360
- Yeah. - I agree.

562
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,000
Miss,

563
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,440
I seem to have seen you somewhere.

564
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,480
You should have...

565
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
You should have seen me.

566
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,960
I accompanied my madam

567
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,760
when our Qin clan of Yueling held the Cultivation Conference.

568
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,800
Qin clan of Yueling. (Different from the instrument "Qin")

569
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,720
Are you

570
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,360
Mrs. Jin's maid?

571
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,720
Yes.

572
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,720
Master Lan is right.

573
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,600
I'm the close maid of Mrs. Jin.

574
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,600
My humble name is Bicao.

575
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,920
What I'm going to say

576
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,400
happened even earlier.

577
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,560
About twelve or thirteen years ago,

578
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,880
I watched my young lady grow up.

579
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,160
Our madam always favored our young lady very much.

580
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,800
But when our lady was going to marry,

581
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,440
madam was always depressed those days,

582
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,920
wearing long face all day.

583
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,880
She'd even break down in tears suddenly in the day

584
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,240
and have nightmares every night.

585
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,320
I thought it was because our lady was going to marry

586
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,040
and she's unwilling to let her go.

587
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,240
So I kept comforting her

588
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,360
that our lady was going to marry

589
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,680
that successful and young Lianfang Zun

590
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,120
who was a gentle

591
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,760
and loyal man.

592
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,240
Our lady would definitely be happy after marrying him.

593
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,360
But our madam got even more upset

594
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,560
having heard that.

595
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,600
A few days later,

596
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,080
the date of wedding was decided.

597
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,720
Our madam fainted out at the sight of the invitation.

598
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,720
After the wedding,

599
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,120
our madam's condition got even worse.

600
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,280
She fell sick from constant depression.

601
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,040
It got worse and worse.

602
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,920
Before her demise,

603
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,600
madam finally couldn't hold it back any longer.

604
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,480
She told me everything.

605
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,240
Jin Guangyao, Lianfang Zun, and Qin Su, our lady,

606
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,520
are not a couple.

607
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,800
They are a pair of siblings.

608
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,320
Our madam was

609
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,840
so unfortunate.

610
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,200
That bastard, old Clan Leader Jin, was inhuman.

611
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,480
He craved for our madam's pretty look

612
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,920
and raped her after he was drunk at a dinner outside.

613
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,120
No way could our madam resist him.

614
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,440
She didn't even dare expose that after.

615
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,800
Jin Guangshan might be unable to remember

616
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,030
who was his daughter.

617
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,840
But how could our madam forget that?

618
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,200
She didn't dare to find Jin Guangshan,

619
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,960
and knew our lady was attached to Jin Guangyao.

620
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,040
She struggled for a long time

621
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,880
and finally went to find Jin Guangyao

622
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,520
before the wedding

623
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,000
for avoiding the tragedy.

624
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,400
She told him the secret

625
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,080
and besought him to call the marriage off.

626
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,400
The tragedy must be avoided.

627
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,800
Nonetheless,

628
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,800
Jin Guangyao knew our lady was

629
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,040
his own younger sister

630
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,920
but still married her.

631
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,280
What a beast.

632
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,720
Outrageous!

633
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
- Yeah! - I can't bear hearing it.

634
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,270
Old Clan Leader Qin

635
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,760
had been following Jin Guangshan so many years.

636
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,440
How could that old bastard lay his hands

637
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,560
on the wife of his subordinate?

638
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,920
This Jin Guangshan

639
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,240
was worse than a beast.

640
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,600
- Agreed. - Right.

641
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,040
Worse than a beast.
