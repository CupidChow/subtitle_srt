1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 43

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,840
But, if he had adopted

4
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,639
the reason of playing the Cleansing Music for Red Blade Master,

5
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,000
in the name of calming him down,

6
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,400
to play it for three months,

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
would the song

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,560
be able to act as a slow poison and catalyze

9
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,880
Red Blade Master's outburst?

10
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,600
If so,

11
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,320
our speculation will be reasonable.

12
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,440
The melody that doesn't belong to the Cleansing Music

13
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
is from

14
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,920
the missing page of the Collection of Turmoil.

15
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,480
What are written on the Collection of Turmoil

16
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,440
are difficult evil music of Dongying (Ancient Chinese address of Japan).

17
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,960
Jin Guangyao didn't have time

18
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
to copy in the Forbidden Chamber,

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,200
but could only tear it apart.

20
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,760
No.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Jin Guangyao can memorize everything he sees.

22
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,880
Tearing the page apart

23
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,960
is not because he couldn't remember,

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
but to wipe out the evidence.

25
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,160
He had to make sure that in case someone knows,

26
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,760
he also can't find out the source.

27
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,040
He did everything

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
with extreme caution.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,720
In your presence,

30
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,320
he played complete Cleansing Music of course.

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,920
Red Blade Master was not a lover of the arts.

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,120
Having heard Clan Leader Lan's playing of Cleansing Music,

33
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
he had a basic impression

34
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,080
of Cleansing Music.

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,880
Therefore, Jin Guangyao

36
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,200
didn't dare to play the evil music directly.

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,160
But with a lot of effort,

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,120
he managed to mingle

39
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,960
two pieces of music

40
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,240
of opposite functions.

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,320
The mingling is not only appropriate,

42
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
but smooth as a whole.

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,480
So he really has a great gift for music.

44
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
I guess,

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,520
he channeled a little spiritual power

46
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,440
in the part of Cleansing Music,

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
but gave a full play in the part of

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,080
Collection of Turmoil.

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,960
After all Red Blade Master was not a master of music.

50
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,560
Naturally he couldn't tell the difference.

51
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,040
One passage of the music

52
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,360
had already been replaced by Jin Guangyao with the fatal evil music.

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,000
Although he often visited Cloud Recesses,

54
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
I never mentioned to him

55
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,080
the Forbidden Chamber in Library Pavilion.

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,480
Clan Leader Lan,

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
with all due respect,

58
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Lianfang Zun

59
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,800
was an undercover in

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
Nevernight of clan Wen.

61
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,480
And a very successful one.

62
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,400
He could even find out Wen Ruohan's hidden chamber

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,760
and sneaked in without anyone noticing him.

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,320
He memorized all the maps and documents

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
and wrote a copy to be sent back to Jinlintai.

66
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,200
As far as he's concerned,

67
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,960
the Forbidden Chamber of Library Pavilion

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
is not a big deal.

69
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,160
I see.

70
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,560
I will find a way to test the remaining pieces of music.

71
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,840
Brother.

72
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
When my big brother died,

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,480
the mobilization meeting has passed.

74
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Childe Wei was no longer alive then.

75
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,040
Through the test,

76
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,960
if it really can disturb one's mind,

77
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,320
but merely a rumor,

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,560
I...

79
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,680
Zewu Jun.

80
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,320
Isn't testing evil music on living people

81
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,800
against the principles of Lan clan?

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
I'll test it on myself.

83
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,240
Brother.

84
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,040
Wangji.

85
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,960
Jin Guangyao

86
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,920
is a totally different person

87
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,720
from my eyes

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
and from yours and others'.

89
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,960
For all these years,

90
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
in my heart,

91
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,360
he's a man of forbearance,

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,160
benevolence and kindness.

93
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
I always firmly believe that

94
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,880
people denounce him due to misunderstandings

95
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
and in my eyes, I can see the real him.

96
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,320
You want me to believe at once that

97
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,520
everything he presented in front of me is fake,

98
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,120
that he schemed to murder his sworn big brother,

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,520
that I'm also a part of his plan

100
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
and I even

101
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,240
helped him.

102
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
Could you allow me to be more discreet

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,840
about my final judgment?

104
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,920
I'll visit uncle.

105
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,640
I'll take Childe Wei back.

106
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,840
You can come later.

107
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,120
Zewu Jun.

108
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,360
How may I help, Childe Wei?

109
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,560
While Lan Zhan is not around

110
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,120
I'd like to consult you about one thing.

111
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Childe Wei, please do say.

112
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,320
Well.

113
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
What's about the

114
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,920
whip scars on Lan Zhan?

115
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
You don't know?

116
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,559
I asked him,

117
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,360
but he's unwilling to tell me.

118
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,400
I have to ask you.

119
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,159
Fine.

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I know him best.

121
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,640
If not necessary,

122
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,040
I'm afraid Wangji won't

123
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,480
mention it for rest of his life.

124
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,080
Let me tell you.

125
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,960
Childe Wei, do you remember

126
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,560
on Qiongqi Road

127
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,760
Ghost General Wen Ning

128
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,120
killed Jin Zixuan by mistake?

129
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,040
Wen Qing then took Wen clan

130
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,720
to Jinlintai and asked for punishment.

131
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,680
Hanguang Jun.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,200
What do you mean by this?

133
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,000
You protected Wei Ying at Nevernight,

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Now you prevent us from searching his den?

135
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,240
What's your real purpose?

136
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,200
You are not qualified

137
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
to talk to me.

138
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,160
You!

139
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,560
Clan Leader Su.

140
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,040
Please don't mind him.

141
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,440
Hanguang Jun is a noble man as we expected.

142
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,040
Since Hanguang Jun doesn't allow us to search here,

143
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,040
then let's leave Demon-subdue Cave be.

144
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,720
We surrounded the whole Burial Mounds,

145
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,960
even Yiling Patriarch is alive by chance,

146
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,240
he's impossible to appear in the Demon-subdue Cave

147
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,960
without noticing.

148
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,520
Right.

149
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,680
By the way,

150
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,680
Hanguang Jun.

151
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,680
Your uncle arrived.

152
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,600
He seems to take you back to Cloud Recesses

153
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,120
At Burial Mounds,

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,840
Wangji made a mess

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
for being the one against all.

156
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,200
Uncle burst into anger

157
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,160
and took him back to Cloud Recesses.

158
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,960
The punishment were 300 times of whips,

159
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,000
repenting in the Cold Pond Cave,

160
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,880
grounded in the back hill for three years.

161
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Beat him!

162
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,200
What's the 52nd of

163
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,640
doctrine of Lan clan?

164
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
Do not make friend with the evils.

165
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,640
The fundamental of Lan clan

166
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,040
should forgotten by you.

167
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,520
How do you have the nerve

168
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,800
to face the forefathers of Lan clan?

169
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I dare ask uncle,

170
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,320
who's right and who's wrong?

171
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,000
Who's black? Who's white?

172
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,880
Perfect!

173
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,880
That's the good student that I taught!

174
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,040
Wangji

175
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,560
You disappointed me so much.

176
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,960
= Eradicate the evil, set up laws, and then goodness is everlasting. =

177
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,040
When Wangji was grounded,

178
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,680
I reached to him

179
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
and persuaded him.

180
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
But he told me,

181
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,040
he took you as his confidant,

182
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,880
so he should trusted your integrity.

183
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,040
Why bother.

184
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,080
Childe Wei.

185
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,600
Do you know what's this place?

186
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,760
I don't.

187
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
It's the place

188
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,800
that my mother lived in Cloud Recesses.

189
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,440
You might find it strange that

190
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,160
as the wife of clan leader,

191
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,240
why didn't she live with her husband in the Frigid Chamber.

192
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,840
Childe Wei, you might know that

193
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,840
my father used to seclude himself for years

194
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,640
not caring about anything.

195
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,840
All things of Lan clan

196
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,360
were managed by my uncle.

197
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I know that.

198
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,640
It is because my mother

199
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,440
that father always secluded himself.

200
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,360
This place is more like a prison

201
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,400
than a living place.

202
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,080
When my father was young,

203
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,600
once on his way back of night hunting

204
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,000
he met my mother outside the Gusu.

205
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,880
It was said it's love at first sight.

206
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,680
A typical teenage romance.

207
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Unfortunately this woman

208
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,000
didn't fall in love with my father

209
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,280
and even killed one of my father's teachers.

210
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Why's that?

211
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,880
Don't know.

212
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,880
But I guess it's about nothing but

213
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,400
right and wrong, love and hate.

214
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
My father was in great agony

215
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,080
after knowing this.

216
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,080
But after much deliberation,

217
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,560
he still secretly took my mother

218
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,120
to Cloud Recesses.

219
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,000
Regardless of the disapproval of the clan,

220
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
he married her quietly.

221
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,400
He also told the clan that

222
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,320
this is the wife he loves for a life time.

223
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
Whoever wants to drive her

224
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,200
must challenge him first.

225
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,400
After their wedding,

226
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,560
father found a house

227
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,480
and locked my mother up.

228
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,920
He found himself another house

229
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,520
and locked himself up.

230
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,360
In the name of seclusion,

231
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,600
but actually repenting.

232
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,200
Childe Wei.

233
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,400
Can you understand

234
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,400
the purpose of my father?

235
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Do you think

236
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,040
he did the right thing?

237
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,520
I don't know.

238
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,880
It was desperate

239
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,400
for my father to do so.

240
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,160
When Wangji and I were born,

241
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
he immediately

242
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,680
sent us to others to look after us.

243
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,560
After we grew older,

244
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,160
he sent us to my uncle for education.

245
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,400
My uncle has a

246
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,800
upright disposition.

247
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,520
In addition to my mother's issue

248
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,120
that destroyed my father's life,

249
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,600
my uncle hates those who misbehave

250
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,160
and practice indecent cultivation more than ever.

251
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,240
He instructed Wangji and I

252
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,160
in an extremely strict way

253
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
scrupulously.

254
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,880
Every time Wangji and I went to visit her,

255
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,400
She never complained about being grounded

256
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,200
and how painful to be unable to leave one place.

257
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,800
She never asked us about our studies.

258
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,840
Although Wangji never spoke about it,

259
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,640
I knew,

260
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,360
every month he was

261
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,120
expecting the day to meet mother.

262
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,480
He did so,

263
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,640
and so did I.

264
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,319
But one day uncle suddenly said,

265
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,160
we didn't need to go there any more.

266
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,720
Mother's gone.

267
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,960
We were too young

268
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
to understand what does "gone" mean.

269
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,280
No matter how others consoled

270
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
and how uncle scolded us,

271
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,000
Wangji still came here every month.

272
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,040
Sitting on the porch,

273
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,800
he waited for someone to open the door.

274
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,200
When we're old enough,

275
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,440
we knew mother would never come back.

276
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,680
No one would open the door for him.

277
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,720
But he still came.

278
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,560
Wangji is stubborn since very young.

279
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,880
So Childe Wei,

280
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,160
back then, Wangji

281
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,560
watched you study crafty tricks.

282
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,720
He didn't say anything but I knew

283
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,960
the pain and confusion in his heart,

284
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,040
exactly the way he felt for our mother.

285
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,400
I persuaded Wangji once.

286
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,160
But in turns it's me now,

287
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,320
I finally know

288
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,720
it's so hard to make a resolution.

289
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,720
For all these years,

290
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,240
I thought I know who he is,

291
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,320
but...

292
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,280
Maybe how one

293
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,920
judges the others' personality

294
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,320
all depends on perspectives.

295
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,560
Lan Zhan.

296
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,840
What?

297
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,280
Thank you.

298
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,240
Surely,

299
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,200
it's too flirtatious to say it out loud.

300
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,120
I mean,

301
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,520
the strike you brother had

302
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,800
is tremendous.

303
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,720
After all,

304
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,040
it's Jin Guangyao.

305
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,600
His sworn brother.

306
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,160
If I were him...

307
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,240
If there's evidence,

308
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,960
he won't tolerate it.

309
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,480
True,

310
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,080
even he has good relationship with Jin Guangyao

311
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,760
he's still your biological brother,

312
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,480
and one of Lan clan of Gusu,

313
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
who has his own principles.

314
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,720
Well,

315
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,440
you didn't tell him?

316
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,920
Tell him what?

317
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,600
On Qiongqi Road,

318
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
the sound of flute?

319
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,320
You know?

320
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,920
I asked Wen Ning,

321
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,960
on Qiongqi Road,

322
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,800
he heard two different sounds of flute.

323
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,120
When that happened

324
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,760
I thought it was my illusion.

325
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,400
Until at Nevernight,

326
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,920
I heard that sound again.

327
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,760
Just one sound.

328
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,040
Only one.

329
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,120
I was too panic

330
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,040
to think that over.

331
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,640
What on earth went wrong?

332
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
After I returned to the world,

333
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,640
I sometimes dream about it.

334
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,520
And I started to believe that

335
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,120
the sound of another flute is not an illusion.

336
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,160
After today,

337
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,400
I grow more confident on this idea.

338
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,480
On Qiongqi Road and at Nevernight,

339
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,440
someone used Collection of Turmoil secretly

340
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,880
to alter the instruction of Chenqing.

341
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
It's Jin Guangyao.

342
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Maybe

343
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,040
or maybe not.

344
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,960
You don't want to know the answer?

345
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,000
When I just resurrected,

346
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,640
I really did.

347
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
But now,

348
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,680
I just want to say

349
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,600
whatever.

350
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,560
Screw it.

351
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,280
Lan Zhan,

352
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,960
actually I feel

353
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,640
whether I know the answer

354
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,320
won't be of much importance for me.

355
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,640
After all, in people's mind,

356
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,000
Yiling Patriarch had done everything bad.

357
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,400
Even now I run out

358
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,640
and yell for my grievance,

359
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,520
no one would trust me.

360
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,800
Sometimes actually,

361
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,560
the world only need an excuse

362
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,800
or a target,

363
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,120
a target everyone hates.

364
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,000
With me,

365
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,360
they can unite together

366
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,760
and think highly of themselves.

367
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,080
Then I figure it out on my own,

368
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,200
even without Jin Guangyao,

369
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
without that sound of flute,

370
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,000
there might be someone else,

371
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,040
something else.

372
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,520
We can't tell.

373
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,880
We can hardly tell.

374
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,840
I was lonely back then,

375
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,840
those few who believed me all dead.

376
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,840
Wen Ning.

377
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,880
Senior sister.

378
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,920
Luckily,

379
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,640
in this world,

380
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,320
somebody still trusts you.

381
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,960
Lan Zhan.

382
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,920
Toast to you.

383
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,960
I'm satisfied for having

384
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,600
one true friend.

385
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,640
For nothing else,

386
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,200
but a clean conscience.

387
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,360
No matter how they slander me,

388
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,680
I have a clean conscience.

389
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,520
Lan Zhan.

390
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,360
I'm sorry

391
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,440
and thank you.

392
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,080
# Warm a pot of vicissitudes to memorize the youth #

393
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,080
# Why sorrow since moon remains the same #

394
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,760
# Why not live at will and go for great adventures #

395
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,560
# Echos a melody from afar #

396
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,400
# Warm a pot of vicissitudes to memorize the youth #

397
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,280
# Why sorrow since moon remains the same #

398
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,080
# Why not live at will and go for great adventures #

399
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,240
# Echos a melody from afar #

400
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,880
What do you mean?

401
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,160
Give it back to second brother.

402
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,000
I've given it to you.

403
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,680
This Pass Jade,

404
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,720
was effective for many years.

405
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,240
Now it lost efficacy,

406
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,320
time to return it to the owner.

407
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,560
Why are you here?

408
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,440
We still don't have information on

409
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,040
Hanguang Jun and Yiling Patriarch.

410
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
I stopped them from searching Cloud Recesses,

411
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,520
many clans are skeptical

412
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,040
with many doubts.

413
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,760
Second bro, if it's convenient for you,

414
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,600
please open your gate for about two hours,

415
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,650
so I can

416
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,840
take some folks to make a show to cope with those clans.

417
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,800
Second brother.

418
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,280
What's wrong?

419
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,800
Nothing.

420
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,720
If you worry about Wangji,

421
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,520
then you don't have to.

422
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,920
The integrity of Hanguang Jun

423
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
was witnessed by all for years.

424
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,520
What he has done must be due to others' deception.

425
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,640
Besides, he didn't do anything irretrievable yet.

426
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,440
All will be fine if he tell the truth then.

427
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,040
I won't give others

428
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,920
an opportunity to gossip.

429
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:17,920
"Then".

430
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,800
When is "then"?

431
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,720
After the purge of Burial Mounds.

432
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,840
Burial Mounds?

433
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,360
Since the fight at Jinlintai that day,

434
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,360
there are abnormalities along the way to Burial Mounds.

435
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,000
The puppets appear again.

436
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,600
and they are all heading towards Burial Mounds.

437
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,480
What are they doing exactly?

438
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,560
Don't know yet.

439
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,040
We assume Wei Wuxian

440
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,360
used some magic circle

441
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,080
or summoned puppets by Stygian Tiger Amulet.

442
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,040
At Jinlintai,

443
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,520
he was stabbed by Jin Ling.

444
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,080
He can still do those things?

445
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,240
Second brother,

446
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,840
back then Wei Wuxian defected Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

447
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,440
He was badly wounded

448
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,200
in the fight with Clan leader Jiang.

449
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,960
Yet he could still manipulate puppets when he went back.

450
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,160
To Yiling Patriarch,

451
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,960
nothing is difficult.

452
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,440
Think too highly of me.

453
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,440
Therefore, there will soon be a

454
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,360
second time siege of Burial Mounds.

455
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,560
I've summoned some other clans,

456
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,000
to Jinlintai to discuss it together.

457
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,280
Second brother,

458
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,680
would you come?

459
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,840
Yes.

460
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,280
Wait outside for a moment.

461
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,320
I will go with you later.

462
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,640
Second brother,

463
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,080
do you want to see big brother?

464
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,000
I'm going to bury big brother,

465
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,080
Would you like to see him off?

466
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,320
I will head to Jinlintai.

467
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
You go to Burial Mounds.

468
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,800
Split up.

469
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,120
Sure.

470
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,200
If he really has some ulterior motive,

471
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,960
I will not tolerate it.

472
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,040
I know.

473
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,760
Lil' Apple,

474
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,400
go, go!

475
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Let's go.

476
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,600
No reaction.

477
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,720
See? They only love you.

478
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,360
They are loyal to the owner.

479
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,320
Don't try to run.

480
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,880
You can never run away from me.

481
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,240
Stay here, bunny.

482
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,880
Right, Lan Zhan.

483
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,240
It's so strange.

484
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,440
I know it will be a dangerous trip,

485
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,320
but I'm not scared at all.

486
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,320
Do you think it's strange or not?

487
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,400
What do you think?

488
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,480
It's getting late, let's go.

489
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,640
Okay.

490
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,040
Little bunny,

491
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,320
We are leaving.

492
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,720
Let's go, Lil' Apple.

493
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,160
Come on, Lil' Apple.

494
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,160
They are loath to let you go.

495
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,560
I never thought Hanguang Jun

496
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
is so popular among little animals.

497
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,960
But I am not.

498
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,440
Why not?

499
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,480
You see,

500
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,440
all the animals regardless their habitat,

501
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,640
they run once they see me.

502
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,480
Am I right? Lil' Apple?

503
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
Talk to me, you don't wanna talk again?

504
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,760
Lil' Apple.

505
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
Wait for me, Hanguang Jun.

506
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,760
Let's go, Lil' Apple.

507
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,880
Wait for me.

508
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,200
Come on, Lil' Apple.

509
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,960
Now, what should I play?

510
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Lan Zhan, I wonder

511
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,960
back then, at Xuanwu cave in Mount Muxi,

512
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,760
what's the name of the song

513
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,720
you sang to me?

514
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,200
Why you ask this?

515
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,080
Just tell me,

516
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,400
what's the name.

517
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,680
I guess I've figured out

518
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,160
how you recognized me.

519
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,120
Tell me, what song it is.

520
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,120
Who's the composer?

521
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,560
Me.

522
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You composed it.

523
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,000
What's the name  then?

524
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,800
What do you think?

525
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,280
Are you asking for my opinion?

526
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,760
I think we can call it...

527
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,480
I'm thirsty, let's find water.

528
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,400
The owner is out.

529
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,320
Let's help ourselves, Hanguang Jun.

530
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,920
Someone's here.

531
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,600
Mianmian,

532
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,400
how many times did I told you,

533
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,640
do not run about when we're out?

534
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,560
You still run so fast.

535
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,720
What if

536
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,240
you ran into Yiling Patriarch who resurrected again,

537
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,400
and his Ghost General,

538
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,960
who might swallow you?

539
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,880
You tell me,

540
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,680
what should your mother and I do?

541
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,240
I'm not afraid.

542
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,040
Mother once said,

543
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,320
those stories are nonsense.

544
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,640
Yiling Patriarch won't bully good people.

545
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,440
Qingyang, you see?

546
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,640
She talks back.

547
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,720
Fine, Mianmian.

548
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,800
Stand straight and listen to dad.

549
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,760
Mianmian.

550
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,320
Who's there, come out!

551
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,280
Nobody.

552
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,800
Come out!

553
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,880
Hanguang Jun?

554
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,400
No matter who it is,

555
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,840
it's someone,

556
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,200
not something.

557
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,120
You are Wei...

558
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,480
Why did this lady know me?

559
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
Did I have trouble with her

560
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,280
or mess her up?

561
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,200
No,

562
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,000
I don't know a girl named Qingyang.

563
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,200
Mainmian!

564
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,720
You are Mainmian!
