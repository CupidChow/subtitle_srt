1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 49

3
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,240
Second brother.

4
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,120
We've been acquaint for many years.

5
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,520
In spite of what I've done,

6
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,200
you should understand

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,640
how I was treating you.

8
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Now I renounce the leader of all cultivation clans.

9
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,240
And the Amulet was given in.

10
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,400
I'll set off to Dongying after this night

11
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,320
without ever coming back.

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,520
For the sake of all above,

13
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,760
please give me another chance.

14
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,080
Clan Leader Jin.

15
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,560
I have made it clear to you

16
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,040
when you planned the Burial Mounds Siege so obstinately

17
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,800
that you should never

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,920
call me second brother

19
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,080
ever again.

20
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,440
Second brother.

21
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,040
What happened at Burial Mounds was a moment of weakness,

22
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,880
a huge mistake.

23
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,360
But

24
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,080
there was no turning back for me.

25
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,120
What do you mean by "no turning back"?

26
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,520
- You... - Brother.

27
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
Don't talk too much with him.

28
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,880
That's right, Zewu Jun.

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,160
Have you forgotten

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,080
what you just said to Clan Leader Jiang?

31
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,520
Let's save our breath.

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,320
Second brother,

33
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,880
everything I said was true.

34
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,680
I received a letter.

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,760
What letter?

36
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,320
A threatening letter.

37
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,840
The letter says

38
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,880
all the things I have done

39
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,240
will be made public in seven days.

40
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,320
I can either apologize and kill myself,

41
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,839
or

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,320
wait for my execution.

43
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,080
That's the reason why you gathered all clans

44
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,840
and tried to lead another Burial Mounds Siege.

45
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,440
Seven days later,

46
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,480
even if your foul deeds were revealed

47
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,640
to the whole world,

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,760
everyone would be too drained out to

49
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,880
hold you accountable after the siege.

50
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,080
Even if that is true,

51
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
you should not have gone the whole way

52
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,240
and settled on murder.

53
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
The way you tried to fix things...

54
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,760
What options do I have?!

55
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,360
Wait until the exposure of my secrets,

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,600
and the rumors soar above the cities?

57
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Wait until I become a joke to all cultivation clans

58
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,800
so I would kneel down to apologize to everyone by

59
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,880
offering my face for their treading

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,360
and beg for their mercy?

61
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,880
Second brother,

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
there is no third ending.

63
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,800
It is either their death

64
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,560
or mine.

65
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,400
Isn't this conundrum all because you...

66
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,440
If you hadn't done all the foul deeds,

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,260
how could anyone have come across

68
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,360
the evidence to hold against you?

69
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
I don't deny the things that I was accused of…

70
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
You cannot deny the truth.

71
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
You...

72
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,600
If not for lack of choice, why would I have done those things?

73
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,680
Second brother,

74
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,560
do you really not believe in me at all?

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,280
Fine. Let me ask you a few questions.

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,640
Tell me the truth one by one.

77
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,880
Brother!

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,400
Wangji, I know what I am doing.

79
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,280
He won't be able to try anything.

80
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,760
First of all,

81
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
your younger sister,

82
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
Qin Su,

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,720
why did you marry her while knowing

84
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
you two were blood siblings?

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
But I really had no choice.

86
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,560
Second brother,

87
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,440
I couldn't refuse to marry her.

88
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
How come you had no choice?!

89
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,720
It was your marriage!

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,200
Not marrying her would have been

91
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
much better than destroying a girl who loved

92
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
and respected you

93
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,840
with all her heart, right?

94
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,400
Second brother,

95
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,920
didn't I love her with all my heart as well?

96
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,320
Yes,

97
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,000
that was indeed my marriage.

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,720
But could I really not have married her

99
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,440
with just my own words?

100
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,920
Your naivety has shocked me.

101
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,840
I have spent so much effort, went through such lengths,

102
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,440
to ask Qin Cangye for his permission to marry his daughter.

103
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,000
As the wedding day approached,

104
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
I finally satisfied both Qin Cangye,

105
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,800
and Jin Guangshan.

106
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,000
If all of a sudden I called off the wedding

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,520
what excuse would I have?

108
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,400
What should I have told the two of them?

109
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,040
Second brother,

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
do you know how I felt

111
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,480
when madam Qin came to me

112
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,280
to secretly reveal the truth

113
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
just as I thought everything was perfect?

114
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,679
It wouldn't have scared me more

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,120
if a streak of lighting

116
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,280
sliced through my skull!

117
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,600
Do you know why she didn't go to Jin Guangshan

118
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,480
and begged me in secrecy instead?

119
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,080
It was because she was raped by Jin Guangshan!

120
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,920
That good father of mine,

121
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,680
he even could do that thing to the wife of his subordinate

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,590
who had followed him for years.

123
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,920
He didn't even remember that he has

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,520
a daughter by blood.

125
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
All these years, she didn't even

126
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,320
have the courage to tell the truth to her husband.

127
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,040
If I all of a sudden broke off the engagement,

128
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,160
causing a falling out between Jin Guangshan and Qin Cangye,

129
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,760
Who do you think would be the one that

130
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,040
be blamed by both sides and finished with tragic end?

131
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
It's probably true...

132
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,240
that you had no choice.

133
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,040
Even if you had to marry her,

134
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,360
you could have given her the cold shoulder.

135
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,320
But why did you make her preg...

136
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,480
With everything happened,

137
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,040
I don't even know whom should I detest.

138
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,800
The father who acted like a beast

139
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,320
or the man I had become, so paranoid and hypersensitive.

140
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,520
So you killed him too,

141
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,600
your father.

142
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,960
Yes,

143
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,320
I killed him.

144
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,520
And in such despicable way.

145
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,640
Yes.

146
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:23,075
= Blossom Pavilion =

147
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,600
I've fetched ladies that you like for you,

148
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,920
many of them.

149
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
Aren't you thrilled?

150
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,400
Yao.

151
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,000
Now you have confessed to

152
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,160
the previous two accounts.

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,600
I have another question for you.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,160
How about Jin Zixuan?

155
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,160
No chicaneries!

156
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,120
You tell me,

157
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
did you single-handedly arrange

158
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,160
the death of Childe Jin?

159
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
Jin Zixuan...

160
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,120
it was true that I didn't run into him by accident.

161
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,720
What did you do?

162
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,080
what the heck did you do?!

163
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,400
Say it!

164
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,760
Yao.

165
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,320
Hurry. Hurry.

166
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,840
Yao,

167
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,080
what are you doing here?

168
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:08,960
What happened?

169
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,320
Nothing. There is nothing.

170
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,640
Yao,

171
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,000
you always avoid eye contact when you are lying.

172
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,440
Spit it out,

173
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,920
what is going on?

174
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,880
Yao.

175
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,960
It's all my fault.

176
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,840
I turned away for a sec, and didn't notice that

177
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
Zixun gathered a crew and went to...

178
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,120
To where?

179
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,200
Where else could they possibly go?

180
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,280
They went to Qiongqi Road to ambush Wei Wuxian.

181
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,240
What?

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,240
Why didn't you stop him?

183
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,800
How would I know?

184
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,360
He just said he is gonna go out.

185
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,440
I... I am not in a position to meddle in his business.

186
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,720
I will go after him.

187
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Why?

188
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,440
Why? Why?

189
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,880
Uncle Jin,

190
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,480
why the hell did you do such thing?

191
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,400
Tell me why did you have to do it?

192
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,560
Why?

193
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
Say something.

194
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,560
Why did you do it?

195
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,920
Why?

196
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,400
Why?

197
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,040
Ling,

198
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,040
could you please tell me some

199
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,080
why?

200
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,200
Tell me,

201
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,800
why I put a smile on my face to everyone,

202
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,270
yet won't necessarily receive

203
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,040
the lowest form of respect in return,

204
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,840
while your father was arrogant and self-important

205
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,040
but people couldn't help but run after him?

206
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,600
Can you tell me why

207
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,880
even though we shared the same father,

208
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,520
your dad could spend the day home at leisure,

209
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,320
with the love of his life

210
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,240
playing with his child,

211
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,680
while I

212
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,840
had to be deployed by my father by blood to do all

213
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,480
the dirty work without even getting the slightest appreciation?

214
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,080
Why is it that even though we were born on the same day,

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,240
Jin Guangshan could host

216
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,000
a grand banquet for one son,

217
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,520
and meanwhile watch with his own eyes

218
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,480
how his subordinate kicked his another son

219
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,840
down the Jinlintai?

220
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,080
He asked his man to kick me down the Jinlintai

221
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,440
from the top stair

222
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,720
to the very last.

223
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
Ling,

224
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,520
now you tell me

225
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
why

226
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,600
did all these things happen to me?

227
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
It is not that I do not wanna be a good man.

228
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,800
To this father of mine,

229
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,800
I once had hopes as well.

230
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,640
In the past, as long as it was his command,

231
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,360
no matter it was to set Childe Wei up,

232
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,360
or to protect Xue Yang,

233
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,560
no matter how foolish it was,

234
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,160
how much hatred I'd get,

235
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,160
I'd obey without hesitation.

236
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,480
Ling,

237
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,680
do you know what it was that made me lose hope completely?

238
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,680
It wasn't that in his mind,

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,880
I was less than nothing to him when compared to Jin Zixuan,

240
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,520
or that he took back Mo Xuanyu,

241
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,920
or that he wouldn't even let me hold you,

242
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,839
or that he tried every possible way to make me a mere figurehead.

243
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,119
It was that...

244
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
That...

245
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,440
One time when he was out on the racket as usual,

246
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
he let the words slip out of his mouth to the hooker next to him.

247
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,800
Do you know why a clan leader like him

248
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,840
who spent money like water

249
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,960
was unwilling to do the smallest favor

250
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,600
and buy my mother's freedom?

251
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,000
Pay for her freedom?

252
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,840
Nah, not gonna happen.

253
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,640
Women are trouble.

254
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,000
Especially those who had read a few books.

255
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,200
I would never be able to get rid of her

256
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,520
if I had paid for her freedom.

257
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,640
Had a grape.

258
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,480
Yum yum.

259
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,080
It is delicious.

260
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,440
Master,

261
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,320
don't you have a son?

262
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,640
A son?

263
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,560
Nah, forget it.

264
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:39,840
Let's drink.

265
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,560
Here. Here.

266
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,720
Second brother,

267
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,840
you see,

268
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,120
as a son,

269
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,600
I'm worth no more than three words to him.

270
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,040
"Nah, forget it."

271
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,120
Even if your father…

272
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
You…

273
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,440
What is the use of

274
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,920
saying all this now?

275
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
It is too late...

276
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Everything is too late now.

277
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,600
There is nothing I can do now.

278
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,520
Seeking for pity after

279
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,920
doing all the bad things...

280
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,040
That...

281
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
that's the kind of person I am.

282
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,880
Jin Ling.

283
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,480
Do not move.

284
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,560
Wei Wuxian,

285
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,960
haven't you confiscated his weapons already?!

286
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,400
I did confiscate all his strings!

287
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,680
Unless Jin Guangyao is powerful enough

288
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
to pull things out of thin air.

289
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,120
He hid it inside his body.

290
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,640
Good for you.

291
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,120
Ling.

292
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,520
There's no need to be so agitated

293
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,920
After all, I watched Ling grow up.

294
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,240
Same as before,

295
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,720
you go your way and I'll go mine.

296
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,480
In no time,

297
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,280
you guys will find Ling

298
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,800
perfectly unharmed.

299
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,320
Jin Guangyao,

300
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,600
if you want a hostage,

301
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,680
let it be me, same deal.

302
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,920
No, it won't be.

303
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,030
Clan Leader Jiang, you're injured.

304
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,120
It's difficult for you to move.

305
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,200
You'll hold me back.

306
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,400
Clan Leader Jin,

307
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,760
didn't you forget to take

308
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,200
something most important with you?

309
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,720
Your loyal subject is still here,

310
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
with me.

311
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,760
Clan Leader, there's no need to mind me!

312
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,280
Much appreciated.

313
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,720
Clan Leader Jin,

314
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,360
you lied again.

315
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,600
Just this once.

316
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
There'll be no next time.

317
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,920
This was what you said last time.

318
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,680
I can no longer tell

319
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,480
which words of yours are true.

320
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
Sizhui.

321
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,400
Senior Wei, Hanguang Jun.

322
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,040
I couldn't stop him.

323
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,640
Stop whom?

324
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,960
Big brother.

325
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,080
Baxia.

326
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,560
Big brother.

327
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,520
No, that's not right. It is Wen Ning.

328
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,960
Wei Wuxian, what is going on?

329
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,680
Why is Wen Ning holding Baxia?

330
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,240
I don't know.

331
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,280
Sizhui, what happened?

332
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,600
I have no clue neither.

333
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,200
He was like this when I saw him outside.

334
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,200
I tried to stop him,

335
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,320
but I couldn't.

336
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,840
What is happening,

337
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,160
why is Wen Ning not listening to me?

338
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:20,760
Could it be...

339
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
He is possessed by blade spirit.

340
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,280
Wei Wuxian. Jin Ling.

341
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,920
Jin Ling.

342
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,080
Jin Ling, are you all right?

343
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,280
It's fine. I am fine.

344
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,720
Clan Leader.

345
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,960
Clan Leader Lan, do you have any herbal medicine?

346
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,160
Please help us.

347
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,240
Our Clan Leader

348
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,000
has always been respectful to you.

349
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,840
Please help our Clan Leader.

350
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,480
Clan Leader.

351
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,320
Clan Leader.

352
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,080
Clan Leader, run!

353
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:26,880
Shut up.

354
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,480
Wen Qionglin.

355
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
Childe.

356
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,160
Wen Ning.

357
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,240
Childe.

358
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,680
I couldn't control it.

359
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,280
You...

360
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
I will try to stop it.

361
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,920
You guys go.

362
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,160
Childe Wei.

363
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,040
Wei Wuxian.

364
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,360
No... No...

365
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,640
Su She,

366
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,520
why did you try to kill me?

367
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,680
No... No...

368
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,320
Help!!

369
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,160
I didn't... No, I didn't...

370
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,240
No, I didn't.

371
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,200
It was you!

372
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,640
Help. Help!!

373
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,600
Help! No, I didn't.

374
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,200
It wasn't me.

375
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,760
Watch out!

376
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,320
Clan Leader.

377
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,520
Minshan.

378
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,120
Minshan.

379
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,760
It hurts... it hurts...

380
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,800
Be gentle, please, Brother Xichen.

381
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,720
Is my leg still attached to my body, Brother Xichen?

382
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,600
It is okay, Huaisang.

383
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
Don't be afraid.

384
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,720
It was just a stab wound.

385
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,680
You didn't break your leg.

386
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,160
A stab wound?

387
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,360
How can I not be afraid if I got stabbed!?

388
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,360
Brother Xichen, help me!

389
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,920
I am dying!

390
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,480
It is not that bad.

391
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,160
Here, take this.

392
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,200
It will help with the pain.

393
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,880
How come I'm so unfortunate?

394
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,920
Caught by that Su Minshan on the way for no reason.

395
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,000
Be gentle, please be gentle.

396
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,840
He had to stab me even when he was running away!

397
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,360
Didn't he know he could've just

398
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,800
pushed me out of the way?

399
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,000
Did he have to use his sword…

400
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,440
It hurts.

401
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
You have some rest.

402
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,840
Here.

403
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,320
Clan Leader Jin,

404
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,520
please do not carry out any meaningless acts.

405
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,040
Otherwise,

406
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,480
I will spare no mercy.

407
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,320
Thank you, Zewu Jun.

408
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,760
Huaisang,

409
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,840
hand me over the bottle of medicine.

410
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,600
Sure.

411
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,280
Huaisang.

412
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,760
Brother Xichen, watch your back!

413
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,280
You!

414
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,680
What happened?

415
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,040
I...

416
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,440
I just saw Third Bro...

417
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,160
No... I mean...

418
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,280
I saw Clan Leader Jin's hand reaching behind

419
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,400
I wasn't sure if he... he is gonna...

420
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,800
Is he gonna...
