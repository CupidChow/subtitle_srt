1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 46

3
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,280
If Jin Guangyao

4
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,400
wanted to gain a firm foothold in Jin clan of Lanling,

5
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,960
he had to have a reliable father-in-law as Qin Cangye

6
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,080
to support him.

7
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,640
He must have been so willing to marry her.

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,560
As for abhorrence,

9
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,560
Jin Guangyao...

10
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,840
He's unparalleled.

11
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
Who can be worse?

12
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,280
- Yeah. - Yeah.

13
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,400
No wonder he told Qin Su in the treasure vault

14
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,600
that Song must die.

15
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,280
Look at that.

16
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,560
Am I right?

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,880
I already heard that his son

18
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,840
wasn't killed by others

19
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,000
but himself.

20
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,960
Clan Leader Yao

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
why you say this?

22
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
We all know

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,680
that the child born from siblings

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,880
are very likely to be retarded.

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,040
When the child is young

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,920
people may not discover it.

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,800
Yet when he grows up

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,200
the retardation

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,920
will reveal itself gradually.

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,880
If they really had a retarded child,

31
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,440
then the others

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,960
might point fingers at him

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
or gossip behind his back.

34
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,320
They might even say

35
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,040
that he could have a retarded child

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,800
because of his blood from a whore,

37
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,560
and rumors similar to that.

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,640
Besides, please consider that

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,000
the one who was accused of murdering Jin Rusong

40
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,760
was exactly who voted against

41
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,680
his promotion as His Excellency.

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,040
How could coincidence like this happen?

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,760
So he decided to go to the whole hog

44
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
that he killed his own son Jin Rusong

45
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,320
and shifted the responsibility to the opponent clan leader.

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,760
Then in the name of revenging for his son

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,760
he wiped out his objector's clan above board.

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,840
Although it's ruthless,

49
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,760
he did kill two birds with one stone.

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,760
Lianfang Zun is so cunning.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
At the Cultivation Conference in Jinlintai

52
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,640
did you meet Qin Su?

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,160
I...

54
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,279
At that night, inside the Fragrance Hall

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,200
Qin Su and Jin Guangyao had a quarrel.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,399
She said that she had met someone

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
and that person told her something

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
and gave her a letter.

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,840
She claimed that person would never lie to her.

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Is that you?

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
Yes.

62
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,640
Why did you decide to leak the secret suddenly

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,760
after keeping it for so many years?

64
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,560
And why you want it known by public now?

65
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,320
Because...

66
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,600
Because I want my lady to know

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,840
what kind of person her husband really is.

68
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,440
At first I didn't want to make it public

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,240
but my lady

70
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,440
killed herself at Jinlintai without any reason.

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,680
I have to reveal

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
the nature of that man who's worse than a beast

73
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,160
and to comfort my madam and my lady.

74
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,160
You don't know that?

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,360
The reason of her suicide is

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,800
that you told her the truth.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
I disagree with you.

78
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,280
Must she keep the secret?

79
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,640
This bracelet is a good one.

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,440
Yet

81
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,400
what's the background of the one

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,160
that send you two here today?

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,760
Why should we focus on this?

84
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,320
We only need to know

85
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,280
that it's somebody

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,280
of justice

87
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,400
and he must be on our side.

88
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,240
- Yeah. - Exactly.

89
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,120
- On our side. - Exactly.

90
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,200
Many skeptical points remain.

91
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,960
What are they?

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,760
So many.

93
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,920
First

94
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,440
why did Sisi survive it

95
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,680
after more than twenty people were killed

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,120
since Jin Guangyao is so cruel?

97
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,920
Now we have the witness

98
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,200
but where is the evidence?

99
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
We will find it out sooner or later since we have known the truth.

100
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
At that time, Jin Guangyao depended on playing up to

101
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,440
Red Blade Master and Zewu Jun  to climb his ladder up.

102
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,680
Or as the son of a whore

103
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,480
how can he achieve his position today?

104
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,840
He dared to kill Red Blade Master.

105
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,040
Now Zewu Jun is in his hands.

106
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,040
I hope nothing bad would happen.

107
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,560
Not only his sworn brother

108
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,600
but also his own brothers were also his targets.

109
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,320
Before Jin Guangshan died

110
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,600
he was busy dealing with other bastards of his father

111
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,640
and afraid that the other would contend with him for the power.

112
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,320
Now it seems

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,280
that Mo Xuanyu is lucky.

114
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
He might have also disappeared

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,520
just like the rest

116
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,160
if he hadn't been kicked out for being crazy.

117
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
The death of Jin Zixuan

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,520
must associate with him.

119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Don't forget

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
he is also involved in Xue Yang's case.

121
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,840
Xue Yang's escape at that time

122
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,800
must be related to Jin Guangyao.

123
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,760
Yeah.

124
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,040
Isn't Stygian Tiger Amulet controlling puppets

125
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,360
made by Xue Yang?

126
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,960
So, now it seems

127
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,400
this Mr. Jin

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,600
killed his father, brothers, son

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
master and fiends.

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,120
So terrible indeed.

131
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,800
As for what happened today,

132
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,880
in my opinion,

133
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,440
Jin Guangyao

134
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
noticed that the other clans

135
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,400
are expanding and becoming stronger

136
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
in these years.

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,440
Sense of danger crept up on his mind.

138
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Because

139
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,640
he's afraid

140
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,880
that he would be threw over

141
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
just as Wen clan of Qishan in the past.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,480
That's why he decided to finish it for good

143
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,920
and scheme to get all of us killed.

144
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,680
Such being the case,

145
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,680
then we should realize what

146
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,880
he fears most.

147
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,800
How about we besieging Jinlintai this time?

148
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Yeah! Besiege Jinlintai!

149
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:31,000
Capture Jin Guangyao alive!

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,360
Just before today

151
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,600
this scary figure

152
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,080
was the well respected Lianfang Zun.

153
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,039
It's unexpected

154
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,080
that he is now the public enemy all of a sudden.

155
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,440
Capture Jin Guangyao alive!

156
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,560
Childe Wei.

157
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,240
Childe Wei. Childe Wei.

158
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,640
Since Jin Guangyao controls the Amulet,

159
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,440
you are  the best one to cope with that.

160
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,520
Right, right.

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,480
As for evil tricks,

162
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,800
no one can be better than you, Yiling Patriarch.

163
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,320
Now Jin Guangyao is gonna meet his doom.

164
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,680
- Yeah. - Yeah.

165
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,120
- It makes sense. - Exactly.

166
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
- Right. - Capture Jin Guangyao alive.

167
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
Burn him and scatter his cremains!

168
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,360
Lan Zhan, what's your opinion?

169
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,280
The one who sent the letter is clear.

170
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,280
Then who wrote it?

171
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,640
He first saved Sisi

172
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
and persuaded her to testify.

173
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,880
And then he bribed Bicao

174
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,800
to tell the truth to Qin Su.

175
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,360
And he chose this timing

176
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
to let them two tell all the secrets of Jin Guangyao

177
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,360
to the public.

178
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,840
Every step is well-considered

179
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
and his shrewdness

180
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,640
is no less than that of Jin Guangyao.

181
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
But I assume

182
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,680
the one is the man in black

183
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,280
who guided us to find Red Blade Master.

184
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,880
No evidence is found yet.

185
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,520
Whether he's friend or not

186
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,800
and what's his intention

187
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,240
can't be judged simply now.

188
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,240
But evidences for Jin Guangyao are enough.

189
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,360
He's doomed.

190
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,680
That is something obvious.

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,280
I'll send a message to my brother

192
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,040
to remind him to be cautious.

193
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:28,960
What's wrong?

194
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,080
Nothing.

195
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,000
It's the ancestral hall of Jiang clan.

196
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,080
Do you want to enter?

197
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,760
No.

198
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,880
Uncle Jiang.

199
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,600
Madam Yu.

200
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,800
Senior sister.

201
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,040
It's me.

202
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm here again to disturb you.

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,040
I used to be

204
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,240
a frequenter here.

205
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,640
Madam Yu often punished me.

206
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,360
I heard a little.

207
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,160
Since it had been spread to Gusu

208
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,400
then it wasn't "a little".

209
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
But after so many years

210
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,800
I've never seen a second woman

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,920
being so irritable as Madam Yu.

212
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,360
She often asked me to kneel down in the ancestral hall

213
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
just for some trifles.

214
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,840
My fault. My fault. My fault.

215
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,280
Won't you tell Jiang Cheng?

216
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,480
I don't know.

217
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,000
At least not yet.

218
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,760
After all

219
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,200
you two are brothers.

220
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,760
Since the misunderstanding between us is so deep,

221
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,760
it's not that easy to be solved.

222
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,880
Besides...

223
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,640
The Stygian Tiger Amulet was created by me.

224
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,040
No mater there is Jin Guangyao or not

225
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,240
the fact can't be changed.

226
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,880
Wei Wuxian.

227
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,040
You still take yourself as one of Jiang clan, huh?

228
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,240
Come and go at anytime you like.

229
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,560
Bring people here when you wish.

230
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,760
Do you remember whose house this is?

231
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
Who's the owner?

232
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,560
I didn't take Hanguang Jun

233
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,920
to any confidential places in Lotus Cove.

234
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,480
I just brought him here to offer some incenses

235
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,000
to uncle Jiang and Madam Yu.

236
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
We're leaving.

237
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,960
You really should kneel down to them.

238
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,160
For coming to their presence to destroy the view

239
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,800
and ruin their quietness.

240
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,280
Clan Leader Jiang,

241
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,160
pay attention to your words.

242
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
I need pay attention to?

243
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
I think someone else need to watch his behaviors.

244
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,000
You have already be kicked out of our family.

245
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,120
How dare you enter and face my parents

246
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,160
and my sister?

247
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
- Jiang Wanyin. - Lan Zhan.

248
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,840
Lan Zhan, let's go.

249
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,960
Go as far as you can.

250
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
I don't want to see

251
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
you awful people again

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
before my dead families.

253
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,520
Jiang Cheng,

254
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,280
scold me as you like,

255
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,880
not the others.

256
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,800
Shall I be nice to him?

257
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,360
Wei Wuxian.

258
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,880
You have such a bad memory.

259
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,560
Then I'll remind you.

260
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,400
It's because you who wanted to be the hero

261
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,960
to save the Second Childe Lan who stands beside you,

262
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,480
the whole Lotus Cove

263
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,480
and my parents died for that.

264
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,640
Isn't it enough?

265
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,320
You saved the Wens.

266
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,760
And my sister died for that.

267
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,320
So great you are!

268
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,960
What's more,

269
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,000
you are so generous

270
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
to bring them two to Lotus Cove,

271
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,680
letting your Ghost General wonder before my door

272
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
and the Second Childe Lan offer incenses.

273
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,320
Aren't you deliberately making

274
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,840
me and them unhappy?

275
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,960
Second Childe Lan,

276
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,360
you also gave me a deep impression.

277
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,280
As one of the famous Jade Twin of Lan

278
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,720
you can ignore the reputation of your clan

279
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,880
to collude with Yiling Patriarch Wei Wuxian.

280
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,800
You really are the honor of your uncle

281
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,520
and brother.

282
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,400
Jiang Wanyin

283
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,040
apologize instantly.

284
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,000
Apologize?

285
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,640
Why should I?

286
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,240
Because I insulted your

287
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,720
great friendship?

288
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,280
Have you finished?

289
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,240
Let's fight then!

290
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,760
Shall I be afraid of you two?

291
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,480
Wei Ying.

292
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,120
Lan Zhan.

293
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,560
Let's go.

294
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,360
OK.

295
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,640
Stop.

296
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,960
Why?

297
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,360
Weren't you tough just now?

298
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,560
Aren't you ready for a fight?

299
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,560
Then have it!

300
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,000
Let him go.

301
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,560
Wei Ying.

302
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Lan Zhan, let's go.

303
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,560
Okay.

304
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,600
Stop.

305
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,680
Piss off.

306
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,560
Who permitted your entrance into Lotus Cove?

307
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
How dare you?

308
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,000
What do you want?

309
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:30,880
Unsheathe it.

310
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,160
I warn you

311
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,680
if you don't want to be burned into ashes again,

312
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
then get your feet out of

313
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
the land of Lotus Cove.

314
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,400
Get out!

315
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,640
Do it.

316
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,520
Unsheathe it.

317
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,560
So what if I unsheathe it?

318
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,240
It unsealed itself?

319
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,800
No, it didn't.

320
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
It's still sealed

321
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
till now.

322
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,240
If you sheathe it

323
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,760
and ask the others to unsheathe it,

324
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,200
no matter who they are

325
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,120
they can't unsheathe it.

326
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,440
Why?

327
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,000
Why can I unsheathe it?

328
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Because the sword

329
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,360
recognizes you as Childe Wei.

330
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,920
What do you mean by that?

331
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,160
How can it do that?

332
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,760
Why me?

333
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,000
Because the golden core running your spiritual power

334
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,840
inside your body

335
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,360
is his.

336
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,800
Sister.

337
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,720
Will he wake up?

338
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,720
He won't.

339
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,560
Come out.

340
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,960
Change the core then.

341
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,520
What nonsense are you twaddling?

342
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm not.

343
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,720
Shut up!

344
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,920
My golden core.

345
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,040
My golden core...

346
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Baoshan Wanderer repaired it for you.

347
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,600
How do you know that?

348
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,880
He even told you that?

349
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,760
No.

350
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,560
Childe Wei never told this

351
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,120
to anyone.

352
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,120
I saw it myself.

353
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,880
You're lying.

354
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,280
You were there?

355
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,600
Impossible!

356
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,160
I was the only one there.

357
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,600
It's impossible that you were following me.

358
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,680
I didn't follow you.

359
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,560
Lair!

360
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,160
Then you can listen to me and tell it yourself.

361
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,750
When ascending the mountain,

362
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,280
you worn a piece of black cloth on your eyes

363
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,160
and held a long branch.

364
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,440
You passed by a tone forest when you topped the mountain

365
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,520
which took you almost one hour to detour.

366
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Then you heard the sound of bell

367
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,800
which disturbed a group of birds.

368
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
You held the branch firmly

369
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,000
as you do to swords.

370
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,720
When the sound of bell died down

371
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,640
the point of one sword was at your heart.

372
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,560
You heard a woman's voice

373
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,400
who forbid your advancing.

374
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,080
Who are you?

375
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,320
Come here for what?

376
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,200
I'm the son of Zangse Wanderer

377
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,160
the disciple of Baoshan Wanderer.

378
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,880
Wei Ying.

379
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,520
I'm here to visit Baoshan Wanderer.

380
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,360
You stopped there

381
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,240
looked very nervous

382
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,040
with a little hidden excitement .

383
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,240
The girl lowered her voice

384
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,760
and asked who you were

385
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,280
and why you came here.

386
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,000
You answered...

387
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,880
Shut up!

388
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,200
You answered

389
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,120
that you're son of Zangse Wanderer,

390
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,120
Wei Ying.

391
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,760
You told her the extermination of your clan

392
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,280
and the chaos in Lotus Cove

393
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,160
and that your golden core was crushed

394
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,320
by Cores Crusher Wen Zhuliu.

395
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,120
The woman asked about your parents

396
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,800
repeatedly.

397
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,800
When you answered the last one

398
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,480
you smelled a fit of fragrance

399
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,840
and fainted out.

400
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,680
How do you know that?

401
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,240
How do you know that?

402
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,600
I've told you

403
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
I was there.

404
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,120
Not only me

405
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,280
so was Childe Wei.

406
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,280
Not only we two

407
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,320
and also my sister Wen Qing...

408
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,840
she was there.

409
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,040
Clan Leader Jiang,

410
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,600
did you really think

411
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,760
that place is where Baoshan Wanderer secludes herself?

412
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,440
It is no more than a deserted mountain in Yiling.

413
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,640
No.

414
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,640
No. No.

415
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,320
Lying.

416
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,040
Why you're lying?

417
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,960
Then why my golden core...

418
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,080
Why my golden core was repaired?

419
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,600
It wasn't repaired at all.

420
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,440
No.

421
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,720
No.

422
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,520
No. No.

423
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,320
Clan Leader Jiang.

424
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,680
You should have guessed it now.

425
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,560
The reason why you though it was repaired

426
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,600
is because of my sister,

427
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,800
the best doctor in Wen clan of Qishan,

428
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,760
Wen Qing.

429
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,160
She took the golden core out of Childe Wei

430
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,840
and put it into your body.

431
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,680
What do you think

432
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,200
why he never used his sword again?

433
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,360
Because he's young and arrogant?

434
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,120
Does he really like being criticized

435
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,040
directly or indirectly

436
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,080
that you are ill-bred?

437
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,920
It's because it's useless to carry the sword.

438
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,120
He lost his golden core

439
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,720
with little spiritual power left.

440
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,640
Once he unsheathes the sword

441
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,840
he can't last for a while.

442
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,480
Your sword.

443
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,280
Wei Wuxian, we've found your Whatever.

444
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
Why not carry the sword today?

445
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,080
I said not in mood.

446
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,080
You shall carry your sword in such public situation next time.

447
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,160
How many times

448
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,280
need you to scrub your sword for a day?

449
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Where is yours?

450
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,160
How long ago did you scrub it?

451
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,960
As for crafty tricks

452
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,600
what do you think

453
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,640
why he would turn to crafty tricks suddenly

454
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,320
and become Yiling Patriarch hated by all?

455
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,320
It's because

456
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,120
he doesn't have the golden core

457
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,680
and can no longer practice swords.

458
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,880
That's the reason.

459
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,280
He had no choice.

460
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,560
Don't be so mad, Jiang Cheng.

461
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,480
Walk away.

462
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,680
What happened? Too drunk

463
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
to manage your spiritual power?

464
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,280
Look at yourself.

465
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,760
Saying something about reviving Jiang clan with me.

466
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,760
Stay there.

467
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,120
Jiang Cheng!

468
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,080
This is your only chance.

469
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,640
Don't be so impulsive next time!

470
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,520
Take this sword

471
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,760
to dining hall or training ground

472
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,200
or anywhere you like.

473
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,320
Find anyone

474
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,960
to ask them to unsheathe the sword.

475
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,080
You can see whether they can do it or not

476
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,720
and whether did I lie or not.

477
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,320
Clan Leader Jiang.

478
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,360
No.

479
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,440
Being so eager to win,

480
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,800
you compete with the others whole life,

481
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,520
but do you know

482
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,280
you were supposed

483
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,880
to beneath him forever?

484
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,120
No.

485
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,840
No.

486
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,800
No. No.

487
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,120
No.

488
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,640
All of you are lying.

489
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,880
Lying!

490
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,080
Second Childe Lan.

491
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,440
Let's leave this place with Childe Wei.

492
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Second Childe Lan.

493
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,440
What?

494
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,960
Please

495
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,680
keep it as a secret now

496
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,960
that I've leaked the fact about the Golden Core.

497
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,960
Because

498
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,800
he warned me

499
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,120
that I should never expose it.

500
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,200
Although he will know it one day

501
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,360
but...

502
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,360
Be assured.

503
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,000
Thank you when you spoke for us in Jinlintai at that time.

504
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,440
I always remembered that.

505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,320
Thank you.

506
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,560
Thank you all the more

507
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,880
for taking care of Yuan

508
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,480
for so many years.

509
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,840
I thought that my families

510
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,360
all died.

511
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
None of them survived.

512
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,400
Unexpectedly

513
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,760
Yuan is alive.

514
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,600
He looks similar to my cousin

515
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,360
when he was in his twenties.

516
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,440
At that day

517
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,480
when the Wens were captured and killed,

518
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,000
I went to Burial Mounds to seek Wei Ying

519
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,680
and discovered Yuan.

520
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,320
He's hiding there for so long

521
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,400
that he had a fever

522
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,080
and was severely ill.

523
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,480
I knew it must be the illness

524
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,560
He can't remember anything from the past.

525
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,760
I had a long conversation with him.

526
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,960
He kept talking about you.

527
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,800
He used to talk about Childe Wei,

528
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,760
but never about me.

529
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,320
Did you tell him

530
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,760
about his birth?

531
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,880
He's happy now.

532
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,920
Knowing too much about the past

533
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,760
and remembering something heavy

534
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,840
would make him less happy than now.

535
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,160
Sooner or later he'll know it.

536
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:00,960
Yeah.

537
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,800
Sooner or later.

538
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,320
Just like Childe Wei and Clan Leader Jiang.

539
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,240
The core change.

540
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,440
Clan Leader Jiang will know it finally.

541
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,840
He can't be kept in the dark for whole life.

542
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,480
Is it painful?

543
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,120
What?

544
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,080
Taking out the core.

545
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,080
Is it painful?

546
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,680
You won't believe me

547
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,560
if I say it's not, right?

548
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,800
I thought Wen Qing might have some method.

549
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,440
Before ascending the mountain

550
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,000
my sister did make many anesthetics

551
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,720
to ease the pain when taking out the golden core.

552
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,280
Yet she discovered

553
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,400
they can't be put in use.

554
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,920
Because when taking the golden core

555
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,280
out of the body,

556
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,840
if the person is in narcosis,

557
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,520
the golden core will be affected,

558
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,040
and it'll be hard to make sure if the core won't dissipate,

559
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,720
and when it'll dissipate.

560
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,680
So...

561
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,040
So

562
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,360
the one who donates the core

563
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,560
has to be awake all the time.

564
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,560
He should be sober enough

565
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,400
to see the golden core which connects to the spiritual vein

566
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,360
be separated from his body

567
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,320
and feel the surging spiritual power

568
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,120
die down,

569
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,960
little by little,

570
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,040
until it is motionless

571
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,560
and nothing can be felt.

572
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,600
Being awake?

573
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,160
Two nights and one day.

574
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,800
Being awake.

575
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,360
At that time

576
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,280
what were the chances?

577
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,560
Fifty percent.

578
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,719
Fifty percent?

579
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,040
After all

580
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,320
no one has ever done

581
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,280
this kind of change of golden core before.

582
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,560
No one will be willing to

583
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,760
give his own golden core to the others.

584
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,000
Because it means

585
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,880
he himself

586
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,920
will become a mediocre

587
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,960
who can never ascend the top.

588
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,159
So

589
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,080
when Childe Wei asked my sister to do that,

590
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,679
at first she disagreed with it.

591
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,800
But he kept asking her

592
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,480
and said that fifty percent was good enough.

593
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,960
At least it's fifty percent.

594
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,560
Even if it failed

595
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,880
and his core was wasted,

596
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,199
he wouldn't regret it.

597
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,960
But Clan Leader Jiang is different

598
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,679
and he's too eager to win

599
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,600
and care too much about his cultivation.

600
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,800
Cultivation is his life.

601
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,360
If Clan Leader Jiang can only

602
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,120
be a mediocre.

603
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,800
Then his whole life will be done.

604
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,840
Why you abandon the sword

605
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
for the others?

606
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
What do you want?

607
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,200
You'll pay for practicing wicked tricks.

608
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,080
There is no exception in the history.

609
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,800
This harms your body

610
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,640
as well as your temperament.

611
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,280
How can the others

612
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,160
know my temperament?

613
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,440
Wei Wuxian.

614
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,520
Lan Zhan.

615
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,040
How did we get out?

616
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,280
We had a fight.

617
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,040
I knew that

618
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,800
Jiang Cheng wouldn't let me go so easily.

619
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,400
Such a badass.

620
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,520
Unreasonable.

621
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,280
Lan Zhan,

622
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,960
you should forget

623
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,360
what he said.

624
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,880
He's like that since childhood.

625
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
When he was mad,

626
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
he would say anything really harsh

627
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,600
ignoring all politeness and etiquette.

628
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,880
If only it can upset the others

629
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,360
he can say anything.

630
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,000
After so many years

631
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,440
he makes little progress on that.

632
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,080
So

633
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,440
don't keep it in your heart.

634
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,240
We are...

635
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,800
Childe,

636
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,200
we are at Lotus Lake.

637
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,560
Sure, I know.

638
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,520
I often played with senior sister here, as a child.

639
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,280
Xian.

640
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,960
Come and have some lotus seeds.

641
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,440
Senior sister.

642
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,680
Childe Wei.

643
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,520
Childe.

644
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,160
Only we three

645
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,360
are closest to each other.

646
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,720
Senior sister,

647
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,920
I'm hungry.

648
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,320
How can you still act like a child?

649
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,480
Childe, what's wrong?

650
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,800
I'm hungry.

651
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,600
Lan Zhan.

652
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,040
Wen Ning.

653
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,760
It's a perfect timing to be here now.

654
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,520
Wei Ying.

655
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,160
What?

656
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,800
Does this lake

657
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,480
belong to someone?

658
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,720
Of course not!

659
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,680
I heard that lakes here all have owners.

660
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,000
Hanguang Jun, you really hear much, don't you?

661
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,960
I don't even know that.

662
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Fine. Fine.  Fine.

663
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,160
Wen Ning.

664
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,560
Let's go.

665
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,280
Only today.

666
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,160
The butterfly letter of Jin clan.

667
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:26,920
What happened?

668
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,960
What did it say?

669
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,480
Jin Guangyao just arrived at Yunmeng.

670
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,680
Why does he come here rather than

671
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,000
staying in Lanling?

672
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,160
My brother didn't return my message.

673
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,640
You worry that Jin Guangyao

674
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,440
would harm him when desperate?

675
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,960
Anyway Jin Guangyao's action

676
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,680
is hard to predict.

677
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,270
=Title deed=

678
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,600
Yunmeng.

679
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,520
Yunping city.

680
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,520
I got it.

681
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,880
Lan Zhan.

682
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,400
I got it.

683
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,560
What?

684
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
I got where he's heading.

685
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,440
Where?

686
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,320
Yunping City.

687
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,800
Yunping City?

688
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,200
Yeah.

689
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,800
Lan Zhan, do you remember that

690
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,040
I once told you

691
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,920
inside hidden chamber in the Fragrance Hall

692
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,040
besides the head of Red Blade Master

693
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
except the Collection of Turmoil

694
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,400
there is a title deed.

695
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,440
That place is inside the Yunping City.

696
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,240
Where is it?

697
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,520
I don't know.

698
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,920
But I remember the address.

699
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,440
Since Jin clan of Lanling is so rich

700
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,960
if this place

701
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,000
is not a place valued by him,

702
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,760
he wouldn't have put Red Blade Master's head

703
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,920
with the title deed.

704
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,280
So I believe

705
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,840
if Jin Guangyao comes to Yunmeng

706
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,720
Yunping City is his destination.

707
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,320
Wen Ning.

708
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,720
Yunping City.

709
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,640
Excuse me,

710
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,600
can I ask

711
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,920
is here Yunping City?

712
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,600
Yes, it is.

713
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,160
Thanks.

714
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,000
Fine.

715
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,880
Lan Zhan, here we are.

716
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,960
Let's have a look in the city first.

717
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,920
Childe.

718
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,880
Pass it to me.

719
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,600
Childe.

720
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,000
Childe.

721
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,960
Don't bully him!

722
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,480
Childe.

723
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,000
Lan Zhan.

724
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,880
You even have kept it til now.

725
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,880
You won't get it.

726
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,720
Childe.

727
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,840
Look, there are many butterflies.

728
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,920
Butterflies.

729
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,360
Butterflies.

730
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,280
So many butterflies.

731
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,240
Butterflies. Over there.
