1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 44

3
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,600
No matter who it is,

4
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,960
it's someone,

5
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
not something.

6
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,400
You are Wei...

7
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,400
Mainmian!

8
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,880
You are Mianmian!

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,720
Why you call my daughter's name?

10
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,360
Mianmian and her little Mianmian.

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,360
Lady Luo.

12
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
Hanguang Jun.

13
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,960
Childe Wei.

14
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Lady Luo.

15
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,360
This time,

16
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,760
I finally know your true name.

17
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
This is my husband.

18
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,120
May I ask, which family and clan do you come from, sir?

19
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,240
My husband isn't a cultivator.

20
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
He used to be a businessman.

21
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,160
But now,

22
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,400
he is willing to accompany me to go night hunting.

23
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400
You just came back from night hunting?

24
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,200
Yeah.

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,680
We were looking for Yiling Patriarch.

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,200
But I heard

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,440
that he would eat children.

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,520
Do you fear or not?

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,200
No, I'm not.

30
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:13,600
I...

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm sorry. Childe Wei.

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,680
She's too young and naive.

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
This is my daughter.

34
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,160
Her name is...

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,120
Mianmian!

36
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,160
Am I right?

37
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,200
She's cute,

38
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,600
just like you when you were at her age.

39
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,240
Childe Wei,

40
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,200
don't you feel guilty when you say this?

41
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Do you really remember what I looked like as a child?

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
Of course.

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,280
Not much difference.

44
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,920
By the way, how old is she?

45
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,560
I'd like to give her some lucky money.

46
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,880
You don't have to!

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Don't be so polite.

48
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,520
It's not my money anyway.

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,040
Here you are.

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,560
Mianmian,

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,480
what should you say to Hanguang Jun and Childe Wei?

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,400
Thank you, Hanguang Jun.

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,520
Mianmian,

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,360
I gave you the money.

55
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,760
Why you didn't say "thank you" to me?

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Lady Luo,

57
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,279
is there anything unusual recently?

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,399
Just hearsay though,

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,400
I heard there are puppets outside the city.

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,280
I spent a whole night to track them last night,

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
but nothing was found.

62
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,840
Don't be afraid.

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,520
Lady Luo,

64
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
protect Mianmian.

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
We can deal with it.

66
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,520
Please be careful.

67
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,920
Farewell.

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,560
Qingyang,

69
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,320
have you

70
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,840
ever been in fatal danger?

71
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,040
And,

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,720
you said Childe Wei saved your life once

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,720
but I have never heard

74
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,440
you mentioned him in front of me.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As for Childe Wei,

76
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,880
he's just a good man.

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
Let's go, Mianmian.

78
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,640
Let's get inside.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,800
Take it slow.

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Wen Ning,

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,000
though you kept silent for years,

82
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,120
your yelling has gotten even scarier.

83
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,800
Sorry, Childe.

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Have I scared you two?

85
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
So astonishing.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,680
This. What's this?

87
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,920
Why you dress in this way?

88
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
Were you robbed by someone?

89
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
And what happened to your face?

90
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,000
I powdered my face with mud and dust on the ground.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
I saw you didn't come out long time after you went in.

92
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,400
So...

93
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,360
You were following us all the time?

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,480
Look at yourself. So messy!

95
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
How's your hands?

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,440
Fine.

97
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,880
Blood.

98
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,400
Not blood.

99
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
It's blood.

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,560
But not human's blood.

101
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,560
Not human's blood?

102
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,040
You fought with something?

103
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,720
Along the way, there are many puppets.

104
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,800
Many puppets along the way?

105
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
You mean

106
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,920
that you've cleared them out

107
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,080
before our arrival?

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,040
Then when did you start following us?

109
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Jinlintai.

110
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
Wen Ning,

111
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,080
I've told you

112
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,360
to hide yourself somewhere

113
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,320
and stay out of all the mess.

114
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,120
But Childe,

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,680
I...

116
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,760
where can I hide?

117
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,400
Let's go,

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,760
together with us.

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,080
Let's travel together.

120
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,000
Move.

121
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,800
Let's go.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,640
Lan Zhan,

123
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,640
do you remember this town?

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,680
Yes.

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,360
Then do you still remember

126
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,240
when we met each other in the town,

127
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,640
you said you were going to night hunting

128
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,360
and I wanted to treat you with a meal?

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,400
Remember that?

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,680
Childe,

131
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,160
local fresh fruits in Yiling.

132
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Have some? Buy one?

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,560
There, there.

134
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,880
Do you need? Spices of high quality.

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
Have a look, here.

136
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,120
Have a look, over here.

137
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,960
Yes.

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,280
Since you seldom come to Yiling

139
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,640
and we meet each other luckily,

140
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
let's have a nostalgic talk.

141
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,360
Let's go, my treat.

142
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,039
Come on.

143
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,600
But it's a little shameful to say

144
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,919
it's you who payed at last.

145
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Yuan. Yuan.

146
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
- Come here. Here. - No.

147
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
No. I don't want to.

148
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
Damn, something happens in Burial Mounts.

149
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,520
Lan Zhan, we have to go now.

150
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,040
But that happened long ago.

151
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,600
If that boy were still alive,

152
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,600
he should be a teenager now.

153
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
Don't waste time on them.

154
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,600
Go up the mountain directly.

155
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Walls were pulled down.

156
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,600
As expected, someone got in here.

157
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,120
Let's go.

158
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Childe Wei,

159
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
this is the my homemade liquor.

160
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,600
Have a taste.

161
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Yuan.

162
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,280
Run slowly and be careful.

163
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,160
Childe, it's my fault.

164
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,840
I'm sorry and thank you.

165
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,920
Childe Wei.

166
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,840
Childe Wei.

167
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
Back then that siege

168
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,880
has ruined all.

169
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Then, let it be so.

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,920
No matter to me

171
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,880
or to Wen Qing and Wen Ning,

172
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,400
this place

173
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,960
represents the hardest time in our life.

174
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,760
No need to return to the old place again.

175
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,880
Wen Ning,

176
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,840
Stop looking, let's go.

177
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,880
Yes, Childe.

178
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,960
I just want to check

179
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,080
if there's anything left?

180
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,640
Be careful!

181
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,440
For defense.

182
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,520
Thank you.

183
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,400
I haven't used the sword for so long a time

184
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,000
and I'm not used to it.

185
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,040
Fine. I'll tell you.

186
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,680
In fact it's because this body of mine

187
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,800
lacks in spiritual power,

188
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,960
even the best sword

189
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,280
can't show its true power in my hand.

190
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,160
Therefore,

191
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,120
Hanguang Jun

192
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,840
please protect this fragile feeble man.

193
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,640
Wait.

194
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,080
Say,

195
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,520
why you just stabbed him

196
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,960
instead of cutting his throw?

197
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,280
They have left for days.

198
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,880
What do they want at all?

199
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,280
Torture or death, just give it to us.

200
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,160
I prefer being eaten by monsters in night hunting

201
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,160
than starving to death in this shit hole.

202
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,440
His intention is clear!

203
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,600
He must want to turn us into his puppets

204
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,480
just like he did in Nevernight,

205
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,360
and use us to combat with our families

206
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
making them hesitate to fight back.

207
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,600
Let enemies fight each other.

208
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,160
Mean bastard Wei,

209
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,000
he has no humanity.

210
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,080
Shut up.

211
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,720
Why shall I shut up?

212
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,920
What do you mean?

213
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
What do I mean?

214
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,280
Are you deaf or stupid?

215
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,319
Can't you understand language?

216
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,200
"Shut up" means

217
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,240
"stopping talking".

218
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,560
How dare you order me to shut up?

219
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,599
What's the use of twaddling here?

220
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,400
Will the rope be broken if you keep talking?

221
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
It only can make noises.

222
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,440
You!

223
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,720
Enough, you two must stop here.

224
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,319
We are trapped here

225
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,599
with many puppets on the mountain which may break in anytime.

226
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,920
You two must bicker at this point?

227
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,160
It's him who started first!

228
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,920
Why?

229
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,480
Why can't I swear while you can?

230
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,800
Jin Ling, who you think you are?

231
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,680
You think Lianfang Zun could become His Excellency,

232
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,840
so will you?

233
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,040
I won't shut up.

234
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,280
What can you do to me?

235
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
You want a fight?

236
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,200
Fine, let's do it.

237
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm just in the sulk now.

238
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,320
You poor bastard without maternal love!

239
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,760
Stop!

240
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,080
Stop! Calm down!

241
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,000
What are you doing? Calm down!

242
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
Stop! It's not time for fighting.

243
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,320
- Calm down! - Stop.

244
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,160
Is it a good timing for fighting?

245
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,560
- Thinking a method. - Stop!

246
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,480
Stop!

247
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,480
Stop!

248
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,160
Jin Ling.

249
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Stop! Stop!

250
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
Look here.

251
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,360
Hanguang Jun. Hanguang Jun.

252
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
Why you are so delighted?

253
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,880
They are on the same side.

254
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,560
Ghost General. Ghost General. Ghost General.

255
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,480
Ghost General.

256
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,200
It turns out as for intimidation

257
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,640
I'm no better than Wen Ning.

258
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,720
Run. Run.

259
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,680
No, there are puppets outside.

260
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,520
Mo...

261
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,400
Senior Wei,

262
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,080
you've come to save us!

263
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,240
It's not you who sent people to catch us, right?

264
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,760
Me?

265
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,280
You know how poor I am.

266
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,400
How can I have such a great sum of money to hire them?

267
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,480
I knew that you are tragically poor long before.

268
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,960
Good boy.

269
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,600
How many people are the enemies?

270
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,360
Is there any ambush around here?

271
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,800
There were several people

272
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,120
all covered with a ghost-mask.

273
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,120
So we couldn't see their faces.

274
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,680
We are bundled up and left alone here

275
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,800
as if they want to leave us here to fate.

276
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:31,880
By the way

277
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
there are many puppets outside there

278
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,240
and yelling all the time.

279
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,400
Well done.

280
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,520
It's really "well done".

281
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,240
Even Sizhui would fight with others.

282
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,960
Just now,

283
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
just now I was seized with an impulse.

284
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,320
Childe Jin.

285
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,280
What are you guys doing here?

286
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,720
Surrounding him like lasagna.

287
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,160
Lan Zhan.

288
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,520
It can't be that you want to stab him again?

289
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,120
- I... - Jingyi.

290
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,360
That's enough.

291
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,320
Can we just get out first?

292
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,520
Yes.

293
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,280
What?

294
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,040
You want to stay here?

295
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,480
There are so many puppets outside.

296
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,120
You ask us to get out...

297
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,880
to die?

298
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,520
Childe.

299
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll disperse them.

300
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,520
At worst we together can fight our way through them.

301
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,840
If you stay here,

302
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,600
what if these puppets come in after we leave?

303
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,400
Judging from the cave's structure,

304
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,200
they can get you like a turtle in a pot.

305
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,240
Let's go.

306
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,760
Lan Zhan, let's go.

307
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,920
Wen Ning, what happened?

308
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm fine.

309
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,640
Jin Ling, come here.

310
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,640
Uncle.

311
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,040
Uncle.

312
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,560
Wen Ning, stay here first.

313
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,440
Dad!

314
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Go, quickly!

315
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,960
Jin Ling, what are you waiting for?

316
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,600
Waiting for death?

317
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,120
Mom!

318
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,760
Uncle!

319
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,400
- Senior brother. - Dad.

320
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,080
Dad, you are here finally!

321
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,040
Wangji.

322
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,320
Come here.

323
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,520
Hanguang Jun,

324
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,280
what happened to you?

325
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,920
You've become someone else.

326
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,960
In the past he was your enemy.

327
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,840
and you two were irreconcilable.

328
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
What method did Yiling Patriarch take

329
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,600
to delude you,

330
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,480
so you stand against us?

331
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
If that's the truth,

332
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,920
you are beneath your good reputation.

333
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,280
Here  you go again.

334
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,160
Sure, we have to.

335
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,680
If you, Yiling Patriarch, hadn't started

336
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,320
to make puppets so blatantly

337
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,280
on your returning to the world,

338
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,040
and kidnapped disciples of various clans,

339
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,840
we wouldn't have come here so quickly

340
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,200
to visit your den.

341
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,840
It was me who saved those disciples.

342
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,480
Why aren't you grateful

343
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,440
but criticize me?

344
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,920
Anyway

345
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,880
your group to repress me

346
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,720
is a little too shabby this time

347
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,000
and two important persons are missing.

348
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,720
May I ask

349
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,440
in such grand occasion

350
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,920
why Zewu Jun and Lianfang Zun are absent?

351
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,520
On the other day, Lianfang Zun

352
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,040
was assassinated by someone unknown

353
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,280
and was badly hurt.

354
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,720
Now Zewu Jun is trying his utmost to save him.

355
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,440
Why do you ask since you already knew it?

356
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,040
Why do you laugh?

357
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,400
Nothing.

358
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,280
I just simply think

359
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,720
that Lianfang Zun is so easily to be hurt.

360
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,180
Dad,

361
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,440
= Clan Leader Ouyang =
Dad,

362
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,480
= Clan Leader Ouyang =

363
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,180
I feel it might really not be done by him.
= Clan Leader Ouyang =

364
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,360
I feel it might really not be done by him.

365
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,560
Last time when we were at Coffin Town

366
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,800
it was him who saved us.

367
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,160
And this time he seems to come to our rescue.

368
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,800
Don't speak nonsense, you silly child.

369
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,480
Do you know what occasion this is?

370
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,120
Do you know what people they are?

371
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,520
Why Nie clan of Qinghe didn't come?

372
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

373
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,240
Emm, brother Wei.

374
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,880
I don't know nothing about this.

375
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,240
I'm here just for making up the number.

376
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,920
Wei Wuxian,

377
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,720
do you remember me?

378
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,040
No.

379
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,240
You don't remember me

380
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,960
but my leg does.

381
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,920
My leg

382
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,800
was disabled by you

383
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,880
that night at Nevernight.

384
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,120
Showing that to you

385
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,340
is to tell you

386
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,440
= Yi Weichun =
is to tell you

387
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,960
= Yi Weichun =

388
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,340
that I am a member of this group
= Yi Weichun =

389
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:09,800
that I am a member of this group

390
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,480
who gather today to siege you.

391
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
Due to your bad karma, retributions come finally.

392
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,720
-Yes. - Yeah!

393
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,640
Wei Wuxian,

394
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,600
I won't ask you whether remember or not.

395
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,080
My parents were killed by you.

396
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
Since you've killed so many people

397
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,400
you must have forgotten them.

398
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,080
But I, Fang Mengcheng, won't!

399
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,080
Nor will I forgive you!

400
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,600
I got your leg disabled?

401
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,840
I killed your parents?

402
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,960
Or massacred your whole family?

403
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,520
Then why do you come here?

404
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,640
I'm here to participate in the fight

405
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,640
is to inform you

406
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
that everyone is willing to kill one

407
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,560
who committed a crime against people's benefit.

408
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,200
No matter what dirty method you take

409
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,040
and no matter how many times you can resurrect,

410
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,600
we'll send you back time again!

411
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,160
Not for else

412
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,680
but for justice only.

413
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,240
- Yeah. - Wei Wuxian must die!

414
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,840
Wei Wuxian must die!  Wei Wuxian must die!

415
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,120
There is still justice in the world!

416
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,800
The evil won't be tolerated!

417
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,400
Not for else,

418
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,080
just to prove that there is still justice in the world!

419
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
The evil won't be tolerated!

420
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,840
My son was cut in the throat by your flunky Wen Ning

421
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,040
during that fight on Qiongqi Road!

422
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:46,200
Wei Wuxian must die! Wei Wuxian must die!

423
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,600
The debt of three thousand lives

424
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,200
can't be evened up even if you died million times.

425
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Three thousand lives?

426
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,680
That night at Nevernight

427
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
truly there were three thousand cultivators present

428
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,120
but their clan leaders were also there

429
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,920
as well as those elite cultivators.

430
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,520
With their presence,

431
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,200
I could really kill all

432
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,400
three thousand people there?

433
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,840
Is it that you think too highly of me

434
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,080
or you think too poorly of them?

435
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,200
Wei Wuxian,

436
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,960
do you think we are having a discussion here?

437
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,960
Can blood debts be bargained?

438
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,200
I'm not bargaining on this.

439
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,920
But I won't accept my charges were added casually

440
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,040
just because of some irresponsible words.

441
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,280
I won't admit

442
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,960
what I didn't do.

443
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,040
It's not you

444
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,520
then who did it?

445
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,880
I don't have evidence to prove it now

446
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,320
as for Qiongqi Road and Nevernight.

447
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,720
But I can tell you

448
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,680
that Red Blade Master wasn't killed by me

449
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,640
and the suicide of Mrs. Jin in Jinlintai

450
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,040
wasn't forced by me.

451
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,480
And those puppets you encountered

452
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,600
along your way up here

453
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,240
weren't manipulated by me.

454
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,880
Yiling Patriarch

455
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,240
I only heard that you are arrogant

456
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,960
but I didn't know you are so modest.

457
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,000
If it were not you,

458
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,200
I can't think up another man

459
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,640
in this world

460
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,560
could manipulate so many puppets

461
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,680
which fazed us like this.

462
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,240
It's actually easy.

463
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,960
Anyone with the Stygian Tiger Amulet

464
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,440
can do that.

465
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,800
Isn't Stygian Tiger Amulet yours?

466
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,200
The question should be

467
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,280
who is the one being so fond of it?

468
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Just like Wen Ning.

469
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,840
Some clan though are so terrified by Ghost General,

470
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,280
and shouting that they would kill him,

471
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,640
yet he was secretly hidden by them for more than ten years.

472
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,760
So strange,

473
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,880
who's the one that told me

474
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,800
Wen Ning had been executed and cremains were scattered?

475
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,400
Stop confusing right and wrong!

476
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,360
Be careful!

477
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,800
Another wave of puppets are coming!

478
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,600
What happened?

479
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,920
I lost my spiritual power.

480
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,240
Dame! Me too.

481
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
We are trapped.

482
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,560
Everyone.

483
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,400
Come here!

484
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
Get inside the Demon-Subdue Place!

485
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,640
There is a big magic circle on the ground inside.

486
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,480
If we mend it up

487
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
it can hold them back for a while.

488
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,680
We can't get inside!

489
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,480
That must be his plan to lure us in!

490
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,200
There must be more dangerous trap

491
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,200
waiting for us!

492
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,040
Staying outside will get you killed.

493
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,760
Getting inside will also get you killed.

494
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,080
Either way is dead end.

495
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,840
But at least getting in will help you stall.

496
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,240
Clan Leader Su,

497
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
why you are in such a hurry to ask everyone to die with you?

498
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
What's your intention?

499
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,200
Will you enter or not?

500
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,360
I'll just get inside myself if you don't.

501
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,000
- Quickly. - Hurry up!

502
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:29,680
Go. Go. Go.

503
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,120
Dad, let's go!

504
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,880
Let's go! If they want to hurt us,

505
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,960
they should have already done it.

506
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Hurry up!

507
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,720
There's really a big magic circle inside.

508
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,400
Clan Leader Su,

509
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,840
still stay here?

510
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,600
Fine. Fine.

511
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Then stay here.

512
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,840
You are such a brave.

513
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,080
Lan Zhan!

514
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,960
Come in!

515
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,800
How can we mend the magic circle?

516
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,560
Uncle.

517
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,560
What do you want?

518
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,800
Nothing.

519
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,360
Since we are here,

520
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,080
let's have a chat.

521
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,760
There is nothing to talk

522
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
between us and you.

523
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,600
Yeah, nothing to talk about.

524
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,280
Is there really nothing to talk about?

525
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,760
I don't believe it.

526
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,400
Aren't you interested in the reason

527
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,120
why you got poisoned?

528
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,120
Poisoned?

529
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,240
Poisoned?

530
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,400
I swear

531
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,960
I'm not that capable

532
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,200
to poison you all

533
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,200
without being discovered.

534
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,440
Yeah.

535
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,800
I think what he said makes sense.

536
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,040
That's it.

537
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,480
I guess that you didn't have time to have a meal together

538
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,560
before coming here to siege me.

539
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,640
Thus

540
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,400
you aren't poisoned by food.

541
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,440
That shouldn't be poison.

542
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,040
I never heard any poison

543
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,719
can dissipate one's spiritual power.

544
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,600
Otherwise this poison

545
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,719
would be pursued with gold by all cultivators in the world

546
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,800
and news about it will spread all over.

547
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,639
Right.

548
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,000
Come. Doctor.

549
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:17,920
Where is the doctor?

550
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,239
Doctor, come here.

551
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,239
Look at me.

552
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,280
The dissipation of power

553
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,960
is perpetual or temporary?

554
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,400
Yeah.

555
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,719
Your golden cores are all safe and sound.

556
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,639
Don't worry.

557
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,880
This is temporary.

558
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,120
That's fine. That's fine.

559
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,120
Temporal?

560
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,040
How long is it?

561
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,480
When can we recover?

562
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,600
I'm afraid it takes at least four hours.

563
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,000
Four hours?

564
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,560
Four hours. What should we do now?

565
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:38,840
Four hours!

566
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,080
How can the newly-mended magic circle defend us

567
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,639
for four hours?

568
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,600
Brother Wei,

569
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,880
what should we do now?

570
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,640
I've told you not to look at me.

571
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,040
Now there are only two groups of people

572
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,160
who still have their spiritual power.

573
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,920
I and Lan Zhan are one group

574
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,880
and the other group are these young men who were taken here

575
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,720
several days ago.

576
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,440
As for the rest

577
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
I don't think it's inappropriate

578
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,840
to describe you as weak and useless.

579
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,880
If I really want to do something to you

580
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,960
can these young men stop me?

581
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,160
Cut off these nonsense,

582
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,400
kill me if you want.

583
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,800
All people here

584
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,280
won't even hum when they meet their death.

585
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,120
-Yeah.- You're right!

586
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,120
Don't wish that we would beg for mercy.

587
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,240
May I ask that

588
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,360
who are you?

589
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,720
- You! - Then what?

590
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,240
It's not poison.

591
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,360
Then what's it?

592
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,480
Then,

593
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,840
people won't lose their spiritual power out of no reason.

594
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,400
So there must be a way or an opportunity.

595
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,920
Can anyone recollect

596
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,560
what did you do before you came here?

597
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,200
Well.

598
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,320
We all drank some water on our way up here.

599
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,480
I can't recall it.

600
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,480
I don't know.

601
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,000
No one drank any water along the way.

602
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,680
Who dares drink the water in the Burial Mounds?

603
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,560
- Yeah. - Who dares?

604
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,360
It may be that we all inhaled the fog in the mountain.

605
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,160
Yeah, this may be right.

606
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,720
Impossible.

607
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,320
The fog is denser on the top of the mountain

608
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,800
but we still got spiritual power

609
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,320
after two days being bundled up here.

610
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,040
Enough.

611
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,560
How can you have a serious discussion with him?

612
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,320
Being guided by your enemy.

613
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,560
Is it interesting?

614
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,760
He...

615
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,200
Continue.

616
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,240
Why you stop?

617
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,000
Clan Leader. Clan Leader.

618
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,960
What happened?

619
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,240
Wei Wuxian, what wicked tricks did you use?

620
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,680
This is not a wicked trick.

621
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,680
This...

622
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,920
Silencing Charm!

623
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,760
Continue.

624
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,840
So strange.

625
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,040
Senior Wei, what's so strange?

626
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,400
Our Clan Leader Su here

627
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,520
is strange since we were outside.

628
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,920
When puppets surrounded us

629
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,160
he appealed to those who lost their spiritual power

630
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,360
to give up resistance

631
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,960
and just die together.

632
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,120
Now he tries to stop me,

633
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,400
from figuring out the situation

634
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
and keeps provoking me.

635
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,320
He's afraid that you may survive this.

636
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
This doesn't make sense.

637
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,960
How can an ally be so?

638
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
It seems you Su clan of Molin

639
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,360
really has a terrible relationship with Lan clan of Gusu.

640
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,160
Indeed.

641
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Su clan of Molin

642
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,760
is a branch from Lan clan of Gusu.

643
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,760
What's the story?

644
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,400
You may not know that, Senior Nie.

645
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,720
Clan Leader Su

646
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,680
built up his own clan

647
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,760
after departing from Lan clan of Gusu.

648
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,120
Their exclusive techniques are similar to those of Lan clan

649
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,360
and they are also good at music.

650
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,840
Even

651
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,760
clan leader's first-class spiritual tool

652
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,880
is modeled after Hanguang Jun's quaint seven-string Qin.

653
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,760
Not "departing from".

654
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,520
They were expelled

655
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,840
for betraying Lan clan.

656
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,360
Not only this

657
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,920
the more funny ones are following.

658
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,240
This Clan Leader Su...

659
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,560
Fine. I know that I should lower my voice.

660
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,240
This Clan Leader Su not only imitates everything from us

661
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,680
and he forbids people discussing

662
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,200
that he is imitating our Hanguang Jun

663
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,200
or he'll become mad instantly.

664
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:16,800
Jingyi.

665
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,480
How come there is such kind of people in this world?

666
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,160
What a Lan clan of Gusu

667
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,760
who takes elegance and integrity as motto!

668
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,240
With so many famed cultivators,

669
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,760
as the top of cultivation world,

670
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,280
you instructed your disciples in this way?

671
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,760
Clan Leader Su

672
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,680
now facing strong enemies

673
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,240
we shouldn't clash with our allies.

674
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,200
- Yeah. - Right.

675
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,760
Allies?

676
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
All of them from Lan clan of Gusu

677
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,600
are in a good term with Wei Wuxian.

678
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,360
How can they be called allies?

679
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,160
Su Minshan!

680
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,280
Even if you aren't a member of Lan clan of Gusu now,

681
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,360
you should be careful of what you say.

682
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,560
Our clan leader has already departed from your clan.

683
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,440
Who are you speaking to him like this?

684
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,200
The position he achieves today

685
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
benefited from the education of Gusu.

686
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:56,840
What?

687
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,320
Can't we mention that when you smear our fame?

688
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,880
There are so many disciples in Lan clan of Gusu.

689
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,720
Can everyone of them build their own clan?

690
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,240
Aren't you being too arrogant?

691
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,400
Arrogant?

692
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,760
Who's the one being arrogant?

693
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,440
Which clan's Demon-Subdue Melody

694
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,520
was played with many faults

695
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,720
while they were unconscious of it?

696
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,280
Neither fog nor food.

697
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,280
Do you forget that

698
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,480
you've done the same one thing

699
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,080
after getting up here?

700
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,560
What's it?

701
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,120
Killing puppets.

702
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,600
Enough.

703
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,000
If there were any difference after killing puppets

704
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,720
we aren't so dumb to ignore it.

705
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,440
It's really related to killing puppets.

706
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,520
Yet the problem is not on the puppets

707
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,240
but people who killed them.

708
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,640
Old Master Lan,

709
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,360
may I ask you a question?

710
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,320
If you have any question,

711
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,960
why not ask him

712
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
but me?

713
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Then I'll ask him.

714
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,880
Lan Zhan,

715
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,600
the Su clan of Molin

716
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
though departed from Lan clan of Gusu,

717
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,880
they imitated the exclusive technique

718
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
from Lan clan of Gusu,

719
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,120
right?

720
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,280
Yeah.

721
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,840
One of the exclusive techniques of Lan clan of Gusu,

722
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,440
Evil Destroyer Music, can exorcise the evil.

723
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,120
Among them, the ancient seven-string Qin is the most profound.

724
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,400
That's why many people of Lan practice Qin.

725
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,400
Su clan of Molin imitate your clan

726
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,760
so many disciples of them practice Qin too.

727
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,560
Is it right?

728
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,800
Yes.

729
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,080
The clan leader of Su clan

730
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,440
though left Lan clan of Gusu with techniques learned

731
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,480
and built his own section.

732
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,120
But due to the fact that his technique in playing Qin

733
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,680
didn't reach the peak of perfection,

734
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,680
so his disciples also play with many mistakes,

735
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,360
right?

736
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,440
Yeah.

737
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,080
That's to say

738
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,000
even if they played a passage wrongly

739
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,440
in the battle music of Su clan of Molin

740
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,360
when killing the puppets in the Burial Mounds,

741
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,440
Lan clan of Gusu won't mind at all.

742
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,800
You'd only think that they learned it poorly

743
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,920
and confused the music score,

744
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,960
rather than figuring that they did it accidentally

745
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,640
or on purpose.

746
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,080
Is it right?

747
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,800
Clan Leader Su,

748
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,520
what are you doing?

749
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,720
Don't forget

750
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,040
that you've lost your spiritual power now.

751
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,160
Will it work if you threaten me in this way?

752
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,680
What are you insinuating

753
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,760
by keeping talking my stuff?

754
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Did I express it so implicitly

755
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,520
so you think I'm insinuating?

756
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,760
Fine,

757
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,520
let me make it clearer.

758
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,680
All people here lost their spiritual power

759
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,640
because of killing puppets.

760
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,440
When they were killing puppets,

761
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,960
this Clan Leader Su

762
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,440
got up the mountain with you

763
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,480
and pretended to play his Qin to drive the evil things.

764
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,600
The fact is that he already changes

765
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,960
a part of the battle music secretly

766
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,560
into another piece of melody

767
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,920
which can deprive people of spiritual power temporarily.

768
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,600
When you were fighting with your lives,

769
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,920
he seemed to be fighting with you

770
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,800
but played tricks behind you.

771
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,680
You are slandering.

772
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,090
There must be many cultivators of Qin

773
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,430
from Lan clan of Gusu present, right?

774
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,320
When you were on your way up here,

775
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,760
did you notice the battle music of Su clan of Molin

776
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,680
was played wrongly?

777
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
Exactly.

778
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,320
Clan Leader Su,

779
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,280
since you knew that many people in Lan clan of Gusu

780
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,440
despise you and your clan,

781
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,720
you thus took advantage of it.

782
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,640
Even if you played it wrongly

783
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,400
only Lan clan of Gusu could notice it

784
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,640
among all clans here.

785
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,680
But people from Lan clan

786
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,760
didn't care to mind you.

787
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,000
So even if they did notice,

788
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,320
they might think

789
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,280
you guys are poor learners.

790
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,920
Is there really such an evil melody

791
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,600
to deprive one of spiritual power temporarily?

792
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,680
Yes, there is.

793
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,480
Since the sound of Qin can subdue the evil,

794
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,960
why can't it summon the evil?

795
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,030
There is a secret Dongying anthology

796
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,160
called Collection of Turmoil

797
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,040
which records techniques killing people unconsciously

798
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,960
through altering the melody.

799
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,400
If you don't believe it,

800
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,520
you're welcome to ask old Master Lan

801
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,560
if there is such book in the Forbidden Chamber

802
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,800
of Cloud Recesses.

803
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,320
Granted that there is,

804
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,440
when I was apprenticing in Lan clan of Gusu,

805
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,040
I was never allowed to enter there.

806
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,240
Who said you have to get in there yourself?

807
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,570
As long as the man behind you

808
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,000
could get in without limitation it'll do.

809
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,320
I suppose your way to alter the music

810
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,040
was taught by him too, right?
