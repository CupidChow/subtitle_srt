1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 48

3
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,120
When

4
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
did Wen Ning tell him?

5
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,040
While you were in a coma.

6
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,320
That's how we left Lotus Cove?

7
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
He's very sorry for that.

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
I've told him time and again

9
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,120
that never speak it out.

10
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,680
Never what?

11
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,720
Wei Wuxian,

12
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
how selfless,

13
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
how great you are.

14
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,480
You've always been doing good deeds

15
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,880
and being wronged but could only keep it to yourself.

16
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
How touching.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,560
Should I get down on my knees

18
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,080
and thank you with tears rolling down?

19
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,200
Uncle,

20
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,400
stop it.

21
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,240
I never desired your thanks.

22
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,000
Of course,

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,080
you did those good deeds for nothing in return

24
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,040
but for your noble personality, right?

25
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,560
Surely distinguished from me.

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,760
No wonder when father was still alive,

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,240
he often said you're the one

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,840
who really understands Jiang's principle,

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,640
and has the demeanor of Jiang clan.

30
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,240
It's enough.

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,240
Enough?

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,360
It's your call?

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Yeah, you know the most.

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
You're better than me in every way.

35
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,920
Gift and cultivation,

36
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,680
intelligence and temperament.

37
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,320
You all know.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,240
I'm not that noble.

39
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,000
Then what am I?

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,600
- Uncle, your wound! - Clan Leader Jiang.

41
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,200
Clan Leader Jiang.

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,600
Discretion.

43
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,160
Clan Leader Jiang, you have to calm down.

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,480
The more you talk, I'm afraid your wound will get worse.

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,080
Why? Wei Wuxian.

46
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,160
Tell me! Why!

47
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,760
Why what?

48
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,040
Jiang clan gave you so much.

49
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,440
I'm his own son.

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,880
I am the successor of Jiang clan!

51
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,480
But for theses years,

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
you always got more than me in everything!

53
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Care during growth,

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,520
and even lives.

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,480
My dad's.

56
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,320
My mom's.

57
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
My sister's

58
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,560
and even Jin Zixuan's.

59
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,200
Because of you,

60
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,200
Jin Ling grew up without parents.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,400
Wei Wuxian.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,480
Who broke the oath first

63
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,080
and betrayed Jiang clan?

64
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,520
You said,

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,520
I would be the clan leader in the future,

66
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,840
and you would be my subordinate.

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,040
You'd assist me for your life time.

68
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
So what there's Jade Twin of Gusu?

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,680
We were the Pride Twin of Yunmeng.

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,520
And you'd never betray Jiang clan.

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,600
Who said that?

72
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
Tell me who said that?

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,840
You've swallowed them all up?

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,520
What did you do for return?

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,120
You went protect those irrelevant

76
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,320
and they were from Wen clan.

77
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,960
How much you owed them that

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,680
you defected with no hesitation?

79
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,720
What you took Jiang clan for?

80
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,360
You've done every good thing.

81
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,490
And it's forced every time you did anything bad, right?

82
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,470
What hardship on earth are you burdened with

83
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,750
that you could never tell?

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,880
Hardship?

85
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,600
You didn't tell me anything.

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,360
Treat me as a little fool.

87
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,760
Uncle.

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,280
Wei Wuxian.

89
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,040
How much you owe Jiang clan?

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,160
Shouldn't I hate you?

91
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,280
Can't I hate you?

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,960
Why?

93
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,200
Why I seems supposed to feel sorry to you now?

94
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,520
Why should I keep feeling all these years

95
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,640
that I'm like a clown?

96
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
What am I then?

97
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,200
I deserve to stay in the shadow

98
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,920
of your glory?

99
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
Shouldn't I hate you?

100
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,360
Hanguang Jun.

101
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,600
My uncle is wounded.

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,440
Let him come!

103
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,760
Am I afraid of Second Lan?

104
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,720
Why?

105
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,720
Why? Wei Wuxian.

106
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,080
Why you didn't tell me?

107
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,920
Because I don't want to see

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,400
you being like this.

109
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,520
You said.

110
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,960
I'd be clan leader in future,

111
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,240
and you'd be my subordinate.

112
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,760
You'd assist me for your life time.

113
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,880
You'd never betray Jiang clan of Yunmeng.

114
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,480
You said it yourself.

115
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm sorry.

116
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,760
I broke my promise.

117
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,800
We've reached this point.

118
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,440
I don't need your sorry now.

119
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,520
I'm not that delicate.

120
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,320
Sorry.

121
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,680
Don't say sorry to me.

122
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,480
My "sorry" is what I pay back to Jiang clan.

123
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
As for this matter,

124
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,800
please don't keep it in your heart.

125
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,640
Forget it.

126
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,760
Though I knew according to your character,

127
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,200
you'll always remember it.

128
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,400
But I have to say,

129
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,680
I really think that

130
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,520
all is past.

131
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,160
All those things

132
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,240
are like from my previous life now.

133
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,840
Let them go please.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,960
And we both should stop lingering on them.

135
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,840
Second brother.

136
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,280
Where am I?

137
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,440
Clan Leader, are you fine?

138
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,200
I'm fine.

139
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,080
Thanks to you just now.

140
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,640
What happened?

141
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,480
A moment of negligence.

142
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,240
Minshan.

143
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,800
Tighten around my wrist!

144
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,680
It's poison.

145
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,080
Doesn't matter.

146
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
A while of adjustment will force it out.

147
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,520
Clan Leader, let me do it.

148
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,480
Clan Leader.

149
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:29,920
Clan Leader.

150
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,960
Big brother.

151
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,560
Big brother.

152
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,440
You...

153
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,840
What on earth do you want?

154
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,120
Zewu Jun.

155
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,560
You're mistaking Clan Leader Jin.

156
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
In my opinion,

157
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,640
what's in there

158
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,360
was not buried by him at all.

159
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,560
Even if he buried something here,

160
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,680
it should have been replaced by something.

161
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,400
Am I right?

162
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,080
Clan Leader Jin.

163
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,880
Wei Wuxian.

164
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,840
Did you set him up?

165
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm saying this with all my modesty,

166
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
but if I were the one who set him up,

167
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,960
I afraid he wouldn't have just

168
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,080
gotten one arm hurt.

169
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,760
Clan Leader Jin,

170
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,880
do you remember the letter

171
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,160
Qin Su gave you at Jinlintai?

172
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,960
It's old madam Qin's maid Bicao who

173
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
told Qin Su what you did before.

174
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,000
But why Bicao suddenly

175
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,560
decided to expose your secrets?

176
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,400
Is there anyone behind her?

177
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,360
Besides,

178
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,440
the girl Sisi, imprisoned by you,

179
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,400
was saved by who?

180
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,800
And who taught them to

181
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,400
go to Yunmeng

182
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,360
and tell your secrets to everyone there?

183
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,800
Since that guy could

184
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,960
have ferreted out all your secret background,

185
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,080
it's also possible that

186
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,080
he arrived here in advance

187
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,440
and replaced the thing you want with some kind of trap

188
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,640
triggered by your digging.

189
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,440
Clan Leader.

190
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,040
The soil seems to have been dug before.

191
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,760
Somebody should have been here from the other side.

192
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,920
I knew it.

193
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Clan Leader Jin.

194
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,640
Have you ever thought

195
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,720
you may be the predator tonight

196
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,520
but there's a hunter behind you?

197
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,080
The one who was always spying on you

198
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
maybe is watching

199
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
your every move

200
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,400
from somewhere right now.

201
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,920
Oh. No. No. No. No.

202
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,319
Probably,

203
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,400
he's not a human.

204
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,839
Wei Wuxian.

205
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,680
Stop bluffing to intimidate us.

206
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,800
Don't waste your energy on quarreling.

207
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,560
When poison is out,

208
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,120
assemble who are still alive and let's go.

209
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,840
Understood.

210
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,760
Clan Leader.

211
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,600
We've got everything settled.

212
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,080
Go treat your wound first.

213
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,200
Got it.

214
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,240
This Su She

215
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,000
is always mean to others,

216
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,720
but he's always deferential to Jin Guangyao only.

217
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,320
Turn back.

218
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,640
It's you!

219
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,280
Hundred Holes!

220
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,280
It's unexpectedly easy to get

221
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,120
what supposed to be hard to find.

222
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,040
Second brother,

223
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,320
what's going on here?

224
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,950
So this is a part of your plan

225
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,520
for the ambush on Qiongqi Road?

226
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,280
You let us call Childe Wei over

227
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,520
just because you knew Jin Zixun would

228
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,240
go to attack him for Hundred Holes curse?

229
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Right?

230
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,720
Zixun.

231
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,800
do you have any personal grudge against Childe Wei?

232
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,800
Second brother.

233
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,480
Why do you ask like that?

234
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
Obviously!

235
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,800
If Jin Zixun hadn't been cast on the evil spell,

236
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,120
none of those mess afterwards would have happened.

237
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,360
One ambush

238
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,800
helped you get rid of Jin Zixuan and Jin Zixun,

239
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,080
two of your peers.

240
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,630
It paved the way for your succession of Jin clan

241
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,520
and becoming His Excellency.

242
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,440
Su She cast the evil spell.

243
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,720
It's pretty easy to know

244
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
who was behind him.

245
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,480
Jin Guangyao.

246
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,520
I didn't do anything against you back then.

247
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,320
We were even not that familiar.

248
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,200
You wanted to kill Jin Zixuan.

249
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,280
Why did you push that on me?

250
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,720
Childe Wei,

251
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,400
you should know it best.

252
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,800
It's impossible that we could live in peace if

253
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,040
there's no feud.

254
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,400
Originally, there's

255
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,440
no feud between everyone in the world.

256
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,840
But somebody would stab the first victim.

257
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,920
Sinister lowlife.

258
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,440
Lowlife?

259
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,480
What right you have to call him lowlife?

260
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,880
All of you

261
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,880
praise yourself as decent clans

262
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
and noble gentries.

263
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,240
You're just counting on

264
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,200
your lucky birth and powerful family.

265
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,560
How could you look down upon us?

266
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,160
Aren't we, peripheral disciples

267
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
also human?

268
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,720
If I could have protected myself,

269
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,880
would I have been threatened by others?

270
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,920
Would I have been swept out of Lan clan

271
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,160
like a pile of leaves?

272
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,120
Yes.

273
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
You!

274
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,320
Betrayers

275
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,080
won't be tolerated by Lan clan.

276
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,120
Hanguang Jun.

277
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm so sick of your

278
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,440
condescending attitude.

279
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,920
Just for that little mistake,

280
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,800
you could never forgive me!

281
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,120
As if I'm inferior to others

282
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
since my birth.

283
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,160
Except Clan Leader Jin,

284
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,440
who else of you ever showed me respect?

285
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
Tell you what.

286
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,920
To supercilious guys like Jin Zixun

287
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,880
I'd show no mercy to any of them.

288
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
I'd kill every last one of them.

289
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,480
What are you laughing at?

290
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,640
Nothing.

291
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,640
I just didn't expect...

292
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,520
What do want to say?

293
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,600
I just didn't expect

294
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,040
you got so many killed

295
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,680
just for...

296
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,960
just for this?

297
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,960
Childe Wei,

298
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,880
are you feeling you're so unfortunate?

299
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,840
Actually.

300
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,160
Not at all.

301
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,200
Not unfortunate?

302
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,480
Yeah.

303
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,440
Childe Wei,

304
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,120
just think about it.

305
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,720
Even if we hadn't cast the spell on Jin Zixun,

306
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,640
I'm afraid Childe Wei would be

307
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,320
attacked for something else sooner or later.

308
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,320
Because you're such kind of person.

309
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,440
Nicely speaking,

310
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,040
you're chivalrous and untamed.

311
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,920
But to be honest,

312
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
you're making enemies everywhere.

313
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,080
Unless those who you offended

314
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
survive their lives with no big trouble,

315
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,440
they're gonna suspect you first

316
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,120
whenever there's bad thing happened!

317
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,480
And you're gonna be

318
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,680
their first revenge target!

319
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,080
You can never

320
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,240
control that!

321
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,200
Even if you hadn't lost your control

322
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,000
that night at Nevernight,

323
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,480
how could you assure

324
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,080
you won't lose control all of your life?

325
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,480
So

326
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,880
your kind of people are doomed to short life.

327
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,320
See?

328
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,160
Don't your feel much better thinking that way?

329
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,800
You are short-lived!

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,360
You son of a whore!

331
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Regardless of any morality for your promotion.

332
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,200
Clan Leader Jiang.

333
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,040
Collect yourself.

334
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,920
I understand how you're feeling.

335
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,280
You're so aggressive now

336
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,400
just because having known the truth.

337
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,000
You reflect on what you did all these years

338
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,680
and your proud ego feels a bit guilty.

339
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,120
So you're anxious to find a culprit for

340
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,280
what happened to Childe Wei.

341
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,680
A culprit who can take all the blame.

342
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,760
Clan Leader Jiang.

343
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,160
If you'd feel much better

344
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,880
when you can dump

345
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,280
all the blame on me,

346
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
please suit yourself.

347
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,720
But you should understand one thing

348
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,480
that you're also responsible for

349
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,160
Childe Wei's situation.

350
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,200
Heavily responsible.

351
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,600
Why are so many people

352
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,720
trying to kill Yiling Patriarch?

353
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,200
Why did even those irrelevant

354
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,480
shout and yell about killing you?

355
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,960
Why was he lopsidedly obnoxious to everyone?

356
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,200
Really because of conformity?

357
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,360
Of course not!

358
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,320
Part of reason

359
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,360
lies in you.

360
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,800
Shut up!

361
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,080
After the Sunshot Campaign,

362
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,080
Jin clan of Lanling, Nie clan of Qinghe, Lan clan of Gusu,

363
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,360
rivaled against each other

364
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,600
which had taken most of the benefit.

365
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,880
But you

366
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,840
had rebuilt Lotus Cove not for long,

367
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,560
with an inconceivably dangerous Wei Wuxian

368
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,560
by your side.

369
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,000
Do you presume that other clans

370
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,800
were glad to see such advantaged

371
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,640
young clan leader?

372
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,320
Therefore,

373
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,160
if you could have ever been nice to

374
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
your senior brother,

375
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,520
to show you two have solid relationship,

376
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,760
or you could have been even a little bit more lenient

377
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,680
to prevent others from sowing discord.

378
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,000
Things wouldn't have turned out this way.

379
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,680
Jin Guangyao,

380
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,600
how vicious you are.

381
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Am I?

382
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,760
Clan Leader Jiang, don't you forget

383
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,600
you were part of the main force

384
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,120
when we're besieging Burial Mounds.

385
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,560
Just a "son of a whore"

386
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,680
made you talk so much.

387
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
It seems "son of a whore"

388
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,560
is Clan Leader Jin's forbidden word.

389
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,080
No wonder you killed Red Blade Master.

390
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,520
Assemble and we leave.

391
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,360
Understood.

392
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,560
Clan Leader Jin!

393
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,800
How did you kill Red Blade Master?

394
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,640
Why don't you satisfy our curiosity?

395
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Xue Yang and you

396
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,080
had spent quite some effort

397
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
turning Red Blade Master into manipulable puppet.

398
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,640
Aren't you afraid?

399
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,240
Afraid of what?

400
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,240
Afraid of him

401
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,760
coming back for you.

402
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,480
Meng Yao.

403
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,840
Meng Yao.

404
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,560
You shall die miserably!

405
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,440
Meng Yao.

406
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
Mean bastard!

407
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:17,120
Yiling Patriarch, you're worthy of your title, aren't you?

408
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,360
Despite of the restoration of half of Aumlet by Xue Yang

409
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,960
and loss of Chenqing,

410
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,280
you still could manipulate them.

411
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,760
Zewu Jun,

412
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,880
you've recovered your spiritual power.

413
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,880
Clan Leader Jin,

414
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,600
hand it over.

415
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,600
It's of not much use in your hands.

416
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,800
Clan Leader Jin,

417
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,520
may I ask you a question?

418
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,680
What did you use to forge this Stygian Tiger Amulet?

419
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,480
Only by that half from Xue Yang,

420
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,720
it shouldn't have been forged.

421
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,680
I just picked it up somewhere.

422
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,720
That's so luck of you, Clan Leader Jin.

423
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,320
One casual walk

424
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,960
could get you Yin Iron desired by all cultivation clans.

425
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,400
Since you have got it,

426
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,640
why ask me?

427
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,760
So from the very beginning,

428
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,200
from that time,

429
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,520
you've been coveting Stygian Tiger Amulet?

430
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,920
I'm afraid even earlier.

431
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,960
The first time you cooperated with Xue Yang

432
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,320
should be at Yet Clean Realm.

433
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,880
Childe Wei,

434
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,600
why are you here?

435
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,720
I wanted to fetch a pot of liquor.

436
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,320
But I got the way wrong.

437
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,520
Childe Meng,

438
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,240
why don't you go to the feast?

439
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,400
I have to keep an eye on Xue Yang.

440
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,080
The Yet Clean Realm

441
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,560
is like a steel bucket.

442
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,160
I suppose Xue Yang could never get away.

443
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,800
Thanks for you efforts then.

444
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,160
This way.

445
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,520
Kind of.

446
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,760
You admit it quite soon now.

447
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,600
Under such circumstances,

448
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,800
what's the difference

449
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,240
if I deny this one?

450
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,160
You cooperated with Xue Yang

451
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,520
just for forging Stygian Tiger Amulet?

452
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,280
Xue Yang hid one shard of Yin Iron.

453
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,360
He wanted to save Xiao Xingchen.

454
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,000
So he joined hands with me,

455
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,160
and tried to forge the Amulet.

456
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,280
But even by two of us,

457
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,200
we could only forge the Amulet of half power.

458
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,000
Childe Wei.

459
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,400
I have one thing that troubles me for a long time.

460
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,080
I always want to ask you.

461
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,240
What is it?

462
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,680
At that time, I also assumed you were

463
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,960
the one who took Yin Iron from Xue Yang

464
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,920
and made them into the Amulet.

465
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,760
But in fact, that was not true.

466
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,480
You're trying to ask me

467
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
how I got the Yin Iron, right?

468
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,880
Exactly.

469
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,880
I knew it from Xue Yang.

470
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,200
Everyone believes

471
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,120
that there's only four shards of Yin Iron.

472
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,440
Not true.

473
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,360
I see now.

474
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,080
All the energy of the four directions

475
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,160
belongs to Xuanwu.

476
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,040
This is what that means.

477
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,920
You've done so many evil things,

478
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
striven so hard

479
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,600
just for Stygian Tiger Amulet.

480
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,360
That's part of reason.

481
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,280
Why don't ask me to explain?

482
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,640
Before this,

483
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,280
I wasn't totally unaware of what you've done,

484
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,760
but I always believe that you did everything

485
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,040
out of an unspeakable reason.

486
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,880
But now,

487
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,080
you've done it too excessively.

488
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,760
I don't know if I should believe you anymore.

489
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Second brother,

490
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,200
I was wrong.

491
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,240
Hey...

492
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,800
Clan Leader Jin,

493
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,120
can't we stop talking?

494
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,720
Just fight?

495
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,240
Can we just start killing each other?

496
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,640
Second brother.

497
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,840
We've been acquaint for many years.

498
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,080
In spite of what I've done,

499
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,760
you should understand

500
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,080
how I was treating you.

501
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,080
Now I renounce the leader of all cultivation clans.

502
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,040
And the Amulet was given in.

503
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,360
I'll set off to Dongying after this night

504
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,240
without ever coming back.

505
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,560
For the sake of all above,

506
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,560
please give me another chance.
