1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 41

3
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,680
Long time no see. Red Blade Master.

4
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,160
Empathy?

5
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,520
Call the cultivator who stayed latest last time.

6
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,280
What's his name?

7
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,320
Clan Leader,

8
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,640
his name is Meng Yao.

9
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,360
People like him

10
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
isn't qualified to be my servant.

11
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,800
- Yeah. - Right.

12
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,120
What a joke he is.

13
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,360
Clan Leader Nie.

14
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,720
Meng Yao.

15
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Yes.

16
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,760
Why not go rest in the cave like others?

17
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,720
Cl...Clan Leader.

18
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,240
Come with me.

19
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,840
You mean Meng Yao?

20
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Yeah, him.

21
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,160
Impossible!

22
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,800
He is the son of Jin Guangshan?

23
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,520
Can the son of Jin Guangshan

24
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
mess around with us?

25
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,840
I think so.

26
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,800
Why doesn't he go find his dad?

27
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,680
Just a move of finger,

28
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,200
he won't be so toilsome like now.

29
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,320
He brought a memento

30
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,480
and trekked all the way from Yunmeng to Lanling

31
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,680
just for his dad's recognition.

32
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,120
Then what?

33
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,920
Then

34
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,960
he was kicked out of Jinlintai.

35
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,920
I must say

36
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,360
Jin Guangsan has been playing around for so long.

37
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,240
There must be a dozen of bastards.

38
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,880
Did any of them ever get his recognition before?

39
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,320
Therefore,

40
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,880
the unlucky result

41
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
is caused by himself.

42
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,560
People

43
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,920
shouldn't desire what is not for them.

44
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,520
Who can you blame when you mess up in the end?

45
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,440
No one.

46
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,480
You deserve it.

47
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Exactly.

48
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,080
Wasn't he stupid?

49
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,040
With a Jin Zixuan,

50
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,280
Jin Guangshan will never pay any attention to other sons.

51
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,400
Moreover,

52
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,840
it's a son from a whore that can sleep with anyone.

53
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,040
Who knows if Jin Guangshan is his real dad?

54
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
As I see it,

55
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,560
Jin Guangshan must be asking the same question to himself.

56
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,800
So he didn't recognize him.

57
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,080
No way could he recognize him.

58
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,000
I think

59
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,320
he'd totally forgotten

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,080
the relationship with that woman.

61
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,960
At the thought of a son of Jin Guangshan

62
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,560
fetching water for us and resigning to fate.

63
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,080
I'm kinda excited.

64
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,560
Resigning to fate?

65
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,960
He tries hard for attention!

66
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,640
Don't see how hard he's been working?

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,960
Running here and there attending to everything all day.

68
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
How attentive!

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,680
All in his mind is coming to the fore.

70
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,400
Then his dad would recognize him.

71
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,240
- Clan Leader. - Clan Leader.

72
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,320
Drinking the water that came from his hard work

73
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,960
but speaking such nasty remarks about him,

74
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,200
you joined my clan

75
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
for eliminating the evil for the people

76
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,880
or backbiting others?

77
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,360
Meng Yao!

78
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,760
Clan Leader.

79
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,080
A decent man

80
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,920
shall stand straight and be just.

81
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,960
The more these people backbite you,

82
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,080
the more perfectly you should do

83
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,760
to leave them

84
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,560
nothing to say.

85
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,960
From now on,

86
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,040
you

87
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,560
are my vice general.

88
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,240
Thank you, Clan Leader!

89
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,720
Meng Yao!

90
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,960
Not me.

91
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,880
Not me.

92
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,400
It's not my fault.

93
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,600
It's not my fault.

94
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Clan Leader.

95
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Please hold on for a second

96
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
and let me explain.

97
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,000
What do you want to explain?

98
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,240
Just a moment earlier,

99
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,840
I saw him accidentally release Xue Yang,

100
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,160
so I immediately argued with him.

101
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,840
However,

102
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,800
however he wanted to kill me.

103
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,600
He even humiliated my...

104
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,000
my mother that...

105
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,960
That's why I killed him.

106
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,880
You're lying.

107
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,680
If you really couldn't stand it and

108
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
was seized by an impulse,

109
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,200
why your look was like that when you're killing him?

110
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Why you deliberately picked up a Wen clan's sword?

111
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,840
Why did you pretend that it was done by Xue Yang?

112
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,960
You must have been plotting

113
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,400
this murder for a long time!

114
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,120
You just told the other day.

115
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,360
At that day...

116
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:21,960
Captain.

117
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,920
Who were you talking to?

118
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,960
Nobody.

119
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,920
What were you doing then?

120
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,040
I was just guarding the prisoner

121
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,320
according to Clan Leader's order.

122
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,800
You're lying!

123
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,560
I just saw that.

124
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,360
You were talking.

125
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,240
Tell me honestly.

126
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,520
What's your ulterior motive?

127
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,360
You've misunderstood me, Captain.

128
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,480
He's too drunk.

129
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,880
Get him back to his room.

130
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
Son of a whore.

131
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,680
Huaisang.

132
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,360
I go and check Xue Yang in the dungeon.

133
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,840
Meng Yao! Meng...

134
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,600
Tell me, Meng Yao.

135
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,720
The first time we met,

136
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,000
did you pretend to be delicate and poor?

137
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,440
So that I might lend a hand to help you?

138
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
If I hadn't stood up for you

139
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,720
would you have killed them all

140
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,400
like today?

141
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,440
I...

142
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,560
Don't lie to me!

143
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,320
I don't regret

144
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,840
meeting you in my life, Red Blade Master.

145
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,680
Since you saved me today,

146
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,920
I won't harm you.

147
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Go away.

148
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,920
No matter to Jin clan or other places.

149
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,440
And

150
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,240
never come back.

151
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,400
Your Excellency.

152
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,760
Clan Leader Nie.

153
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,320
Long time no see.

154
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,840
It's you.

155
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,280
It's you.

156
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,600
I could never expect

157
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
that you can look so miserable today.

158
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,680
Get lost!

159
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,760
You think you still are King of Hejian?

160
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
Look closely.

161
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,720
Here is the Scorching Sun Palace.

162
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,320
What Scorching Sun Palace!

163
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,400
Just a den of Wen!

164
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,840
You!

165
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,520
Jackal!

166
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,800
Kill me too if you can!

167
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
Pleased.

168
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,160
Anyone else feels like saying that word?

169
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,080
Jackal.

170
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,640
Clan Leader Nie.

171
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,000
Please have a look at this.

172
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,600
Clan Leader Nie,

173
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,640
I've held Baxia many times before.

174
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,680
Isn't it a little too late

175
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,920
for you to be angry now?

176
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,400
Put your hand away.

177
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,680
Your blade

178
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,400
can barely be deemed as first-class spiritual tool.

179
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,280
Nevertheless,

180
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,720
compared to your father, old Clan Leader Nie's blade,

181
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,960
it's a little bit inferior.

182
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
Why not have a guess?

183
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,120
How many times will Clan Leader Wen spank it

184
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,720
til it's broken?

185
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,400
I remember that when old Clan Leader received his broken blade,

186
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,560
he died

187
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,640
of wrath.

188
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,760
Wei Ying.

189
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,240
Brother Mingjue.

190
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,520
Xichen.

191
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,120
You're finally awake.

192
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,480
Hand me the blade.

193
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,880
Clan Leader Nie.

194
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,240
Brother Mingjue.

195
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,560
Clan Leader Nie,

196
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
you still got wounds on you.

197
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Xichen, it's none of your business.

198
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,240
When you were killing the cultivators of Nie clan...

199
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,880
I had no choice that moment.

200
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,960
You had no choice?

201
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,840
Whether do it  or not was up to you,

202
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,840
and so was to kill them or not?

203
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,360
Was it really up to me?

204
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,440
Clan Leader Nie,

205
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,400
if we could have exchanged our situation...

206
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,440
We couldn't!

207
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,720
Brother Mingjue.

208
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,040
Xichen. Get out of the way!

209
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
Calm down!

210
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,200
Zewu Jun.

211
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Brother Mingjue.

212
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,480
Back then, after he was kicked out of Qinghe,

213
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
I was wondering why I couldn't know his whereabouts.

214
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,890
It turns out that he became the Wen's underling and

215
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,560
had been helping the tyrant at Nevernight!

216
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Brother Mingjue.

217
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,640
Do you know who gave you the Wen clan's

218
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,720
map of tactical formation at that time?

219
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,839
Do you know who

220
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,240
was our source of info all the while?

221
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,079
Him?

222
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,400
Clan Leader Nie.

223
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,560
What I just did here

224
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,200
was to gain his trust

225
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,680
and to cover my identity.

226
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,400
But I did hurt you

227
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,680
and said something awful.

228
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,440
I knew the case of old Clan Leader Nie is your grief

229
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,280
but I purposely brought it up.

230
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,600
You shouldn't kneel to me

231
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,720
but to those who were killed by you.

232
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,240
Wen Ruohan is so atrocious

233
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,960
that he'd be incensed at any umbrage.

234
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
If I wanted to be his trusted hand,

235
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,160
when he was insulted,

236
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,680
I couldn't stay silent.

237
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,760
Fair enough.

238
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,080
It seems you've been quite used to barking for him.

239
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,120
Brother Mingjue.

240
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,560
While working in Qishan,

241
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,000
Yao couldn't help doing something not desirable.

242
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,440
But I believe,

243
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
when he was doing such things,

244
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,080
deep in his heart he must have been...

245
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,640
If there is disloyalty between us, we'll be universally condemned.

246
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,480
Both God and people will be furious with us.

247
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,240
Alright.

248
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,400
Having heard second brother's playing,

249
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,400
I want to smash my Qin right away.

250
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,360
Yao, your playing is also quite good

251
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,480
outside Gusu.

252
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
If you could be instructed by some famous musician,

253
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,760
you'll make great progress very soon.

254
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,200
There's a famous one right before me.

255
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,520
But I dare not bother him.

256
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,800
What would you like to teach me then?

257
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,720
How about Cleansing Music?

258
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,280
Great.

259
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,200
Big brother! Big brother!

260
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,040
Wei Ying.

261
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,760
Yao.

262
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
Big brother's temperament is getting worse.

263
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,040
Don't ever displease him again.

264
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,480
He's been subject to the harassment of his blade lately.

265
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,160
If you hadn't been playing Cleansing Music for him everyday,

266
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm afraid he'd be...

267
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,880
Jin Guangyao!

268
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,880
Big brother, what's wrong?

269
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,120
Don't move.

270
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,480
Come out.

271
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,640
Second bro,

272
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,640
please check the list of guests

273
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,160
of the Floral Banquet for me.

274
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,360
I need to talk some private affairs with big brother.

275
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,040
I'll explain it to you later.

276
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Big brother.

277
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
Why act like this?

278
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,560
We can talk nicely, can't we?

279
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,680
Where is Xue Yang?

280
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,480
He's been shut up in the dungeon,

281
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,000
for life time.

282
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,280
What did I tell you in Yet Clean Realm at that time?

283
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,480
I want him to pay his killing debts.

284
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,000
You now give him life imprisonment.

285
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,760
As long as he's punished,

286
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,080
and can't recommit crimes,

287
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,590
I can't see the difference

288
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,280
between life imprisonment and death sentence.

289
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,080
Tell me.

290
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,520
When we were at Yet Clean Realm,

291
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
who on earth released Xue Yang?

292
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,520
It was my captain,

293
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,640
or you?

294
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
It wasn't me.

295
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,520
Why should I let him go?

296
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,080
But the past is in the past,

297
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,120
Chang Ping had withdrawn his confession.

298
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,480
No certain evidence can prove

299
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,680
that Xue Yang had massacred 50 people of Chang clan.

300
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,080
And my father insists on keeping him alive.

301
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,920
Why?

302
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,720
Don't you know he's got a shard of Yin Iron on him?

303
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,480
You're trying to reclaim him now.

304
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,480
I can clearly see what you have in mind.

305
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,720
Big brother,

306
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,320
this is really my father's order.

307
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,920
I couldn't deny.

308
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,520
If you want me to execute Xue Yang now,

309
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,520
in which way can I report this to him?

310
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,320
Meng Yao.

311
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,160
Don't try to get clever with me.

312
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,120
I am already used to

313
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,520
how you operate to get your way.

314
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,040
How I operate?

315
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,000
What are you talking about?

316
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,320
Big brother,

317
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,200
you always scold me for indecent scheming.

318
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,520
You always say that you are just and straight,

319
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,280
being fearless when face everything.

320
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,480
A decent man

321
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,520
shouldn't resort to devious stratagems.

322
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,400
Well.

323
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,480
You're of noble birth

324
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,520
and have profound cultivation.

325
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,440
What about me?

326
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,360
How can I be the same?

327
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,600
First, I don't have the foundation of cultivation.

328
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
No one has ever taught me that since I was a child.

329
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,600
Second, I don't have any background.

330
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,880
Do you think that my position is very solid

331
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
in Jin clan of Lanling?

332
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,280
You thought that I could be promoted

333
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,760
all the way up after Jin Zixuan's death?

334
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,640
Jin Guangshan would rather

335
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,160
recognize another bastard

336
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,360
than letting me to succeed him.

337
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,960
You told me to be fearless when face everything.

338
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,120
Yet I can do nothing but fear everything

339
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,640
and even the people!

340
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,360
After all

341
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,080
the reason why you keep Xue Yang alive

342
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,640
is to stable your position

343
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,520
in Jin clan of Lanling!

344
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,880
Sure it is.

345
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,640
But big brother,

346
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,120
I always want to ask you a question.

347
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,880
Lives taken by you

348
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,000
can only be more

349
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,360
than those I took.

350
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,040
I just killed a few cultivators

351
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,400
under that certain situation.

352
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,240
Why do you stick to it

353
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,600
until now?

354
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,240
Well.

355
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,400
I can tell you.

356
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,280
So many had died under my blade.

357
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,560
Neither would I kill anyone just for my own satisfaction.

358
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,680
Nor would I kill for promotion.

359
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,200
Big brother.

360
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,600
I see what you mean now.

361
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,560
Are you trying to say

362
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,000
you kill all of them for justice?

363
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
Please allow me to ask this.

364
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,720
How can you judge whether

365
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,040
one should be killed as a punishment?

366
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,480
Are your standards necessarily just?

367
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,720
If I can kill one for saving a hundred,

368
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,920
that's "merits outweigh shortcomings"

369
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,960
or "just punishment"?

370
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,640
To achieve something great,

371
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,160
there must be some sacrifice.

372
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,800
Why don't you sacrifice yourself then?

373
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,600
You're more precious than them?

374
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,760
You're different from them?

375
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,960
Yes!

376
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,840
Of course

377
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,360
I'm different.

378
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
Bastard!

379
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,240
I can't expect more

380
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,480
from a son of whore, can I?

381
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,680
Big brother,

382
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,280
it's time for Cleansing Music.

383
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,160
Big brother,

384
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,600
ever since second brother taught me Cleansing Music,

385
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,080
Every time you needed to settle your mind,

386
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,520
it's always me who played the music.

387
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,920
We never bothered second brother again.

388
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,240
Big brother,

389
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,040
please forgive my impudence but

390
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,480
you can't be more careless.

391
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,840
Didn't you notice any difference

392
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,400
between the Cleansing Music played by me

393
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,840
and that by second bro ?

394
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,120
You!

395
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,600
You!

396
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,000
You lout! How dare you!

397
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll kill you!

398
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,800
Kill! Kill!

399
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,440
I'll kill you!

400
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,200
Kill! Kill!

401
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,220
I'll kill you!

402
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,840
= Pageant Hall =
I'll kill you!

403
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,280
= Pageant Hall =

404
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,220
Kill!
= Pageant Hall =

405
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,440
Kill!

406
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,920
I'll kill you!

407
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Kill! Kill!

408
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,760
Kill!

409

I'll kill you!

410
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,240
Kill!

411
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,880
Big brother! Big brother!

412
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,080
Big brother! Big brother!

413
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,200
- Big brother! - I'll kill you!

414
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
Big brother! Big brother!

415
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,760
Kill!

416
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,360
Big brother!

417
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,320
Huaisang!

418
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,960
- Don't go there! - Big brother!

419
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,440
- He can't recognize you now! - Big brother!

420
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,600
Big brother! Big brother!

421
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,440
Big brother! Big brother! Big brother!

422
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,480
Big brother!

423
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,680
Big brother!

424
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,880
Big brother! Big brother!

425
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,440
It's me!

426
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,040
Big brother!

427
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,600
Big brother! Big brother!

428
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,320
- Big brother! - Don't go there!

429
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,520
It's me!

430
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,080
It's me.

431
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,160
It won't work.

432
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I only have half the power of Stygian Tiger Amulet here.

433
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
I can't control him.

434
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,840
What should we do?

435
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,200
Just kill it.

436
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
Finally, it's quiet now.

437
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,880
Come on!

438
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,720
Move!

439
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,680
Move!

440
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,680
Wei Ying.

441
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,760
Wake up!

442
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,960
Wei Ying.

443
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,920
How is it?

444
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,840
Let's go.

445
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,600
Where?

446
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,600
Fragrance Hall.

447
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,270
The bronze mirror in Fragrance Hall

448
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,520
is the entrance of the hidden chamber.

449
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
His wife, Qin Su

450
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,600
just found out his secret and was dragged inside by him.

451
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,960
She should be inside it now.

452
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,720
So is Red Blade Master's head.

453
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,480
Let's hurry there!

454
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,320
Hold on.

455
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,000
Why is Hanguang Jun in a rush?

456
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,880
Anything urgent?

457
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,200
Please allow us to report

458
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,080
to His Excellency.

459
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,760
Get aside.

460
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,240
No time for you to report it.

461
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,280
I've told you already.

462
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,800
Wangji.

463
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,720
Big brother.

464
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,480
Where is it?

465
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,560
Fragrance Hall.

466
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,400
It's you guys.

467
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,200
Why are you here?

468
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,440
Wait a second.

469
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,640
This is my little uncle's bedroom.

470
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,120
You must come to a wrong place.

471
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,320
Stop.

472
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,000
What do you want

473
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,280
as you barging into here?

474
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
Lianfang Zun.

475
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,720
Clan Leader Jin. Please open the door.

476
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,680
Open up!

477
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,080
What on earth do you want?

478
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,880
People are all attracted to here.

479
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,480
This is my little uncle's bedroom.

480
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,360
You understand bedroom?

481
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,280
Didn't I tell you never...

482
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,160
What's the problem?

483
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,280
Did any imperfection of our service during the day trouble you?

484
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,320
So you want to open

485
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,400
another banquet in the night here?

486
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,840
Lianfang Zun, you show up in time.

487
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,400
A little bit later.

488
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,080
You will miss the good stuff in the hidden chamber

489
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,120
in Fragrance Hall.

490
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,440
Hidden chamber?

491
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:49,960
What's wrong?

492
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,600
Not so rare is the hidden chamber, is it?

493
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,120
All clans have their treasure vaults

494
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,200
if they have some precious spiritual tools.

495
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,840
Yao.

496
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,080
May we see what's inside

497
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
your treasure vault?

498
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,320
Second brother,

499
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,360
it's called "treasure vault"

500
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,320
which means

501
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,160
to keep others

502
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,920
from getting in.

503
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,080
So...

504
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,880
Open it.

505
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,000
Clan Leader Lan.

506
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,960
It's said that Lan clan of Gusu takes etiquette highly.

507
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,320
Judging from this case,

508
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,720
it seems it's just being said, not done.

509
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,360
Forcing one's way to the bedroom of a clan leader,

510
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,760
does it fit with etiquette?

511
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,880
Su She.

512
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
Hanguang Jun.

513
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,640
Su She.

514
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,800
You defected from Lan clan,

515
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,960
but still imitate Hanguang Jun.

516
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,720
He wields Qin. So do you.

517
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,360
How could you scold Lan clan of Gusu?
