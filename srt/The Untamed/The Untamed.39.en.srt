1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 39

3
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
Of course I can't show you any mercy.

4
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,750
Do you think I don't know

5
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
what you've done all these years?

6
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,960
When you were chased by your foes,

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,000
Xiao Xingchen saved you with kindness.

8
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
But you betrayed his kindness.

9
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
Turning living people into puppets,

10
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,560
You deceived Xiao Xingchen

11
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,200
and now made Song Lan look like this.

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,880
You didn't even spare Jing, a little girl!

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,720
You are laughing?!

14
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
How can you still laugh out?

15
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,400
He is so disgusted by you.

16
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,720
Yet you still wanted to bring him to life

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,480
just for your crappy game!

18
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,840
I want nothing of the kind.

19
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,120
Then why did you kneel down and beg me

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
to repair his spiritual cognition?

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,440
Why did I do so?

22
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,960
Didn't he want to be a virtuous person?

23
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
I just won't let him do what he wanted.

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,480
You hate him that much?

25
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,040
Then why did you kill Chang Ping?

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,920
Why did I kill Chang Ping?

27
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Haven't I told you already, Patriarch Yiling?

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,380
I said that I was going to wipe out the entire Chang clan,

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,280
that I wouldn't even leave a dog behind!

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,320
That's a great excuse you came up with.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
However, the timing doesn't make any sense.

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,440
Someone like you who seeks revenge for the pettiest things

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,240
and murders in such ruthless ways

34
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
wouldn't have waited so many years

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,880
to finish off one clan, would you?

36
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,720
You know the reason

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,640
why you killed Chang Ping.

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,920
Then, tell me.

39
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
What do I know?

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,920
What do I know?!

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,040
You didn't just kill him.

42
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,240
Why did you choose Lingchi, the lingering death,

43
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,920
a torture method that represents 'punishment'?

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,280
Why did you use Frostwork Sword

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,960
instead of your own Looming Disaster?

46
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,600
Why did you gouge out his eyes

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,800
and turned him into the way Xiao Xingchen looked like?

48
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,320
Nonsense!

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,480
That's all nonsense!

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,120
It's revenge.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Why on earth would I have let him die comfortably?

52
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
You were indeed seeking revenge,

53
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,120
but whose revenge were you truly seeking?

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,120
What a joke.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,280
If you wanted vengeance,

56
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,040
the one you should've executed Lingchi on

57
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,400
would be yourself!

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,320
The little delinquent has got such a high vitality.

59
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,680
It's as if he can't feel pain at all.

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,520
I still have to psych him to say a few more words.

61
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,840
But I'm really curious.

62
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,640
Even if you have a shard of Yin Iron,

63
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,160
I'm afraid you won't be able to restore half of the Amulet.

64
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
Let me guess.

65
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,080
Someone must be helping you, right?

66
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,240
What about the friend you used to say

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
he is good at acting and makes you feel inferior?

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
Why doesn't he show up to help you?

69
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,080
Why don't you say something?!

70
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,240
Lan Zhan, hurry,

71
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
and attack where the pole knocks!

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,560
Little Blind.

73
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,880
I've cut your tongue and taken your eyes.

74
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,560
You've been hiding all these years.

75
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,960
But now you dare to come out.

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,560
Aren't you scared that I'll break you into pieces?

77
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,640
Go to hell!

78
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,000
Lan Zhan. Ghostface Man...

79
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,080
It's a pity that the Amulet they made was taken away.

80
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
I stabbed him three times just now,

81
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,520
but I let him escape in the fog.

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,520
At least

83
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,960
we know that Xue Yang

84
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
and Ghostface Man are in the same group.

85
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,240
Maybe they have the same manipulator.

86
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,800
Lan Zhan.

87
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,320
What are you thinking?

88
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,120
The Ghostface Man's swordsmanship is strange.

89
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,640
It's born out of Lan clan of Gusu,

90
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,440
but has the unique skill of Jin clan of Lanling.

91
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,840
They're here.

92
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,520
Hanguang Jun,

93
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,640
you're finally back.

94
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,240
Senior Mo, this is...

95
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,080
Don't worry.

96
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,840
He has already regained consciousness.

97
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,680
Senior Mo, they...

98
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,960
I'll tell you later.

99
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,400
The rest

100
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,320
is for them to clean up.

101
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:13,727
= Snow Flick =

102
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,120
Was it fun?

103
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,320
Yes.

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,080
Of course it was fun.

105
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Taoist Xiao Xingchen,

106
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,280
do you want to know

107
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,280
how I broke this finger?

108
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,200
No.

109
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,240
But I want to share with you anyway!

110
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,240
If you still think it's my fault

111
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,720
when I'm finished

112
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,000
you can do whatever you want.

113
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,080
Do you remember the story I told you

114
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,160
about the child and his candy?

115
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The child really wanted to

116
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,160
eat that candy.

117
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,960
So he kept on chasing the cart.

118
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,720
He waved his arms

119
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,520
in front of the cart for them to stop.

120
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,600
But the man was too irritated by his crying.

121
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,240
Snatching the driver's whip,

122
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,240
he lashed the child's face and threw him onto the ground.

123
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,880
And then,

124
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,960
the wheels of the cart milled over the child's hand,

125
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,560
one finger at a time.

126
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,560
He was seven!

127
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,640
The bones of his left hand were crushed,

128
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,520
while one finger was milled into battered flesh on the spot!

129
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,240
Xiao Xingchen,

130
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,600
you were so just, so stern

131
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,960
when you brought me to Jinlintai!

132
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,520
This man was Chang Ping's father.

133
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,360
Chang Cian broke one of your fingers in the past.

134
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
If you sought revenge,

135
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
you could've simply broken one of his fingers as well.

136
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,120
If you really took the matter to heart,

137
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,000
you could've broken two, or even all ten!

138
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,880
You could've even cut off an entire arm of his.

139
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,320
Why did you have to wipe out his entire clan?

140
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,720
Are you telling me that a single finger of yours

141
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,080
was worth more than fifty human lives?!

142
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
Of course.

143
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,520
My fingers were my own, while those lives were other peoples'.

144
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,040
No matter how many lives I took, they wouldn't have been even.

145
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
It was only around fifty. How could it have possibly

146
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,920
been equal to one of my fingers?

147
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,920
Then what about others?!

148
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,320
Then why did you wipe out Snow White Pavilion?

149
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,640
Why did you blind Zichen's eyes?!

150
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,560
Then why did you stop me?

151
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
Why did you hinder what I wanted to do?

152
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,240
Why did you stand up for those dregs of Chang clan?

153
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,080
Xiao Xingchen,

154
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,120
this was your fault, ever since the beginning.

155
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,800
You shouldn't have meddled with other people's business.

156
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
Right or wrong,

157
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,390
kindness or hatred are not clearly distinguished,

158
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
so how could an outsider possibly understand?

159
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,760
Or maybe you shouldn't have left the mountain in the first place.

160
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,640
Your martial mentor, Baoshan Wanderer, was indeed insightful.

161
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Why didn't you listen to her

162
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,080
and obediently cultivate in the mountain?

163
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,240
If you couldn't understand the human affairs

164
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,760
and this world, then you shouldn't have come!

165
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,440
Xue Yang.

166
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,000
You are really disgusting.

167
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,400
Xiao Xingchen.

168
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,280
This is why I hate you.

169
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,160
The people that I hate the most

170
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,440
are ones like you who say they're righteous,

171
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,360
who think they're virtuous.

172
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,320
Stupid, naive, dumb idiots,

173
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,720
like you who think the world's better

174
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,560
just because you did something good!

175
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,080
You think I'm disgusting?

176
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,240
Very well.

177
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,600
Would I care if anybody thinks I'm disgusting?

178
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,920
But,

179
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,000
are you in a position to be disgusted by me?

180
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,760
Didn't we go out and

181
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,280
kill some evil corpses every few days recently?

182
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,240
Why are you bringing this up now?

183
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Nothing, really.

184
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,160
It's just really unfortunate

185
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,600
that you're blind.

186
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,600
You dug out both of your eyes.

187
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,640
So you couldn't see

188
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,360
those men that you killed. They were so scared, in so much pain,

189
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,400
when you pierced them through their hearts.

190
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,600
Some even kneeled down, cried and kowtowed for you to spare

191
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,160
the young and elderly of their families.

192
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,360
If not for how I cut off all of their tongues,

193
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,480
I bet they would've been wailing and shouting

194
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,760
'spare us'.

195
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,800
You were lying to me.

196
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,200
You were lying to me.

197
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
You tricked me.

198
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
There is no way. You were lying to me.

199
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Yes.

200
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,240
You tricked me.

201
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,280
I deceived you.

202
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,800
I've been deceiving you all along.

203
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,280
Who would've known that

204
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,480
you believed me when I was lying to you,

205
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,680
but now you won't believe me when I'm speaking the truth?

206
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,240
Shut up!

207
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,920
Shut up!

208
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,880
Alright!

209
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,920
I'll be quiet!

210
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,240
If you still don't believe me,

211
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,120
then pass a few moves with the one standing behind you.

212
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,320
Make him tell you that

213
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,160
if I'm deceiving you or not!

214
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,350
= Snow Flick =

215
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Zichen.

216
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,720
Zichen.

217
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,800
Is that you?

218
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,800
What happened?

219
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,520
Say something.

220
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Say something.

221
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Can anybody say something?!

222
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,240
What's wrong?!

223
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,360
You're so touched to see

224
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,480
your old friend again that you're even crying!

225
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
Do you want to give him a hug?!

226
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,800
Saving the world!

227
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,160
What a joke.

228
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,200
You can't even save yourself!

229
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,920
Xiao Xingchen.

230
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,800
You couldn't do anything.

231
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,560
You've failed miserably.

232
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,920
You're the only one to blame.

233
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,280
You asked for all of this!

234
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,880
Please. Let me go.

235
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Didn't you want to stab me to death just a moment ago?

236
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Why are you begging me to let you go, now?

237
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,760
The dead is better than the living.

238
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,720
Dead ones will be more obedient.

239
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,000
Xiao Xingchen.

240
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,200
If you don't get up,

241
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,760
I'll make your dear friend Song Lan murder people.

242
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,560
I'll strangle that little blind Jing and leave her corpse

243
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,480
in the fields

244
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,080
for the wild dogs to gobble her up.

245
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,240
Xiao Xingchen!

246
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,920
Spirit-trapping pouch.

247
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,840
Spirit-trapping pouch.

248
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,560
Right.

249
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
I need a Spirit-trapping pouch.

250
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,560
Once upon a time there was a little child

251
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,520
who liked sweet things very much.

252
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,280
But because he had no parents nor money,

253
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,480
he could never have such things.

254
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,920
So everyday he'd been dreaming

255
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,200
if only someone could give him a candy

256
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,440
every day.

257
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,000
How could there be such a thing in the world?!

258
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,280
Jing.

259
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,480
Miss Jing...

260
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:32,850
= Grave of Jing =

261
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,000
That Xue Yang

262
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,280
is such a filthy scumbag!

263
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,800
Punishment by death was too light for him!

264
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,240
If Fairy were here,

265
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,280
I would've made her chomp him to death!

266
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:51,840
Lan Zhan.

267
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,960
Fortunately.

268
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,560
What?

269
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,120
Go back

270
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,560
to Coffin Town.

271
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,800
Finally, it has a response.

272
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,520
Wait here for us.

273
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,760
We'll be right back.

274
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,040
Understood.

275
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,650
= Coffin Town =

276
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:43,960
Brother Song.

277
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,320
This is his left spiritual cognition.

278
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,960
Miss Jing has passed away.

279
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,080
We buried her outside the town.

280
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:36,450
= Thanks a lot. =

281
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,320
What do you intend on doing afterwards?

282
00:25:49,525 --> 00:25:53,125
= Roam this world with Frostwork. =

283
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,150
= Exorcise evil beings alongside XingChen. =

284
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,120
Xiao Xingchen, the Moon in Breeze.

285
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
Song Zichen, the Gentry Despite Frost.

286
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,880
I wonder if the two of them

287
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,360
would be able to meet each other again.

288
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:29,050
= Coffin Town =

289
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,720
Suppressing Circle.

290
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,760
Lan Zhan, be careful.

291
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,040
Sure enough, it's the sign of Stygian Tiger Amulet.

292
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,520
It's him!

293
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,150
= Tanzhou =

294
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,160
This is where people should live.

295
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,920
Do you agree, Sizhui?

296
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,640
Where is Sizhui?

297
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,400
Sizhui.

298
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,960
What are you doing, Sizhui?

299
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,640
You like this? How old are you?

300
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,640
I haven't played with it since I was three.

301
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
None of your business!

302
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,920
We can buy whatever we want,

303
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,880
and it doesn't cost your clan's money!

304
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,560
I will take a look around over there.

305
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,040
Sizhui,

306
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,760
no need to look at it.

307
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,240
We have all these stuff in our Gusu.

308
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,120
Yea. I know.

309
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,680
Feel free to take off first. I'll follow you right away.

310
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,240
All right then.

311
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,920
Jingyi.

312
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,880
Do you remember what you were doing before you were three?

313
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,840
Who would remember such things?

314
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,320
It's nothing more than

315
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,000
playing in Cloud Recesses, and so on.

316
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,720
Why did you ask?

317
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,560
Nothing.

318
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,680
Just checking.

319
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,840
Sizhui, look at that.

320
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,440
Yuan!

321
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,440
Hey, kiddo, do you like it?

322
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,080
Yes.

323
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,560
Lan Zhan.

324
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,560
You like rabbits, don't you?

325
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,560
Lan Zhan.

326
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,840
Let's buy it.

327
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,680
Okay.

328
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,760
Hanguang Jun.

329
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,760
Hanguang Jun.

330
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,040
Hanguang Jun.

331
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,760
What's the matter?

332
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,440
Zewu Jun

333
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,040
has arrived

334
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,640
and is waiting for you at the inn.

335
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,160
= Tanzhou Inn =

336
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,520
Senior Mo,

337
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,600
this lantern...

338
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,840
You can keep it.

339
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,720
Seems like we've got some business to take care of.

340
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,760
Are you sure

341
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,630
you saw my Big Brother's body?

342
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,960
In the Coffin Town, under the Circle

343
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,400
we saw the headless corpse,

344
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,000
which was well preserved.

345
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,120
Even the clothes did not decay.

346
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,840
Blade Spirit didn't turn into

347
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,150
his original appearance until he saw the body.

348
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,760
Big Brother.

349
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,160
He really is Red Blade Master.

350
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,440
Brother.

351
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,120
Wangji.

352
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,120
Enough said.

353
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,160
Back then,

354
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,000
I witnessed Big Brother

355
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,800
went through Qi deviation at Jinlintai with my own eyes.

356
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,600
And all his meridians were broken.

357
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,160
Though I haven't heard from him

358
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,680
all these years,

359
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,160
I've prepared myself for the worst.

360
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,800
Zewu Jun.

361
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,400
I have one more thing to ask.

362
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,440
Go ahead, please.

363
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,920
Just now, Hanguang Jun said

364
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
that we had dealt with

365
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,400
the Ghostface Man who robbed Xue Yang's Amulet

366
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,000
in Coffin Town.

367
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,360
But what Hanguang Jun didn't tell you was that

368
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,000
this person not only knows

369
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,280
your clan's swordsmanship very well,

370
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,520
but can use some unique skills of Jin clan.

371
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,280
Does Zewu Jun know who he might be?

372
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,280
This Ghostface Man

373
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,080
not only knows the swordsmanship of Lan and Jin,

374
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,960
but is secretive with his trace and identity.

375
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
He not only attempted to rob Blade Spirit in Yueyang,

376
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
but helped Xue Yang to commit murder in Coffin Town.

377
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,680
This person

378
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,320
obviously didn't want us to find

379
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,560
Red Blade Master's body,

380
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,280
and was afraid that

381
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,280
we would see the Amulet restored by Xue Yang.

382
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,400
Let us leave aside

383
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,840
the secrets

384
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,480
this person may not want us to know.

385
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,280
As it turns out that

386
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,560
this is someone who is well aware of

387
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,840
the secret behind Blades Shrine of Nie clan.

388
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,680
Someone who's quite close

389
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,600
with Lan clan of Gusu.

390
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,600
Someone who

391
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,760
has a rather complicated history with Red Blade Master.

392
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,240
He wouldn't have done such things.

393
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,560
Zewu Jun.

394
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,840
The incidents you had when investigating the Blade Spirit

395
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,120
and encountering the Ghostface Man

396
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,520
all happened within this month.

397
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,160
During this time, he has been

398
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,400
discussing matters with me every single night.

399
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Just a couple days ago,

400
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,440
we were planning the Cultivation Conference together

401
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,200
that was supposed to be held at Lanling next month.

402
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
He couldn't have been in two places at once.

403
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,520
So the Ghostface Man

404
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,880
could not have been him.

405
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,800
What if he used a Transportation Talisman?

406
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,360
One must cultivate the Transportation Technique

407
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,840
in order to use the Transportation Talisman.

408
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,120
It is rather difficult to do so.

409
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,800
He has never shown signs of cultivating it.

410
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,160
Besides, one must expend large quantities

411
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,120
of spiritual powers to use this technique.

412
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,680
However, we had been night hunting together just a few days ago,

413
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,560
and he was in excellent condition.

414
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,280
I can be certain that

415
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,640
he has never used the Transportation Talisman.

416
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,640
He did not have to go himself.

417
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,920
Zewu Jun.

418
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,280
You are fully aware

419
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,480
who is the most suspicious person.

420
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,440
You're just refusing to admit it.

421
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,960
Yes, I know.

422
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,480
These years the world

423
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,520
holds quite a few misconceptions about him.

424
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,240
But,

425
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,840
I trust what I have seen

426
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,960
throughout all these years.

427
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,760
I trust that he is not that kind of person.

428
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,600
It wasn't difficult for me to understand

429
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,640
why Zewu Jun defended him.

430
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,360
To be honest,

431
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,520
even I didn't have a terrible opinion

432
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,440
of this person.

433
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,360
Weren't we talking about Xue Yang just then.

434
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
Why are we bringing up Wei Yin?

435
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,800
Just think about what Xue Yang has done.

436
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,200
He is worse than an animal.

437
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,240
Wei Yin is even more disgusting as

438
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,080
compared to Xue Yang.

439
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,200
Simply by letting these crook heretics living in the world

440
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,280
would be an act of evil.

441
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,960
And they should all be killed!

442
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,520
Why are you so angry?

443
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,240
Sizhui didn't say that Wei Wuxian shouldn't be killed.

444
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,440
He was just saying that the person

445
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,560
of demonic cultivation may not all be the same as Xue Yang.

446
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,160
Do you really have to make a scene?

447
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,080
Didn't he say something else?

448
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,040
"The person of demonic cultivation

449
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,840
may not use the power to do evil!"

450
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,160
Who is the "person of demonic cultivation"?

451
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,080
You tell me!

452
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,360
Besides Wei Yin, who else?!

453
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,240
Childe Wei.

454
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,360
Don't take it to heart.

455
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,040
It turned out that Zewu Jun has already recognized me.

456
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,880
Excuse my manners.

457
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,440
I just confirmed it.

458
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,800
Then Zewu Jun should also know

459
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,800
it's no coincidence that the Blade Spirit

460
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,080
reappeared in Mo's Manor.

461
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,920
Please think it over carefully, Zewu Jun.
