1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 32

3
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
= Pageant Hall =

4
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,760
I didn't expect the rest of Wen clan

5
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,160
really came to Jinlintai for punishment.

6
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,240
No way would Clan Leader Jin go easy on them.

7
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,440
Right.

8
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,000
After all, it is Childe Jin who died.

9
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,840
If I were him, I would also have killed them to vent anger.

10
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,040
It is really a tragedy.

11
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,400
Little Childe Jin is just one-month-old and...

12
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,600
Enough, let's go.

13
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,960
Li.

14
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,360
Go get some rest.

15
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
I will take care of the rest.

16
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,040
Go.

17
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,120
You won't stand it if you stay here too long.

18
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,560
I will stay. It'd be enough.

19
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,760
Mother.

20
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,600
Let me accompany him a little bit longer.

21
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,200
No.

22
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,600
I will get you some food.

23
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,240
Who's there?

24
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,520
Who?

25
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,880
Who?

26
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,120
Xian.

27
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,320
Wei Wuxian.

28
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,000
Somebody help!

29
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,040
Come immediately!

30
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,640
Wei Wuxian sneaked into Jinlintai!

31
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,040
Somebody help !

32
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,480
- Wei Wuxian is here! - Help!

33
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,120
Catch him, catch Yiling Patriarch!

34
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,560
Catch Wei Wuxian!

35
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,560
You! Stop!

36
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,920
Xian.

37
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,720
Xian.

38
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,960
Senior sister.

39
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,600
Xian.

40
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
Stand up.

41
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,840
I'm so sorry.

42
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
Wei Wuxian,

43
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
you are losing control.

44
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
Get lost!

45
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,240
Get lost!

46
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,160
Let us out. Let us help you.

47
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,680
Wei Wuxian.

48
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,560
Get lost!

49
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,200
Leave me alone!

50
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,880
Go away!

51
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
Clan Leader Jin said

52
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,880
the Four will hold a mobilization meeting

53
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,960
at Nevernight.

54
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,200
They will display the Wen's corpses for three days

55
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,070
and scatter the cremains of bandit chieftains

56
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,160
for demonstration of justice.

57
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,240
The Ghost General was so brutal.

58
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,040
He claimed to ask for punishment but suddenly went crazy

59
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,800
and killed many people at Jinlintai again.

60
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,960
Luckily, I wasn't there that day.

61
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,120
He was indeed the dog trained by Wei Wuxian.

62
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,680
Why did Wei Wuxian

63
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,280
make something he can not control?

64
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
He didn't even know

65
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,720
to chain that fierce mad dog.

66
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,400
Sooner or later, it will backfire on him.

67
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,800
With this trend, I can say that day ain't far.

68
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,880
Jin clan of Lanling is really unfortunate.

69
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,720
Lan clan of Gusu is more unfortunate.

70
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,040
Over 30 people were killed in Qiongqi Road.

71
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,840
More than half of them were from Lan clan.

72
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,720
They were there just to help repress the trouble.

73
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,840
At least we finally burnt the Ghost General.

74
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,480
Otherwise, thinking of him

75
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,800
haunting around all day long

76
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,030
really makes me sleepless.

77
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,910
This ending served the Wen right.

78
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,720
The Ghost General and his sister

79
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,880
have been burnt to ashes.

80
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,960
Now Wei Wuxian knows who is the boss.

81
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
All clan leaders made it clear that

82
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
the meeting tonight

83
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,520
is to discuss how to deal with Wei.

84
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
What a relief!

85
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,960
If from now on

86
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,640
he would hide in that barren hummock

87
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,680
and behave himself, it'd be wise of him.

88
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,920
But if he dares to come out again,

89
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,480
once he comes out, then...

90
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,720
Then what?

91
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,320
Chenqing! It's Chenqing!

92
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,840
Wei Wuxian!

93
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,520
Report to Clan Leader Jin, quickly!

94
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,240
Why do you stop talking?

95
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,000
How to deal with me?

96
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,480
Wei Ying.

97
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,600
If you're really capable,

98
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,280
then go to the mobilization meeting

99
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,440
to compete with the clan leaders there.

100
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,880
Bullying low-rank

101
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,280
defenseless cultivators like us

102
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,480
can't... can't prove how capable you are!

103
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,200
Don't kill me!

104
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
Low-rank cultivators...

105
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,240
Why should I tolerate you because you're low-rank?

106
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,000
What kind of hatred do you have for me?

107
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,800
Always pushing me, always.

108
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,320
But you are right about one thing.

109
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,600
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

110
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,160
I shouldn't waste time on you.

111
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:07,140
= Nevernight =

112
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,000
Whoever they are.

113
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,760
Whichever name they bear.

114
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,960
This cup of liquor

115
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,320
represents my respect to our past heroes.

116
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,440
Your spirits are everlasting.

117
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,640
May you rest in peace.

118
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,640
Your spirits are everlasting.

119
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,400
May you rest in peace.

120
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,520
Wen Qing, Wen Ning.

121
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,760
Bandit chieftains of clan Wen.

122
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,040
I'll scatter their cremains.

123
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Great! Great! Great!

124
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,120
We can move now.

125
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,160
Hanguang Jun.

126
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,040
Where's Wei Ying?

127
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,000
Hangguang Jun, you are late.

128
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
Wei Wuxian just left.

129
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,760
Yes, just an hour ago.

130
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,880
Where did he go?

131
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,240
He got in Nevernight

132
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,520
for the meeting probably.

133
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,320
Tonight,

134
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,000
it is the two bandit chieftains here

135
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,760
whose cremains were scattered.

136
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,720
Tomorrow,

137
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,760
it will be the rest of Wen's last dregs

138
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,840
and also

139
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,440
Yiling Patriarch, Wei Ying,

140
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,680
Wei Wuxian!

141
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,560
Wei Ying!

142
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,280
How dare you

143
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,280
to show up here?

144
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,110
Why I cannot be here?

145
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Don't you forget

146
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,240
back in Sunshot Campaign,

147
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,070
I fought five thousand men alone

148
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,000
not to mention three thousand.

149
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,350
Besides, my appearance

150
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,640
is just what you all want, isn't it?

151
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,310
Save your labor to find my den

152
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,440
and burn me tomorrow.

153
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,360
Arrogant lout!

154
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Clan Leader Nie,

155
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,840
I am always arrogant like this.

156
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,040
Clan Leader Jin,

157
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,640
I have a question for you.

158
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,080
Who said if Wen Qing and Wen Ning

159
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240
went to Jinlintai and asked for punishment,

160
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,280
he would call it the end?

161
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,320
And who just said

162
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,800
he would scatter the cremains of

163
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,480
rest of Wen's last dregs

164
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,240
and me?

165
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,160
Those are two different things.

166
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,000
Wei Ying,

167
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,960
in the assault in Qiongqi Road

168
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,200
you slaughtered over one hundred disciples of Jin clan.

169
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,360
That's one thing.

170
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,360
You letting Wen Ning commit many murders

171
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,960
is another thing.

172
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,440
Clan Leader Jin,

173
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,080
about that assault in Qiongqi Road,

174
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,760
who was the target?

175
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,560
Whose death was wanted?

176
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,000
Who plotted that?

177
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,680
Who fell into that ambush?

178
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,600
Ultimately,

179
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,200
who was the one that provoked me actively?

180
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,000
And please tell me

181
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,360
how can I control Wen Ning

182
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,320
to commit murders at Jinlintai from miles away?

183
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
Wei Wuxian,

184
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,560
even it was Jin Zixun who assaulted you at the first place.

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,240
You shouldn't have been so brutal

186
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,920
to have killed so many people there.

187
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
I see.

188
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,840
If you want to kill me,

189
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,560
you can do whatever you want.

190
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,920
But if I want to protect myself,

191
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
I must be careful about

192
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,000
not hurting this one, not hurting that one.

193
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,040
If I die, it's because of my bad luck.

194
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
You can ambush me,

195
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,920
but I can't fight back.

196
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,640
Have I said it wrong?

197
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,080
Fight back?

198
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,920
Those over thirty people who died in Qiongqi Road were innocent.

199
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,800
Why did you kill them while fighting back?

200
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,800
At Burial Mounds,

201
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,080
the dozen of Wen clan cultivators were innocent too.

202
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,040
Why did you involve them?

203
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,640
You!

204
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,080
What great benefit did Wen clan offer you?

205
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,080
Why you protect those fiends so hard?

206
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,160
Wei Wuxian.

207
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,600
Do you think

208
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,760
being against all clans

209
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,400
makes you a hero, a martyr?

210
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,040
Do you think

211
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,200
you dare to do what's forbidden

212
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,040
will make yourself a great people?

213
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,600
To tell the origin,

214
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,000
it was you who cast

215
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,120
that vicious evil spell on Jin Zixun at first palce.

216
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,960
I want to ask you.

217
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,440
What evidence do you have

218
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,120
to prove it was my work?

219
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
What evidence do you have

220
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,640
to prove it's not your work?

221
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,360
Then I shall ask you.

222
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,480
Why it's not you?

223
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,040
You don't have the evidence

224
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,120
to prove it's not your work, do you?

225
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,080
Me?

226
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm not like you!

227
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,680
Don't you confound right and wrong and talk nonsense!

228
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,720
You are the most probable suspect!

229
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,280
You think we don't know

230
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,920
that you had a grudge against Jin Zixun one year ago.

231
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,880
Who's talking nonsense here?

232
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,960
You are correct that

233
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,920
I knew him one year ago

234
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,920
but if I wanted to kill him

235
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,440
I could have done it one year ago.

236
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,840
Why should I keep him alive till now?

237
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,480
Little characters like him.

238
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,480
I forgot him just in three days,

239
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,040
not to mention a year.

240
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,760
Wei Wuxian.

241
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,560
You've really broadened my horizon.

242
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,280
I've never seen a person like you.

243
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Such an arrogant unreasonable scoundrel!

244
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,560
You killed more than thirty people

245
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,360
and insulted them with venomous words.

246
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,240
Don't you have any

247
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,880
compassion and sense of empathy?

248
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,400
Wei Ying,

249
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,080
you disappoint me so much!

250
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,560
I admired you once and

251
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:06,960
even said

252
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,240
you are somebody who established a section!

253
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,640
But now,

254
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,280
you're repulsing me!

255
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,040
From now on

256
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,760
you and I are irreconcilable!

257
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,600
You said you admired me once.

258
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,160
Why I never saw you

259
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,680
when you were admiring me?

260
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,280
But when I'm at a disadvantage

261
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,640
you suddenly jump out to help them yell and shout?

262
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,880
How cheap your admiration was!

263
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,160
You say you and I are irreconcilable from now on.

264
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,600
Does it make any difference to me

265
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,520
if your stance changes or not?

266
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,840
Both your hatred and admiration

267
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,080
are so cheap!

268
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,200
How could you reproach me with that kind of trifle?

269
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,520
You got him.

270
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,720
Nice shot!

271
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,640
Brother!

272
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,800
Brother!

273
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,000
Brother!

274
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,480
How is he?

275
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,720
Brother!

276
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,040
Brother!

277
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Wei Ying, you are so vicious!

278
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,400
What is vicious?

279
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,080
Since he dared to shoot me,

280
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,120
he should have known

281
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,120
what would happen if he missed it.

282
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,440
You're already calling me with "wicked tricks".

283
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,360
You can't be counting on my mercy

284
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,080
to let it go, right?

285
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,240
Form up!

286
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,040
We can't let him leave here alive today!

287
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,400
Kill!

288
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,240
Clan Leader,

289
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,680
they don't attack us.

290
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,240
It seems

291
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,680
senior brother still remembers us.

292
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,960
WangJi.

293
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,240
Lan Zhan,

294
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,840
you are here.

295
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,440
You should have known that

296
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,080
I'm immune to Cleansing Music.

297
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,160
Lan Zhan.

298
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,160
I knew it.

299
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,120
One day

300
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,920
we are going to have a real fight.

301
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,840
Wei Ying.

302
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,560
Stop it!

303
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,120
Wei Ying,

304
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,000
stop it now!

305
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,920
Lan zhan.

306
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,120
Do you think now

307
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,560
I have any other choice?

308
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,120
Situation changed.

309
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,000
What?

310
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,680
You must trust me.

311
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,640
It's not that simple.

312
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,480
What do you mean?

313
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,400
Xian!

314
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,520
Senior sister.

315
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,200
Xian!

316
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,840
Cheng!

317
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,800
Senior sister.

318
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,040
Where are you, Xian?

319
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,000
Xian!

320
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,600
Xian!

321
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Where are you?

322
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,320
Cheng!

323
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,480
Sister.

324
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,000
Senior Sister!

325
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,360
Senior sister, where are you!

326
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,760
Wei Wuxian comes down now, kill him!

327
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,320
Senior sister!

328
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,160
Wei Ying, flute!

329
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
Cheng!

330
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:21,800
Sister!

331
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,360
Xian!

332
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,240
Sister!

333
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,160
Cheng!

334
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,360
Sister!

335
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,360
Xian!

336
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,520
Where are you?

337
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,320
Sister!

338
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,440
Sister!

339
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,560
Sister!

340
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,560
Xian!

341
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,880
Senior sister.

342
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,920
Wei Wuxian!

343
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,040
Wei Wuxian stop!

344
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,720
Wei Wuxian!

345
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,520
Stop immediately!

346
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,200
Xian!

347
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,040
Xian!

348
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,960
Xian!

349
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,880
Senior sister!

350
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,800
Xian!

351
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,080
Xian!

352
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,240
Xian!

353
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,560
Wei Wuxian, make that disappear!

354
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,680
Go away!

355
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,920
Go away! Don't touch her!

356
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,400
Senior sister, watch out!

357
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,920
Sister!

358
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,760
Sister!

359
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:31,920
Wei Ying.

360
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,160
Stop your puppets!

361
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,640
Stop them!

362
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,520
You said you can control them!

363
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,880
You said there's no problem!

364
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
It's not me!

365
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,240
I don't know.

366
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,120
I didn't make them kill!

367
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,120
Why can't I control them?

368
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,160
I lost control of it!

369
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,720
Doesn't matter.

370
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,040
It's fine.

371
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,560
Only a small wound.

372
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,280
I don't know why they aren't under my control.

373
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,280
Why I can't control them!

374
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,720
Xian.

375
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:46,880
Senior sister.

376
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm here.

377
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,840
Xianxian.

378
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,960
My Xian.

379
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,160
You ran so fast

380
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,720
that I didn't have enough time to look at you

381
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,360
and talk with you.

382
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,440
I want to tell you.

383
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,480
# Returning to #

384
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,400
# the old days #

385
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,520
# beside Lotus Cove #

386
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,960
No, not me!

387
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,120
No, I was going to kill Wei Wuxian.

388
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,000
I was going to revenge for my brother!

389
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,040
She threw herself on the sword!

390
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,160
Sister!

391
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,560
# Time elapsed and dreams seem illusory. #

392
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,760
# Hope to write a letter, #

393
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,040
# console old friends missing me in Yunmeng. #

394
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,640
Wei Wuxian, it's you who got her killed!

395
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,160
None of my business!

396
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,280
Not me!

397
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,280
# Looking back, #

398
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,960
# many years have passed without notice. #

399
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,440
# Hope there's no departure, no sorrow. #

400
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:53,760
# But no one would call me "Xian" anymore. #
