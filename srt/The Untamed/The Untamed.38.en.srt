1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 38

3
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,600
How about Empathy?

4
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,680
No way!

5
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,080
Too dangerous!

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Using such a wicked trick,

7
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,480
a little carelessness will get you destroyed.

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
You may never return.

9
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,200
Unless there is a...

10
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,240
Enough! We're running out of time.

11
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,480
Form up now. Let's begin.

12
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,880
We still need to go back for Hanguang Jun when it's done.

13
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,520
Jin Ling. You supervise this.

14
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,520
Me?

15
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,400
You want a Chi...

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,040
You want me to supervise you doing this?

17
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
If Childe Jin is unwilling,

18
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,160
I'd love to.

19
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,080
Jin Ling.

20
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
Did you bring the silver bell of Jiang clan?

21
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,880
The silver bell of Jiang clan has the effect of settling minds.

22
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,040
Let's use this as the signal.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,640
It'd better be me.

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
You didn't want to just now.

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Now you want to.

26
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,680
Now this, then that. What a temper of a lady.

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,600
Jingyi.

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
Stop talking now.

29
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,200
Let's start.

30
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,400
Why is a girl here?

31
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,760
She seems blind.

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,640
Yeah.

33
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,720
Miss.

34
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
There's a tree in front of you.

35
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Thank you very much.

36
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,960
Take it slow.

37
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,640
Miss.

38
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:51,960
Thanks.

39
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,760
Be careful.

40
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,320
Are you hungry?

41
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
Take this to eat please.

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How can I take this?

43
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,000
I...

44
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,800
Just take it.

45
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,240
Jing here to thank you two.

46
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
Thank you.

47
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,720
Poor girl.

48
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,280
Yeah.

49
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,040
At such a young age. Blind.

50
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,200
She's so young.

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,920
What happened to her eyes?

52
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:31,960
Hold well please.

53
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,720
Alright, thanks.

54
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm sorry. So sorry.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,960
Didn't you bring your eyes?

56
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,240
I... I can't see.

57
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,280
Sorry.

58
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,560
You... can't see?

59
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,520
Be careful walking then.

60
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,080
Miss. Let me escort you a little, OK?

61
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
Be careful. Miss.

62
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,000
I can walk on my own, thank you.

63
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,600
You should take care then, Miss.

64
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,720
Bad man.

65
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,200
Are your kind of people all like this?

66
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,880
Dress up like a decent man,

67
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,240
but carry only so little money.

68
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,480
Can't tinkle even when I pinch and shake it.

69
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,400
Bro Song said in Yiling,

70
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,880
Xiao Xingchen had gone missing.

71
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,640
And what happened to his eyes?

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sorry. Sorry.

73
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,440
I can't see.

74
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,840
I'm fine.

75
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,160
Miss, you can't see either?

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,880
Yeah.

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,800
Please take it slow then.

78
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,080
Don't walk so fast

79
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,800
in case you run into somebody again.

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,280
This way.

81
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,640
Crowd are fewer.

82
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
Jing here to thank brother.

83
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,000
I can go back on my own.

84
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,640
Since you redeem me as a brother,

85
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,200
please return brother's moneybag.

86
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,880
Bad girl!

87
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,840
Return my money!

88
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,880
Return it!

89
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,920
Mister, calm down please.

90
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,840
It's inappropriate to treat

91
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:51,720
a little girl like this.

92
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,400
You blind out from nowhere.

93
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,480
Why play the hero here?

94
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,160
Do you know she's a thief?

95
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,040
She's stolen my money!

96
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,360
You are protecting her.

97
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,160
It means you... you're with her?

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Return his money.

99
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,800
So bold of you.

100
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,040
Without your sight,

101
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,800
you still dare to steal.

102
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,080
He just touched me in lewd way.

103
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
What's wrong with a little charge?

104
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,840
His moneybag is so big

105
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
but with so little money inside.

106
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,720
How could he threaten to beat people like that?

107
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,919
Stingy asshole.

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,760
Such being the case,

109
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
you shouldn't have messed up with him.

110
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,400
If there were none with you,

111
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,600
one slap wouldn't be the end.

112
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,080
Miss.

113
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,960
I hope you know what's allowed now.

114
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,280
I haven't returned your moneybag.

115
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
It's yours now. Not really much.

116
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
Don't steal again before it runs out.

117
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,720
According to what that stingy guy said,

118
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,440
you can't see either?

119
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,440
Then I'll follow you from now on.

120
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Follow me for what?

121
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,880
You want to be a cultivator?

122
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,680
You're the big blind. I'm a little blind.

123
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,320
We can take care of each other if we're together.

124
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,680
I don't have parents.

125
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,360
I can follow anyone and go anywhere.

126
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,000
Besides, if you don't bring me with you,

127
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,960
the money you give me

128
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,800
will run out very soon.

129
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
I can only steal or defraud then.

130
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,080
Maybe

131
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
I'd be slapped by somebody so badly

132
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,600
that I couldn't know the directions.

133
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,000
So poor then!

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,880
You're such a smart.

135
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,120
Only you can fool people so utterly and completely.

136
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,560
Who can beat you disoriented?

137
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
Which means you allow me to follow you?

138
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,000
Brother in white.

139
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,240
Don't jump while walking

140
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,080
in case you'd fall.

141
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,280
What's wrong?

142
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,760
Nothing. I... I just sprained my foot.

143
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
Let's hurry to the you-know-what town ahead!

144
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
And rest for a while.

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Didn't you sprain your foot?

146
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
Need me to carry you?

147
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,080
Yes.

148
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,760
Wait a second.

149
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,520
Smell of blood.

150
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,360
What's wrong?

151
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,920
Somebody is lying here.

152
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,600
Is he dead?

153
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
Should we dig a pit to bury him?

154
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,080
Not yet.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,080
Just badly wounded.

156
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,590
= Coffin Town =

157
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,070
= Coffin Town =

158
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:13,680
Jing.

159
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,880
Find something useful around here.

160
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,040
There's a basin.

161
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,400
Find a pot to boil some water. And be careful.

162
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,160
Jing. Quick.

163
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,080
Coming.

164
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,880
Water is here.

165
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,360
Don't move.

166
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,960
You...

167
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
I told you not to move.

168
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
Your wounds are gonna tear.

169
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,080
Rest assured.

170
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,640
I've taken you out of wild.

171
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,880
I won't hurt you.

172
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,000
Who are you?

173
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,360
Can you see with your eyes?

174
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,520
A wandering cultivator of course.

175
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,120
He carried you here

176
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
treated you and fed you elixirs.

177
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,120
How can you be so inimical?

178
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,600
Blind?

179
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,560
What? Have a problem with the blind?

180
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
Weren't you saved by the blind?

181
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,160
Or you'd be rotting beside the road now.

182
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,040
You didn't thank us when you're awake

183
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,440
and call us blind instead.

184
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,840
Stop leaning on that.

185
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
Your leg wound is still bleeding.

186
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,360
Treatment can't delayed.

187
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,080
Or your leg would be disabled.

188
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,200
Sorry for your trouble then.

189
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,840
What?

190
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Have I made you pain?

191
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,200
No.

192
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,080
I touched my wound myself.

193
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,000
Why don't you ask who I am

194
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,600
and how I was wounded like this?

195
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
If you don't say it yourself,

196
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,880
I don't have to ask.

197
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,280
We met by chance.

198
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm just lending my hand.

199
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,960
It's not quite difficult for me.

200
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,000
Once you recover, we shall depart.

201
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
If it were me,

202
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,360
I also have something I don't want to be asked about.

203
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,400
Done.

204
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,320
But movement is inadvisable now.

205
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,360
Or your bones will dislocate again.

206
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,760
Thank you for saving my life.

207
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,320
What's the matter?

208
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,240
Here is a candy for you.

209
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
I don't want to eat. I won't go there.

210
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,600
For sure?

211
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
You dare not come here?

212
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,360
Who said I dare not?

213
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,000
What did you throw at me?

214
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,840
Sweets.

215
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,200
It's my treat.

216
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,560
Sorry. I forgot you're blind. You can't catch.

217
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,440
It's beside your feet.

218
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,760
Delicious? Little blind?

219
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,720
I have a name. And it's not "little blind".

220
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,800
You didn't tell me.

221
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,400
I can only call you that.

222
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,680
Listen carefully,

223
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
my name is Jing.

224
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,599
Don't call me "little blind" again.

225
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,680
You're such a weirdo.

226
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,680
Covered with blood,

227
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,319
wounded so severely,

228
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,040
yet you still got sweets along with you.

229
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,839
Do... do you have more?

230
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,000
I have a crazy sweet tooth since I was a kid.

231
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,839
But I always couldn't have any.

232
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,920
Could only watch others eating sweets. Feeling tempted.

233
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
So I was thinking

234
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,920
once I became successful,

235
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,280
I would bring endless supply of sweets with me.

236
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,080
So... do you have more?

237
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,520
Of course.

238
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,000
Come here.

239
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,360
And I'll give you.

240
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,680
Jing.

241
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,880
About your brother in white.

242
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,160
What did he go to do at midnight?

243
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,600
Out for hunt I guess.

244
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,480
Hunt? Night hunting I presume.

245
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,240
Is it so?

246
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,400
They sound alike.

247
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,160
Something about killing monsters for people without charge.

248
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,080
He can still go to night hunting without his sight?

249
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,960
You're saying that again. So what that he can't see?

250
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,600
Taoist priest he's still awesome

251
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,000
despite his lost sight.

252
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,120
His sword is always whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

253
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,600
One word for that. Fast!

254
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,440
You can't see.

255
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,040
How do you know his sword is fast?

256
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,800
I say it is so it is.

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,480
Taoist priest's sword must be very fast.

258
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,840
Besides,

259
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,160
can't I hear even if I can't see?

260
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,720
What are you insinuating?

261
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
You're looking down on the blind, right?

262
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,480
Where have you been?

263
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,600
I went out for some wood and hay

264
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,600
to fix the rooftop

265
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,640
in case you are cold at night

266
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,840
when I'm out there.

267
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,280
You're going out tonight again?

268
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,360
Night hunting?

269
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,600
Just a favor.

270
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,640
Need a favor?

271
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,760
I mean the rooftop.

272
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,360
No need to bother you.

273
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,760
You really can do it, friend?

274
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,920
Shamefully,

275
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,280
I never did that.

276
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,720
Then you should leave it to me.

277
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
I've been displaced since I was little.

278
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,720
If I couldn't do this...

279
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,800
Your wounds haven't recovered. You can?

280
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,080
Movement is the best cure.

281
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,440
Besides, I didn't get both legs wounded.

282
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,520
I've gotten used to this level of injuries.

283
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,440
I got beaten a lot as a child.

284
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,200
Let me help.

285
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,360
Don't go with him.

286
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,760
Tell you what.

287
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,320
This guy is your peer.

288
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,120
When I was talking with him,

289
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,000
I deliberately mistook "night hunting" as "hunt".

290
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,640
He corrected me immediately.

291
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,160
This should be

292
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,560
a word only known to cultivators, right?

293
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,600
He is furtive,

294
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,720
not revealing himself,

295
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,920
and hiding something.

296
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,600
He can't be good.

297
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,880
Listen to yourself.

298
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,800
You've had his sweets.

299
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,480
Please don't drive him away then.

300
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,480
He'll naturally leave once his wounds heal.

301
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,920
Nobody wants to

302
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,280
stay with us in the coffin home.

303
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
Can you take me out with you tomorrow night?

304
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,160
Definitely not.

305
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,560
You're still recovering.

306
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,280
Besides, I wanna laugh every time you talk.

307
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,680
And I can't hold my sword steadily when I'm laughing.

308
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,760
Then I'd stay quiet.

309
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,640
I'll carry the sword for you. Assist you.

310
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,080
Don't desert me please.

311
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,640
OK then.

312
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,120
Come on.

313
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,400
Slowly.

314
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,040
There's not even one living man in this village.

315
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,080
All puppets now.

316
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,520
Yeah.

317
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,320
Luckily, your sword can indicate where puppets are.

318
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,280
With our own strength,

319
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,800
we couldn't have fought our way out.

320
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,640
Let's go check the village again.

321
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,760
If there's really no living person,

322
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,000
we should burn these evil things as soon as possible.

323
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,240
These people are really puppets?

324
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,800
The bad guy is really helping Taoist priest?

325
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,800
The blind and the crippled walking side by side.

326
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,720
How interesting.

327
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,640
He walks with a limp.

328
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,160
Yeah.

329
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,600
Get out of my face.

330
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,960
Xiao Xingchen.

331
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,080
Little girl.

332
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,160
Sun is setting.

333
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,520
If you really can't see,

334
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,600
you shouldn't walk so fast.

335
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,440
Miss.

336
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,000
What's the matter?

337
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,440
Have you seen

338
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,680
a white blind cultivator carrying a sword?

339
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,120
What...

340
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,680
do you want from him?

341
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,480
You've seen him?

342
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,920
Where is he?

343
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
I might have seen him,

344
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,680
and might not have seen him.

345
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,680
Miss.

346
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,920
How might you have seen him?

347
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,920
Well, answer my questions.

348
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,280
I might have seen him then.

349
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,360
OK.

350
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,920
Are you a friend of him?

351
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,040
Yes.

352
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,720
You really know him?

353
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,720
What's his height?

354
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,000
How does he look?

355
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,760
And how does his sword look like?

356
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,800
He has the similar height as me.

357
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,440
Looks pretty nice.

358
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,790
His sword is engraved with frost flowers.

359
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,560
Okay.

360
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,320
I suppose you're not a bad guy.

361
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,440
Come with me.

362
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Sorry for your trouble.

363
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,080
What's wrong?

364
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,400
Why don't you catch up?

365
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,320
Come on. Why standing there?

366
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,840
Bad guy is back.

367
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,880
Why is he here?

368
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,720
Do you know who he is?

369
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
A bad guy.

370
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,440
He never told his name. How can I know?

371
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,320
He was saved brother in white.

372
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,280
The bad guy pester him all day. Disgusting!

373
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,200
Here. Xiao Xingchen. Old rules.

374
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,600
Pick one.

375
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,920
This one. Sure?

376
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,600
You picked the short one. I won.

377
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,490
You go get some fresh food.

378
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,320
Well. I'll go.

379
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,360
Come back.

380
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,480
I'll go.

381
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Why are you willing to go again?

382
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,480
Are you stupid?

383
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,600
I actually picked the short one.

384
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,240
But I already hid a longest one.

385
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,680
Whichever you picked,

386
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,440
I could always have a longer one.

387
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,280
Just taking advantage of your blindness.

388
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,840
Well. Well. Enough.

389
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,760
I'll go get some fresh food.

390
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,360
Wait for my return.

391
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,400
Brother.

392
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,880
What happened?

393
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,040
No. No.

394
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,920
Song Lan. No.

395
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,960
Should we wake them up?

396
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,920
Too dangerous.

397
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,400
Wait. Wait longer.

398
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,240
Ring the bell now!

399
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,640
Ring the bell!

400
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,040
Senior Mo.

401
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,000
Senior Mo. Wake up!

402
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,040
Senior Mo. Wake up!

403
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,240
Why won't he wake up?

404
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,160
Senior Mo.

405
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,240
Senior Mo. Wake up!

406
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,160
Xue Yang. Taking advantage of his blindness,

407
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,080
you've deceived him so badly.

408
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,800
His blindness?

409
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,040
Where you think his eyes went?

410
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,640
Xue Yang.

411
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,440
Isn't it the Taoist Song?

412
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,800
Rare guest.

413
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,080
Come for a meal?

414
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Damn Taoist.

415
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,640
I finally feel like going out for food,

416
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,640
only to be disrupted by you.

417
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,360
What trick are you using?

418
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,120
I was wondering why you're being lenient.

419
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,440
So you want to ask this?

420
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,040
Speak!

421
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,280
You scum!

422
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,880
What you want approaching him?

423
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,320
I didn't expect your warm concern, Taoist Song.

424
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,000
Speak!

425
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,240
Well. You make me do this.

426
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,560
Do you know what your good friend of Taoism, best friend

427
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,960
have done?

428
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,000
He's killed so many evils.

429
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,440
And he did that for free.

430
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,560
So touching.

431
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,560
He gave his eyes to you,

432
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
so he is blind now.

433
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,400
Luckily Frostwork can

434
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,000
indicate where the resentful energy is.

435
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,320
What's more.

436
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,560
I found

437
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,360
if tongues of those poisoned are removed,

438
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,520
even the Frostwork can't tell

439
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,480
whether it's living person or evil thing?

440
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,600
So...

441
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,960
Son of a bitch.

442
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,040
You animal beneath beasts.

443
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,240
Taoist Song.

444
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,160
Sometimes I think

445
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,920
you educated can be really amateur

446
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,000
at cursing.

447
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,760
Just repeated several words.

448
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,000
It's weak and unimaginative.

449
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,840
You curse like a lady.

450
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
I quit using those words when I was seven.

451
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,160
You!

452
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
Taking advantage of his blindness,

453
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,960
you've deceived him so badly.

454
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,880
His blindness?

455
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,040
Where you think his eyes went?

456
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,280
So senior uncle

457
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,560
gave his eyes to Taoist Song.

458
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,040
What position you have to chastise me?

459
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,520
As a friend?

460
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,640
You still can say

461
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,080
you're a friend of Xiao Xingchen?

462
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,640
- I... - Taoist Song.

463
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,720
Should I remind you

464
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,520
what you said to Xiao Xingchen

465
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,520
after I slaughtered Snow White Pavilion?

466
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,920
I...

467
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,120
I was...

468
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,040
You were grieved and indignant?

469
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,600
In pain?

470
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,200
In sorrow?

471
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,080
Finding a person to vent anger?

472
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,040
So you blamed him that time?

473
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,840
No.

474
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,280
To be fair,

475
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,240
I slaughtered Snow White Pavilion just because of him.

476
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,360
You really could blame him for that.

477
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,000
And that's exactly what I wanted.

478
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,120
Isn't it you who said

479
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,800
that we wouldn't meet again, Taoist Song?

480
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,240
He gave you his eyes

481
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,600
and disappeared.

482
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,080
Why you come for him again?

483
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,440
Aren't you besetting him?

484
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,000
Xiao Xingchen. What do you say?

485
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,480
Is that you?

486
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,520
I'm here. Why are you here?

487
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,520
Frostwork sensed something. I came by its guidance.

488
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,080
A puppet?

489
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,320
Yeah.

490
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,080
He was shouting fiercely.

491
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,640
But he's ran out of his strength.

492
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,820
= Snow Flick sword =

493
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,520
Come on. Let's go make dinner. I'm hungry.

494
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,840
What about some fresh food?

495
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,760
Already bought.

496
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,560
So unlucky I ran into this thing

497
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,600
on my way back.

498
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,760
- Senior Mo. - Senior Mo.

499
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,680
- Senior Mo. - Senior Mo.

500
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,640
- Wake up!

501
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,920
No reaction.

502
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,280
Has he gone dumb?

503
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,840
I said Empathy is dangerous.

504
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,680
It's your fault. You didn't ring the bell in time.

505
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,560
Keep quiet.

506
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,720
I feel dizzy.

507
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,560
You've done well.

508
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,160
You could see things before

509
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,400
and could speak.

510
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,080
It's Xue Yang who

511
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,440
made you like this.

512
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,120
Rest assured.

513
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,200
You stay here for now.

514
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,240
Puppets in the town

515
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,080
can't get in coffin home.

516
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,640
I'll be back soon.

517
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,440
Senior Mo.

518
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,240
What did you see

519
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
when you're in Empathy?

520
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
Too long. I'll talk about later.

521
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,600
Can you cut it short?

522
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,600
Don't leave us suspended.

523
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:28,880
Well.

524
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,880
Xue Yang must die.

525
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:55,760
Lan Zhan.

526
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,800
Wen Ning. Fix him!

527
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,320
The two nails

528
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,760
are much thinner than those in Wen Ning's head.

529
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,160
And materials are different.

530
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,480
It shouldn't be difficult for Song Lan to restore the nature.

531
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,720
Give it back!

532
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,240
Xue Yang.

533
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,120
What do you want him to give back to you?

534
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,880
Frostwork?

535
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,400
But Frostwork is not your sword.

536
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,600
Why should he give it back?

537
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,680
How bold are you?

538
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,240
Senior Wei.

539
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,720
You're so relentless.

540
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,800
Of course I can't show you any mercy.

541
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,000
Do you think I don't know

542
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,160
what you've done these years?

543
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,160
When you were chased by your foes,

544
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,200
Xiao Xingchen saved you with kindness.

545
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,280
But you betrayed his kindness.

546
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,320
Turning living person into puppets,

547
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,720
You deceived Xiao Xingchen

548
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,520
and now made Song Lan look like this.

549
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,080
You even didn't spare a little girl like Jing!

550
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,040
Laughing?!

551
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,560
How can you still laugh out?

552
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,880
He is so disgusted by you

553
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,040
Yet you still wanted to bring him to life

554
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,760
just for your crappy game!

555
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,080
I want nothing of the kind.

556
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,400
Then why did you kneel down and beg me

557
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,280
to repair his spiritual cognition?
