1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 50

3
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Huaisang.

4
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,720
Brother Xichen, watch your back!

5
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
You!

6
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,520
What happened?

7
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,880
I...

8
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,360
I just saw Third Bro...

9
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,080
No... I mean...

10
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,200
I saw Clan Leader Jin's hand reaching behind

11
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,480
I wasn't sure if he... he is gonna...

12
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,760
Is he gonna...

13
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Lan Xichen.

14
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,520
Lan Xichen.

15
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,880
Clan Leader Jin, I've made a promise that

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,760
if you ever make another move

17
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,920
I would show no mercy. Haven't you heard me?!

18
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
That's right.

19
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,120
I heard you loud and clear.

20
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
But did I move?

21
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,040
Why are you looking at him?

22
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,560
Stop looking at him.

23
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,560
What can you possible find?

24
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,040
For years I didn't even have a clue.

25
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Nie Huaisang.

26
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,959
Good for you.

27
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,560
I didn't expect that you would be my downfall.

28
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
Do not move.

29
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Don't move.

30
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,920
Claiming you don't know anything. What a great strategy.

31
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,880
No wonder that

32
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,560
you could hide behind the scene for so many years.

33
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,400
Sorry that you have been unfairly treated.

34
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,760
Brother Xichen, please believe me.

35
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,680
I really did see him reaching behind.

36
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,240
- You!!... - I told you not to move!

37
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,400
Lan Xichen... Lan Xichen.

38
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,620
I've told countless lies

39
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,360
and caused great harm throughout my life.

40
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,600
Just like you said,

41
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,280
I have done every foul deed.

42
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
But never have I ever

43
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,440
thought about do you harm.

44
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,440
Back when

45
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,200
Cloud Recesses was burning down,

46
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,280
and you were fleeing for your life,

47
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,000
who was the one saving you in dire straits?

48
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Who was it?

49
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,200
And then,

50
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,280
who was the one heartily helped

51
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,160
the Gusu Lans to rebuild Cloud Recesses?

52
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,400
All these years,

53
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,440
have I ever tried to hold down Lan clan of Gusu?

54
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,400
Haven't I been supportive every single time?

55
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,000
Besides suppressing your spiritual power this time,

56
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,040
have I ever do you wrong?

57
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,600
Have I ever tried to take credit and seek rewards from you?

58
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,560
Minshan

59
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,200
could reciprocate in kind

60
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,080
just because I remembered

61
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
his name back then.

62
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,800
Yet you,

63
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,160
Lan Xichen,

64
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Zewu Jun,

65
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,440
is just like Nie Mingjue, could not care for me.

66
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,920
Second Brother,

67
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:13,225
now you won't even give me a chance to live?

68
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,360
This place is gonna crush.

69
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,320
We must run.

70
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,400
Hurry.

71
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,680
Run.

72
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
Second Brother,

73
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,840
Stay, and die with me.

74
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,920
Lan Zhan, take Zewu Jun and go.

75
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,920
Nie Mingjue.

76
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,320
Do you think I will be afraid of you?

77
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,200
Brother Xichen.

78
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,920
Yao... What exactly was he trying to accomplish?

79
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,040
I thought I knew him well

80
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,280
and it turns out I didn't.

81
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,880
Before tonight,

82
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
I thought I was able to recomprehend him.

83
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,240
And again, I knew nothing.

84
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,320
Brother Xichen,

85
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,840
no one could fully understand one another.

86
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,440
Huaisang,

87
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
was he really about to attack me from the back?

88
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,960
I...

89
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,400
I seemed to have seen...

90
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,680
Is that right?

91
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,280
Huaisang, was it true?

92
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,200
Brother Xichen,

93
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,960
the way you are asking...

94
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,530
even I can't be certain now.

95
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,360
I don't know...

96
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,520
Fairy.

97
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,440
Hanguang Jun.

98
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,600
Senior Wei.

99
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,400
Senior Wei. Hanguang Jun. Fairy.

100
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
No sprinting.

101
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,920
No shouting.

102
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,800
Are you alright? Have you been hurt?

103
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,390
Sizhui, are you alright?

104
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,080
I am fine.

105
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,240
Clan Leader, are you alright?

106
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,120
Are you all right, Clan Leader?

107
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,040
- Are you alright? - I am fine.

108
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,760
It's okay.

109
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,360
Uncle.

110
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,520
I am glad you are okay.

111
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,680
Senior Wei,

112
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,560
what happened to your neck?

113
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,760
Your neck is bleeding.

114
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,200
Are you alright?

115
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,000
Fairy, wait outside.

116
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,720
What should we do?

117
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,520
It's okay. I am alright.

118
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,880
Senior Wei.

119
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,080
Man of virtue dresses properly.

120
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,720
Yao,

121
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,560
you shall not wear hat cocked to the side.

122
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,120
Jingyi,

123
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,440
where is Wei Wuxian?

124
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,680
They headed out.

125
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,960
Headed out?

126
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,880
Where did they go?

127
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
I told them that we brought Lil' Apple here.

128
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,680
Senior Wei grabbed Hanguang Jun and Senior Wen

129
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,000
and headed out to see Lil' Apple.

130
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,640
Right.

131
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,720
Lil' Apple?

132
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,120
Please take care of Fairy for me for a sec.

133
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,840
Don't chase them.

134
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,920
Uncle.

135
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
They are far gone.

136
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,360
So that's it? You are letting them leave just like that?

137
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,640
What else?

138
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,560
Invite them to stay for dinner?

139
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,280
Say thank you

140
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,760
and then I am sorry?

141
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
It was exactly because of the way you are acting

142
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,320
that they took off.

143
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,960
Uncle, you're such a pain in the neck.

144
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,880
Is this how you are supposed to speak to your elders?

145
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Are you asking to be disciplined?!

146
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,280
Let's go home, Jin Ling.

147
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,640
Let every one be back to the place where they belong.

148
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,760
Uncle,

149
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,880
was there something you wanna say to Wei Wuxian back then?

150
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,720
No, there isn't.

151
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,640
Bullshit.

152
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

153
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
You wanted to talk to Wei Wuxian.

154
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,120
But you didn't say a word.

155
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,960
Just now.

156
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,880
And also back in the temple.

157
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,840
There is nothing to say.

158
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,160
Bullshit. You had something to say.

159
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,080
Jiang Cheng, Senior Sister is burning up with a fever.

160
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,120
I will go and buy some herbal medicines for her.

161
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,160
You need to be the one looking after her.

162
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,520
So stay here.

163
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,440
Please do not leave. Okay?

164
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,000
Stop right there.

165
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,320
Sir, I would like five crepe pancakes.

166
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,440
Stop right there.

167
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,920
Let's go.

168
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,520
Take care.

169
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,640
I'm leaving Sis in your hands.

170
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,200
We got him. We got him.

171
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,200
Come and help.

172
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,000
Take care.

173
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,120
Let's go.

174
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,480
Uncle.

175
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,640
Wei Ying.

176
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,600
What's up?

177
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,800
There is something that I...

178
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,080
I...

179
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,400
didn't tell you.

180
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,440
What is it?

181
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,280
Damn it. Every time. These two are fast.

182
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,720
Hanguang Jun. Senior Wei.

183
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,840
Sizhui.

184
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,240
Why are you following us?

185
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,880
Aren't you afraid that old Master Lan calling you out?

186
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,240
Senior Wei,

187
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,760
I have something important

188
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,760
that I must ask you.

189
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,360
What is it?

190
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
I have been recollecting memories for the last couple days.

191
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,440
But I can't be certain.

192
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,480
So

193
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,720
I wanted to ask Hanguang Jun and Senior Wei.

194
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,560
What is it that you wanna know?

195
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
Self-proclaiming to be a great chef,

196
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,560
yet can only making eye-blinding dishes with awful taste.

197
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,480
Planted me in the ground with radish.

198
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,280
Told me that with watering

199
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,520
and sunbathing

200
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,240
I would grow faster.

201
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,120
And also fruit little buddies

202
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
and play with me.

203
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,360
Invited Hanguang Jun for a meal on your treat.

204
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,480
But ran without picking up the tab.

205
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,400
Hanguang Jun ended up paying for the food.

206
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,520
It might be because I was too little.

207
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,520
There are a lot of things that I couldn't fully remember.

208
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,840
But I can be certain that

209
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,800
Wen was my surname.

210
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,520
Wen was your surname?

211
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,640
Isn't Lan your surname?

212
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,920
Lan Sizhui.

213
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
Lan Yuan.

214
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,360
Lan Yuan.

215
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,960
Yuan.

216
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Senior Wei.

217
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,520
I...

218
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,440
I am Yuan.

219
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,000
Yuan.

220
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,160
Didn't Yuan pass away already?

221
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
He was left alone in Burial Mounds.

222
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,520
Lan Zhan,

223
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,400
was it you?

224
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
Yes.

225
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,840
And this is the thing I haven't told you.

226
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,040
Senior Wei.

227
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,240
I really miss you.

228
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,080
I really really miss you.

229
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
Silly boy,

230
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,200
why are you crying?

231
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,800
I didn't cry.

232
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,360
I was just feeling

233
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,560
really sad.

234
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,480
And yet thrilled at the same time.

235
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,320
I couldn't put it into words.

236
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,840
Then don't.

237
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,440
Right.

238
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,400
No need to say anything.

239
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,440
Damn, you little one is strong.

240
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,800
You are indeed a student of Hanguang Jun.

241
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,080
He is a student of yours as well.

242
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,880
No wonder he is such a handsome boy.

243
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,160
Senior Wei didn't teach me anything.

244
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,840
I... I did!

245
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,440
It was because you were so little

246
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,440
and you forgot.

247
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,680
Yea I seemed to recall.

248
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,640
I remember now.

249
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,400
You see.

250
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,320
I've mentored him.

251
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
For example, switching Portait of a Beauty into...

252
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,960
And when a pretty lady passes by...

253
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,880
Nonsense!

254
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,600
Nonsense.

255
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680
How come you are remembering this kind of things?

256
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,200
How could I possibly teach little kids these things?

257
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,480
You did. Uncle Wen can testify.

258
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,840
There is nothing for your Uncle Wen to testify.

259
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,640
Stop talking nonsense.

260
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,240
I am telling you little boy.

261
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,920
Lan Zhan, what did you teach him?

262
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,640
When Yuan was a little and with me, he was a good boy.

263
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
- What I said was true. - Stop talking nonsense.

264
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,840
- Do you see that pit? - It was true.

265
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,930
Hey, no matter how big you have become

266
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,800
I will still be able to plant you into that pit. Understand?

267
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,480
What are you laughing at, you dumb boy.

268
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,240
You...

269
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,840
Yuan.

270
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,840
You are too old for this.

271
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,760
Do you remember,

272
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,350
you used to grab Hanguang Jun's leg

273
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,400
when you were a lttle, just like this.

274
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,320
Let's go.

275
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,320
Childe,

276
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,560
We

277
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,000
are gonna head that way now.

278
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,080
To where?

279
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,680
Childe,

280
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,360
didn't you ask me before

281
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,920
when the dust settles,

282
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,920
what would I do next.

283
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,280
I discussed with Yuan.

284
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,880
I wanna go back to Qishan to take a look.

285
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,320
Build a cenotaph for our clan.

286
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,080
I will come with you.

287
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,760
That won't be necessary.

288
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,520
You don't wanna me to tag along?

289
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,440
You have done enough for us.

290
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,760
What are you gonna do next?

291
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,160
I will walk Yuan back to Cloud Recesses.

292
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,840
As for what to do in the future,

293
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,200
I will take my time and think carefully.

294
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
For the road ahead,

295
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,120
let me be on my own.

296
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,580
Yea, that may be for the best.

297
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,080
Lan Zhan, let's go.

298
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,760
Where should we go?

299
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,600
Let's get going.

300
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Lil' Apple.

301
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,720
Come.

302
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,520
Lan Zhan,

303
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,840
you...

304
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,720
Aren't you gonna come with me?

305
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,480
# Hearing the flute, feeling blue #

306
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,960
# Cloud is deep yet night is young #

307
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,800
# Right or wrong passes in flee #

308
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,200
# Wake up, only to find an empty dream #

309
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,040
# How to weigh the tears and laughs, mundane flashes are nothing #

310
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,400
# As hot as the blood, as cold as the blades #

311
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,080
# Somewhere in high hill or lake afar #

312
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,760
# The Qin was heard again long #

313
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,640
# The flute continues #

314
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,160
# Silk flowers submerged with moonlight cream #

315
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,120
# Warm a pot of vicissitudes to memorize the youth #

316
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,560
# Why sorrow since moon remains the same #

317
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,320
Lan Zhan,

318
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,880
to be honest,

319
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,680
it surprised me that

320
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,000
you would take over the role of Excellency.

321
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,960
We made a vow here.

322
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,480
May I, Wei Wuxian, curb the violent and assist the weak.

323
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,240
And have no regrets.

324
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,680
May I, Lan Wangji, curb the violent and assist the weak.

325
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,640
Have no regrets.

326
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,560
Lan Zhan,

327
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,420
you truly deserve your title, Hanguang Jun.

328
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,320
And you too, Wei Ying.

329
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,239
This is unexpected. Cloud Recesses has added

330
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,280
another thousand of rules.

331
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
Bro Nie,

332
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,199
no matter how many rules are added

333
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,280
there is one that matters the most.

334
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,320
Do you know what that is?

335
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,480
I have no clue.

336
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,560
Please advise, Bro Wei.

337
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,440
That would be

338
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,320
thou shall not befriend with the devil.

339
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,640
Bro Wei, Bro Wei,

340
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,280
you've got bulls.

341
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,120
No, no, no, I won't dare.

342
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,360
My must throw my hand in.

343
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,680
Your Excellency.

344
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,880
Clan Leader Nie,

345
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,840
I have one question

346
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,600
that I would love to get your opinion on.

347
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,360
Go on.

348
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Clan Leader Nie has put in so much effort and energy,

349
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,520
don't you wanna be the Excellency?

350
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,080
Bro Wei,

351
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,880
it was once said,

352
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,640
we can never get tired of these scenes

353
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,600
earth and sky, woods and fields,

354
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,480
lakes and rivers, the mountain and the sea.

355
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,840
As for me,

356
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,440
I am a sensible man.

357
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,320
The things I need to do, I won't shirk.

358
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,400
But for the things that aren't my business,

359
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,880
I won't meddle in.

360
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,080
I gotta get going.

361
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,800
Aren't you gonna ask him?

362
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,040
Ask him what?

363
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,440
Ask him who let Mo Xuanyu out?

364
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,800
Who released the blade spirit?

365
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,760
Who found Sisi and Bicao?

366
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,000
And who wrote that anonymous letter?

367
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,520
But these questions bear no significance anymore.

368
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,760
Do they?

369
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,560
I will head that way.

370
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,680
I will head this way.

371
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,760
Have you decided

372
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,240
where are you gonna go?

373
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,800
It's a big world that we live in.

374
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,560
I will wander with my fine wine and a ride,

375
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,040
and make it my home.

376
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,360
Lan Zhan,

377
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,760
I will get going.

378
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,840
Lil' Apple,

379
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,240
let's go.

380
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,680
As long as the sea is bound to wash up on the sand,

381
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,560
and stars are above you, we will meet again.

382
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,840
Lan Zhan,

383
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,520
next time we see each other,

384
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,760
you better have a name for this song.

385
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,480
Way ahead of you.

386
00:40:29,475 --> 00:40:34,040
# Hearing the flute, feeling blue #

387
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,590
# Cloud is deep yet night is young #

388
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,530
# Right or wrong passes in flee #

389
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:49,870
# Wake up, only to find an empty dream #

390
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:55,760
# How to weigh the tears and laughs, mundane flashes are nothing #

391
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,160
# As hot as the blood, as cold as the blades #

392
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,560
# Somewhere in high hill or lake afar #

393
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,920
Wei Ying.

394
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,420
# The flute continues #

395
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:10,850
# Silk flowers submerged with moonlight cream #

396
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:16,820
# Warm a pot of vicissitudes to memorize the youth #

397
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,360
# Why sorrow since moon remains the same #

398
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:27,670
# Why not live at will and go for great adventures #

399
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,410
# Echos a melody from afar #

400
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:38,210
# Warm a pot of vicissitudes to memorize the youth #

401
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,050
# Why sorrow since moon remains the same #

402
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:49,050
# Why not live at will and go for great adventures #

403
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:54,790
# Echos a melody from afar #

404
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,110
Thanks for the author Mo Xiang Tong Chou for bring the charaters into life.

405
00:42:04,132 --> 00:42:05,870
May their wishes come true thereafter.

406
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,090
Till next time.

407
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,094
The End
