00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 40

3
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
You have puzzled me.

4
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,000
You Lan Clan of Gusu is an influential gentry family after all.

5
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,400
What Wei Wuxian did back then

6
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,720
is known to us all.

7
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,960
How can you take a bizarre stance

8
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,280
when it comes to your opinions?

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,160
Do you want to justify Wei Ying's behavior?

10
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,240
I didn't want to justify his behavior.

11
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,240
I just suggest

12
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,080
before knowing context of the matter,

13
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,280
we should not pass judgment randomly.

14
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,920
That year when he was attacked in Qiongqi Road

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
and purged Nevernight,

16
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,600
how many cultivators died because of him,

17
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,360
Wen Ning and Stygian Tiger Amulet?

18
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
This is an incontrovertible fact.

19
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,920
Can't we pass judgment now?

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,600
He instigated Wen Ning to kill my father

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,120
and got mother killed.

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,440
I will never forget that feud.

23
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,760
How can you justify his behavior?

24
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,000
Why are you

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,560
arguing over this?

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
Let's not talk about it, shall we?

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,440
We were in middle of dining and the dishes are half-warmed.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
Right. There is nothing worthy of arguing.

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,520
Sizhui just didn't pay attention.

30
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,760
He just talked causally without deep consideration.

31
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,440
Just eat your dinner, Young Mistress Jin.

32
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,400
Everyone is hungry.

33
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,360
Right.

34
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,760
We just got out of that Coffin Town.

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,680
We are somewhat Damon and Pythias anyway.

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,760
You will go back to Jinlintai tomorrow.

37
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,040
We can't

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,600
quarrel all the time here.

39
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,240
Sorry.

40
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,000
I didn't think my speech over.

41
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,720
Please sit down, Childe Jin.

42
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,040
If we continue to quarrel

43
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,440
and attract Hanguang Jun's attention...

44
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,240
What do you need, sir?

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,880
Liquor.

46
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,920
Sure. Give a second please.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,840
Sizhui.

48
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,960
Go. Go. Go.

49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,440
Sir, your liquor.

50
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,760
Eat.

51
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,160
Did I see wrong just now?

52
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,320
What?

53
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,880
It was liquor that Hanguang Jun was holding.

54
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,120
Childe.

55
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,880
Wen Ning.

56
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
That was...

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
son of Lady Jiang?

58
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,960
Wei Ying.

59
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,440
Wei Ying.

60
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,360
You are here.

61
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,640
Liquor?

62
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,480
Good liquor.

63
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,000
Lan Zhan,

64
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,680
wanna drink with me?

65
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,720
My brother has recognized you.

66
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,680
Jiang Cheng also knows who you are.

67
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,240
So what they do?

68
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,000
So I am really curious.

69
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
How did you recognize me?

70
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
I am also curious.

71
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,080
Why do you have such a poor memory?

72
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,160
I also wish I had a poor memory.

73
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,320
Next month,

74
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,280
accompany me to Jinlintai.

75
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,240
Why?

76
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Only the head is missing.

77
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,840
So you think

78
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,520
the head of Red Blade Master is hid near him.

79
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,320
If the head of Red Blade Master

80
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,920
is in Jinlintai,

81
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
it confirms our speculation.

82
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,040
It's just Zewu Jun...

83
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,560
Zewu Jun.

84
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,440
Childe Wei has a good point.

85
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,880
It matters a lot.

86
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,960
So Childe Wei, please go to Jinlintai with Wangji.

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
If you can find evidences,

88
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,120
I certainly will treat it based on justice.

89
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,200
Lan clan of Gusu enter please.

90
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,080
= Swearing to be brothers =

91
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,000
= Ambush =

92
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,000
= Benevolence and authority =

93
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,200
Let's go.

94
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,440
Zewu Jun.

95
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,920
Clan Leader Jiang.

96
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Hanguang Jun.

97
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,640
I never saw you at the Cultivation Conference

98
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,800
in Jinlintai before.

99
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,840
Why are you interested this time?

100
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,600
Zewu Jun,

101
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,160
you never took freeloaders in the past visit.

102
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,040
What is going on this time?

103
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,400
Once in a blue moon.

104
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,600
Who is this famous and talented cultivator?

105
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,160
Could you please introduce him to me?

106
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
= Pageant Hall =

107
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,040
Second brother.

108
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,320
Second brother.

109
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,000
Yao.

110
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,960
Why don't you tell me in advance

111
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,080
that Wangji is also coming?

112
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,840
Uncle.

113
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,720
You still remember to call me uncle?

114
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,520
Clan Leader Jiang.

115
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,440
Ling has known he was wrong.

116
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,200
These days he was so afraid of being punished by you

117
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,640
that he could barely have meals

118
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,720
and sleep well.

119
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,680
Children are naughty.

120
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,880
You are the one who love him dearest.

121
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,280
Please don't be angry with him.

122
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,040
Yes. Yes. Yes.

123
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,480
Uncle Jin can testify for me.

124
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,800
These days I had a poor appetite.

125
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
Poor appetite? But you look very well.

126
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,280
You must have eaten not less than normal time.

127
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,240
Why are you here?

128
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,080
I... I come to eat free meal.

129
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,280
How dare you come here?

130
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,760
Didn't I warn...

131
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,320
That's fine.

132
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
He is a guest since he is here.

133
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,240
One thing I am sure about Jinlintai is

134
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,600
that our food will satiate you.

135
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,520
Second brother,

136
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,760
you go inside and sit please.

137
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,080
I'll go check elsewhere

138
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,800
and arrange it for you by the way.

139
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,200
Don't bother.

140
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,440
It doesn't bother me.

141
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,520
Since you are in my place, be my guest please.

142
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,720
Please.

143
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,600
It's him.

144
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,280
I heard that he has been thrown out.

145
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,120
Right.

146
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Why was he still allowed in?

147
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,520
He is so shameless.

148
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,320
Thanks a lot.

149
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,680
Hanguang Jun.

150
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,840
Hanguang Jun.

151
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,080
What?

152
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
It seems everyone here knows Mo Xuanyu.

153
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,280
If they ask me some strange questions

154
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,200
which I can't answer,

155
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll have to play the fool.

156
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,600
Suit yourself.

157
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,160
I am just afraid of losing your face.

158
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,120
As long as you don't provoke others.

159
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,200
= Qin Su =

160
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,320
Tomorrow the three-day Cultivation Conference

161
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,720
will start officially.

162
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,880
Today the banquet is held in Pageant Hall.

163
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,480
I hope everyone may enjoy it.

164
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,720
Let's drink until drunk.

165
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,520
I propose a toast to all of you.

166
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
We propose a toast to you.

167
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Third brother.

168
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,560
Huaisang, what happened?

169
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,520
Talk slowly.

170
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,880
Third brother.

171
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,880
What should I do?

172
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,840
You have to help me.

173
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,320
Last time. You have to help me the last time.

174
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,240
Last time haven't I

175
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,280
helped you to solve

176
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,680
your problem?

177
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,960
But new problems appear.

178
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,160
If you don't help me,

179
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
I will commit a suicide before you.

180
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,200
Su, why don't you go back first?

181
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,800
Well... Huaisang,

182
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,240
let's find a place to sit and talk.

183
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,320
Third brother.

184
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,640
What's wrong?

185
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,120
What should I do, third brother, second brother?

186
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
Second brother.

187
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,520
Second brother.

188
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
- What should I do, second brother? - Huaisang.

189
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,360
Come on. Let's go.

190
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
Please help me.

191
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
Hanguang Jun.

192
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,360
If we entertain ill today,

193
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,800
please excuse us.

194
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,160
And I shall leave you to yourself.

195
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,640
People from Jin clan of Lanling

196
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
look at me in a strange way.

197
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,920
What on earth did Mo Xuanyu do?

198
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,880
Did he court someone nakedly in public?

199
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,680
But that doesn't sound too bad to me.

200
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,280
How about this, Lan Zhan.

201
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,440
I'll find a person for some information.

202
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,760
Please watch out for Jiang Cheng for me.

203
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
It's the best if he doesn't come after me.

204
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,200
But if he does,

205
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,040
cover for me.

206
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,640
Don't go far.

207
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,240
I know.

208
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
If I go far, we meet each other tonight.

209
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,760
Remember your identity.

210
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,920
Wait for me.

211
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,440
How did you get in?

212
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,720
I...

213
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,720
I thought I saw wrong.

214
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,160
It's him indeed.

215
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,040
I...

216
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,640
who else can it be besides you?

217
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,680
Mo Xuanyu.

218
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
How could you be so shameless to come back?

219
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,600
Jin Chan,

220
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,480
= Jin Chan from Jin clan of Lanling =

221
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,400
what are you doing here?
= Jin Chan from Jin clan of Lanling =

222
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,440
what are you doing here?

223
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,840
It's none of your business.

224
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,760
Why is it your business?

225
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,440
What I'll do doesn't concern you.

226
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,520
Don't be reckless.

227
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,320
What is "reckless"?

228
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,800
Is there a problem

229
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,600
if I lecture one of our misbehaving disciple?

230
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,480
Wake up.

231
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,360
He has long been swept out like rubbish.

232
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,160
So he is not our disciple at all.

233
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,080
So what?

234
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,400
"So what"?

235
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,480
Don't you know

236
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,040
whom he come with?

237
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,680
If you want to lecture him,

238
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
you have to ask Hanguang Jun for permission.

239
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,320
Jin Ling,

240
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,960
didn't you dislike him very much before?

241
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,560
Why have you changed your attitude now?

242
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Cut the crap.

243
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,560
It's none of your business whether I dislike him or not.

244
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,440
This guy

245
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,400
was shameless so that he pestered Lianfang Zun's wife.

246
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,400
Who are you to speak for him?

247
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,440
Mo Xuanyu. Mo Xuanyu.

248
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
You can pester anyone.

249
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,800
Why did you pester Jin Guangyao's wife?

250
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,160
Did you wish for death?

251
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,800
Stop your nonsense. Looking for a fight?

252
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
Let's fight then. Why should I be afraid of you?

253
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,880
You want to call the dog for help again.

254
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,360
I won't summon Fairy this time.

255
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,280
Even if I don't call Fairy here,

256
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,920
I can beat all of you down.

257
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,080
Why are you still standing here?

258
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,480
What are you doing? You want to die?

259
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,120
Have you learned it?

260
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,880
What?

261
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,880
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

262
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,720
How about that? Do you want to continue?

263
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,640
No. No.

264
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
Jin Ling, expect my revenge!

265
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,360
You are so happy.

266
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,080
First time to win a fight?

267
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,360
I always win in a one-on-one fight.

268
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,520
But Jin Chan

269
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,040
are with a bunch of helpers all the time.

270
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,720
He is really shameless.

271
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,360
Who taught you that?

272
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Han...Hanguang Jun did.

273
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,560
Hanguang Jun taught you that?

274
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,400
Of course he did.

275
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,080
Tell you what,

276
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
this is the first time you use that move.

277
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,400
If you use it for more times,

278
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,680
they will find a way to counter you.

279
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,040
It won't be this easy in that case.

280
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,160
What do you think?

281
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,160
Do you want to learn more from me?

282
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,280
What kind of person are you?

283
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,680
My uncle Jin always calms me down.

284
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,320
How should you incite me?

285
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,320
Calm you down? What does he say?

286
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,760
Tells you not to get into a fight

287
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,840
and get along well with others?

288
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,400
More or less.

289
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,120
I tell you, Jin Ling,

290
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,280
don't listen to him.

291
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,400
When you grow up,

292
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
you will find that you want to beat more people.

293
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,520
But at that time,

294
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,800
you'll have to

295
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,480
get along well with those people.

296
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,640
So when you are still young,

297
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,120
beat those who you want to beat.

298
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,240
Really?

299
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,640
Sure.

300
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
At your age,

301
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,560
without several decent fights,

302
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,560
your life is not complete.

303
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,360
What are you talking about?

304
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,000
My uncle Jin has my best interests in his heart.

305
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,480
Right. Right. Right.

306
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,000
By the way,

307
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,440
what are you doing in backyard?

308
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,400
Do you still have the lewd intent?

309
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,320
To be honest,

310
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,160
please don't tell others.

311
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,160
Actually, I have fallen in love with someone else.

312
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,880
In those months when I left,

313
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,000
I have deeply understood that Mrs. Jin

314
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,920
is not my type.

315
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
Besides she is not suitable for me.

316
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,160
So this time

317
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,400
I come here specifically for apologizing to her.

318
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,600
Stop mumbling.

319
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,880
If you promise me not to shout, I will let you go.

320
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,200
You...

321
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
are you really Mo Xuanyu?

322
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,000
Didn't you see my face?

323
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,520
Mo Xuanyu is being crazy all the time.

324
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,160
Everyone says he is disfigured

325
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,560
and covers his face all the time.

326
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,160
He either wears a mask or is caked with white powder.

327
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,240
Who remembers his face?

328
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,680
You...

329
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,360
forget about it.

330
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,960
I don't care who you are.

331
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,440
Since you have worn the mask,

332
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,480
don't turn up here again

333
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,720
in case that my uncle Jin finds and misunderstands you.

334
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
I count to three.

335
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,840
If you don't leave,

336
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,160
I will call Fairy.

337
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,440
Three.

338
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Two.

339
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,000
You stupid kid.

340
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,520
In middle of a nice talk, why call a dog?

341
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,800
= Fangchen Pavilion =

342
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,320
Lan Zhan.

343
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,080
Tasty.

344
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,120
Lan Zhan,

345
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,560
I am a little drunk.

346
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:52,920
Don't kid me.

347
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,800
Be careful when you go.

348
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
= Fragrance Hall =

349
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,480
What happened?

350
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,160
Tonight during the banquet, she looked distinctly well.

351
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,880
Su.

352
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
What are you doing?

353
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,320
What are you holding?

354
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,560
Su,

355
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,760
you don't look well.

356
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,480
What's wrong?

357
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,840
I met a person.

358
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,560
She told me something

359
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,680
and gave me a letter.

360
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,120
Who?

361
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,720
You buy

362
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,000
everything she told you?

363
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,600
She will never lie to me.

364
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,680
Never.

365
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,200
What is written in this letter...

366
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,200
is it true?

367
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
It's not true.

368
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,080
It is made up to set me up.

369
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,400
You lie to me.

370
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
Now you still want to lie to me.

371
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,320
Su.

372
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,680
You don't believe me when I tell the truth.

373
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,440
I don't know what to do.

374
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
God!

375
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,920
God!

376
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,080
You are really...

377
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,040
You are really horrible.

378
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,720
How could you?

379
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,760
How could you?

380
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,200
What on earth is written on the letter?

381
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,840
Jin Guangyao killed Red Blade Master

382
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,480
or it is about Mo Xuanyu?

383
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,440
No.

384
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,200
Those can't make Mrs. Jin

385
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,840
feel so disgusting that she throws up.

386
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,680
Su,

387
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,120
we are husband and wife for many years

388
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,640
and live together harmoniously,

389
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,040
respecting each other like guests.

390
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,440
As a husband,

391
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,480
I think I have treated you well.

392
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,800
Your acting like this

393
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,360
makes me heart-broken.

394
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,120
You have been treating me well.

395
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,160
But I

396
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,640
would rather never know you.

397
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,720
No wonder

398
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,400
after that

399
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,640
you never...

400
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,840
Instead of doing such a disgusting thing,

401
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,080
I prefer that you just kill me.

402
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,840
Su,

403
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,960
before you know it,

404
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,560
we've been leading a happy life.

405
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,600
In fact, it's nothing.

406
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,800
It will not affect you in the essence.

407
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,440
It's just physiological.

408
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,080
Tell me the truth.

409
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,600
Song...

410
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,040
How did Song die?

411
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,560
Song,

412
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,320
haven't you already known it?

413
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,320
Our son was killed by others.

414
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,080
And I have killed those who killed him

415
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,360
and revenged for him.

416
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,960
Why do you mention him suddenly?

417
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,600
I know.

418
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,160
But now I suspect

419
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,440
everything I know is fake.

420
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,440
Su.

421
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,080
What are you thinking about?

422
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,120
Song was my son.

423
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,000
What do you think I would do to him?

424
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,040
You would rather believe a cowardly and hidden person

425
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,200
and a letter without a reliable source,

426
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,920
than believe me?

427
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,320
It is just because he was your son

428
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,760
that makes me scared.

429
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,640
What do you suppose I think what you would do?

430
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,200
You even did things like that,

431
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,200
then what else you wouldn't do?

432
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,240
Don't be lost in various conjectures.

433
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
You tell me

434
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,640
who did you meet today?

435
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,760
Who gave you the letter?

436
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:49,480
You...

437
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,360
what do you want to do?

438
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,320
Since that person has told you,

439
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,840
he could also tell others.

440
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,440
One letter could be forged,

441
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,800
then the second, the third, infinite letters could be forged.

442
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
What's your plan?

443
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,960
Allow her to tell everyone?

444
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,120
Su.

445
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,840
I beg you,

446
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,360
for the sake of whatever,

447
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,159
please tell me

448
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,400
who

449
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,239
gave you the letter?

450
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,560
This person reveals Jin Guangyao's secrets to Qin Su.

451
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,280
He must be determined to utterly discredited Jin Guangyao.

452
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,639
But whether this person is

453
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,800
the one who directed us

454
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,920
to the corpse of Red Blade Master?

455
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,360
Su.

456
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,600
You are not a human.

457
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,880
You are a lunatic.

458
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,719
Su.

459
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,520
I really didn't have choice at that time.

460
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,920
Originally I wanted to conceal it for your whole life

461
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,800
without your knowing.

462
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,440
But now the person who told you all

463
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,600
has destroyed everything.

464
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,760
You think I am dirty

465
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,880
and disgusting.

466
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,880
It doesn't matter.

467
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,680
But if it is spread around,

468
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,600
since you are my wife,

469
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
what will others think of you?

470
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,360
Stop talking. Stop reminding me.

471
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,960
I prefer to not get involved with you.

472
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,720
I know no matter what I say,

473
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,160
you will not believe me.

474
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,720
But at that time I was sincere to you.

475
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,680
I always remember

476
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,120
you have never badmouthed

477
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,880
about my family background.

478
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,960
For my life I will appreciate you,

479
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,600
respect you,

480
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,480
cherish you,

481
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,440
and love you.

482
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,400
But you have to know

483
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,520
even if they hadn't harmed Song,

484
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,440
Song had to die.

485
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,760
He had to die.

486
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,160
If he should have grown up, you and me...

487
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,960
So

488
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,840
who is the one who puts us in such a situation?

489
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,680
To get the position,

490
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,880
what else you wouldn't do?

491
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,920
Su.

492
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,960
You really don't want to tell me?

493
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,880
I tell you

494
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,360
so that you continue to kill the informer?

495
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,200
Su.

496
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,240
It seems that you are too sick and muddled.

497
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,720
Father-in-law is out traveling and cultivating.

498
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,160
I will send you out for a while too.

499
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,360
Go enjoy the happiness of a family reunion with your father.

500
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,760
Let's deal with it quickly.

501
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,840
There are a lot of guests out there.

502
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,800
And the Cultivation Conference tomorrow.

503
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,440
With everything happening,

504
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,360
you still care about your guests?

505
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,600
Don't be afraid.

506
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,520
You are in a bad condition

507
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,280
which is improper for walking around.

508
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
There are too many people these days.

509
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,880
You should have a rest here.

510
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,720
As soon as you tell me who she is,

511
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,520
you can be back.

512
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,200
If you are willing to tell me, nod.

513
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,760
I haven't constrained all your regulating bodily functions.

514
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,520
You can still nod.

00:39:59,320 --> 00:39:59,960
Su.

519
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,760
I go take a look there,

520
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,600
and will be back for you later.

521
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,520
It was you that stared at me just now?

522
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,000
It's been so many years.

523
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,920
Why can't you set me free?

524
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,200
Big brother.

525
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,520
The blueprint of Stygian Tiger Amulet.

526
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,640
Long time no see.

527
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,360
Red Blade Master.

528
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,240
Empathy?
