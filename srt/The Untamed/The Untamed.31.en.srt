1
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 31

3
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,200
Brother Xian bullies me.

4
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,000
Yuan.

5
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,720
Yuan.

6
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,800
These lotus seeds are not edible.

7
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,120
Lotus seeds are not edible?

8
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not "lotus seeds are not edible".

9
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,480
It's "these lotus seeds are not edible".

10
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,120
These lotus seeds

11
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,680
grow in the soil of Burial Mounds.

12
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,240
It's the best thing to shield people from the evil.

13
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,080
So, come, give me your hands.

14
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,160
You can carry it with you.

15
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
But you can never eat them.

16
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,560
Do you understand?

17
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,240
Atta boy.

18
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,520
Go play with grandma.

19
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,920
Yuan, go play.

20
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,280
What is this?

21
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,880
An invitation letter from a disciple of Jin clan.

22
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
I got it when I went downhill.

23
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,760
There is no word on it.

24
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,000
= Chlide Jin and Lady Jiang's child will have a first-month celebration and Wei is invited. =

25
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,890
= From Lan Wangji =

26
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,880
Sister, what's up? Is there something wrong?

27
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,720
Wei Wuxian.

28
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,640
What's wrong?

29
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,800
You can go meet your senior sister.

30
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
= Lingbao Pavilion =

31
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,920
Jin clan

32
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,880
has come across a series of happy events.

33
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
Little Chlide Jin is about one month old.

34
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,960
All Jin clan are over the moon.

35
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,200
I hear

36
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,120
His excellency wants to set up lookouts around the land.

37
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,520
Lookouts?

38
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,280
Recently several clans are arguing over this.

39
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,280
Is there an agreement?

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,240
What is to argue over?

41
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,680
I think the lookout is a great idea.

42
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,680
On one hand,

43
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,880
it can monitor situations from place to place.

44
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,400
On the other hand, it passes messages immediately.

45
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,800
I don't know what they are arguing about.

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,240
I don't think so.

47
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,040
What if...

48
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,120
it would become another Wen's Supervisory Office?

49
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
Are the two the same?

50
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,560
Jin clan is only in charge of building lookouts.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
They are managed by all clans.

52
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,000
Be that as it may,

53
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,280
managing it jointly will

54
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,680
finally turn into managing it alone by Jin clan of Lanling.

55
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,120
I hear the idea was proposed by Jin Guangyao.

56
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,200
Even if Red Blade Master disagree with building lookouts,

57
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,240
he is supposed to attend

58
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,760
first-month celebration of Jin Zixuan's son.

59
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,440
This first-month celebration

60
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,880
is really spectacular and influential.

61
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,400
All the clans are coming.

62
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Did you hear about it?

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I heard that.

64
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,080
I've also attended his first week celebration.

65
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
That child

66
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,600
exactly grasped his father's Suihua

67
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
among a bunch of various swords,

68
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,360
which thrilled his parents.

69
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,240
At that time, people were saying

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,920
the child

71
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,400
must be an incredible sword immortal in the future.

72
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,480
Jin clan of Lanling is indeed rich.

73
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,040
The first week celebration of an infant

74
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,280
is such a grand occasion.

75
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,760
Don't you see who his parents are?

76
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,680
They had to take it seriously.

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,280
Let alone Young Mrs. Jin's husband, who is unwilling to arrange it casually,

78
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
her mother-in-law and brother

79
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,320
won't be satisfied if it is less grand a bit.

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,240
I'm afraid that this first-month celebration

81
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,600
will be more extravagant.

82
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,400
That's right.

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Young Mrs. Jin is so lucky.

84
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,200
She must have given up her ascension in her previous life

85
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
to deserve such fortune this life.

86
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,440
It seems that among all sorts of fortunes,

87
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,600
having a rich family is the best.

88
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,120
Young Mrs. Jin herself is not quite impressive though.

89
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,840
Do you know that

90
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,960
it is said a special person is invited to this first-month celebration.

91
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,040
-Who? - Who?

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,840
Wei Wuxian.

93
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,040
Wei Wuxian.

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
How could it be him?

95
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,800
Wei Wuxian.

96
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,440
I don't know what on earth

97
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
are Jin clan thinking about?

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,560
What Wei Wuxian did in Qiongqi Road...

99
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,880
do they all forget it?

100
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Tell me about it.

101
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
How could Jin clan

102
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,880
invite such a person

103
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,960
in Jin Ling's first month celebration?

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,000
Who dare attend it?

105
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,160
I won't attend it anyway.

106
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,480
I don't go, either. You can go if you like.

107
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,840
Excuse me,

108
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,880
I want this.

109
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,000
Right.

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,000
He...

111
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,560
is a total bane.

112
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,840
Yes.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,760
It is unknown what disaster is going to happen.

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,320
Loquats!

115
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,360
Fresh loquats!

116
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,280
Childe, have you bought it?

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,000
So beautiful!

118
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,720
I tell you,

119
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,720
these little pretty trinkets aren't cheap.

120
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,160
The money your sister gave me

121
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,520
has been used up anyway.

122
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,920
We can expect scolding when back.

123
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,520
No. No.

124
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,080
Childe used the money to buy gifts for Lady Jiang's child.

125
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,200
Sister won't blame you for that.

126
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,440
It's you who said it.

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
If she scolds me after we are back,

128
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,880
could you shield me from her?

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,080
Little Jin Ling

130
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,880
will definitely like the little gift very much.

131
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,040
I tell you,

132
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,440
this is not the gift I give him.

133
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,280
It's only a small accessory.

134
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,240
Besides, in a place like Lingbao Pavilion,

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,480
except meretricious things,

136
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,960
what else do they have ?

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Childe, what gift did you prepare then?

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,480
What a powerful rosary.

139
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,160
Childe,

140
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,080
this is what you've working on

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,320
for over half a month in Demon-subdue Palace

142
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,080
day and night?

143
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,000
Right.

144
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,480
As long as my nephew put on this,

145
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,360
low-level hobgoblins, demons, ghosts and monsters

146
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,160
can never get close to him.

147
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,440
Don't touch it.

148
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,640
I assume if you touch it, you'll get hurt too.

149
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,720
I can feel that.

150
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,920
But childe,

151
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,680
now that you will attend

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
first-month celebration of Childe Jin Ling,

153
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,560
when you see the husband of Lady Jiang,

154
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,000
please control your emotions

155
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,720
and don't be in conflict with him.

156
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't worry.

157
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
I know my place.

158
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,680
Since the peacock has invited me,

159
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,280
I will not speak ill of him for a year.

160
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,920
When I saw the invitation from Jin clan of Lanling,

161
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,760
I thought there were tricks.

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Now it seems I got them wrong.

163
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,600
In fact, Childe Jin is a good man.

164
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,800
What's more, there is Second Childe Lan.

165
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,720
I never thought we would be back here.

166
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,520
So did I.

167
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
Anything strange?

168
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,720
No. But it's too quiet.

169
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,120
It is too quiet.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,520
Go.

171
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,520
Who are you?

172
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,120
Wei Wuxian,

173
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,400
I warn you!

174
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,880
Lift the evil spell on me at once!

175
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,400
Then I can pretend that nothing happened

176
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,560
and forgive your past misdeeds.

177
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,080
What evil spell?

178
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,040
Aren't you still pretending?

179
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,160
Good.

180
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,400
Then I will let you see

181
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,760
what on earth the evil spell is.

182
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,720
Hundred Holes curse?

183
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,480
Yes,

184
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
exactly the Hundred Holes curse.

185
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,120
You were cast on Hundred Holes.

186
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,960
Why are you coming for me?

187
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,320
It's none of my business.

188
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,080
Except you,

189
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,560
who else is a master of wicked tricks,

190
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,840
who else will it be to cast malicious spell

191
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,720
on me?

192
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,360
I don't even remember who you are.

193
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,640
Why should I bother to cast an evil spell on you?

194
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,720
Besides I never use those insidious tricks.

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
If I want to kill a person,

196
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,960
I will tell the world

197
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,000
that this man dies in my hands.

198
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,000
Furthermore, if I really want you to die,

199
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,760
you will get a a thousand times more miserable ending.

200
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,280
Aren't you arrogant?

201
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,280
What?

202
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,120
Deny it after you did it?

203
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,360
It's not me.

204
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,760
Why would I admit it?

205
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,680
I am courteous before the use of force.

206
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,760
Since you are not willing to correct your mistake,

207
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,760
I will not let you go easily.

208
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,080
What do you want to do?

209
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,040
Since you don't want to untie evil spell on me,

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,400
I'll have to kill you.

211
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,560
Kill me?

212
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Can you?

213
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,240
Can they?

214
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,560
Now that you want to die,

215
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,120
I am not the one to blame.

216
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,000
Shoot.

217
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
Wei Wuxian,

218
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,280
this is the price for your arrogance.

219
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,200
Without a sword,

220
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,120
I'll see what you can do.

221
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,080
Give it back.

222
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,840
This is the gift you give the child?

223
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,960
Do you really think

224
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,680
you can attend his first month celebration?

225
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,200
Stop, both of you.

226
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,960
Zixuan, what are you doing here?

227
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,480
What do you say?

228
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,760
Where is Jin Guangyao?

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,960
He's in Jinlintai.

230
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,880
If it's not Yao who told me something was wrong,

231
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,920
you really wanted to

232
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,320
mess it up and hide it back from everyone.

233
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,960
You were cast on Hundred Holes curse.

234
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,560
Why do you hide it away from me

235
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
and do something like this furtively?

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,640
Zixuan,

237
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,720
please hide it from my sister-in-law for a moment.

238
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,880
After I get the spell lifted on me,

239
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,880
I will make an official apology to you.

240
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,920
There are still rooms for common ground.

241
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,760
Both of you, stop it.

242
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,520
How can you reach a common ground under this circumstance?

243
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't you see the things on me?

244
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,320
I have heard it from Yao.

245
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,720
Since you have heard it from him,

246
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,720
you should understand I can't wait.

247
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,440
Just because he is the junior brother of sister-in-law?

248
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,760
So for sister-in-law,

249
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,560
you can ignore the life of your brother?

250
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,680
You certainly know I am not that kind of person.

251
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,440
Besides,

252
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
Hundred Holes curse on you

253
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,000
is not necessarily cast by him.

254
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,359
Why are you so anxious?

255
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,000
Wei Wuxian, after all,

256
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,800
was invited by me to attend kid's first month celebration.

257
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,599
You behave like this.

258
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
What place do you put me into?

259
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,760
What place do you put my wife into?

260
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,760
It's the best that he can't attend.

261
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,040
He, Wei Wuxian, is nothing but trash.

262
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,440
Who is he to attend our family banquet?

263
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,280
Those who touch him get themselves with dirt water.

264
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,160
Zixuan, today you invite him here.

265
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,720
Aren't you afraid of your families

266
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,280
having an indelible stain the whole life

267
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,360
from now on?

268
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,360
Shut up.

269
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,920
Wei Wuxian, that's enough!

270
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,440
You stop Wen Ning

271
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,840
from being crazy first.

272
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,800
Don't aggravate the situation.

273
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,080
Why don't you let them stop first?

274
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,640
At this time,

275
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,240
why are you being so tough?

276
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,920
Both of you, cool down.

277
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,240
Follow me to Jinlintai.

278
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,440
Justify yourself clearly and argue.

279
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
As long as you didn't do that,

280
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,440
you'll be OK.

281
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,760
Stop?

282
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,080
As soon as I tell Wen Ning to stop,

283
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,440
I will be shot by thousands of arrows and die with a broken body.

284
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,240
How can I argue with you in Jinlintai then?

285
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,600
Never.

286
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,800
Never?

287
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,160
How can you assure that?

288
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,240
Jin Zixuan.

289
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,240
I have a question.

290
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,680
When you invite me,

291
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,360
you really don't know their killing plan against me?

292
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,840
You...

293
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,360
Wei Wuxian, are you crazy?

294
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,440
Jin Zixuan,

295
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
get out of my way.

296
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,160
I won't touch you.

297
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,880
But you have to do the same.

298
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,880
Jin Zixuan.

299
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,760
I warn you.

300
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,800
Don't come any closer.

301
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,520
Wei Wuxian,

302
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,520
why can't you give up your ego for once?

303
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,920
Don't you know

304
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,760
Li is...

305
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,160
Li... she...

306
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,360
is still

307
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,280
waiting for you to attend

308
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,920
kid's first-month...

309
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Shoot.

310
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,840
Shoot.

311
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,360
Childe Jin is killed by Wen Ning.

312
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,520
Go, go.

313
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,600
Go report to Clan Leader.

314
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Childe Jin...

315
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,080
Childe Jin is killed by Wen Ning.

316
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,960
Childe Jin.

317
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,800
Good boy.

318
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,200
Why haven't they arrived yet?

319
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
They are supposed to be back earlier.

320
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,880
Maybe they got stuck by something on the way.

321
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,200
Don't be anxious.

322
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,640
Let's wait.

323
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,880
Where is Jin Guangyao?

324
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,040
Jin Guangyao?

325
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,160
How should I know?

326
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,480
Maybe he arranges some myrmidons to cancel the banquet.

327
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,520
Why are you asking about him?

328
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,800
Has Wei Ying arrived?

329
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,840
No.

330
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Hanguang Jun,

331
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,960
what happened?

332
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:26,960
Chlide Jin,

333
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,800
Hanguang Jun,

334
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,360
why did disciples of Lan clan my brother brought here

335
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,840
follow Jin Zixun to leave Jinlintai?

336
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,760
Where did they go?

337
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,400
Do you know that?

338
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,560
Hanguang Jun,

339
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,040
calm down.

340
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,440
Zixun did head to Qiongqi Road.

341
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,360
But it hasn't gone very far.

342
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,600
Zixuan has rushed there too.

343
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,200
Presumably...

344
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,000
Terrible!

345
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,200
Terrible!

346
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,360
Lianfang Zun!

347
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,240
What happened?

348
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,960
Lian... Lianfang Zun...

349
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,640
Ghost general...ghost general killed people.

350
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,720
What?

351
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,880
Say it clearly.

352
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,600
Heir Clan Leader...

353
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,280
Heir Clan Leader is killed by ghost general.

354
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,320
Sister.

355
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,040
Sister.

356
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,320
You can't control it.

357
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,120
We've been waiting for this day...

358
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,960
We've been waiting for this day for too long.

359
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,960
You can't control it.

360
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,400
We've been waiting for this day for too long.

361
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,640
Wei Wuxian.

362
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,240
Wei Wuxian.

363
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,640
Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian.

364
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,160
Who did you kill?

365
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,040
Do you know who did you kill?

366
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,120
Bro Xian. Bro Xian.

367
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,520
Yuan, don't cry. Don't cry.

368
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,600
I 'll take you to play.

369
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,440
You can kill anyone else.

370
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,080
But why did you kill Jin Zixuan?

371
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,880
Why?

372
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,600
You killed Jin Zixuan.

373
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,520
What should senior sister do?

374
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,880
What should Ling do?

375
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,440
What should I do?

376
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,440
Yuan, don't cry.

377
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Later I will take you

378
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,240
to make a big butterfly, OK?

379
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
There. There.

380
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,640
Yuan, don't cry.

381
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,160
Don't cry.

382
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,480
These years,

383
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,440
why did I confine myself in Burial Mounds?

384
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,920
Why did I choose this way

385
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,160
and put me in this situation?

386
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,600
Am I crazy?

387
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,920
Sorry.

388
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,200
Sorry... it's... it's all my fault.

389
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,600
Sorry.

390
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,680
Was that his fault?

391
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,160
He changed into this.

392
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,080
Is this his fault?

393
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,880
Who can tell me?

394
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,520
What on earth should I do?

395
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,640
What on earth should I do?

396
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,280
Who can tell me?

397
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,360
You...

398
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:08,960
Sorry.

399
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
What did you do to me?

400
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,840
When you woke up just now,

401
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,280
we were discuessing.

402
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,360
We have almost reached an agreement.

403
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,200
Discuss what?

404
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,480
Cut the crap.

405
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,480
Pull the needle.

406
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,000
Sister and I have discussed already.

407
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,440
We will go to Jinlintai

408
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,600
and ask for punishment.

409
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,680
Ask for punishment?

410
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,960
What kind of punishment?

411
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,840
Carry a rod and ask to be spanked?

412
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,520
Surrender yourself to justice?

413
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,320
These days, when you were lying,

414
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,640
Jin clan of Lanling

415
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,480
has sent people to pass messages.

416
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,760
What?

417
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,920
Don't tell my only after I scold you.

418
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,680
Make it clear.

419
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,240
Jin clan of Lanling wants your account on this matter.

420
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
According to them,

421
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,080
as long as you hand two of us over,

422
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,320
it's over for the moment.

423
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,120
Please lie down for another few days.

424
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,920
The needle will lose its effect in three days.

425
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
I have told uncle and other people to

426
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,680
take good care of you.

427
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,200
Nonsense.

428
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,480
Did I ask you to do this?

429
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,920
Pull the needle immediately. Pull the needle.

430
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,720
The evil spell on Jin Zixun was not cast by me.

431
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,120
It's not me.

432
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,480
But they affirmed it's you.

433
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,600
Wen Qing,

434
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,440
the general countermeasure of evil spell

435
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,600
is to cast it back

436
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,440
to the spell caster.

437
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,000
For the moment,

438
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,800
we only need to find the person

439
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,800
who has the trace of rebounding evil spell.

440
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,720
I definitely don't have

441
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,040
the trace of rebounding evil spell.

442
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,440
It won't work.

443
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,480
Why not?

444
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,480
Among the massive crowd,

445
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,080
where can we find him?

446
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,920
Are we going to set up roadblocks

447
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,240
in every road in every city

448
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,480
and force everyone to take off their clothes for check?

449
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,600
Why can't it work?

450
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,680
No one is willing to set up roadblocks for you.

451
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,280
And how long will it take?

452
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,760
Maybe 8 or 10 years.

453
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,920
But are they willing to wait?

454
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,280
But I don't

455
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,960
have the trace of rebounding evil spell.

456
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,240
Today during their assault,

457
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,600
did they ask you about it?

458
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,120
No.

459
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,080
Right,

460
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,720
they didn't ask

461
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,040
and wanted to kill you directly.

462
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,680
Do you get it?

463
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,160
They don't need any proof

464
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,760
and truth from you.

465
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,320
It doesn't matter

466
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,880
whether you have the trace.

467
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,200
You are Yiling Patriarch

468
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,080
and master of wicked tricks.

469
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,960
So it's not strange even you don't have it.

470
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,320
Also small things like casting a spell

471
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,200
doesn't require your action.

472
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,360
You just can't deny it.

473
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
In this case,

474
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,720
it doesn't matter

475
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,400
who cast the spell.

476
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,360
What is important is that

477
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,680
people in Qiongqi Road

478
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,000
and

479
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,520
Jin Zixuan

480
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,280
was indeed killed by Ning.

481
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,760
But

482
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,720
if someone has to go, it should be me.

483
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,640
I was the one who controlled Wen Ning

484
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,520
and turned him into a puppet.

485
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,400
I made him kill people.

486
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,120
The murderer is the one should go

487
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,160
instead of his knife.

488
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,000
Wei Ying,

489
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,680
we all know

490
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,320
Wen Ning is a knife,

491
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,080
which makes them scared.

492
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,120
But he is also a knife they use

493
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,880
as an excuse to attack you.

494
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,840
If we go,

495
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,400
there will be no knife.

496
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,800
And they don't

497
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,040
have an excuse no more.

498
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,280
The case may be closed like that.

499
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,720
But do you understand

500
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,160
the consequence of going to Jinlintai?

501
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,120
Aren't you the one who cherishes Wen Ning most?

502
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Whatever the consequence is,

503
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,960
we deserve it.

504
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,640
Thinking about this,

505
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,800
we should have died long age.

506
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,080
All these days

507
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,880
were gifts for us.

508
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,760
Wen Qing,

509
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,040
help me up.

510
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,199
I have finished

511
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,920
and made myself clear.

512
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,000
I also said goodbye.

513
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,520
Then

514
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,600
farewell.

515
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,800
No.

516
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,400
Wen Qing.

517
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,760
I didn't tell you for a lot of times.

518
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,639
But today,

519
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
something needs to be said.

520
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
Or from now on,

521
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,400
I don't have a chance.

522
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,400
No.

523
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,840
Sorry.

524
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,760
And

525
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,880
thank you.

526
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,360
Last dregs of Wen clan

527
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,600
killed my son

528
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,400
and disciples of Lan.

529
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,760
They deserve capital punishment.

530
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,080
Today Jin clan of Lanling

531
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,160
shall

532
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,080
grind your bones to dust.

533
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,560

534
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,000

Senior sister.

537
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,880
Xian.

538
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,960
Senior sister.

539
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,480
Xian, come out.

540
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,440
We will go home together.

541
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,040
Where are you?

542
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,480
No one blames you.

543
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,880
I am sorry.

544
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,520

545
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,520

No.

547
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,800
No.

548
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,160
No.
