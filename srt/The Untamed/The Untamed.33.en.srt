Episode 33

3
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
Wei Wuxian is there! Kill him now!

4
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Wei Wuxian!

5
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,040
It was you back then who caused

6
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,040
the deaths of Jiang Fengmian and his wife,

7
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,960
and now you caused the death of your senior sister.

8
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,240
You suffered from your own actions,

9
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
yet you vented your anger on another!

10
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,080
Instead of turning around,

11
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,520
you continue taking life.

12
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,650
Your sin shall never be forgiven!

13
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
Wei Wuxian!

14
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
Drenched in clan peers' blood,

15
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,360
you're heartless and frenzied!

16
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
Wei Wuxian, you harmed others and yourself.

17
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,560
Today is your last day.

18
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,600
- Wei Wuxian!  -You went astray from the right path!

19
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,520
You'll die without burial!

20
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,520
So heartless and ungrateful.

21
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,120
You cultivates the crooked way!

22
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,280
Wei Wuxian,

23
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,160
what's the difference between you and a dog?

24
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,080
Today we'll grind your bone and scatter the powder.

25
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,800
Wei Wuxian.

26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
Kill Yiling Patriarch!

27
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Kill him!

28
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,720
Kill Yiling Patriarch!

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
Kill Yiling Patriarch!

30
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,160
Kill Yiling Patriarch!

31
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Kill Yiling Patriarch!

32
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,040
Wei Ying, stop!

33
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,360
Wei Wuxian is injured!

34
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,680
Go to take his Stygian Tiger Amulet!

35
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,680
Stygian Tiger Amulet!

36
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,240
Stygian Tiger Amulet?

37
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,160
Since you want it so much,

38
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,360
come and take it by your own ability.

39
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,680
I got Stygian Tiger Amulet!

40
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Stygian Tiger Amulet!

41
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,240
Wei Ying,

42
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,880
come back.

43
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,560
Lan Zhan.

44
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,520
Lan Zhan.

45
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Let me go.

46
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,800
Jiang Cheng.

47
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,720
Jiang Wanyin!

48
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,840
Stop it.

49
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,160
Wei Wuxian,

50
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
go to hell!

51
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,680
Wei Ying!

52
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,000
Wei Ying.

53
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,800
Mo Xuanyu.

54
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,760
Mo Xuanyu.

55
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,000
I have no choice.

56
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,720
I don't wanna sacrifice my body to summon you.

57
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,720
But

58
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,240
I can't stand their bullying any more.

59
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,800
Kill them for me!

60
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,200
Kill them for me!

61
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I can see you lack in some maternal education.

62
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,440
Great.

63
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,160
You are back.

64
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
Clan Leader Jiang, please stop.

65
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,400
That's purple lightening.

66
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,000
The purple lightening can recognize

67
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,480
souls that possess others' bodies.

68
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,040
Wei Wuxian's body

69
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,280
and soul were both lost

70
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
after he died.

71
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,480
How do you know Wei died for sure?

72
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,360
Tell me.

73
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,120
Who are you!

74
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,280
It's been sixteen years.

75
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,520
It feels like a dream.

76
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,360
You're awake.

77
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,720
I never thought

78
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,520
that I could still be alive.

79
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,480
That day you fell from the cliff,

80
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,400
Jiang Cheng insisted on looking for you under the cliff,

81
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,080
but he could only see bones of the dead.

82
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,320
What about you?

83
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,200
Have you ever looked for me?

84
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,560
Three years later,

85
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,760
I went there.

86
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,480
But there even was no bones left.

87
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,960
Why three years later?

88
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,040
These sixteen years...

89
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,200
If I say

90
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,800
I also don't know where I was

91
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,160
these sixteen years,

92
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,080
do you believe me?

93
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,440
Yes, I believe you.

94
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,440
Lan Zhan,

95
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,000
but did you really

96
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,480
believe me back then?

You're such a pain in the ass.

100
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,400
Lan Wangji will be wild with joy

101
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,160
hearing you left.

102
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,000
Bullshit.

103
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,560
I tell you

104
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,880
these disciples here all like me very much.

105
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,360
Let me ask you,

106
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,670
why did you only say farewell to Lan Zhan

107
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,120
among so many disciples?

108
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,800
Can't I admire his talents?

109
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,120
You are all losers to me.

110
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,400
I desire for a equivalence.

111
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,040
And I finally found a match.

112
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,160
It is not easy.

113
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,840
Yes. Our Xian is everyone's favorite.

114
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,400
Honestly!

115
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,160
Aren't you shameful?

116
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,240
Senior sister, look at him.

117
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,360
You nuisance!

118
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,560
Come back!

119
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,240
All right.

120
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,200
Get away from me!

121
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,840
Stop. You!

Stop running.

Quit it, you two.

125
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,920
Senior sister, look! He is hitting me.

126

I didn't know

135

that you're still being kept here after so many years.

136

Didn't that fuddy-duddy say

You have always been a model among disciples.

What on earth have you done

144

It's not an evil spirit,

but the spiritual energy of first-class spiritual tool.

00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,600
Old Master Lan is here.

177
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,120
I can't give myself away.

178
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,840
Stop fluting!

179
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,120
Out.

180
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,120
Get out.

181
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,520
No more...

182
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,920
Sure enough, it was infected by Stygian Tiger Amulet.

183
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,520
But how could that happen?

184
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:22,450
= the Cultiation Chamber =

185
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,320
Hanguang Jun.

186
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,640
Acupuncture and medicinal pills all failed.

187
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
What, what should we do about it?

188
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,160
Hanguang Jun.

189
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,920
The sword ghost was infected by the dark spirit of the Amulet.

190
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,200
Did Yiling Patriarch really come back?

191
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,240
If so, what should we do?

192
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,120
But Yiling Patriarch has been dead for 16 years.

193
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,200
Did he really obsess someone's body?

194
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,920
You may leave.

195
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,120
Sizhui, go back to your room and have a rest.

196
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,680
Han Guangjun, but...

197
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,720
Say no more. Go.

198
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,680
Yes.

199
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,120
Are you okay?

200
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,400
Senior Mo.

201
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,880
What's wrong?

202
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,120
I feel a little guilty.

203
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,880
Why?

204
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,760
The sword ghost is coming for us.

205
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,720
How did you know?

206
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,680
Spirit Lure Flags of different grades

207
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,360
are different in their painting and power.

208
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,280
When we were in Mo's Manor,

209
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,680
Spirit Lure Flags we drew

210
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,240
could only work within the radius of 2,500 meters.

211
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,320
But the sword ghost

212
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,000
has so strong resentful energy.

213
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,320
If it had been within

214
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,800
the domain of the Flags' influence to begin with,

215
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,840
Mo's Manor should have flowed

216
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,920
with rivers of blood under its ferocity.

217
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,920
However,

218
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,920
it was there

219
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,240
after we arrived.

220
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,240
That is to say.

221
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,960
It was deliberately put there

222
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,920
at that time by someone

223
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,320
with an ulterior motive.

224
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,080
Good analysis. It seems that you've studied very hard.

225
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,280
In that case,

226
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,880
maybe we're also responsible for

227
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,520
what happened in Mo's Manor.

228
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,600
Now,

229
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,230
it also make Master Lan fall into a coma.

230
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,880
It's not you who should be responsible.

231
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,670
It's the person who released the sword ghost.

232
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
In the world

233
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,230
there's a lot things

234
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,150
which are beyond our control.

235
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,670
Senior Mo.

236
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
Why are you wearing the mask again?

237
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,800
Nothing.

238
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,760
Just afraid of being seen by some old friends.

239
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:10,870
= the Cultivation Chamber =

240
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,760
You aren't suspecting me, are you?

241
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,160
I've been sleeping for sixteen years.

242
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,280
Of course I believe you.

243
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,480
But

244
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,120
where was it infected by the dark spirit of the Amulet?

245
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,120
Normally

246
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,880
it's impossible.

247
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,760
I have already destroyed the Amulet

248
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,880
which has broke into pieces.

249
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,320
If someone gathers all the pieces...

250
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,760
That won't help.

251
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,360
The Amulet has been destroyed.

252
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,920
It's useless to have pieces.

253
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,560
Unless...

254
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,880
Unless they could use Yin Iron

255
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,240
to restore another Amulet.

256
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,120
It was Xue Yang!

257
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,320
Actually, I always had a question in those days.

258
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
It's said that Yin Iron is intelligent,

259
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,720
and suppressed in four directions.

260
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
It sounds like there are four shards of Yin Iron.

261
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
But I don't think so.

262
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,360
If Xue Yang has one shard on him,

263
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,880
plus the sword made of Yin Iron

264
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,360
I took out from the Xuanwu Cave.

265
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,040
There's at least five shards of Yin Iron.

266
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,680
Therefore,

267
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,560
Xue Yang may be able to restore the Amulet.

268
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,280
But he also needs the pieces of

269
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,400
my Stygian Tiger Amulet.

270
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,840
Otherwise, even if he's extremely brilliant

271
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,440
he can't restore the same thing.

272
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,520
Lan Zhan, I and the infected sword ghost

273
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,800
appeared in Mo's Manor at the same time.

274
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,880
Have you ever thought that

275
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,440
how low the possibility was?

276
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,920
Jiang clan and Lan clan

277
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,440
had tired all your efforts to find me but failed.

278
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,720
I don't even know

279
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,040
where I was myself.

280
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,160
But

281
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,800
how did this crazy Mo Xuanyu

282
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,960
know where I was?

283
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,160
Also

284
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,760
the man in black in Mo's Manor.

285
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,000
And

286
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,720
the manipulator of Dancing-Peri illusion.

287
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,400
Anyway, whoever this person is

288
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,160
this is all coming for me.

289
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,485
= the Underworld Chamber =

290
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,840
Hanguang Jun. What should we do?

291
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,840
To trace to its source.

292
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,920
Exactly.

293
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,400
We should find out its root cause.

294
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,120
Once we find the owner of the sword ghost

295
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,200
and know who he is,

296
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,080
we'll be able to save Master Lan.

297
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
It's easy for you to say that.

298
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,640
Look at what we're going through.

299
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,880
Where are we going to find him?

300
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,200
Go northwest.

301
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,880
Northwest?

302
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,520
Hanguang Jun.

303
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,280
Why should we go northwest?

304
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,080
He had showed you the direction.

305
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,640
Show me the direction?

306
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:33,920
Who?

307
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,240
Who showed me the direction?

308
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,640
Hanguang Jun didn't do anything.

309
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,320
It's he.

310
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,680
He?

311
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,520
What's he pointing to?

312
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
What else can he point to?

313
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,600
Either he is pointing to where he comes from,

314
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,960
or he is pointing to

315
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,760
the person who conducted the incident.

316
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,360
Sizhui.

317
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,520
Get all the wounded settled.

318
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,520
Understood.

319
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,760
Hanguang Jun.

320
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,120
Are you going out right now?

321
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Good. That's great.

322
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,280
I won't be controlled by the strict rules here finally!

323
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,691
= Qinghe =

324
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,080
We have arrived at Qinghe.

325
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,000
The further we go northwest,

326
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,080
the stronger the resentful energy of the sword ghost will be.

327
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,480
Looks like,

328
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,080
what the sword pointed at

329
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,080
is just around the corner.

330
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,400
Let's go in the town first.

331
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,280
Take a look at this.

332
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,720
Don't miss it when passing by.

333
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,680
It can exorcise the evil and cure all diseases.

334
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,120
What are you selling?

335
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,280
Everything.

336
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,560
To cure diseases or exorcise the evil, what do you want?

337
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,840
May I ask you?

338
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,160
Do you wannna cure diseases or exorcise the evil?

339
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,440
Have a guess.

340
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,680
Well.

341
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,640
Chi... Childe.

342
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,000
I see the space between your eyebrows appearing black,

343
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,280
and your eyes are lusterless.

344
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,560
You must be accompanied by the evil,

345
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,440
Would you like some portraits of Yiling Patriarch?

346
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,240
It can supress the evil.

347
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,240
Here you are.

348
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,270
Five wen for one, ten wen for three!
("wen"is a currency unit)

349
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,280
Five wen for one, ten wen for three!

350
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,360
Such a low price

351
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,160
wouldn't cost you anything!

352
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,520
I recommend three.

353
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,640
One for the door,

354
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,560
one for the hall,

355
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,360
and stick the last on your bedroom wall.

356
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,040
With the strong, dense evil energy,

357
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,640
these portraits use poison to cure poison,

358
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,440
making sure that no evil beings

359
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,240
can come near you!

360
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,720
Hey.

361
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:42,440
Wei WuXian was a man famous for his good looking.

362
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,000
Who are these guys on your papers?

363
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,160
If you never saw actual person,

364
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,160
then don't draw randomly.

365
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,520
Misleading the young generation.

366
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,400
You make it sound like a real thing

367
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,880
as if you had seen Wei Wuxian before.

368
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,320
I...

369
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,775
= Jin Ling, courtesy name is Rulan =

370
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,160
Jin Ling?

371
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,360
What is he doing here?

372
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,200
Why did you kick me?

373
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,440
Kick you?

374
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,120
Anyone who dares to mention

375
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,840
the words “Wei Wuxian” in front of me

376
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,720
should be grateful

377
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,960
when I don't kill them.

378
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,120
Yet, you're shouting right in the middle of the streets.

379
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,800
Do you want to die?

380
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,920
I wonder

381
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,720
how this child's personality

382
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,760
turned this way.

383
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,720
A poor temper and strong hostility.

384
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,360
He learned all of his uncle and father's defects,

385
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,960
but none of his mother's strengths.

386
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,000
If I don't do some tinkering with him now,

387
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,840
he'd definitely suffer great losses in the future.

388
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,520
Jin Ling!

389
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,000
You still haven't run away yet?

390
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,320
Good for you.

391
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,680
I wonder who was

392
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,920
forced down onto the ground by me

393
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,920
and unable to get up?

394
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,000
Fairy!
