00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,230
The Untamed

2
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,750
Episode 37

3
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,360
Don't go there.

4
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,400
Though there's no danger in it,

5
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,160
the place is full of weirdness.

6
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
We'd better behave ourselves

7
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,240
when we're in other people's domain.

8
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,320
I need someone to help me,

9
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,720
Any volunteers?

10
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,880
Senior Mo. I can.

11
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,120
Then what do I do?

12
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,040
You...

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,600
Don't move

14
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,480
until I tell you to.

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,240
Got it?

16
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,090
OK.

17
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,120
Let's go.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
What's the smell!

19
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,400
What are you doing here instead of

20
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,480
thinking up ways to detoxify?!

21
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,040
How did you know that I was going to call you over?

22
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,520
I'm not here to help!

23
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,280
Did somebody kill someone but forgot to bury?!

24
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,880
Why is here so stinky?

25
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,320
Young Mistress Jin,

26
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,560
if you're coming with me, please lend me a hand.

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,200
If you're not, then please go back, sit down

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
and tell someone else to come over.

29
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
You're calling who Young Mistress Jin?

30
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,360
Be careful what you say!

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,160
Well, I want to see

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,520
what on earth you're trying to do.

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,200
OK, then.

34
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,350
Sizhui, go fetch me a bucket of water.

35
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,050
To clean the kitchen hearth.

36
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,400
Okay.

37
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,280
What's the use of cleaning the hearth?

38
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,040
You're not going to cook or anything.

39
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,480
I am exactly going to cook.

40
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,800
You, go to sweep the dust.

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,560
Get rid of

42
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,640
the straw and other rubbish here.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,840
Get yourself moving!

44
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,280
Making congee?

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,600
Why do you make congee?

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,320
It's so watery and tasteless!

47
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
It's not for you anyways.

48
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,440
What did you say?

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,080
I worked for so long, and I can't even have any?!

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,160
Senior Mo,

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,120
is it that congee can cure poisoning?

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,390
Yeah. Sizhui is clever.

53
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,390
But it's not the congee that can cure poisoning.

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,510
it's the glutinous rice.

55
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,800
This is a folk method.

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,520
So that's why you intended to

57
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,680
enter a house with someone inside.

58
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
Only a house with someone living inside could have a kitchen.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,240
Only a kitchen could have glutinous rice.

60
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,880
Am I right?

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,920
Yes.

62
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Okay, stand away.

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
You haven't explained

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,080
why you came to Coffin Town together?

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,840
It wasn't just by chance that

66
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,920
you ran into each other and then us, was it?

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,880
I, the Lan clan's people,

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
and the ones from other clans

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,200
were all chasing after something.

70
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,280
I came from the Qinghe area.

71
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
We came from Langya.

72
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,240
What was it?

73
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,440
I don't know.

74
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,400
It never showed its face.

75
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
We don't even know what or who

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,920
or which organization

77
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,240
it was, exactly.

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,760
Who is it?

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,200
Who?

80
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,040
Such situation

81
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,670
still continued after I changed the inn a few times,

82
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,120
so I went on the offensive.

83
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,400
If I heard that a cat's corpse

84
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,520
happened to appear anywhere,

85
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,720
I would go and check,

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
determined to find out who was messing around.

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,320
You guys the same?

88
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
Yes.

89
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,080
We chased after it to Yueyang,

90
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
and came across Chlide Jin.

91
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
We found out that we were searching for the same thing,

92
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,190
so we decided to work together,

93
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
and only arrived at this area today.

94
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
We asked a hunter in the village

95
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,000
in front of a stone tablet,

96
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,560
and we were shown the path to Coffin Town.

97
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,920
A hunter?

98
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
When I came here with Lan Zhan this morning,

99
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,960
there was an ordinary farmer at the entrance of the village.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
Where did the hunter come from?

101
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,960
Though killing cats and dumping the corpses

102
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,200
both sounded and looked terrifying,

103
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,640
they weren't actually harmed.

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
On the contrary, these events stirred up

105
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,480
their curiosity to search for the truth.

106
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,280
Also, these juniors met one another

107
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,160
in Yueyang where I and Lan Zhan have stopped off.

108
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,360
It seems as if somebody was purposely leading them

109
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,880
to meet up with the me and Lan Zhan.

110
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,800
And, this isn't the most knotty part of it.

111
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
The person who restored Stygian Tiger Amulet

112
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,600
might be within the Coffin Town at this very moment.

113
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,360
Senior Mo. I think that the congee is ready?

114
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
It's ready? Take it out if then.

115
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,000
One bowl for one person. Feed those

116
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,120
who had been poisoned.

117
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,520
Jin Ling.

118
00:07:59,040 --> 00:07:59,640
What?

119
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,680
Be careful.

120
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,320
What is this? It's poison?

121
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,880
Poison? It's the cure! Glutinous rice congee.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,630
First, I don't know why glutinous rice can be the cure.

123
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,800
= Ouyang Zizhen =
First, I don't know why glutinous rice can be the cure.

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,030
= Ouyang Zizhen =

125
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,800
Second, I've never had

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,160
such spicy glutinous congee before!

127
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,150
Did I accidentally sprinkle

128
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,790
the paprika in it?

129
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,840
The taste... is so terrible

130
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,440
that it almost brings about a sense of deja vu.

131
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,760
All medicine is poisonous to some degree.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,320
The spicy taste will make you sweat

133
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,240
so that you get better sooner.

134
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,840
Seriously? Come on.

135
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
What are you seeing?

136
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
What's outside the door?

137
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Shh. Don't talk.

138
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm looking at it.

139
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
Amazing.

140
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,640
Move!

141
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,200
What did you mean?

142
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,800
How is it? Doesn't it look pretty?

143
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah,

144
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,440
it's so-so at best.

145
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,840
Only barely worthy of a look!

146
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,120
Se... Se... Senior Mo! There...

147
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,680
Don't say it out,

148
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
or else it wouldn't be a surprise.

149
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,000
Let everyone check for himself.

150
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,080
- No, thanks. - No, thanks.

151
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,975
In this situation you're still in the vein for mischief?

152
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,680
Just what in the world were you thinking?

153
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,360
You joined me as well, didn't you?

154
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,520
Don't imitate your uncle's tone.

155
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Sizhui, was that thing scary?

156
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,680
Yes.

157
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,120
Then take another look.

158
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,760
This is an excellent opportunity for your cultivation.

159
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,720
It's scary. That's why you need to see it.

160
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,480
Look carefully

161
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,080
and tell me what exactly it is.

162
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,120
How did it go?

163
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,520
What have you seen?

164
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,240
White pupils.

165
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,160
Female.

166
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,480
Short and skinny.

167
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,320
Fine looks.

168
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,480
Holding a bamboo pole.

169
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,280
The girl is only around fifteen or sixteen.

170
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,440
She has an oval face,

171
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,560
with a lively air

172
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,880
mixed with her comely nature.

173
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Her wooden hairpin has a small

174
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,400
fox head carved onto the end.

175
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,000
She's not only small but her figure is also slender.

176
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,480
Although she's not that tidy,

177
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,880
she's not grimy either.

178
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,480
After some grooming,

179
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,880
she's bound to be a lovely girl.

180
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,080
Well done, well done.

181
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,720
The observations are both

182
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,080
detailed and unique.

183
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,450
Kid, you'll definitely

184
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,375
be the sentimental type after you grow up.

185
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,200
The girl's height reaches my chest.

186
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,360
She is only wearing rags and doesn't look too clean,

187
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,800
dressing like a beggar roaming the streets.

188
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,640
The bamboo pole appears to be a white cane.

189
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,280
She has white pupils.

190
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,800
It's not because she's a monster,

191
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,200
but she's blind.

192
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,640
And she keeps knocking on the ground with a bamboo pole,

193
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,120
as if to express something that she is unable to say.

194
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:51,800
And

195
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,360
there's some black marks on her neck.

196
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,560
Right. Right. Right.

197
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,320
Jin Ling could see much,

198
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,640
while Sizhui could see the details.

199
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,400
Miss,

200
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
you've been following us,

201
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
what can we help?

202
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
So that's why she could not speak.

203
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,080
Both blind and mute. How unfortunate.

204
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,120
Is it the Ghostface Man?

205
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,880
Probably not.

206
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,360
The Ghostface Man had entirely

207
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,680
different moves from this person.

208
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
How could it be him?

209
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,680
Senior Mo,

210
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,520
this man got poisoned.

211
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,160
We need to help him!

212
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:17,960
How?

213
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,120
The poisoning powder is everywhere.

214
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,280
You're gonna be poisoned if you go out.

215
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
Flirty eyes behind thy long lashes,

216
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,280
red lips parted, smiling in tease.

217
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,600
Mind not the good or evil,

218
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,040
with smeared eyes I summon thee.

219
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,430
It's the Summoning of Painted Eyes!

220
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
Take the living person back inside.

221
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,360
Other than him,

222
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,240
eliminate everything.

223
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,240
Don't come near.

224
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,480
Be careful not to touch the powder.

225
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,320
Even physical contact would poison you.

226
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,440
Who are you?

227
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,680
Senior uncle.

228
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,960
I'm your acquaintance.

229
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,800
Sizhui.

230
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
Go and get a bowl of glutinous rice congee. Go!

231
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,760
We still don't know who he is,

232
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,560
whether he's friend or foe.

233
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,560
Why should we save him

234
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
without a second thought?

235
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,880
If he were a bad guy,

236
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,680
wouldn't we be letting a snake in?

237
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,760
But it is also possible that he's a good person.

238
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Didn't you see him outside surrounded by puppets?

239
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
He's definitely not a bad guy.

240
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,800
No matter what,

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
not helping a dying person is against our clan's rules.

242
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,680
Fine.

243
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,120
You're the good guys.

244
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,880
If someone dies, it's not my fault.

245
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,520
Senior Mo.

246
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,080
The Frostwork?

247
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,200
Is he...

248
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,480
Xiao Xingchen.

249
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,040
Oh, no. There are so many puppets out there!

250
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,440
How many is "so many"?

251
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,400
I do not know!

252
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
They fill the entire street. Probably hundreds!

253
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,840
I don't think the door can hold them off any longer!

254
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,600
Senior Mo,

255
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,425
are you going to use the Summoning again?

256
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,750
If you dot twice in each one's eyes,

257
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,575
how much blood will you lose?

258
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,080
How about using my blood?

259
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,560
- I can also spare some.  -Me too.  -Me too.

260
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,600
You've only been cultivating for a few years.

261
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,920
Are there any blank talismans?

262
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160
Written ones are fine as well.

263
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,840
Disperse!

264
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:54,760
Song Lan?

265
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,360
Tie him up.

266
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,240
Bro Song.

267
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,800
Song Lan.

268
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,920
Detached tongue.

269
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,200
My God?

270
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,120
Who could be so vicious?

271
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,760
Have any of you

272
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,040
studied "association with spirits"?

273
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,200
Me. I have.

274
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,970
Have you brought your Qin?

275
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,600
Yes.

276
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,760
How is your Qin language?

277
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,160
Any practical experience?

278
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
Will the spirit that you summon be able to lie?

279
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,040
Hanguang Jun said that Sizhui's Qin language is fine.

280
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,000
Hanguang Jun told me

281
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,290
to focus on quality instead of quantity.

282
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,080
The spirit that I summon will be able to

283
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,880
avoid answering, but won't be able to lie.

284
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,960
So, if it is willing to answer,

285
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,160
then it will definitely speak the truth.

286
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,520
Then, let's start.

287
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,720
The first question.

288
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,520
Who is he?

289
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,560
What did he say?

290
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,680
Song Lan.

291
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,320
Good.

292
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,760
Looks like your Qin language is not bad.

293
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,080
The answer is correct.

294
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,400
Then ask the second question.

295
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,840
Who killed him?

296
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,680
That is impossible!

297
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:08,880
What did he say?

298
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,440
He said...

299
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Xiao Xingchen.

300
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,640
You played it wrong, right?

301
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,400
No.

302
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,880
"Who are you" and "who killed you" are the two

303
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,320
easiest and most common questions

304
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,360
in association with spirits.

305
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,160
When someone first starts to learn association with spirits,

306
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,240
these are the first and second sentences that he learns.

307
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,860
I've practiced them no less than ten thousand times.

308
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,480
And I checked them before I played.

309
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
I definitely didn't play them wrong.

310
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,760
Either you played it wrong,

311
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,280
or you interpreted the Qin language wrong.

312
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:41,840
Impossible.

313
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,680
If playing them wrong is impossible,

314
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,760
then interpreting them wrong is even more impossible.

315
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,560
The name and the three characters of "Xiao Xingchen"

316
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,320
are not at all common in the spirits' answers.

317
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,600
If he answered a different name

318
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,580
and I interpreted it wrong,

319
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,000
it would not have just happened to be this three characters.

320
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,520
It's said Song Lan went to find the missing Xiao Xingchen,

321
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,600
But he just said Xiao Xingchen killed him.

322
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,000
Why would Xiao kill his own good friend?

323
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,240
He doesn't seem like this sort of person.

324
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,440
Sizhui,

325
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,400
ask the third question.

326
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,680
Who is controlling him?

327
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:45,960
The. One. Behind. You.

328
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,200
Don't move!

329
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,360
Stay back!

330
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,960
In terms of swordsmanship,

331
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,600
even everybody here added up

332
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,080
wouldn't be a worthy opponent to this Song Lan.

333
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,920
Adults are going to talk to adults.

334
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,960
The children can wait outside.

335
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,000
Go outside for now.

336
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,240
You won't be much help here, anyways.

337
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,440
The poisoning powder should have settled.

338
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,360
When you go outside, don't run around and stir up the dust again.

339
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
Breathe slowly.

340
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,240
Sizhui,

341
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,490
you're the most sensible here.

342
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,920
Guide them a bit.

343
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,160
Can you do that?

344
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,520
Don't be scared.

345
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,240
I am not.

346
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:07,920
Really?

347
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,360
Senior Mo, you are so much like Hanguang Jun.

348
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
Us? How are we alike?

349
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,320
We are obviously like fire and ice.

350
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,800
I do not know, either.

351
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,360
But it just feel fimiliar.

352
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,080
It is as though if either one of the two seniors is present,

353
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,640
I will not need to be scared or worried about anything.

354
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,760
Cure of the poisoning powder?

355
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,800
Correct.

356
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,960
Much more effective than your terrible congee,

357
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,600
right?

358
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,240
And it tastes sweet.

359
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,560
Your performance was wonderful.

360
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,520
From courageously killing puppets, tiring out,

361
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,720
to getting poisoned

362
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,920
and losing consciousness.

363
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,360
You have worked so hard

364
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,800
for our entertainment, huh?

365
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,000
Not for you all,

366
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,760
but for you alone.

367
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
I'm guessing that

368
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,920
you haven't yet told anyone who you really are, have you?

369
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
So, I didn't expose your secret either

370
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,760
and let them go outside

371
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,040
for we could shut the doors and talk in privacy.

372
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,240
How's that?

373
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,720
Am I thoughtful?

374
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,240
All puppets in Coffin Town

375
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,640
were made by your Stygian Tiger Amulet?

376
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,080
Just as you guys came in

377
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,720
and your fluting started,

378
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,960
I began to see who you are.

379
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,440
But the fog is so heavy

380
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,480
and we haven't seen each other for years.

381
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,600
So I had to sound out you.

382
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,600
Though Hanguang Jun is a little troublesome.

383
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,760
But it was not difficult for my friend

384
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,760
to keep him occupied in Coffin Town for a short time.

385
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,520
All right.

386
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
I don't have time chatting with you.

387
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,720
Get to the point.

388
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,120
So, taking the group of children as hostage,

389
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,920
what do you want me to do?

390
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,280
Senior, I want you to do me a favor.

391
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,400
A tiny favor.

392
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
Whose spiritual cognition is this?

393
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,320
It's already in shambles.

394
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,280
Even glue won't be able to stick it together.

395
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
If this person's spiritual cognition

396
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,960
was that easy to stick together,

397
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,320
why would I need your help?

398
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,400
You want me to fix this spiritual cognition?

399
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
No offense,

400
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,240
but there really isn't much left of it in here.

401
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,160
If a spiritual cognition itself

402
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,880
doesn't have any desire to live,

403
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,880
then it'll most likely be impossible to save.

404
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,000
If I'm not wrong,

405
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,360
this person is dead already.

406
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,560
Now that he's dead

407
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,120
how can I save him?

408
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,560
Don't you understand this more than anyone?

409
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,920
I don't understand and I don't care!

410
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,440
Wasn't Win Ning dead?

411
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,280
Now that you could have revived him,

412
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,840
there must be a way...

413
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,760
Who told you Win Ning was dead?

414
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,680
He didn't die at all, okay?

415
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,520
Since you call me Senior,

416
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,280
I'll tell you a truth.

417
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,560
Most of the rumors on the world are not to be trusted.

418
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,880
You have to do it even if you don't want to.

419
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,920
Senior, don't you forget

420
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,760
those kids you brought

421
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,920
are still staring at you from outside,

422
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,800
waiting for you to help them out of the danger.

423
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
Haven't seen you for years.

424
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,760
You haven't changed a bit, have you?

425
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,760
Xue Yang,

426
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,040
why are you pretending to be a cultivator

427
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,640
when you actually are a delinquent?

428
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,760
Uh-oh. You found out.

429
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,320
Purposely pretended to be poisoned

430
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,840
so that our consciences would urge us to save you.

431
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,160
purposely showing us the upper part of Frostwork.

432
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,970
You know not only how to pretend to be injured and defenseless,

433
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,160
but also how to gain the sympathy of others.

434
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,720
You truly brought out a genuine, virtuous Xiao Xingchen just now.

435
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,200
If we hadn't fought before

436
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,200
I really would have believed

437
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,000
that you were Xiao Xingchen.

438
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,160
Well, it's true that his reputation is better than mine.

439
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,320
Of course I pretended to be him.

440
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,840
It's easier to gain the trust of others this way.

441
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,560
That was some

442
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,960
excellent acting right there.

443
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,000
Now you're just flattering me.

444
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,640
I have a friend.

445
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,880
His acting is what I'd call excellent.

446
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,400
I still have a long way to go.

447
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,960
Anyways,

448
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,600
enough for the chit-chat.

449
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,280
You are Yiling Patriarch, the founder of crafty tricks.

450
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,400
I deem you as my senior,

451
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,280
so you really have to do me this favor.

452
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,800
You're the one who made the long nails that controlled

453
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,480
Song Lan and Wen Ning, aren't you?

454
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,680
You can even restore half of Stygian Tiger Amulet,

455
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,840
so why would you need my help to

456
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,480
restore a spiritual cognition?

457
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,520
They're not the same.

458
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,560
You're the founder.

459
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,440
If you never made Stygian Tiger Amulet,

460
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,480
I wouldn't have been able to

461
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,880
make Yin Iron as effective as half the Amulet.

462
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,040
When we parted,

463
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,560
I didn't expect

464
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,040
that you could have used Yin Iron

465
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,280
to invent Stygian Tiger Amulet, such a treasure.

466
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,120
I misjudged you at that time.

467
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,400
So you did hide

468
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,880
the Chang clan's Yin Iron back then.

469
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,000
Wrong.

470
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,720
I did hide a shard of Yin Iron,

471
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,240
but it's not Chang clan's.

472
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,400
How could Chang clan of Yueyang have Yin Iron?

473
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,080
They were too weak.

474
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,040
You guys are so gullible!

475
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,360
I did hide one shard of Yin Iron privately.

476
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,320
But

477
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,120
I hid it before I went to the Nevernight.

478
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,800
No wonder

479
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,560
we turned Chang clan inside out

480
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,360
with no Yin Iron to be found.

481
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,475
"Yin Iron is intelligent,

482
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,775
suppressed in four directions."

483
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,400
People only know this sentence,

484
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,400
but doesn't know there's another sentence after it.

485
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,760
"All the energy of the four directions belong to Xuanwu."

486
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,760
The Slaughter Xuanwu?

487
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,960
So Senior Wei,

488
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,160
you were so lucky to have found

489
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,760
the last shard of Yin Iron

490
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,040
sealed in the sword

491
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,360
by accident.

492
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,560
So

493
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,440
you already knew there are five shards of Yin Iron.

494
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,280
You are so good.

495
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,160
You could have hidden Yin Iron for so many years

496
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,480
without leaking out any info.

497
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,200
Hence everyone thinks that

498
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,720
I took away your Yin Iron

499
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
and made the Amulet.

500
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,600
I feel I'm not your equal.

501
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,440
No, no, no.

502
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,400
You are better than me.

503
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,000
I just happened to discover

504
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,640
some secrets of Yin Iron,

505
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,760
but you're self-taught

506
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,640
when making the Amulet.

507
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,680
You're being too humble.

508
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,080
It's not being humble.

509
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,760
It's the truth.

510
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,360
I never like to exaggerate when I'm talking.

511
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,040
If I say I'm gonna kill someone's entire clan,

512
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,080
I'll actually kill their entire clan.

513
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,200
I won't even leave a dog behind.

514
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,840
Like Chang clan of Yueyang and Snow White Pavilion?

515
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,000
Fight outside, Wen Ning.

516
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,800
Guess who's gonna win?

517
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,040
Would I need to guess? Wen Ning, of course.

518
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,225
It's such a shame that

519
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:20,675
even though I had put so many nails in his head,

520
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,000
he is still unwilling to obey.

521
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,040
Things that are too loyal

522
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,080
are also quite troublesome.

523
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,480
Wen Ning is not a thing.

524
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,600
Don't you see that

525
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,850
what you said could be interpreted in a different way?

526
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,680
Yeah.

527
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,000
Do you often sneak up on people in the middle of a conversation?

528
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,280
Of course. I'm a delinquent, aren't I?

529
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,160
It's not like you know me for the first day.

530
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,280
Anyway, it's not the first day that I want to kill you.

531
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,120
I just want to make you unable to move. Then I can take you back

532
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,120
and you can take your time repairing the cognition.

533
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,760
I've already said that I can't do anything about it.

534
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,240
Don't be so eager to refuse me.

535
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,960
If you don't know what to do about it,

536
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,000
the both of us can discuss the matter together.

537
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,670
Are you really taking advantage

538
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,960
of my body's low spiritual power?

539
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,040
That's right!

540
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,280
Well, there's an old saying.

541
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,600
"Better upset a decent man than a rogue",

542
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,920
which is you, in this case.

543
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,920
I'm not dealing with you any longer. I'll get you someone else.

544
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
Who else?

545
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,520
That Hanguang Jun?

546
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,150
My friend is keeping him occupied.

547
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,240
Should I call this "to come in time

548
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,080
is better than to come early"?

549
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,640
Hanguang Jun, we meet again!

550
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,840
Give me the sword back.

551
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,440
You do not deserve this sword.

552
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,160
The Looming Disaster?

553
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,120
The name of this sword matches you perfectly.

554
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,920
Step back. You are not needed here.

555
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,520
Senior Mo! Senior Mo!

556
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,560
I don't think I'm needed here, either.

557
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:44,920
Let's go.

558
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,840
Aha. I'll definitely be needed there.

559
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,120
Everyone alright?

560
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,160
Yes!

561
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,760
We all listened to you and held our breaths.

562
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,600
Good.

563
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,960
If anyone doesn't listen to me,

564
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,040
I'll feed him that congee again.

565
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,640
No. No more please.

566
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,240
He's so good!

567
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,000
Well, obviously. Of course Hanguang Jun is good.

568
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,360
He just never likes to show it off. He is very low-key,

569
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,480
right?

570
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,640
Are you asking me?

571
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,560
So you think that Hanguang Jun is not good?!

572
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,240
He's good.

573
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,320
Of course. He's really good. He's the best.

574
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,120
Not good.

575
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,120
With so many people,

576
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,120
if we are surrounded by a large group of puppets,

577
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,960
escape will be impossible.

578
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,520
Go!

579
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,640
Where to?

580
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,480
Follow the sound of the bamboo pole.

581
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,400
You want us to

582
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
follow an unidentified person?

583
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,320
Who knows where she'll lead us to!

584
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,760
That's precisely what you're going to do.

585
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,440
The sound has been following you guys

586
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,360
ever since you entered the town, correct?

587
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,360
You were trying to go into the town,

588
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,280
but she was leading you toward the town gate, where you ran into us.

589
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,120
She actually was chasing you out.

590
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,800
She was trying to save you!

591
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,400
Hanguang Jun,

592
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,760
it's up to you now.

593
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,240
We're gonna go ahead!

594
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,520
Let's go.

595
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,680
Last night, she clearly wanted to tell us

596
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,000
something really urgent,

597
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,560
but couldn't express it.

598
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
However, she disappeared as soon as Xue Yang came.

599
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,960
She was most likely trying to avoid Xue Yang.

600
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,640
Anyways, she definitely isn't on the same side as him.

601
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,720
Xue Yang?!

602
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,760
The Xue Yang who massacred Chang clan?

603
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,720
He's not dead?

604
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,160
Why is Xue Yang here as well?

605
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,800
Wasn't it Xiao Xingchen and Song Lan?

606
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,640
Uhh. I'll explain that later.

607
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,040
Anyways, the one fighting with Hanguang Jun

608
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,350
isn't Xiao Xingchen, but Xue Yang,

609
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,600
who pretended to be him.

610
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,520
We've already come this far. Let's go in.

611
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,760
This is the so-called Coffin Home?

612
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,360
Where dead people are temporarily put?

613
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,080
That's right.

614
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,880
Corpses that aren't claimed by anyone,

615
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,520
are often put into here.

616
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,560
Why did she bring us to the Coffin House?

617
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,880
It can't be because we

618
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,200
won't be surrounded by puppets here, can it?

619
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,240
Where did she go herself?

620
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,680
It's likely that we really won't be surrounded.

621
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,240
We've been standing still for so long already.

622
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,160
Has anyone heard any puppets?

623
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,560
- No. - No.

624
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,240
Senior Mo.

625
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,640
She wants us to open this coffin for her?

626
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,040
Would it be that her family's body is inside?

627
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,360
Stay back!

628
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,480
Stand further back.

629
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,080
In case it is not a corpse inside and spurts out

630
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,440
some more poisoning powder at you.

631
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,880
Xiao...

632
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,050
= Jing =

633
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,320
Senior Mo.

634
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,960
Don't worry.

635
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,360
Senior Mo.

636
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,840
Since this girl can't talk

637
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,720
should I associate with spirit again?

638
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,160
There's no need.

639
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,160
We may not be able to

640
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,800
ask the question she wants us to ask.

641
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,040
And I think that her reply will be quite complex, quite difficult

642
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,240
to interpret.

643
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,480
Then what should we do?

644
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,400
How about Empathy?

645
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,400
No way!

646
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,720
Too dangerous!

647
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Using such a wicked trick,

648
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,240
a little carelessness will get you destroyed.

649
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,560
You may never return.

650
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,040
Unless there is a...

651
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,040
Enough! We're running out of time.

652
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,640
Form up now.

653
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,280
Let's begin.

654
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,600
We still need to go back for Hanguang Jun when it's done.
