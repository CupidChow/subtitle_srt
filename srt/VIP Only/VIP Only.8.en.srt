00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,187
No slippers for you.

00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,091
It's okay.

4
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,528
When Liu Li used to come to my house to play,

5
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,263
he would throw the slippers everywhere,

6
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,799
so it didn't matter
whether he wore them or not.

7
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,212

13
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:12,372
By the way,

14
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,307
do you want to go visit
the professor next time?

15
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,842
Every time I talk to him,

16
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,844
he always mentions you.

17
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:24,017
Shouldn't you bring a gift
when visiting the professor?

18
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,018
A gift?

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,420
I can teach you how to make handmade cookies,

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,957
just like the last time
when we made dumplings at home.

21
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,025
What dumplings?

22
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,860
I can make dumplings,
and I can make cookies too.

why are you still just friends?

63
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,304
Is it because he's not good enough

or because you're not up to par?

65
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,608

the other's preferences,

97

You said before

98
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,423
that I could do whatever I wanted with you.

99
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,952

into novels.

105
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,344
Such an atmosphere

106
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,192

Does your boss

151
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,009

152
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,313
That question

153
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,849
is not for me to answer.

154

But if you want to know,

155
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,488
you should ask him yourself.

163
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,244
I wanted to tell you

164
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,847
that our boss is not a heartless jerk.

165
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,983
Instead, he's so gentle and caring

166
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,480

172

he said those things?

I've thought it over.

182

My past obsession with you

183
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,294
was just an allure created by the distance,

184
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,895
and those beautiful moments

185
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,331
were actually my imagination.

186
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,934
Just like in novels, they're fictional.

187
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,144
But after Gu Jin appeared,

188
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,512
I realized

189
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:42,944
that love is not just imagination.

190
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,512
It has to be felt up close.

191
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,646
Only then can one understand

192
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,632
what true feelings for a person are like.

193
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,008
Did Gu Jin confess to you?

194
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,792
Well, if your feelings are unrequited,

195
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,060
doesn't it mean I still have a chance?

196
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,240
But I don't want to.

197
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,165
Whether he confessed or not has nothing to do

198
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,648
with me accepting you.

199
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:10,235
I want to find someone I like

200
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,304
by my side,

201
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,606
not just someone because I'm lonely.

202
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,409
Even if he doesn't like me now,

203
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,445
I can wait,

204
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,880
until he says yes

205
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,615
or until I give up.

206
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,672
Back then,

207
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,861
why didn't you have such a determined attitude

208
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,162
toward me?

209
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,288
Maybe it wasn't true love.

210
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,473
It turns out that Mr. Liu
who followed me back then

211
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,842
was just lost.

212
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,478
I wasn't late.

213
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,440
In matters of love, there is
no such thing as being late.

214
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,885
There's only desiring or not,

215
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:01,653
and willing or not.

216
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,624
Thank you.

217
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,627
Thank you for telling me that you liked me.

218
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,362
And thanks to you,

219
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,798
I have two best-selling books.

220
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,733
Also, it's because of you that I know

221
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,536
if you're not brave, you won't gain anything.

222
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,706
I hope that you can

223
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,341
find the right person.

224
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:55,941
Watch where you're going.

225
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,976
I'm sorry, Auntie, are you okay?

226
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,511
- It hurts.
- I'm sorry.

227
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,146
I'm really sorry.

228
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,581
What are you doing here?

229
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,816
Boss.

230
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,304
Can't I come to see my son?

231
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,955
Don't give me attitude in front of your friend.

232
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:11,323
He's not my friend.

233
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,864
He's just a customer
who came to eat at the restaurant.

234
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,688
We're not close.

235
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,432
I seldom see your friends.

236
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,640
What do you do?

237
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:26,805
I am a writer.

238
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,968
Enough.

239
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,647
Sorry to bother you.

240
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,312
Son.

241
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,136
Can you give me a little more money?

242
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:44,890
It's not enough.

243
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,825
How much have I given you?

244
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,494
It's never enough for you.

245
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,080
I raised you.

246
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,731
Am I asking too much?

247
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,066
You didn't raise me.

248
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,334
Grandma did.

249
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,376
After divorcing Dad,

250
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,638
when have you ever taken care of me?

251
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,392
Ever since I was little, you've used me
to ask Dad for money.

252
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,440
And when I grew up, you came to me for money.

253
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,480
And I gave you money. I did.

254
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,415
But you can't be like a bottomless pit.

255
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,160
Why are you yelling at me?

256
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,520
Who is to blame for what I've become today?

257
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,756
If it wasn't for carrying you at the beginning,

258
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,358
would I have married your father

259
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,760
and end up suffering like this now?

260
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,848
No one forced you.

261
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,997
You can choose not to be my mom.

262
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,112
You…

263
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,488
It's my birthday today.

264
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,407
Can you at least choose another day?

265
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,176
I forgot.

266
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,847
It's not just you who's suffering.

267
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,850
I'm in pain too.

268
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,616
If you're not happy,

269
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,560
why do you have to drag me along?

270
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,849
He's not my friend.

271
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,851
He's just a customer
who came to eat at the restaurant.

272
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,186
We're not close.

273
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,264
How could you say that?

274
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,433
That we are not friends?

275
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,068
That I'm just a customer?

276
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,239
We're clearly…

277
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,607

in the freezer.

296

298
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,741

Stop eating instant noodles.

302
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,818
Learn to cook for yourself,

303
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,287
