perhaps this was just a tasting.

Hello, I'm Little Yellow Bird.

19
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,014
Good morning, Mr. Gu.

20
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,650
Sorry.

21
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,536
I drank too much yesterday.

22
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,793
I think you're more approachable

23
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:15,392
after leaving Old House.

24
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:20,256
And you're more well-behaved after drinking.

25
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,703
Especially,

26
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,606
when you were sleeping in my bed.

27
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,563
Rest assured.

28
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,831
I won't eat you.

29
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,066
Don't be nervous.

30
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:57,248
How do you know

31
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,572
I won't be the one eating you?

32
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,115
I don't have much to eat here anyway.

00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,208
Go ahead.

34
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:15,288
The best food after a hangover
is a bowl of instant noodles.

35
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,656
Give it a try.

36
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,352
Boss, let me ask you.

37
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,680
Do you still remember what happened
in your restaurant

38
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:53,632
last night?

39
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,965
Are you talking about

40
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,967
'Who do you like the most?'

41
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,069
'Do you like Boss Gu?'

42
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:05,905
Or

43
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,320
were they trying to offer me up?

44
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,328
Do you want to ask

45
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,689
that if I still want to be
the reference subject

46
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:23,923
for your third book?

47
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,029
When I get drunk, I don't lose
my memory like you do.

48
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,665
And I remember

49
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,668
you asked me that question at home,

50
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,670
not in the restaurant.

51
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,856
So, are you willing or not?

52
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,513
I knew you wouldn't change your mind.

53
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,716
Although I've never been
in an official relationship,

54
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,217
those scenes have played themselves

55
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,052
countless times in my mind.

56
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,354
I can certainly master it with ease.

57
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,689
As for the practical experience,

58
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,324
it will just take a few tries.

59
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,527
You sound confident.

60
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,497
Then do you know

61
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,234
what the first step of falling in love is?

62
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,376
What?

63
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,583
You want to gain more
real-life experience, right?

64
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,185
I'll teach you

65
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,388
when the plot requires it.

66
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:40,299
I'll clean up.

67
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,847
Brother.

68
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,083
You finally thought of me.

69
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,484
I thought you totally forgot about me

70
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,787
after falling in love with that Boss Gu.

71
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,920
Shut up already.

72
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,191
Tell me something.

73
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,026
In your opinion,

74
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:09,729
does Boss Gu have a lot of dating experience?

75
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,997
Why?

76
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,299
Are you afraid he'll find out
that you're new at this?

77
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,518
No, I'm not.

78
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,303
He is just

79
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,505
a reference for my third book.

80
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,008
It's not like we're in a real relationship.

81
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,876
Dating a lot is a good thing.

82
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,878
At least it'll help you give up

83
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,413
on that teaching assistant who went out

84
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,582
and who knows when he'll come back.

85
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:31,918
To be honest,

86
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,921
seize the opportunity when it comes.

87
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:39,058
Even if you've gained nothing in love,
at least achieve something in your career.

88
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,427
That way, your third novel
won't have a difficult birth.

89
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,646
Besides,

90
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,920
I think Gu Jin would make
a brilliant leading character.

91
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,384
Do you still like him?

92
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,224
The protagonist in the book?

93
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,061
I suppose.

94
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:20,352
I had three years of secret adoration
and two years of heartbreak.

95
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,784
How can there be heartbreak
when love didn't even start?

96
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,547
Everyone has been comforting me all along

97
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,704
telling me not to feel sad about losing it,

98
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,840
but no one has reminded me

99
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,889
that I never had it in the first place.

100
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,124
You must remember.

101
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:47,424
You are not someone who has been abandoned.

102
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,763
You are someone waiting to be cherished.

103
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,608
Is that so?

104
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,912
Perhaps, I may never see that day.

105
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:56,768
You must believe

106
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,672
that you are worth it.

107
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,504
No wonder Ren looks up to you so much.

108
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,728
What you've said made me
feel great about myself.

109
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,193
What else did he say to you?

110
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,397
He said that even the worst things

111
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,265
can be sold well when you talk about them.

112
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,800
That's really impressive.

113
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,970
Don't laugh and joke around over there.

114
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,171
Focus on your studies.

115
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,840
Alright, Mr. Gu.

116
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,143
I have a question.

117
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,648
How should I arrange a first date?

118
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,284
The first date?

119
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,024
Go to the movies.

120
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:53,856
Ren.

121
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,296
What movies can enhance
the love between couples?

122
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,899
Boss, you've asked the right person.

123
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:03,903
Have you ever heard about
the misattribution of arousal?

124
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,304
The accelerated heartbeat caused
by the hanging bridge

125
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,906
is similar to the tension of a horror film.

126
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,141
So of course, it's a horror film.

127
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,244
But why would you suddenly ask that?

128
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,947
Boss.

129
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,551
You're not thinking of doing
something naughty, are you?

130
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,058
A horror movie.

131
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,161
[Scared stiff]
Why do you want to watch a horror movie?

132
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,732
This way, the relationship
between two people will become closer.

133
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:33,760
Let's go.

134
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,003
In the environment of a hanging bridge,

135
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,406
fear will cause the heart to beat faster,

136
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,942
giving people the illusion of arousal.

137
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,443
It creates distance,

138
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,345
and the opportunity to shorten it.

139
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,115
The last scene of the movie just now

140
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,017
was really quite scary.

141
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,354
Alright, we're here.

142
00:10:55,354 --> 00:11:00,224
[Old House]

143
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,065
The horror movie we just watched

144
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,134
was really terrifying.

145
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,048
Can you stay with me tonight?

146
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:19,578
Let's go.

147
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,357
When it's mealtime,

148
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,558
if you can't cook,

149
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,926
should you order takeout or…

150
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:34,976
Make dumplings.

151
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,730
Making dumplings takes time

152
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,976
and there can be interaction.

153
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,534
Unintentionally,

154
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,669
it can also create

155
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,104
some amorous atmosphere.

156
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,832
This behavior can create a warmer contact.

157
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,888
When two people sit side by side,

158
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,725
it's the most natural contact

159
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,693
in a confined space.

160
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,740
Creating something together

161
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,843
produces a unanimous goal

162
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,444
in a common task.

163
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:38,257
We look at each other and smile.

164
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,977
Because we remember the next step.

165
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,479
Because we understand what each other wants.

166
00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:45,824
And we have a common expectation.

167
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,346
How should we do it?

168
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,848
What should we do?

169
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,499
How can we wrap it?

170
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,368
Is it big enough?

171
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,119
Is it tight enough?

172
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,373
Your shape and my shape.

173
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,991
Arranged one by one,

174
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,162
they look the same yet different.

175
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,638
Wait for the water to boil

176
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,507
and throw them in.

177
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,092
We stand by the stove shrouded in smoke,

178
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:32,672
waiting for the moment
when the dumplings are cooked and float up.

179
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,192
Together we examine the fruits
of our combined efforts.

180
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,285
And then

181
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,954
eat them.

182
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,775
I see how it is.

183
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:48,027
You see, does this process

184
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,479
look a miniature of love?

185
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:53,232
Cooking dumplings.

186
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,936
Right?

187
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,085
I never knew that cooking dumplings
and falling in love

188
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,653
had such a huge connection.

189
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:18,090
It seems like I did the right thing
choosing you as a reference.

190
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,048
Please continue to guide me, Mr. Gu.

191
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,864
Okay, eat up quickly.

192
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:36,876
Aren't you going to answer it?

193
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,227
What?

194
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,080
I told you, that was the last time.

195
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,328
Boss.

196
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,120
Are you okay?

197
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:16,982
It's getting late. I should go.

198
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,083
Wait a moment.

199
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,784
I have another question.

200
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,792
If my love interest wants to leave in a hurry

201
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,993
and I want him to stay,

202
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,120
what should I do?

203
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,414
Boss.

204
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,484
You're too naive about people's feelings.

205
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,720
You can easily get bullied like this.

206
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,156
Who would bully me?

207
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,614
Don't trust people so easily.

208
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,067
Turns out, my heart can beat so fast

209
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,352
without working out.

it means he likes the person beside him.

217
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:35,454
Only when facing someone they love,

218
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,456
would one desire frequent physical contact.

219
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,192
They are constantly creating physical contact.

220
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:45,197
It's obvious that the man is in pursuit.

221
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,303

So if one wants to experience it,

00:18:41,664 --> 00:18:42,988
what needs to be done?

237
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,259
They should partake in an activity together

238
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,480
and bring each other closer.

239
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:50,429
For example…

240
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,497
I know!

241
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,932
We could try hand-building pottery.

242
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,101

243
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:57,970
