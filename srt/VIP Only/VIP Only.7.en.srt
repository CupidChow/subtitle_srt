00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:04,608
I didn't expect this restaurant
to have French cuisine

2
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,040
and the taste is not bad.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,353
The usual dishes in this restaurant
are not like this.

4
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,626
What I mean is

5
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:28,576
the dishes in this restaurant
are very delicious.

When your old crush appears,

16
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:22,949
and your heart doesn't beat for him,

17
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,386
is it because of fear

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,536
or is it because I don't want to?

Why did you give up your seat
to that weird assistant?

00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:36,823
What seat?

Didn't you have me arrange

When I was in San Diego,

46
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,176
I found a ZEN Modern Asian there.

47
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,088
Their Taiwanese beef noodles
are very authentic.

48
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,320
And I was thinking,

49
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,349
if you like beef noodles so much,

50
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,808
perhaps you would also like
the exotic creative flavor.

would be different.

You're clearly pretending to be busy.

There's a saying that goes you can't know

appears to be quite decent,

Alright, drink up.

185
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,774
Teaching Assistant.

186
00:14:02,374 --> 00:14:03,520
What are you doing here?

187
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,456
I'm waiting for you.

188
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,650
You should have told me before you came.

189
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,352
If I hadn't come down today,

190
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,753
it would have been in vain.

191
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,512
To be honest,

192
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,240
I'm afraid you would dodge me.

193
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,363
And I'm already two years late,

194
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:26,816
so I should make up for it.

195
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,235
Waiting here

196
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,636
is not much.

197
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,951
Do you not like steak?

198
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,256
I remember you used to like

199
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,000
the steakhouse behind the school.

200
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,329
Does this shop not suit your taste?

201
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,802
Perhaps people's tastes change.

202
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,976
But I might have been spoiled by the old boss.

203
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,581
Why is your table so messy?

204
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,386
Is this

205
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,472
a bird?

206
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,558
I folded it out of boredom.

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,095
Your dark circles are a bit heavy.

208
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,298
Did you stay up late last night?

209
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,602
Your routine is not normal.

210
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,305
I just saw you pick while eating.

211
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,173
How can you be healthy this way?

212
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,378
A messy desk shows your creativity.

213
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,891
I've said it before, different strokes
for different folks.

214
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,512
Next time, just make what you love to eat.

215
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,165
You should learn more origami patterns

216
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,399
so that the Old House's counter

217
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,992
can turn into your zoo.

218
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,936
Why do you always like to go
to the Old House restaurant?

219
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:28,160
That restaurant is right below my house.

220
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,423
The first time I ate there, I realized

221
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,888
it tasted a lot like what I
used to enjoy as a child.

222
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,920
Plus, the environment is nice
and there's no time limit on dining.

223
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:42,334
They even tease me for treating
that place like my own kitchen.

224
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,616
Don't you think

225
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:51,168
the restaurant owner's attitude
towards you is strange?

226
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:02,154
Could he have developed feelings for you?

227
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,248
He hasn't made an official confession,

228
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,552
so how would I know?

229
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:30,560
[Old House]

230
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:37,408
Teaching Assistant, thank you
for inviting me to dinner today.

231
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,064
I will go upstairs now.

232
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,648
Liu Li.

233
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,200
Are you slow

234
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,632
or are you avoiding?

235
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,243
After going abroad, I read your manuscript.

236
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,747
I regret that I didn't have the courage
to accept your feelings at that time.

237
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,600
After reading your second book, I understood

238
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,312
that I missed someone

239
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,990
who liked me so much.

240
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,112
The days abroad were tough

241
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,467
but every time I saw your posts,

242
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,136
it would remind me

243
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,071
of the happy times at school

244
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,896
and I would tell myself,

245
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,110
Wu Xin,

246
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,679
hang on a little longer.

247
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:35,914
Just a little bit more,

248
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,752
and I can come back to find you.

249
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:40,919
Teaching Assistant.

250
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,588
There's no need to rush for an answer.

251
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,456
You liked me for such a long time back then.

252
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,112
Now, I will prove with time

253
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,632
that all the waiting was worth it.

254
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,371
As for my old crush,

255
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,074
I don't know what kind of answer to give.

256
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,478
Love is not a multiple-choice question,

257
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,680
but rather

258
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,016
a true/false question.

259
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,189
Teaching Assistant.

260
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,191
Why didn't you come upstairs?

261
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,072
It's so late.

262
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:24,992
The restaurant should be closed by now.

263
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,935
I'm not talking about the restaurant.

264
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,768
I meant Liu Li's home.

265
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,777
Or did Liu Li not invite you?

266
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:46,618
After all, it's human nature
to prefer the new over the old.

267
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:54,176
I respect his choice.

268
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,998
But I came back this time to let him know

269
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,184
that old love remains the most beautiful.

270
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,576
I feel like

271
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,944
I'm not a question,

272
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,017
but a piece of sandwich biscuit.

273
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,321
No matter which side is removed,

274
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,291
[The Seventh Flavor A Bittersweet Dilemma]
it will be ruined.

275
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,143
Master Bodhi Zhizunbao,

276
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,080
in your eyes,

277
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,424
is Zixia an exclamation point or a period?

278
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,816
At this moment, my mind is filled
with question marks.

279
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,973
I believe I can make him happy.

280
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,309
And I'm willing to commit right away.

281
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:19,745
You should go after your happiness.

282
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,346
And that person won't be me.

283
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,383
