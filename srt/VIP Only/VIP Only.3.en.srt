The famous novelist Zhang Ailing once said

00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:24,352
"Love is not complicated, it all
comes down to three words."

00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,808
"It's either 'I love you', 'I hate you',

or 'let it be', 'how are you'.

Unfortunately, I can't write about love.

All that's left in life are

has Boss Gu always run a restaurant?

Why are you suddenly asking that?

Do you also think our boss doesn't
seem like a shop owner?

Speaking of which,

45
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,096
actually, our boss doesn't run this shop

Who knew he would be

Just consider it as an extra experience.

89

Why do you say you can't write the third book?

The first book was to commemorate a confession.

The second book was
to commemorate a heartbreak.

94
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,674
For the third book, it seems
there's nothing worthwhile to commemorate.

95

Could it be

183
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,222
that I was stagnating?

184
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:38,430
You need to find another projection subject

185
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,997
Thinking that nothing can be replaced,

186
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:13,952
but could it be

187
00:17:13,952 --> 00:17:18,240
that I forgot to put the right person in place?

188
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:37,568
[The third Flavor]

189
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,842
Jin.

190
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,212
The story of the bluebird tells us

191
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,881
that happiness is often right beside us.

192
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,818
But only those who are willing to provide

193
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,320
without seeking rewards can see it.

194
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:12,124
If you blindly pursue distant happiness,

195
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,860
no matter what color that bird is,

196
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,995
it will be crushed to death in your hands.

197
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,831
You need to take it easy.

198
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,666
Don't be like your mother.

199
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,418
Just wait patiently.

200
00:18:22,418 --> 00:18:25,237
The bluebird might have just gotten lost,

201
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,638
and it will come.

202
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,926
Luckily you guys weren't
thrown away from back then.

203
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,525
Boss.

204
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,328
What do you think?

205
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,232
I'm trying a new recipe

206
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,312
and let the customers do a blind taste test

207
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,448
Boss.

208
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:08,352
Haven't I always been a professional
for the taste-testing?

209
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,040
You call it a blind test,

210
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,745
but it must be served to Liu Li.

211
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,728
Is this the taste of home?

212
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,088
It is spot on.

213
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,457
This looks so delicious.

214
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,193
I'll dig in.

215
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,304
Do you like it?

216
00:21:24,832 --> 00:21:25,884
I like it a lot.

217
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:28,512
You see, I'm so busy eating
that I don't have time to talk.

218
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,962
Every ingredient is exclusively special.

219
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,097
If the food is not finished,

220
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,099
the Chef will be very upset.

221
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,802
Alright.

222
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,760
Different vegetables for different people.

223
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:47,680
Next time, I'll make what you love to eat.

224
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,715
Happy birthday.

225
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,950
I don't celebrate birthdays. It's not my thing.

226
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,253
From now on, it can be your thing.

227
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,622
The birthday person is the most important.

228
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,457
Is there anything specific you want to do?

229
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:08,627
Would you be willing to be
the reference for my third book?

230
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:21,081
♫ I like ♫

231
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,296
♫ The simple life with you ♫

232
00:22:23,296 --> 00:22:25,888
♫ A relationship without expectation ♫

233
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:30,400
♫ Occasional distance allows us to breathe ♫

234
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,952
♫ And occasionally more intimate than lovers ♫

235

♫ It's getting late ♫

236
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,496
♫ A couple of guests ♫

237
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:41,120
♫ Are gradually leaving ♫

238
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:45,280
♫ This dish is specially made for you ♫

239
