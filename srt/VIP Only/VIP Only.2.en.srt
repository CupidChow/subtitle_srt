♫ Occasional distance allows us to breathe ♫

180
00:19:19,648 --> 00:19:23,232
♫ And occasionally more intimate than lovers ♫

181
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:25,728
♫ It's getting late ♫

182
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:27,840
♫ A couple of guests ♫

183
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,528
♫ Are gradually leaving ♫

184
00:19:30,528 --> 00:19:34,784
♫ This dish is specially made for you ♫

185
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,610
A brother and sister went on a journey

186
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,146
to find the Blue Bird to save someone,

187
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,948
but they realized in the end

188
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:46,185
that the Blue Bird was always by their side.

189
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,321
Is there really such a bird in this world?

190
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:52,191
Blue Bird represents
the things people strive for.

191
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,761
Getting it means getting happiness.

192
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:59,831
Why would anyone catch this bird
and be willing to give it to others?

193
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:03,302
Sometimes what you have
doesn't necessarily mean happiness.

194
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,737
You'll know when you grow up.

195
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,973
Hurry up, before the noodles get cold.

196
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:17,024
♫ I like ♫

197
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:22,048
♫ To watch you eat my carefully
prepared food attentively ♫

198
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:26,496
♫ Savoring the tastes of home on your tongue ♫

199
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:30,240
♫ Let it take you on a journey ♫

200
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,032
♫ Are you aware ♫

201
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:37,760
♫ Of the secrets hidden in these dishes ♫

202
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,568
♫ All my inspiration comes from you ♫

203
00:20:41,568 --> 00:20:48,864
♫ Eat it while it's still hot.
Let's continue tomorrow ♫

204
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,424
♫ Stop talking ♫

205
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:57,504
♫ Or the noodles will be cold ♫

206
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,130
Liu Li.

207
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,635
Go sleep in your bed.

208
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:28,836
♫ Are you better now? Who are you hurting for ♫

209
00:21:28,836 --> 00:21:34,368
♫ We understand, feeling powerless is tiring ♫

210
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:38,336
♫ Love is cunning ♫

211
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:40,704
♫ I gave up my old love for others to chase ♫

212
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:46,080
♫ Grab it only to realize it's a mirage ♫

213
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,928
♫ You reject and block the right person ♫

214
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:51,776
♫ And you wait in line for the wrong person ♫

215
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:56,992
♫ You deserve to be punished
for not being able to love ♫

216
00:21:56,992 --> 00:22:01,056
♫ This wonderful journey is close ♫

217
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,840
♫ About to appear ♫

218
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,624
♫ He protects those around him ♫

219
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,928
♫ But you, of all people, just can't see ♫

220
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,960
♫ Spinning around your wonder ♫

221
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,032
♫ Circling around you ♫

222
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:18,336
♫ Why not kiss and fall in love ♫

223
00:22:18,336 --> 00:22:21,760
♫ Seize the sweet happiness ♫

224
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:32,800
(The Second taste)

225
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,686
There are many ways to fold the Blue Bird.

226
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,954
If you've never seen it before,

227
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,023
you would think that the Blue Bird
only has one form.

228
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,908
If you can't get rid of that,

229
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,593
your characters will always be the same.

230
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,262
Find another projection subject?

231
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:46,398
Where can I find that?

232
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,399
You will find it.

233
00:22:49,572 --> 00:22:56,096
(Eat while it's hot,
or the noodles are getting cold)

234
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:58,816
♫ I like ♫

235
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,088
♫ The simple life with you ♫

236
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,256
♫ A relationship without expectation ♫

237
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:08,032
♫ Occasional distance allows us to breathe ♫

238
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,776
♫ And occasionally more intimate than lovers ♫

239
00:23:11,776 --> 00:23:13,888
♫ It's getting late ♫

240
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:16,256
