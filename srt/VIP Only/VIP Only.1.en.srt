You, him and I, we went to the same school.

177
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:14,613
What a coincidence. I have things to do.

178
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,081
Handle my noodles for me.

179
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,683
Be nice to our guest.

180
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,733
So, you're a classmate
of the Teaching Assistant?

181
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,203
I don't think I've seen you in school.

182
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,107
Do you also live in the dormitory
of the graduates?

183
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,718
Boss, a blind date between men.

184
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,020
Mind your own business.

185
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,423
Didn't you ask me
to observe our customers more?

186
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,394
Are relationships between men
widely accepted now?

187
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,197
Are you against it?

188
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,635
I don't know. I haven't encountered it before.

189
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,136
That's right.

190
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,439
Before the encounter,

191
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,474
no one knows who they'll fall for.

192
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,157
Here's our menu.

193
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,492
No, thank you.

194
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,438
You must be curious why I signed up willingly.

195
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,477
Actually, I just wanted to see

196
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,879
why you didn't be with Wu Xin.

197
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,418
Do you remember me asking you out actively?

198
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,226
You don't, do you?

199
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,696
I was your guide during freshman orientation.

200
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,603
I had feelings for you back then,

201
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,739
but all you did was keep your head down

202
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,242
like a tag-along trailing behind Wu Xin.

203
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,446
You've secretly loved him for so many years
but haven't dared to confess.

204
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,517
So, do you want to try with someone
whose zodiac sign and blood type

205
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,453
are just the same as his?

206
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,393
Actually, I didn't have any plans today.

207
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,396
I was just curious
when I heard that your friend

208
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,131
was setting you up with people.

209
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,634
I know that he broke up with his girlfriend,

210
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,936
and you are single.

211
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,872
It makes me feel a lot better.

212
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,825
If you still can't get over him,

213
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,961
I can comfort you.

214
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,057
Boss, you should do something.

215
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,860
We can't let him drink like this, can we?

216
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,132
Where's his friend?

217
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,434
I don't know.

218
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:35,207
Lai, it's all your fault.

219
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,310
Whether I confessed to anyone or not

220
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,214
or whom I like, is none of their business.

221
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,215
Look what you did.

222
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,544
You found someone

223
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:47,953
who exposed my wound and made fun of me
in front of so many strangers.

224
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,155
Why did you do that?

225
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,559
Lai Daiyi, you went too far.

226
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:57,546
Wow, classmate, are you drunk?

227
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,164
Please don't make a scene.

228
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:00,165
I'm on my way.

229
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,210
What are you looking at?

230
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,413
What, are you also laughing at me?

231
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,883
Please. Watch your tongue.

232
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,084
Let me.

233
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:31,096
Where is your friend?

234
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,733
Boss.

235
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,870
Am I really that bad?

236
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,273
Back then, I didn't have enough confidence

237
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,574
so I didn't dare to confess.

238
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,375
But I don't know

239
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,744
why I have become like this today.

240
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,014
Besides, I've already had a bad day.

241
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,482
My draft was rejected in the morning,

242
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,351
and in the afternoon, some weird dude

243
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,787
said he could comfort me? Bullshit.

244
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,155
Am I having a rough patch or bad luck?

245
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,590
Hold him.

246
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,293
I'll ask you a question now.

247
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,829
Where did I do wrong this year? Tell me.

248
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,064
- Okay.
- Say it out loud. I can't hear you.

249
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:06,965
Here's the microphone for you.

250
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,533
Tell me. Is this a rough patch?

251
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,001
Or am I cursed?

252
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,036
Boss, am I…

253
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,704
Boss, do you want a microphone?

254
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:47,606
Here's a microphone for you.

255
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:51,343
Speak up, I can't hear you.

256
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,477
Customer, don't do this.

257
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,912
What do you mean by don't do this?

258
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:54,980
Here.

259
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,714
Boss, you're finally here.

260
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,449
Come on.

261
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,054
Drink this first.

262
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,140
You gave me leftover soup when I was drunk.

263
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,925
But you're so kind to this person.

264
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,660
It smells so good.

265
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:24,176
Even the boss bullies me.

266
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,014
Spoons exist for a reason.

267
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:36,736
(The First Taste)

268
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:50,769
Brother, I'm here.

269
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,771
Don't tell me you're drunk.

270
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:56,575
Sorry, my friend tends to kiss people
when he's drunk.

271
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,143
But it's usually on the cheeks.

272
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,644
Usually on the cheeks.

273
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,645
Usually?

274
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:02,647
Who said that?

275
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:07,648
♫ No more trouble, no more chaos ♫

276
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:11,904
♫ I was a devoted cameo in the last one ♫

277
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:17,262
♫ I understand now about the borrowed dream ♫

278
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,497
Why do you like the blue birds?

279
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,332
I fold paper whenever I'm sad.

280
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,368
Wrap the bad things inside it.

281
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,836
You really like folding paper.

282
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,072
Someone once told me

283
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:30,041
that getting it means getting happiness.

284
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,700
(Eat while it's hot,
or the noodles are getting cold)

285
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:42,948

286
