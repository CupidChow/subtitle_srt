00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,577
There are many misfortunes in this world.

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,812
Fortunately,

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,850
we are all trying very hard to live,

4
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,655
to become the significant others,

5
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,760
and to become not the version of ourselves
that we love the most.

6
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,624
Thank you.

7
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,812
Until someone comes along,

8
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,982
and you see the reflection
of your despondent self.

9
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,052
Then you start to ask yourself

10
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,320
if you're happy.

11
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,944
But,

12
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,712
to love someone,

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,976
you don't need to ask
if they can make you happy,

14
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,919
because as long as they're here,

15
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,160
it means happiness.

28
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,288
This place used to be a beef noodle shop,

29
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,608
run by an old lady.

30
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,776
You can't taste it anymore,

31
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,694
but her noodles

32
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,363
tasted much like you.

33
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,901
It should be that my beef noodles
resembled hers.

34
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:51,771
I was left here for a week when I was a child.

35
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,673
Back then there was a young boy
who kept me company.

36
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,075
He taught me paper folding

37
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,477
and told me the story of the bluebird.

38
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,216
You must have cried incessantly

39
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,318
and he had no choice
but to comfort you this way.

40
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,470
How did you know that?

41
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,464
With such perception,
you could be a fortune teller.

42
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,626
She was just like you.

43
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,763
She loved making things with a tomato soup base

44
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,332
and it was super delicious, you know?

45
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,934
Gu Jin.

46
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,976
What is this place you've brought me to?

47
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,144
The great writer is also here.

48
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,928
Then I'm even more embarrassed.

49
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,014
Hello, Auntie.

50
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,352
I chose this place.

51
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:41,854
Son,

52
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:43,489
the money you transferred to me last time…

53
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,691
Auntie,

54
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,593
I invited you here today

55
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,576
to tell you something important.

56
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,763
What is it?

57
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,035
Gu Jin and I are officially dating now.

58
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,942
From now on, I will be
managing Gu Jin's finances.

59
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,212
if there are any issues,
please come to me directly.

60
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:07,513
You can ask for money,

61
00:04:07,513 --> 00:04:09,280
but you'll have to go through me first.

62
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:15,455
Well, as you know,

63
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,992
as a novelist.

64
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm all up for a little

65
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
mother-in-law drama.

66
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,068
Son.

67
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,937
Say something.

68
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,512
Are you going to let him treat me like this?

69
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,975
Like he said,

70
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,368
he's in charge of my money.

71
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,376
You can try to get it from him.

72
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:43,516
Auntie,

73
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,752
please stop asking for everything from Gu Jin

74
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,648
or blackmailing him using excuses.

75
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,290
I don't think you want to lose your son.

76
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,093
Stop while it's not too late.

77
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,135
I won't let anyone bully him,

78
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,840
not even his mother.

79
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,112
I won't back off.

80
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,912
I can't believe you called her mother-in-law.

81
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,392
I'm just quoting a line from novels.

82
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,760
Was it weird?

83
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,088
It was cute.

84
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,152
But I was surprised

85
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,885
that only it took you a few words
to convince my mom.

86
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,091
I think your mom

87
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,744
is only seeking attention.

88
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,328
She's afraid to be abandoned again,

89
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:03,996
and she's trying to prove in this way

90
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,631
that you care about her.

91
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:11,040
But I think she got my message today.

92
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,145
Why are you looking at me like that?

93
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,176
I feel so lucky.

94
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,984
Am I amazing?

95
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,390
Do I get a reward?

96
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,096
I'll stay the night.

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,784
You have to cook something good for me.

98
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,171
Of course.

99
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,679
Wait, you didn't brush your teeth.

100
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,384
Do you dislike me?

101
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,688
How dare I?

102
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:48,935
Wait.

103
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,560
You'll be late for work.

104
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,306
So you say.

105
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,607
Do you still want me to move here?

106
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,224
Of course, I do.

107
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,264
Why would your editor ask you

108
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,456
if I was by your side?

109
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,104
Alright. Brush your teeth.

110
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,383
Boss Gu, I'm glad you're still here.

111
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,385
Otherwise, this fourth book

112
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,154
would be a loop of unrequited love.

113
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,556
Miss Tsai.

114
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,892
Just kidding.

115
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,495
When we signed you,

116
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,932
you were still a child
who would worry about love.

117
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,969
Now you are an adult who is brave for love.

118
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,041
Only feelings that can grow are called love.

119
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,981
Rest assured, Liu Li won't leave me.

120
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,619
But then Miss Tsai might
reject my manuscript again,

121
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,654
saying that all the characters
I write are the same.

122
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,958
Let me tell you, as long as there is true love,

123
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,393
all difficulties can be overcome.

124
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,495
However, I have a question.

125
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,797
According to the book,

126
00:09:57,797 --> 00:10:00,000
they met each other when they were kids.

127
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,736
Isn't that too coincidental?

128
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,376
It's not a coincidence.

129
00:10:05,955 --> 00:10:07,520
It's fate.

130
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,280
That's a photo of me with my grandmother.

131
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,080
What's wrong?

132
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,912
Are you jealous of the little boy in the photo?

133
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,612
Yeah.

134
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,320
Are you still in touch with that little boy?

135
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:51,651
What if one day, a childhood sweetheart

136
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,472
suddenly appears?

137
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,895
This big boy once said

138
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:04,930
when the little boy grew up,

139
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,533
he would find the answer of the bluebird.

140
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,335
If he couldn't find it,

141
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,584
the big boy has to be responsible.

142
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,392
When did you find out?

143
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,712
You displayed the photo just so I would notice.

144
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:21,447
Besides, how could I not recognize

145
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,624
myself in the photo?

146
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,351
But what about you?

147
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:26,944
When did you recognize me?

148
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:29,822
Very early on.

149
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,291
The day you bumped into me,

150
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,856
the bluebird hand-drawing on the notebook.

151
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:35,795
The night you got drunk,

152
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,830
you told me someone taught you
how to fold paper animals

153
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,699
to eat away the bad mood.

154
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,001
And you told me

155
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:45,137
an elder brother told you
the story of the bluebird.

156
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,376
So

157
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,768
will you teach me paper folding

158
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,414
and tell me stories again?

159
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:12,544
This is a hard-won romance.

160
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:17,603
They are so happy.

161
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,039
But love came fast,

162
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,674
and accidents followed.

163
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,142
What does it mean?

164
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,511
The plot takes a turn.

165
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,646
That person from the past

166
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,416
has come back again.

167
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,981
Teaching Assistant.

168
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:46,465
Hi.

169
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,584
Who is it?

170
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,472
Don't get me wrong.

171
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,584
I just want to borrow your boyfriend for a bit.

172
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,632
No.

173
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:01,408
I just want to have a word with him.

174
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,451
I said,

175
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,496
no.

176
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,384
Five minutes.

177
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:18,976
Ten minutes.

178
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,600
Seven minutes.

179
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,973
Deal.

180
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,560
I'll wait for you at the restaurant downstairs.

181
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,186
It's okay.

182
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,353
Don't worry.

183
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,064
Gu Jin has given me a spare key,

184
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:54,066
so I can come in at any time.

185
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:57,369
He seems to treat you well.

186
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,409
I just didn't expect our farewell

187
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,992
to be just like our reunion,

188
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,784
both at this place.

189
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,704
Farewell?

190
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,018
I got into a doctoral program abroad

191
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,653
to continue my research.

192
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,525
Oh right.

193
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,936
I wanted to ask you for an autograph.

194
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,165
Autograph?

195
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,369
So that I can brag to my friends

196
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,928
that the author of this book once liked me.

197
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,109
Okay, I'll sign it for you.

198
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,586
After reading this book, I realized

199
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,790
what love really looked like.

200
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,266
I hope you can find your happiness soon.

201
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,871
Thank you for your kind words.

202
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,480
And I hope you can remember this smile

203
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,778
and keep it there.

204
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,672
If you dare to make him cry,

205
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:18,592
I will come back and take him away.

206
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,520
That won't happen.

207
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,664
It's more likely he will make me cry first.

208
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:33,966
Why would I do that?

209
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,346
I'm leaving.

210
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,480
Wait a second.

211
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,390
Were you eavesdropping?

212
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,558
No.

213
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,632
Did your mom call again to ask you for money?

214
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,266
No.

215
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,075
Don't worry.

216
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,276
I'm fine.

217
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,380
Tell me what's on your mind.

218
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,681
I'm here.

219
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,383
You don't have to bear
these responsibilities alone anymore.

220
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,432
Okay?

221
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,023
Something has been
bothering me for a long time.

222
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,126
What is it?

223
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:12,864
It's just that

224
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,803
I realized

225
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,505
the more I look at you, the more I like you.

226
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,120
In the future,

227
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,151
I will be your only one.

228
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,016
Not just the only one,

229
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,922
but also my limited edition delicacy.

230
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,761
Gu Jin, let me down.

231
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,363
Put me down.

232
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:48,067
Gu Jin.

233
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,601
From then on,

234
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,616
they lived happily ever after.

235
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,677
If you're hungry, someone would serve you.

236
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,512
So hungry.

237
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:03,015
I'm so hungry.

238
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,896

Stop lingering in bed.

247
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,742
If you want to stay in bed,
someone will sweet-talk to you

248
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,244
and let you.

249

254
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,024
I can't walk anymore.

255
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,452
If your legs are sore, someone will carry you.

256
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,687
Okay.

257
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:50,789
I'll carry you.

258
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,928
You have your special seat.

259
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,638
And also,

260
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,274
your very own special delicious dishes.

261
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,656
Dig in.

262
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,385
I want to look at you first

263
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,120
and eat later.

264
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,892
Eat up.

265
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,088
It's very tasty.

266
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,081
Boss really works hard.

267
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,464
But he's also happy.

268
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,085
After all, they've been through
so much together.

269
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,200
Happiness after hardship doesn't come easy.

270
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:59,491
So this relationship has taught us one thing.

271
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:01,260
As long as you occupy the toilet and don't poo,

272
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,794
you can have happiness.

273
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,296
What do you mean?

274
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,932
Are you saying that Boss Gu's
restaurant is a toilet?

275
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,600
That's not what I meant at all.

276
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,102
What I mean is

277
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,160
our boss can't spoil Liu Li like this.

278
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:14,560
Do you agree?

279
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,632
He does pamper him, I guess.

280
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,512
But being pampered to the point of incapability

281
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,792
is a blessing.

282
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,360
What?

283
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,495
Being my secretary

284
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,530
isn't a blessing?

285
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,328
How can you compare
our relationship with theirs?

286
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,241
Being able to work by your side all my life

287
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,640
is truly a blessing I've been
waiting for over many lifetimes.

288
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,382
Lai.

289
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,032
Don't you think this is the boss's strategy?

290
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,154
What strategy?

291
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,723
To spoil Liu Li to a hopeless point

292
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,225
so that he can't leave him anymore.

293
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,741
You're hopeless.

294
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,581
Why do you come so often lately?

295
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,518
Your boss's wife, Liu Li

296
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,754
asked me to quit my job and work here.

297
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,356
So from now on, I will be your colleague.

298
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,584

The published one is an abridged version
that can be shared with others.

305

And the other

306
00:23:09,655 --> 00:23:11,673
is not for sale on the market,

every story

both love food.
