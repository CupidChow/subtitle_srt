00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,736
When I'm not around,

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,205
you must take good care of yourself.

3
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:06,706
Learn to cook for yourself,

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,343
just like I taught you.

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,611
Where have you been?

6
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:13,947
I couldn't find you anywhere.

7
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:41,608
Don't they all say

8
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:44,576
that dreams are the opposite of reality?

9
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,712
Hey, Lai.

10
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,617
Are you asleep?

11
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,385
Just about to go to sleep.

12
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,853
What's up?

13
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,560
Tell me something.

14
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,584
Is it too late for me to pursue Gu Jin?

15
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,360
Is it?

16
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,840
But I can wait.

17
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,736
I don't want him to disappear.

18
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,087
Go ahead.

19
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,555
There is a medical term

20
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,690
called cherophobia,

21
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,859
fear of happiness syndrome.

22
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,694
The patient's first reaction
when happiness arrives

23
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,829
is to reject and escape,

24
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:11,331
because in their subconscious,

25
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,333
they believe that after extreme happiness,

26
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,488
pain and sorrow will certainly follow.

27
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,575
Wait.

28
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,044
When did you become so clever?

29
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,615
Did you see Gu Jin's mom

30
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,950
who was desperately extorting money?

31
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,620
Could it be that Boss Gu is afraid
that his mom will latch onto you,

32
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,522
that he would hold you back

33
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,757
that he couldn't make you happy?

34
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,095
Yes, that should be correct.

35
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,197
Would you pull away

36
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,465
for such a foolish reason?

37
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,167
Of course not.

38
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,935
That's right.

39
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,505
I heard from Ren
that today is Gu Jin's birthday.

40
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,873
Poor guy.

41
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,575
Having this kind of drama on a birthday

42
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,210
is quite sad.

43
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:01,181
And I happen to have Boss Gu's address

44
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,784
from Ren.

that if you're by my side,

Your boss, Gu, hasn't even
confessed his feelings yet,

187
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,256
and he's already fallen head over heels.

188
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,070
I'm really afraid that your boss will not
take responsibility when the time comes.

189
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,638
And he could be shadowed for life.

190
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,340
What do you mean 'Your Boss'?

191
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,508
If it comes to innocence,

192
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,010
my boss is way more innocent

193
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,392
than your Liu Li.

194
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,880
How is that possible?

195
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,183
He looks like an old hand in the game of love.

196
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:06,185
Didn't he give him dating tips?

197
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,032
I was the one who taught him that, mind you.

198
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,491
You can give tips?

199
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,759
Of course.

200
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,894
Why can't I?

201
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:18,730
Throw out any problem you have,

202
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,096
and I'll help you figure it out.

203
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,835
Come on.

204
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,872
Ask away.

205
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,110
Right, I'll stop by the store in a bit.

206
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,511
Do you want to go together?

207
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,946
I'm not going to the store today.

208
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,447
I have important things to do.

209
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,568
What important things?

210
00:18:39,568 --> 00:18:40,800
Give me your phone.

211
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:43,322
What? Checking my phone already?

212
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,024
Hurry up.

213
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,248
Are you free later?

214
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,749
Let's meet up.

215
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,217
I have something to tell you.

216
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,920
Just like I said yesterday,

217
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,384
I won't let you face it alone again.

218
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,628
From now on,

219
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:23,862
I will accompany you.

220
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,205
Let's go.

221
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,608
Come with me to a place first.

222
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:41,632
♫ Hey, what's on your mind, keeping you awake ♫

223
00:19:41,632 --> 00:19:45,792
♫ Tomorrow's work, and the planned trip ♫

224
00:19:45,792 --> 00:19:48,896
♫ How lucky I am that you've chosen me ♫

225
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:54,995
♫ To share your present and your future ♫

226
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,904
[The Ninth Flavor I Am Your Beginning]

227
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,505
So it was you.

228
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,288
In the future,

229
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,923
I am your one and only.

230
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,894
The more I see you, the more I like you.

231
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,030
This is not a coincidence.

232
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,332
This is fate

233
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:52,300
♫ I like ♫

234
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,515
♫ The simple life with you ♫

235
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:57,107
♫ A relationship without expectation ♫

236
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,619
♫ Occasional distance allows us to breathe ♫

237
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:05,171
♫ And occasionally more intimate than lovers ♫

238
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,507
♫ It's getting late ♫

239
00:22:07,507 --> 00:22:09,715
♫ A couple of guests ♫

240
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:12,339
♫ Are gradually leaving ♫

241
00:22:13,043 --> 00:22:16,499
♫ This dish is specially made for you ♫

242
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:23,642
♫ Eat it while it's hot, or it will be cold ♫

243
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:32,275
♫ Stop talking, or the noodles will be cold ♫
