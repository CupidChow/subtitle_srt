70
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,336

it would surely be you.

00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,177
Why would it be me?

136
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,012

How is it strange? It's just straightforward.

159

Make a wish.

167
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,880
Make a wish, quickly.

- Cliché.

172
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,971
I hope my third book comes out soon.

173

And then my love story will never be returned.

Okay.

Idiot.

00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:25,664
You can't speak your wish out loud
or else it won't come true.

188
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,922
As for…

189
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,840
My third wish…

190
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,364
Happy Birthday.

191
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,588
♫ Occasional distance allows us to breathe ♫

192
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,120
♫ And occasionally more intimate than lovers ♫

193
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,378
♫ It's getting late ♫

194
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:53,632
♫ A couple of guests ♫

195
00:16:53,632 --> 00:16:56,416
♫ Are gradually leaving ♫

196
00:16:56,986 --> 00:17:00,544
♫ This dish is specially made for you ♫

197
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:07,392
♫ Try it while it's still hot ♫

198
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:11,282
♫ Passing each other in the wind and rain ♫

199
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:15,149
♫ Every story has its own flavor ♫

200
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:18,400
♫ I've tasted the bittersweet life ♫

201
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,980
♫ Only then do I realize
who is precious to me ♫

202
00:17:25,664 --> 00:17:30,368
[The Fourth Flavor]

203
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,359
Come on. One more.

204
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,094
Good.

205
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,272
Is it trendy now to open doors
with psychic power?

206
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:52,704
Wait for a moment.

207
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,643
Wait, I'll close the door.

208
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,312
Come, watch your step.

209
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,312
Come on, take off your shoes.

210
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:10,848
Let me turn on the light.

211
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:13,759
This way.

212
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,930
You can sit down.

213
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,031
Be careful.

214
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,620
Do I use water?

215
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,889
How much do I use?

216
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,235
Why have you been in a daze all day?

217
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,873
I'm not drunk.

218
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,375
I made this for you.

219
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,377
After all, you drank double today.

220
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,915
Drink it quickly.

221
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,587
When you meet a bottleneck,

222
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,556
you should find a subject
for a simulated experience.

223
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:27,426
Simulation experience?

224
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:38,496
So, are you willing to be
the reference object for my third book?

225
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,899
How would you arrange the first date?

226
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:08,960
Let's go watch a movie.

227
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:13,338
If the person I'm dating
is in a hurry to leave,

228
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,506
and If I want him to stay,

229
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,707
what should I do?

230
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,688
You will get easily bullied like this.

231
00:21:28,691 --> 00:21:31,340
♫ I like ♫

232
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,555
♫ The simple life with you ♫

233
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:36,147
♫ A relationship without expectation ♫

234
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,659
♫ Occasional distance allows us to breathe ♫

235
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:44,211
♫ And occasionally more intimate than lovers ♫

236
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,547
♫ It's getting late ♫

237
00:21:46,547 --> 00:21:48,755
♫ A couple of guests ♫

238
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:51,379
♫ Are gradually leaving ♫

239
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:55,539
♫ This dish is specially made for you ♫

00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:02,682
♫ Try it while it's still hot ♫

241
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:11,315
♫ Stop talking, or the noodles will be cold ♫
