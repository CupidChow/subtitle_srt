Humans have the instinct to create illusions,

4
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:53,353
making the other person get used to, depend on,

00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:55,121

Are you okay?

21
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:05,825
It's nothing.

22
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,827
It's probably just an allergy.

23
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:16,469
It's been a while since I visited the market.

24
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,304
Do you always come this early?

25
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,157
Usually, yes.

26
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,104
- Hey.
- What are you looking for today?

27
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,511
One bell pepper.

Two portions of lotus root, got it.

Boss.

You're not buying only
what I like to eat, are you?

38
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:58,211
If one person unconsciously remembers
the other's preferences,

39
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,313
it means that person really likes them.

40
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,284
This sentence is awesome.

41
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,919

42
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,826
Don't you want to know my preferences?

43
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:38,484
When you said I needed a projection object,

44
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,420
I wrote down things

45
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,854

I'm sorry.

47
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,473
I wrote them down without your permission.

48
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,609
Is it very impolite?

49
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,643

59

That's a long time.

Yes, it's like the steakhouses
where the steak sparkles as they pour wine.

If you want it to be flavorful,

63
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,628
you have to spend time simmering slowly.

He has a handsome face, doesn't he?

76
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:42,335
It's not about the appearance.

77
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,303
He seems really joyful.

00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,874
You mean that terrifying smile of his?

the experience of kissing.

I thought Lai was your friend.

But to have him take care of me?

114
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,269
I might as well be alone.

You're teaching me to observe love

128
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,253
and taking me to experience love.

129
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,755

I'll tell you the answer.

Are you still not over your cold?

141
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,045
Otherwise, why do you look so out of it today?

142
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,351
Miss Tsai, may I ask for your advice?

143
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,788
If someone takes meticulous care of you,

144
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
stays by your side when you're drunk,

145
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,858
and even does something foolish with you,

146
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,830
does that mean that person likes you?

147
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,431
Of course.

148
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,433
Why else would they waste their time?

149
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,871

00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:28,073

Let me tell you.

00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,977
The doting words you just mentioned

153
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,914
are much more attractive
than your previous works

154
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,849

Boss, where are you?

188
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,832
Liu Li is here.

189
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,737
Gu Jin.

190
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:15,341
I called you, but you didn't answer.

191
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,143
I sent you a message,
but you read it and didn't reply.

192
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:19,645
Now that I'm here in person.

193
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,348
I wonder how long you are
going to keep avoiding me.

194
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:26,685
You've gone from being the advertising director
to Boss Gu now.

195
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,254
What? Have you become more arrogant?

196
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,490
You have money to open a shop
but no money for me?

197
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,826
I'm talking to you.

198
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,961
Look at me.

199
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,280
Do you want to be like your dad?

200
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,464
Leaving me behind

201
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,033
and enjoying yourself with the money, huh?

202
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,535
Every time you come to see me,
you're asking for money.

203
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,805
How much do you owe this time?

204
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,442
What do you mean how much?

205
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:55,414
I've just borrowed a little money
from the underground lender.

206
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,884
After I make money from my investments,

207
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,619
I'll pay you back with every penny.

208
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,855
Underground lender?

209
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,358
Did you borrow money
from an underground lender?

210
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,363
I only borrowed a hundred thousand or so.

211
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,799
Why are you yelling?

212
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,841
I'll wire the money to you.

213
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,381
But could you please

214
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,718
stop doing this in the future?

215
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
I knew my darling son

216
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,075
wouldn't abandon me.

217
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,693
I'll go now.

218
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,488
Bye bye.

219
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,878
It's been a long time.

220
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,146
How have you been?

221
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,868
There are many things that we think we forgot,

222
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,637
but in fact,

223
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,273
they are still there.

224
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,901
I have been following your social media.

225
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,335
Did you notice?

226
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,972
Or are you pretending not to see?

227
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,084
Boss, you're under attack.

228
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:47,152
That Teaching Assistant is here.

229
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,388
Hurry up. Your seat is taken.

230
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,434
You've changed.

231
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,640
No, I haven't.

232
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,176
I just haven't seen you for a long time,
Teaching Assistant,

233
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,312
so I feel a bit tense.

234
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,513
Teaching Assistant.

235
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,715
You're still calling me that after graduation.

236
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,188
Were you just close by or passing by?

237
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,556
What a coincidence.

238
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,860
It's not a coincidence.

239
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:31,830
It was intentional.

240
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,944
It's been two years.

241
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,181
Does this confession still count?

242
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:49,952
[A Hope Shaped Like a Rainbow]

243
00:20:54,336 --> 00:21:00,544
♫ No need to respond. I understand everything ♫

244
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:04,916
♫ How I wish to hold you in my arms ♫

245
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:08,190
♫ To laugh with you and be crazy with you ♫

246
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,914
♫ I'd rather be left in pain ♫

247
00:21:11,914 --> 00:21:15,107
♫ I smile and say, take care ♫

248
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,509
I want to start a new story,

249
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,511
but the old drama drags on.

250
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,252
The chapter I wanted to give up

251
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,222
suddenly continues…

252
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:43,680
♫ The plot moves forward to
the next section of happiness ♫

253
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:51,008
♫ Don't bother, don't turn around.
The past is worth talking about ♫

254
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,779
Sorry, Teaching Assistant.

255
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,314
What did you just say?

256
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,237
Let's start over.

257
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,724
This time, I'll chase you.

258
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:38,524
It was his place originally.

259
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,925
So I should return it.

260
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,962
If you let go now, you'll regret it later.

261
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:50,001
Do you have something to say to me?

262
00:22:58,788 --> 00:23:01,437
♫ I like ♫

263
00:23:01,437 --> 00:23:03,652
♫ The simple life with you ♫

264
00:23:03,652 --> 00:23:06,244
♫ A relationship without expectation ♫

265
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:10,756
♫ Occasional distance allows us to breathe ♫

266
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:14,308
♫ And occasionally more intimate than lovers ♫

267
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:16,644
♫ It's getting late ♫

268
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,852
♫ A couple of guests ♫

269
00:23:18,852 --> 00:23:21,476
♫ Afraid of leaving ♫

270
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,636
♫ This dish is specially made for you ♫

271
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:32,779
♫ Try it while it's still hot ♫

272
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:41,412
♫ Stop talking, or the noodles will be cold ♫
