1
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:45,083
<i>Jeez! Why do I have to</i>
<i>make curry with him?</i>

2
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,750
<i>I'm hopping mad.</i>

3
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,125
<i>Gosh…</i>

4
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,625
<i>Hey, let go.</i>

5
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,041
<i>I couldn't possibly do that.</i>

6
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,916
<i>Come closer to me.</i>

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,916
<i>Oh, my…</i>

8
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,750
TAKAGI-SAN

9
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,458
Wait…

10
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,291
H-Hello, Takagi-san<i>.</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,750
<i>Hi, Nishikata. Been a while.</i>

12
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:20,916
Y-Yeah, it has.

13
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,791
What's up?

14
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,083
<i>Nothing, just wondering</i>
<i>what you were doing.</i>

15
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:31,750
Nothing, really.
I was about to go to sleep.

16
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,250
100% UNREQUITED LOVE

17
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:36,666
<i>I thought you might be watching</i>
<i>the 100 UL anime.</i>

18
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,791
100 UL?

19
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:40,916
100…

20
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:44,291
Oh, <i>100% Unrequited Love.</i>

21
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,916
I remember that.
It was super popular in middle school.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,291
<i>Did I guess right?</i>

23
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:01,375
<i>Oh, by the way, Nishikata,</i>

24
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:05,666
<i>I'm going back to where I wanted to go,</i>
<i>to study drawing.</i>

25
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,791
-Where you wanted to go?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

26
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,416
Okay.

27
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:18,583
You're back from Paris,
and you go to college in Tokyo right now?

28
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,208
<i>That's right.</i>

29
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,125
So you're going back then.

30
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:26,500
For a long time?

31
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,125
<i>I don't know.</i>

32
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,916
<i>Maybe three weeks.</i>

33
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,833
Three weeks…

34
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:36,125
Good luck.

35
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:37,666
<i>Thanks.</i>

36
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,000
THANK YOU, YEAR 2 CLASS 3!

37
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:45,666
<i>Takagi-san and I</i>
<i>were classmates in middle school.</i>

38
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,208
CHECK THE HALL

39
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,333
<i>She was always teasing me back then.</i>

40
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,458
<i>I swore that I'd get back at her someday.</i>

41
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:02,875
<i>I kept telling myself that,</i>
<i>but it was always her teasing me.</i>

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,291
Nishikata.

43
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,291
Nishikata.

44
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:14,041
I can't even get a better fortune?!

45
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,750
Dang it.

46
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:23,208
<i>So when I heard</i>
<i>that Takagi-san was moving to Paris,</i>

47
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:28,166
<i>I figured she was just teasing me again.</i>

48
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,583
Bye!

49
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:33,458
See you!

50
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,458
-Bye!
-See you!

51
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,000
Takagi-san!

52
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,916
Thank you!

53
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,166
Takagi-san!

54
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,000
Takagi-san!

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,666
Takagi-san!

56
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,458
<i>That was the summer</i>
<i>of my third year of middle school.</i>

57
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,708
<i>It's been ten years since then.</i>

58
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,125
Mornin'.

59
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,208
Mornin'.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,500
-Mornin'.
-Good morning.

61
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:55,958
<i>And now, I'm the gym teacher</i>
<i>at my old middle school.</i>

62
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,625
Keep your chin down. It'll be easier.

63
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,500
Good, Sakai.

64
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:03,791
Keep it up.

65
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,250
-Hello.
-Hello.

66
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:11,375
Hey! No running in the halls.

67
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,541
-Okay.
-Okay.

68
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,208
You're still running!

69
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,458
Sheesh.

70
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,541
Hello.

71
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,083
Hello.

72
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,250
-Nakai, what are you doing?
-I'm sorry.

73
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,291
Oh, it's just you, Nishikata.

74
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:41,750
Is that for the wedding?

75
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:47,208
Yeah, there's the seating chart
and other stuff to decide.

76
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,750
Mano's not good with stuff like this.

77
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,208
Oh, yeah,
she doesn't seem like she'd enjoy it.

78
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,958
We still on for tonight?

79
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,708
You mean, the party?

80
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,750
The wedding prep/class reunion?

81
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:10,833
Yeah.

82
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:16,625
I'm looking forward to seeing
everyone from middle school.

83
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,458
-Yeah.
-Yep.

84
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,458
-What are you two doing during work hours?
-Sorry.

85
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,250
-Hey, Nishikata.
-Yes.

86
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:30,875
I'm putting you in charge
of the trainee teacher coming tomorrow.

87
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,041
-Huh?
-It's all in your hands.

88
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:38,083
Give them some good tips, Mr. Nishikata.

89
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,666
Why me?

90
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,916
-Wanna go to the arcade?
-Sure.

91
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,625
-Bye.
-Bye.

92
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,083
-Be careful going home.
-Okay.

93
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,375
-Good.
-How much are you going to spend?

94
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't just leave it out like this.

95
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:29,541
Excellent reaction as always.

96
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,375
Takagi-san?

97
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,958
It's been ages. How have you been?

98
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,708
H-Hold on…

99
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,708
What are you doing here?

100
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,708
I'm the trainee teacher starting tomorrow.

101
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:50,000
The trainee teacher?

102
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,708
Wait, what?

103
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:57,500
What do you mean?
I told you over the phone the other day.

104
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,250
Hold on a second.

105
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,541
I thought you said you were going back
to Paris to study drawing?

106
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,083
I never said that.

107
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sure I clearly told you

108
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:13,958
that I was going back where I wanted to go
to study drawing.

109
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,291
Where you wanted to go back?

110
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,333
I even gave you a hint.

111
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,666
I said, "Three weeks."

112
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:29,208
Three weeks?

113
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:35,875
You mean, the training period?

114
00:08:37,666 --> 00:08:39,166
You finally got it.

115
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:41,958
Oh, wow.

116
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:45,250
Mr. Tanabe and Nakai
are going to be so surprised.

117
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,500
Everyone else knows already.

118
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:50,291
What?

119
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,375
I asked them to keep it secret.

120
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:57,458
I asked them not to tell you I was coming.

121
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,541
I'm the only one who didn't know?

122
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,500
This brings back memories.

123
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,250
Huh?

124
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:27,416
What?

125
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:33,875
Well…

126
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,875
It's a pleasure to have you.

127
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,333
No.

128
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,625
The broom. Give it here, I'll put it away.

129
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,875
The broom. Right.

130
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,666
The broom.

131
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,791
Wait a minute.

132
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,083
Did you want to hold my hand?

133
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,750
No.

134
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,000
No.

135
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,833
Come on, let's go.

136
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:08,375
What? Wait.

137
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,875
Hey, where are we going?

138
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,166
You'll see soon.

139
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
Wait.

140
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,500
Hey, wait. No running in the halls!

141
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,208
Hold on.

142
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:32,125
So, where are we going?

143
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,208
Hey, where's your bicycle?

144
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,541
My bike?

145
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:42,333
I'm going drinking with Nakai tonight,
so I left it behind.

146
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,541
It's sort of a reunion.

147
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:53,791
Wait, is it because you've come back?

148
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,625
We've still got time. Let's take a walk.

149
00:10:58,916 --> 00:10:59,916
What?

150
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,333
This is great.

151
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,625
You can't beat an island.

152
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,000
Really? Nothing changes, though.

153
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:14,833
That's exactly what I like about it.

154
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,166
Really?

155
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,208
Do you remember?

156
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,791
We sat here and listened to
the <i>100% Unrequited Love</i> theme song.

157
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,666
We shared a pair of earphones.

158
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,833
Yeah, I remember.

159
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:33,458
The waves were too loud for speakers,
so we shared the earphones.

160
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:36,458
You remember that?

161
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,125
It must be because you liked it.

162
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,833
That's not why.

163
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,375
And you did that on purpose, anyway.

164
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:49,125
You used the same earphones
to embarrass me.

165
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,416
You brought me here just to tease me.

166
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:57,458
No, I just wanted to
listen to the song with you.

167
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,875
You did?

168
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,958
You were embarrassed?

169
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,625
Huh?

170
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,750
You were embarrassed
to share the earphones?

171
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,833
No…

172
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,625
I wasn't embarrassed.
It's just that, sharing earphones is like…

173
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:17,333
Like what?

174
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,000
Like lovebirds?

175
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,958
No, not like that.

176
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Okay, then.

177
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,083
Here.

178
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,125
What?

179
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,125
You're still using wired earphones?

180
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,708
Yeah, I prefer them.
We can be close when we listen together.

181
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,083
Hurry up, sit. Come on.

182
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,916
No, it's fine. I'm good.

183
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,333
So you <i>are</i> embarrassed.

184
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,416
I'm not.

185
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:58,083
Embarrassed to be so close to me,
like lovebirds.

186
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,333
I'll listen alone then--

187
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,583
Okay, fine, I'll listen.

188
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,083
I'll listen, all right?

189
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:08,708
Here.

190
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:30,958
Ready?

191
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Yeah.

192
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,083
KYUN SEKKIN!!

193
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,833
<i>100% Unrequited Love</i>

194
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
<i>I lock eyes with him after school</i>

195
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,500
<i>There he goes, teasing like always</i>

196
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:53,833
<i>I want to act normal</i>
<i>But I just can seem to</i>

197
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,458
<i>Gah!</i>

198
00:13:55,541 --> 00:14:00,625
<i>I know that I can be careless</i>

199
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:05,666
<i>I can't ever tell him</i>
<i>How I feel I've been caught off-guard</i>

200
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,916
<i>Oh!</i>

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,916
<i>Heart beating, beating</i>
<i>Thump, thump</i>

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,833
<i>It's a counterattack of love</i>

203
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:16,500
<i>I just want to tell him honestly</i>

204
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,000
<i>I love you, I love you so much</i>

205
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,791
<i>Heart beating, beating</i>
<i>Thump, thump</i>

206
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,083
<i>Just where is love right now?</i>

207
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:29,583
<i>Unrequited love, requited love miracle</i>

208
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:35,916
<i>Unrequited love, requited love miracle</i>

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,791
<i>Thump, thump!</i>

210
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:40,916
There!

211
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:55,000
Yum!

212
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,958
I remember this.

213
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,041
These noodles are the best.

214
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:05,500
I'm sorry.
She made me promise not to tell.

215
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,041
Yeah, but still…

216
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,958
Excuse me! Another beer!

217
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,125
Sure!

218
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,208
Hamaguchi, you've had too many.

219
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:19,291
Shut up.
I can't endure this without a drink.

220
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,458
What's wrong with him?

221
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,500
He broke up with Hojo again.

222
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,208
Again?

223
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:30,083
What is this, the third time? Fourth?

224
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,541
How long has it been?

225
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,500
I moved the summer of third year so…

226
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,333
Exactly ten years, I think.

227
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,791
Really?

228
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,125
You haven't ever split up
in these ten years?

229
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:49,125
Nope. Isn't that so?

230
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,833
Yeah, I don't think we have.

231
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,083
Do you ever fight?

232
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,000
Yep, a lot.

233
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,500
What about?

234
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,041
Really trivial stuff.

235
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,166
Right?

236
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,166
Mano took forever to pick a wedding dress.

237
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,583
I want it to be perfect.
I only get one wedding, after all.

238
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,708
Yeah, but they're all the same.

239
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:18,041
Can you believe this?

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,958
You're so cute
that everything looks good on you.

241
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,458
Oh, Nakai!

242
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:33,250
Are you two flirting with each other?

243
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,708
No, but we do fight often.

244
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:39,125
The closer you are, the more you fight.

245
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,291
That's right.
You know exactly what to say, Takagi-san.

246
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:48,125
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Hojo.

247
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,125
I know we're always fighting--

248
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,333
No way.

249
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:55,041
I haven't finished saying
what I wanted to.

250
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,791
You just want to get back together.

251
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,250
See? You know exactly how I feel.

252
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,750
-She dumped him?
-Definitely.

253
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,666
We're so in sync, right?

254
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,000
You see this?

255
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,208
You're so close.

256
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:11,958
-Yeah!
-We are not!

257
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,458
Hojo.

258
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,416
Enough already,
I can't bear to watch this.

259
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:22,125
Didn't you and Takagi-san date
back in middle school?

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,125
No. Why would you think that?

261
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,083
I remember you two were always together.

262
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,541
We weren't always together.

263
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:35,500
We just lived in the same area.

264
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:39,583
Did you not see each other
after Takagi got back from Paris?

265
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,958
I was going to visit her
when I went to Tokyo.

266
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:47,083
Oh, I heard about that.

267
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:51,958
You got so worked up about
seeing her again that you got a fever.

268
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,916
No. It wasn't because I was worked up.

269
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:57,708
It was the mumps.

270
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,916
The mumps?

271
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,083
Can adults even get mumps?

272
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,458
Well, I did. That's why I couldn't go.

273
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,708
That's so like you.

274
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,166
You're jinxed.

275
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,583
How uncool.

276
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,583
Wait a minute…

277
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,166
That's a bit extreme.

278
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,041
That was so good.

279
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,375
-Thanks so much.
-Thank you so much.

280
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,458
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

281
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,875
It's cool, I'm fine.

282
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,500
-Drink some water.
-I'm fine.

283
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:40,833
You're stumbling.

284
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,416
Okay, I'm going this way.

285
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Bye.

286
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,750
-Nishikata.
-Huh?

287
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,541
What is it, Takagi-san?

288
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,083
What? I'm going this way too.

289
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:03,583
What?

290
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,375
Really?

291
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,416
Yeah.

292
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:18,250
Where are you staying?

293
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:23,291
A guest house
close to where I used to live.

294
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:25,833
Up near the olive orchard.

295
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,541
Oh, I think I've heard about that place.

296
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,250
Yeah.

297
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,750
Well, I'm going this way.

298
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,625
Okay.

299
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,875
What?

300
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:52,375
Nothing, I'm just happy.

301
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,333
About what?

302
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:56,541
That nothing's changed.

303
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,500
You mean, the island?

304
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,041
Yeah, I guess the island too.

305
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,583
What?

306
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Nothing.

307
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,333
-I'll be going then.
-Nishikata?

308
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,791
Huh? What?

309
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:16,916
Close your eyes.

310
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,708
What? Why?

311
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,208
Just do it.

312
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,791
Why, though?

313
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,791
Come on, hurry up!

314
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,875
Okay, okay, I'll close my eyes.

315
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,666
Huh?

316
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,291
Takagi-san?

317
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:57,750
Nishikata!

318
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,375
Huh?

319
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,625
Did your heart skip a beat?

320
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,333
Of course not.

321
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:13,875
See you tomorrow.

322
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,500
See you tomorrow.

323
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:37,500
See you tomorrow, huh?

324
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,250
YEAR 2 CLASS 3

325
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:51,791
I'll only be here for three weeks,
but I look forward to teaching you.

326
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,083
Welcome.

327
00:21:58,166 --> 00:21:59,958
That's all for homeroom.

328
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,541
Ozeki, you're the leader today.

329
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,458
Okay. Stand up.

330
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,875
Bow.

331
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:13,041
Thank you.

332
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,250
Looks good.

333
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:23,125
Kitada, pay more attention
to this part here.

334
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,208
Okay.

335
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,625
Well done, Yasukawa.

336
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:40,708
But what about the nose?

337
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:42,583
Oh, you're right.

338
00:22:50,541 --> 00:22:53,916
You know their names already?

339
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:57,375
Yeah, I memorized them all.

340
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:00,458
Wow.

341
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:05,625
Ms. Takagi, can you draw something too?

342
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:07,791
Me?

343
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, I want to see you draw.

344
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,625
-Me too.
-Yeah, me too.

345
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,208
Really?

346
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:18,083
Well then…

347
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,750
Mr. Nishikata?

348
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,875
Yes?

349
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,625
Would you model for me?

350
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:26,875
Me?

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,750
-She's amazing.
-Isn't she?

352
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:52,083
I can't draw you
if you don't look at me, Mr. Nishikata.

353
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,708
Okay.

354
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,583
I think I'm done.

355
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:28,708
That's amazing.

356
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:31,791
What is that, though?

357
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:34,166
Huh? What?

358
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,250
You're blushing.

359
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,291
My cheeks aren't that red.

360
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:44,666
They are.

361
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,958
No, they're not.

362
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,625
You were really in Paris?

363
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:53,583
Yes, from age 14 to 20.

364
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,166
-Wow.
-That's so cool.

365
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:58,875
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

366
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,958
Can I ask you something?

367
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,750
Go ahead.

368
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:06,875
How can I learn to draw as well as you?

369
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:13,708
With lots of practice.

370
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,458
You have to really study your subject.

371
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,958
And be eager to learn more.

372
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,208
Be eager to learn more.

373
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,208
Thank you.

374
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:29,416
No problem.

375
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:41,500
-It's great.
-It can beat yours.

376
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,291
It's much better than yours.

377
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,541
You've never seen my drawings.

378
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,916
No, but I get the feeling it's better.

379
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,750
You get the feeling, huh? Come on.

380
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,791
Wait a sec.

381
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,708
Hi, Machida.

382
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,916
Well, here's your classwork.

383
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,916
And I need you to give this
to your parents.

384
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Okay.

385
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:30,958
Thanks.

386
00:26:32,375 --> 00:26:35,458
I'll come by again next week.

387
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:38,791
<i>Machida is a special case.</i>

388
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,958
<i>He prefers being on his own.</i>

389
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:46,708
During breaks,
he'd go off to a corner of the campus.

390
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:50,375
Sometimes he'd draw on the roof.

391
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,291
But he hasn't been to school lately.

392
00:26:54,833 --> 00:26:55,916
I see.

393
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,750
You must be worried.

394
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,291
Yeah.

395
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,583
Do you think…

396
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:22,833
that kids
absolutely have to attend school?

397
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,208
Why do you ask?

398
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,333
Well, in Machida's case,

399
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:34,666
all the other teachers are looking for
a way to get him to attend his classes.

400
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,583
Yeah.

401
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:41,958
But I don't think
school is an absolute must.

402
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,708
It's a weird opinion to have,
especially as a teacher.

403
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:55,083
But that's what I think
when it comes to Machida.

404
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:02,041
I really love Machida's drawings.

405
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:12,458
You're a good teacher, Nishikata.

406
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,333
Huh? You think?

407
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:18,625
You're cool.

408
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:22,750
What? Why did you say that? Quit it.

409
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:25,416
What? What's wrong?

410
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,583
I just said you were cool.

411
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:30,375
I'm not used to being told that.

412
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:32,791
You're not?

413
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,583
Nishikata, you're so cool!

414
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,916
Hey, don't tease me.

415
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,125
Go get the ball.

416
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:48,375
One more time.

417
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:54,666
Switch places.

418
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:56,541
Switch.

419
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,041
Ready?

420
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,583
You saw them, right?

421
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,750
I guess…

422
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,541
And not just once?

423
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,208
Yeah…

424
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,125
A few times.

425
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,166
Could you talk to them, please?

426
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,083
All right, I'll have a word with them.

427
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,416
Thank you.

428
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,291
Excuse us.

429
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:24,291
Excuse us.

430
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:27,125
-Hello there.
-Hello.

431
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:31,500
It's so hot today.

432
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:32,750
Yeah, really is.

433
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:36,500
I'm so glad that the test is over though.

434
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:42,791
That's Itagaki and Kitada
from our class, right?

435
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,500
Yeah.

436
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:49,166
I was asked to talk to them
about after-school snacking.

437
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:51,875
I see.

438
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,541
Still…

439
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,750
Hey, there's going to be fireworks.
Want to go?

440
00:29:58,291 --> 00:29:59,125
Yeah.

441
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,541
It's hard to tell them off.

442
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,666
I want to get cotton candy.

443
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:11,750
I can't wait.

444
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,083
They're holding hands.

445
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:36,958
They kissed!

446
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:43,250
It's just like us in middle school.

447
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:47,250
What? We never kissed!

448
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,166
Come on.

449
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:58,000
Hey, you two.

450
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,416
You can't buy snacks.

451
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,708
Mr. Nishikata.

452
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,458
Sorry.

453
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:06,208
How long have you been watching us?

454
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,291
I was just walking by.

455
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,125
-I'm on patrol.
-Patrol?

456
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,791
-That's kinda odd.
-Yeah, it's strange.

457
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,500
Why is it odd?
Teachers often go on patrol.

458
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,208
It's tough being a teacher.

459
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,666
They should hang out somewhere else.

460
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:41,750
You shouldn't have bought that.
You're setting a poor example.

461
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:44,000
I'm an adult.

462
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,708
Yeah, but…

463
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:54,083
Do you go on dates around here?

464
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,208
No, definitely not.

465
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:58,625
Why not?

466
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,166
Well, because…

467
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,041
It'd be awkward if the kids saw me.

468
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:04,666
They'd tease me.

469
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:06,958
Huh.

470
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,791
So you only like getting teased by me.

471
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:13,041
I don't like it.

472
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:30,125
When you become a teacher,
you can't go on dates around here.

473
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,958
You wouldn't want the kids teasing you.

474
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:38,833
Well, depends on who I date.

475
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,791
Huh?

476
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:46,000
If it were someone
I could see myself growing old with,

477
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,541
I wouldn't mind it.

478
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:51,875
Grow old with someone?

479
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:54,416
Yeah, that's right.

480
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,583
You mean, like…

481
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:02,958
For example…

482
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:08,666
The person you're going to marry?

483
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:12,583
Yeah, I guess so.

484
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:19,916
<i>Grow old with someone.</i>

485
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,541
They kissed.

486
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,833
Huh? What?

487
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,708
Those two kissed.

488
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,583
Yeah.

489
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:49,791
Are you the type
to kiss your date out in public?

490
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:52,333
Whoa, wait. What's this about?

491
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,083
Well? Would you?

492
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:58,625
Of course not.

493
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:01,916
I see.

494
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,666
What about holding hands in public?

495
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,541
Yeah, I guess I would.

496
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:12,458
You'd hold hands?

497
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:14,666
Holding hands is fine.

498
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,958
Isn't it? Do you not do that?

499
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,041
It's not that I don't do it.

500
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,125
I think holding hands is fine.

501
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,791
Still…

502
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:33,958
I don't really like kissing
in front of others.

503
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:35,875
Yeah.

504
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,375
It's best to do it in private.

505
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:40,666
Yeah, that's right.

506
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,500
I mean… Yeah.

507
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,291
I think so too.

508
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,083
Wait, why are we talking about this?

509
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,125
You know…

510
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,958
we're alone right now.

511
00:34:57,416 --> 00:34:59,583
Huh? What?!

512
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,708
Huh?

513
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,000
I guess I'll avoid kissing anyone
in town then.

514
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,166
I'll settle for holding hands.

515
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:13,666
You mean, like me and you…

516
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,500
If my boyfriend wants to hold hands.

517
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,583
Right, your boyfriend.

518
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,625
You're getting the wrong idea again.

519
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,791
I'm not.

520
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,708
Good.

521
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,041
Mano!

522
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:46,333
Congratulations!

523
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:51,125
Here goes.

524
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:53,916
One, two…

525
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,000
Takagi!

526
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,416
Lucky you!

527
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,875
I'm so happy!

528
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,083
You did it!

529
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,291
I caught it.

530
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,666
Nishikata, what do you think?

531
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
How do I look?

532
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,166
Nishikata?

533
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:26,166
Nishikata.

534
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:36,958
Love is important,
but love alone won't last.

535
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,916
Mutual respect for each other,

536
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,833
faithfulness,

537
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,958
or even just humor.

538
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:51,083
You have to feel like
this person is special to you.

539
00:36:52,458 --> 00:36:56,250
Like it's a relationship
you couldn't have with anyone else.

540
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,166
So if you meet someone special,
tell them how you feel.

541
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,333
No regrets.

542
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:08,625
Got it?

543
00:37:08,708 --> 00:37:09,750
-Yes.
-Yes.

544
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,541
Just kidding.

545
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,500
Hey now. Oh man.

546
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,750
I sound like a teacher.

547
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,250
Though I am a teacher.

548
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:27,875
Got it, Hamaguchi?

549
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:29,083
Ow!

550
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,750
-Mr. Tanabe.
-What is it, Mano?

551
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:38,500
Now that I think about it,
I never got a proper proposal.

552
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,833
We've dated since middle school,

553
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:46,833
so the closest thing to a proposal was,
"I guess we should get married."

554
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,208
Is this true, Nakai?

555
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:56,041
I guess I never did really propose to her.

556
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,791
Did you want me to? Sorry.

557
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,000
Of course I did.

558
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,750
I'll propose then.

559
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:09,375
I love you Mano,
and I want to be with you--

560
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:10,500
Slow down.

561
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:13,166
You're going too fast, and you're sitting.

562
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,791
There's a proper way to do this, you know?

563
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,208
You have to take a deep breath first.

564
00:38:19,291 --> 00:38:21,708
And how'd you say it so smoothly?

565
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,750
You need to be a little nervous.

566
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,416
Nervous?

567
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,208
Do I really need to be nervous?

568
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:29,708
You're so dull.

569
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,666
Don't say that.

570
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:37,958
Enough. That's enough already.

571
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,875
Let's not do this in front of everyone,
it's embarrassing.

572
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:44,208
I'll propose to you. Let me do it.

573
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,291
Stand up.

574
00:38:46,166 --> 00:38:47,166
Come on.

575
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
I love you, Mano.

576
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:10,333
So please stay with me forever.

577
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:14,083
Mano, you're kinda funny.

578
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,791
What do you mean, kinda funny?

579
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,791
Nice!

580
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:28,083
Why are you crying, Mr. Tanabe?

581
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,458
Congrats.

582
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,125
-Nakai, did you eat?
-I did, thanks.

583
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,333
It's your turn next.

584
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:54,416
What?

585
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:58,416
You and Takagi-san.

586
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,875
No, no, we're not like that.

587
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:06,208
You're okay with her dating someone else?

588
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,750
Like who?

589
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:10,291
I don't know.

590
00:40:11,625 --> 00:40:12,750
A French guy.

591
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,750
A French guy?

592
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:23,333
Did you hear something from Mano?

593
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:24,875
Nope.

594
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,041
But you know,

595
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:31,083
I wouldn't be surprised if she was.

596
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,583
Dating…

597
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,541
Nakai!

598
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:39,583
See you later, Nishikata.

599
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:42,833
Huh?

600
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:47,625
They think your proposal was wonderful.

601
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:48,750
Really?

602
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:53,458
She was so cute.

603
00:40:53,541 --> 00:40:55,750
She really was.

604
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,500
Dating…

605
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:05,250
<i>Are you dating someone, Takagi-san?</i>

606
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:24,166
Hojo!

607
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:34,708
Oops.

608
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:45,708
Nishikata!

609
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,041
Takagi-san.

610
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,958
It still looks okay.

611
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,333
-What's he doing?
-I have no idea.

612
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,458
Hojo, take this.

613
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:12,708
Whoa! Why?

614
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,333
Why'd you jump in?

615
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:21,208
Idiot!

616
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,458
You're such an idiot, Nishikata.

617
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,000
Here.

618
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,750
Thank you.

619
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:46,916
Don't copy me.

620
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,625
I'm not.

621
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,583
-See? You are.
-Am not.

622
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:54,958
-Are too.
-Am not.

623
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:58,250
Don't copy me.

624
00:43:58,333 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm not.

625
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:00,791
-You are.
-What?

626
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,000
See!

627
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:12,208
<i>Does Takagi-san have a boyfriend?</i>

628
00:44:15,791 --> 00:44:20,000
<i>I wouldn't be surprised if she did.</i>

629
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,375
Takagi-san?

630
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:30,875
So…

631
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:32,708
What?

632
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Actually…

633
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,750
What?

634
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,041
Well…

635
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,708
Takagi-san, do you…

636
00:44:56,791 --> 00:44:57,916
So, Nishikata…

637
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,500
Do you have a girlfriend?

638
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,875
What? Why do you ask?

639
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:05,958
Just wondering.

640
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,541
So, do you?

641
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:12,541
No. Does it look like I do?

642
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,958
I don't know.

643
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,333
I wouldn't be surprised if you did.

644
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:20,791
Really?

645
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,333
Yeah, really.

646
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:30,291
Hey, hey, that wasn't cool.

647
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:36,625
I can never tell
if you're teasing me or not.

648
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,166
I don't.

649
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,750
What?

650
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,583
I don't have a boyfriend either.

651
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,208
I didn't ask.

652
00:45:58,875 --> 00:46:02,916
Really? I swear I thought you did.

653
00:46:03,833 --> 00:46:04,833
Guess not.

654
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,083
<i>Heart beating, beating</i>

655
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,250
<i>Thump, thump</i>

656
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:31,541
<i>Just where is love right now?</i>

657
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Takagi-san?

658
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:48,833
Yes?

659
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:53,541
Will you come watch the fireworks with me?

660
00:46:54,875 --> 00:46:55,875
What?

661
00:46:58,041 --> 00:46:59,041
The fireworks.

662
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:01,916
Well?

663
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:11,000
Are you asking me out on a date?

664
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,750
Yeah.

665
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,583
No, no, not like that.

666
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,291
Not like that.

667
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,708
Patrol! We'll be patrolling.

668
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,750
We'll be watching over the kids there.

669
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,000
What do you think?

670
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:37,875
Okay.

671
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:39,791
Let's go then.

672
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,250
Okay.

673
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,250
Mine's better.

674
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,375
That's best.

675
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:29,125
Well?

676
00:48:35,041 --> 00:48:36,750
I'm studying the subject.

677
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,625
It looks good.

678
00:49:04,166 --> 00:49:05,250
Hi.

679
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,125
You're Machida, right?

680
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:12,166
Hello.

681
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:16,291
I'm Takagi,
a trainee teacher at the school.

682
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:21,583
I saw you the other day
when Mr. Nishikata delivered your papers.

683
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,000
That's beautiful.

684
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,750
Mr. Nishikata said he loves your drawings.

685
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:23,625
Hey.

686
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,833
What is Nishikata like as a teacher?

687
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,083
Nishikata?

688
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,416
You can speak!

689
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:39,333
Nishikata and I
were classmates in middle school.

690
00:50:40,625 --> 00:50:42,666
We went to your school too.

691
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:44,833
Really?

692
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:53,416
Mr. Nishikata is a weirdo.

693
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:56,416
A weirdo?

694
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,708
But I like that about him.

695
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:01,750
He doesn't force me to go to school.

696
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,541
I see.

697
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:15,083
Do you ever draw people?

698
00:51:15,833 --> 00:51:17,208
Or only landscapes?

699
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,333
I don't like them.

700
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:22,500
People?

701
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:25,000
Yeah. They're a pain.

702
00:51:29,458 --> 00:51:33,875
And you can be by yourself
when you're drawing…

703
00:51:34,708 --> 00:51:37,416
without needing to think
about anything else.

704
00:51:39,083 --> 00:51:40,291
Something like that?

705
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,708
Yeah, something like that.

706
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:47,000
I was like that too.

707
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:55,458
My family moved to Paris for work
when I was in middle school.

708
00:51:56,916 --> 00:51:59,166
I was really lonely at first.

709
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:03,541
But as time went by,

710
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:07,833
I went to a lot of museums
and saw so many pictures.

711
00:52:09,875 --> 00:52:13,750
I started to like drawing more and more.

712
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:23,250
When I was drawing,
I could forget about my loneliness.

713
00:52:25,708 --> 00:52:31,083
I started to dream about
making a living with art.

714
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,041
I went to school for it.

715
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:40,666
But then,

716
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:47,291
I stopped being able to draw
purely for the love of it.

717
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:56,625
But the other day,
I drew with all the students in class.

718
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,750
Everyone paired up and drew each other.

719
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:05,000
That was so much fun.

720
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:09,041
Who did you draw?

721
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:11,291
Huh?

722
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:13,958
Why do you ask?

723
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:17,416
It's so obvious.

724
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,875
Hey, don't tease me.

725
00:53:25,708 --> 00:53:26,791
What about him?

726
00:53:27,708 --> 00:53:28,708
Huh?

727
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,625
Mr. Nishikata and you…

728
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,541
What did you say your name was?

729
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:35,833
Takagi.

730
00:53:37,125 --> 00:53:39,750
What does he think about you, Ms. Takagi?

731
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:45,250
I don't know.

732
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:48,500
That's great.

733
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:52,083
Enjoying your youth.

734
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,875
Hey.

735
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:04,458
Machida, what are you doing tomorrow?

736
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,875
I don't have any plans.

737
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,583
Why do you ask?

738
00:54:14,416 --> 00:54:16,625
-What is it?
-You'll see.

739
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,833
What is it, Ozeki?

740
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Mr. Nishikata…

741
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:39,500
Sorry to take up your time.

742
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:41,625
Don't worry about that.

743
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,416
What is it?

744
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,666
Well…

745
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,958
It's my fault.

746
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:12,041
It's my fault
Machida stopped coming to school.

747
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:15,875
What?

748
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:24,291
<i>I have a crush on Machida.</i>

749
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:31,208
<i>Back when he was still coming to school,</i>
<i>I told him about it.</i>

750
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,916
<i>And I think…</i>

751
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:41,500
<i>I don't think he likes that kind of stuff.</i>

752
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,000
<i>It must be a pain.</i>

753
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:49,083
<i>That's why he stopped coming to school.</i>

754
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:54,125
<i>So it's my fault.</i>

755
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:05,291
Isn't it a great view?

756
00:56:06,583 --> 00:56:07,583
Sure is.

757
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:10,208
Wait.

758
00:56:11,125 --> 00:56:12,625
You've been here before?

759
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:15,375
Yeah.

760
00:56:16,291 --> 00:56:17,458
Really?

761
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,791
I bet you know lots of nice places.

762
00:56:29,583 --> 00:56:30,708
Follow me then.

763
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:32,833
What?

764
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,541
Well? Is this your first time here?

765
00:57:21,416 --> 00:57:22,416
Yeah.

766
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:25,791
Then I win.

767
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,458
Was it a contest?

768
00:57:52,166 --> 00:57:53,458
You're not drawing?

769
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,541
No.

770
00:57:59,416 --> 00:58:01,416
I don't feel the need right now.

771
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:11,041
They say if you climb those stairs
with the person you like,

772
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,875
you'll become a couple.

773
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:14,916
Did you know that?

774
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,000
Because there are 415 steps to the top.

775
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,083
415 stands for "Love will thrive."

776
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,333
So you did know that!

777
00:58:25,291 --> 00:58:27,083
Did you climb up here with someone?

778
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:31,583
I got dragged up here
before I knew what it meant.

779
00:58:34,583 --> 00:58:38,208
Ten years later,
and everyone still does the same thing.

780
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,333
What?

781
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,541
Oh, nothing.

782
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:56,958
Did…

783
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:03,791
Did Machida say that to you?

784
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,708
Huh?

785
00:59:07,333 --> 00:59:11,833
Did he say he doesn't want to
come to school because of you?

786
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,458
No…

787
00:59:16,208 --> 00:59:19,000
He didn't say it straight out, but…

788
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,041
I'm sure it's true.

789
00:59:30,375 --> 00:59:31,708
You think so?

790
00:59:34,333 --> 00:59:37,458
I think there's more to it than that.

791
00:59:38,791 --> 00:59:41,541
Especially in Machida's heart.

792
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:47,375
I'm not Machida, so I can't speak for him.

793
00:59:54,958 --> 00:59:56,541
<i>Is that why?</i>

794
00:59:58,041 --> 00:59:59,166
What do you mean?

795
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:04,125
Things became awkward
because you knew she liked you,

796
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:07,375
so you stopped going to school?

797
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:09,833
I don't know.

798
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,875
But that's part of it?

799
01:00:15,208 --> 01:00:19,833
Even if that hadn't happened,
I would have stopped going to school.

800
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:24,875
I see.

801
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,208
You turned her down?

802
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,500
What?

803
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,583
He never turned me down.

804
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,416
He never turned me down,

805
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:49,458
so that's probably why
I feel like it was my fault.

806
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,750
Maybe I wanted it to be my fault.

807
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:11,666
Maybe I just wanted to feel like I had
some kind of impact on Machida's life.

808
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:20,916
Did you say to her,

809
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:26,916
"I'm sorry. I don't want to date you."

810
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,791
No, she said she liked me

811
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:33,250
and then ran off
before I could say anything.

812
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:38,125
How cute.

813
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:45,125
She might be worried, you know.

814
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:47,083
About what?

815
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:54,916
She might think you stopped
going to school because of her.

816
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,166
But it's not my fault if she thinks that.

817
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,291
What?

818
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:11,208
She just went and had a crush on me,
and then ran off after telling me.

819
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,833
Even if she does think
I stopped going because of her,

820
01:02:17,291 --> 01:02:22,208
it's not my fault at all.

821
01:02:24,375 --> 01:02:27,041
Well, I guess that's true.

822
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:36,958
This is why I hate being around people.

823
01:02:40,125 --> 01:02:42,125
It's because stuff like this happens.

824
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:55,000
Saying "I love you" to someone
is so violent.

825
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,708
The person who punches, their fist hurts…

826
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:02,125
just as much
as the person who gets punched.

827
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:10,333
I'm sorry… for what I said.

828
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:15,833
Don't be. You didn't do anything.

829
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:41,708
Okay. Let's go get some soda.

830
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,708
What?

831
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:46,291
Come on.

832
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:48,125
Wait…

833
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:50,375
But I haven't finished yet.

834
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,166
Unfinished art is beautiful.

835
01:03:58,708 --> 01:04:00,166
That's so unconvincing.

836
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,416
Come on, let's go.

837
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:07,875
Hey.

838
01:04:10,833 --> 01:04:16,041
<i>I saw Machida with Ms. Takagi yesterday.</i>

839
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:23,041
I thought I wouldn't mind
if he didn't come to school,

840
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,666
as long as he was happy.

841
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:27,875
But somehow,

842
01:04:29,416 --> 01:04:31,125
I'm not happy.

843
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:40,666
I don't want to see him happy
with someone else.

844
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:44,250
It's a part of me I don't like.

845
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:46,083
But…

846
01:04:48,166 --> 01:04:50,041
I don't know what to do.

847
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:56,916
Is that why…

848
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,666
you wanted to talk to me?

849
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:07,333
Thank you for telling me.

850
01:05:16,375 --> 01:05:19,958
Is there something you want me to do?

851
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:24,125
Maybe talk to Machida?

852
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,333
Anything like that?

853
01:05:32,791 --> 01:05:33,791
No.

854
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:37,875
Not really.

855
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Okay.

856
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:47,250
I won't say anything to him then.

857
01:05:48,666 --> 01:05:51,541
Try not to worry about it.

858
01:05:56,666 --> 01:05:58,875
Thanks for listening to me.

859
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:03,291
I couldn't keep it bottled up.

860
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:06,333
That's normal.

861
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:12,666
I'm glad you talked to me.

862
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:17,208
Thank you.

863
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,250
Also…

864
01:06:29,958 --> 01:06:32,833
I think it's wonderful…

865
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:37,083
that you told him how you felt.

866
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,750
Not everyone can do that.

867
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:47,875
I admire you for that.

868
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,291
-Hey.
-Hey.

869
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:32,458
One, two…

870
01:07:33,875 --> 01:07:34,875
It's stuck.

871
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:41,208
You shook the bottle, didn't you?

872
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:44,625
-Me?
-It shouldn't explode like that.

873
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:48,333
Thanks, anyway.

874
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:20,291
<i>We'll keep walking, one year from today</i>

875
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:25,916
<i>Even ten years from today</i>

876
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,666
Come on, guys. Be serious.

877
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:31,708
-We are.
-We're singing.

878
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,666
Be serious, don't mess around.

879
01:08:34,541 --> 01:08:36,916
"Don't mess around." Hmph!

880
01:08:38,666 --> 01:08:40,333
Be serious.

881
01:08:40,416 --> 01:08:42,416
-You suck.
-Yeah.

882
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,916
"You suck."

883
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,166
I don't sound like that.

884
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:46,416
Stop it.

885
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:53,958
It's Machida.

886
01:08:58,708 --> 01:08:59,708
Well…

887
01:09:00,791 --> 01:09:01,958
Yes?

888
01:09:02,041 --> 01:09:03,375
Can I join in?

889
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,333
Of course.

890
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,541
Let's see…

891
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:10,666
Here.

892
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:12,916
Thanks.

893
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,166
Over there.

894
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,625
Be serious.

895
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:19,916
Do it right.

896
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Okay, okay.

897
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:30,041
All right, once more, from the top.

898
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:53,833
Good morning.

899
01:09:53,916 --> 01:09:55,708
Take your seats, everyone.

900
01:10:05,791 --> 01:10:08,666
Let's begin homeroom.
Nishimura, please lead the class.

901
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:10,250
Yes. Stand up.

902
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,166
Bow. Good morning.

903
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,041
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

904
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,125
Sit.

905
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:27,916
I'll take attendance.

906
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,166
-Aikawa?
-Here.

907
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:32,375
-Ishida?
-Here.

908
01:10:42,208 --> 01:10:43,291
What is it?

909
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:48,000
Well…

910
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,083
the last time we met,

911
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:55,750
you said you had a crush on me.

912
01:10:58,958 --> 01:10:59,958
Yeah.

913
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:06,750
I never really gave you a reply that day.

914
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:15,166
Yeah, but it's fine.

915
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:17,291
Huh?

916
01:11:18,916 --> 01:11:20,000
I know.

917
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:22,625
Know what?

918
01:11:23,208 --> 01:11:24,208
Your reply.

919
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:26,250
Huh?

920
01:11:27,625 --> 01:11:30,041
I know how you feel.

921
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:33,458
Really?

922
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,500
Yeah.

923
01:11:38,916 --> 01:11:40,000
Okay…

924
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:43,208
Yeah.

925
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:53,458
I'm sorry.

926
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,666
Oh, come on, don't apologize.

927
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,166
I don't regret for a moment
that I told you how I felt.

928
01:12:24,708 --> 01:12:28,125
But weren't you scared?

929
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:32,083
To tell me.

930
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:37,125
Knowing that
things could get really awkward.

931
01:12:43,458 --> 01:12:44,458
Yeah.

932
01:12:45,666 --> 01:12:48,166
But I still wanted to tell you how I felt.

933
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,583
I see.

934
01:12:57,583 --> 01:12:58,583
Yeah.

935
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:08,583
So, is there someone you have a crush on?

936
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:12,541
No, not really.

937
01:13:18,833 --> 01:13:19,875
What?

938
01:13:24,041 --> 01:13:26,458
It's okay. I know about it.

939
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:29,500
But I'll keep your secret.

940
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:31,791
What do you…

941
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:34,250
Wait, what? What are you talking about?

942
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:39,666
I know you have a crush on Ms. Takagi.

943
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,500
What?

944
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:43,250
That's ridiculous.

945
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:46,958
Isn't that why you joined the choir?

946
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,375
No, that's not why.

947
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:52,208
You came back to school for her,
didn't you?

948
01:13:52,875 --> 01:13:55,041
What? Of course not.

949
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:58,208
I don't have a crush on Ms. Takagi.

950
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:01,416
You don't have to pretend.

951
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:05,000
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.

952
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:09,166
There's nothing going on with her, though.

953
01:14:12,625 --> 01:14:14,375
Then why are you here?

954
01:14:15,708 --> 01:14:16,750
Why?

955
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,375
Because I…

956
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,291
I came back for you.

957
01:14:25,458 --> 01:14:26,458
What?

958
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:29,333
What? You…

959
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,083
For me?

960
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:34,416
Never mind.

961
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,166
Forget about it.

962
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:40,208
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

963
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:43,541
-Come on, tell me.
-Drop it.

964
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:45,708
Hey, hey.

965
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,125
Hey.

966
01:14:59,541 --> 01:15:01,458
-Nishikata.
-Yes?

967
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,666
Why the long face?

968
01:15:08,875 --> 01:15:10,833
Can I ask you something?

969
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:15,083
What is it?

970
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:20,666
If…

971
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:23,916
If you like someone,

972
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:28,000
is it be best to tell them about it?

973
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:29,958
Did something happen?

974
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:31,958
Are you in love?

975
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,750
No, not me.

976
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,916
One of the students asked me…

977
01:15:38,625 --> 01:15:44,291
if telling their crush
may have hurt that person.

978
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,625
I see.

979
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:52,708
Sometimes you end up hurting others.

980
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,416
And sometimes you get hurt.

981
01:15:55,791 --> 01:15:58,708
But there are some things in life
you can only get

982
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:01,291
by being honest about your feelings.

983
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,125
Besides,

984
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:10,041
no one wants to go through life
on their own.

985
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:14,541
Must be nice to be young.

986
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,291
Oh, and, Nishikata…

987
01:16:25,708 --> 01:16:26,583
Yes?

988
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:32,083
First crushes don't turn into real love.

989
01:16:35,208 --> 01:16:38,416
But the feeling of love
makes your heart feel full.

990
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,958
So even just the act of loving someone
is a wonderful thing.

991
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:47,666
That's what I think, anyway.

992
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:51,291
Right. See you tomorrow.

993
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:54,541
Thank you.

994
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:55,791
Bye.

995
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,083
Waiting for someone, Itagaki?

996
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,541
Yeah, I guess.

997
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:30,041
I see.

998
01:17:32,125 --> 01:17:33,208
You too?

999
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:37,041
No, I'm on patrol.

1000
01:17:37,666 --> 01:17:38,666
Okay.

1001
01:17:43,041 --> 01:17:44,041
There she is.

1002
01:17:46,916 --> 01:17:47,958
I'm here.

1003
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Hey.

1004
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,041
I think Mr. Nishikata has a date.

1005
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:55,208
Oh, hello, Mr. Nishikata.

1006
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:56,500
Hello.

1007
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,333
We're going on in.

1008
01:17:58,416 --> 01:18:00,583
-Have fun and be careful.
-Okay.

1009
01:18:00,666 --> 01:18:03,000
-Don't stay out too late.
-Okay.

1010
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,083
Okay.

1011
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:15,833
Nishikata.

1012
01:18:17,208 --> 01:18:18,375
I'm here.

1013
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,041
What… Takagi-san!

1014
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:26,208
Your clothes are not appropriate
for patrolling.

1015
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,125
You're the one on patrol.

1016
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,375
I'm not a teacher yet.

1017
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:35,041
Right?

1018
01:18:35,791 --> 01:18:38,000
That's not what I meant.

1019
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:44,291
Well, shall we?

1020
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:56,291
What'll it be?

1021
01:18:57,041 --> 01:18:58,833
Lemon and strawberry.

1022
01:18:58,916 --> 01:19:00,250
Please.

1023
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,458
-600 yen for two.
-Okay.

1024
01:19:03,583 --> 01:19:04,583
I got this.

1025
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,291
-Really?
-Yeah.

1026
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:10,458
I even have exact change.

1027
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:14,666
-That's 600 yen exactly. Thank you.
-Thanks.

1028
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:22,625
Here you are.

1029
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,916
-Strawberry and lemon.
-Thanks.

1030
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,750
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1031
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:29,500
-Yay!
-Hi, what would you like?

1032
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:31,500
-Looks good.
-Let's dig in.

1033
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:35,875
-Melon and lemon, please.
-Okay.

1034
01:19:35,958 --> 01:19:37,166
Yum.

1035
01:19:58,708 --> 01:20:00,041
So pretty.

1036
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:01,875
Yeah.

1037
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:20,541
Thanks for inviting me, Nishikata.

1038
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:23,208
Oh. Yeah.

1039
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,375
I'll remember this night.

1040
01:21:01,416 --> 01:21:02,625
Takagi-san…

1041
01:21:05,916 --> 01:21:06,916
What?

1042
01:21:28,958 --> 01:21:29,958
How pretty.

1043
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:31,875
The fireworks.

1044
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,625
Yeah. They are.

1045
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:26,208
That's the end of my last class.

1046
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:32,000
I hope you learned to enjoy drawing
just a bit more.

1047
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:35,000
Thank you.

1048
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,833
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1049
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,625
Thank you.

1050
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:47,541
Mr. Tanabe?

1051
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:50,041
I'm all done.

1052
01:22:50,791 --> 01:22:51,791
Finished?

1053
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:55,916
How did your training go? Learn anything?

1054
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:59,041
Yes. I'm very glad I came.

1055
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:00,958
I'm glad to hear that.

1056
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:08,625
I'm going to think more about what to do
with my art and my career.

1057
01:23:10,666 --> 01:23:13,791
Teaching isn't the only path to follow.

1058
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,625
It's okay to be unsure.

1059
01:23:17,458 --> 01:23:19,375
It's your life, after all.

1060
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,541
Thank you.

1061
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,125
Thanks for coming.

1062
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:26,208
Thanks for having me.

1063
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:31,250
-Good-bye.
-Good-bye.

1064
01:23:31,333 --> 01:23:33,791
-Bye.
-Good-bye.

1065
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:41,458
Really?

1066
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,333
What?

1067
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:47,625
Tomorrow's her last day.

1068
01:23:58,666 --> 01:23:59,666
Ms. Takagi?

1069
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:08,958
Really?

1070
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,208
Huh?

1071
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:13,500
You're really not going to tell him?

1072
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:17,916
You're going to leave
without saying anything?

1073
01:24:19,375 --> 01:24:20,750
Would you look at that!

1074
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,958
You've completely changed your attitude.

1075
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:28,291
I thought you said
saying "I love you" was violent.

1076
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:30,708
Yeah, but…

1077
01:24:32,916 --> 01:24:34,958
So you're suggesting I resort to violence?

1078
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:36,333
No, I'm sorry.

1079
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:39,250
I'm getting things mixed up.

1080
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:49,333
I'm glad, though.

1081
01:24:52,375 --> 01:24:53,666
I really am glad…

1082
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,333
to see you taking an interest in others.

1083
01:25:09,458 --> 01:25:10,583
You know something?

1084
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:13,541
Actually…

1085
01:25:15,583 --> 01:25:20,041
I've told Nishikata I like him
over a hundred times since middle school.

1086
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,208
That many?

1087
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:41,583
He doesn't seem to have noticed
at all, though.

1088
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,416
What the…

1089
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:51,166
My punches are too weak,
so he doesn't notice.

1090
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:53,416
It doesn't hurt him…

1091
01:25:54,458 --> 01:25:55,958
nor does it hurt my fist.

1092
01:26:02,625 --> 01:26:03,625
Plus…

1093
01:26:04,875 --> 01:26:06,541
I don't want to confuse him.

1094
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:12,541
By telling him you love him?

1095
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,250
Besides…

1096
01:26:20,166 --> 01:26:23,500
I want to keep teasing him.

1097
01:26:31,166 --> 01:26:36,583
What does teasing mean to you, Ms. Takagi?

1098
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:42,416
Well…

1099
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:53,166
I think it's a deeper love than love.

1100
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:01,666
Those aren't weak punches then.

1101
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:57,541
Nishikata.

1102
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,916
Takagi-san?

1103
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,291
I thought you left.

1104
01:29:07,416 --> 01:29:09,625
I had something to tell you.

1105
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:13,125
What?

1106
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:27,375
Thank you for everything, Mr. Nishikata.

1107
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:31,250
No, thank you for your hard work.

1108
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,875
You're so formal.

1109
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:37,375
Huh? You started it.
I'm just playing along.

1110
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:55,666
It's so pretty.

1111
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,041
Yeah.

1112
01:29:58,833 --> 01:29:59,916
Very pretty.

1113
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,958
I wonder
when I'll get to see this view again.

1114
01:30:34,666 --> 01:30:35,708
Nothing.

1115
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:48,291
These three weeks went by in a flash.

1116
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:53,041
Maybe because I had so much fun…

1117
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:57,291
being with you.

1118
01:30:58,333 --> 01:30:59,166
Huh?

1119
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:01,958
I got to tease you so much.

1120
01:31:02,041 --> 01:31:04,333
Oh, come on!

1121
01:31:32,083 --> 01:31:34,000
So, what's your plan?

1122
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:39,000
Will you become a teacher?

1123
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:43,291
I don't know.

1124
01:31:46,291 --> 01:31:47,291
I see.

1125
01:31:55,291 --> 01:31:56,375
You see,

1126
01:31:57,541 --> 01:31:59,208
somewhere along the way,

1127
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:02,458
I lost the joy for drawing.

1128
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:09,375
I thought coming here
might help me find it again.

1129
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:13,166
That's why I took up the training course.

1130
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:16,000
I see.

1131
01:32:18,875 --> 01:32:20,291
I'm glad I did, though.

1132
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,166
It brought back memories.

1133
01:32:28,291 --> 01:32:33,750
I didn't know either what I wanted to do
before I went to college.

1134
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,458
Really?

1135
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:40,666
I had no idea
what career I wanted for myself.

1136
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:45,791
After you moved away,

1137
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:50,541
I lost interest in a lot of things.

1138
01:32:52,083 --> 01:32:55,958
Maybe I'm exaggerating a little,
but my life's goal back then…

1139
01:32:58,583 --> 01:33:02,083
was to get back at you
for all the times you teased me.

1140
01:33:02,166 --> 01:33:04,125
That's all I ever thought about.

1141
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:09,333
So I was your life's goal?

1142
01:33:10,916 --> 01:33:13,125
I'm exaggerating, but yes.

1143
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:17,791
So?

1144
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:18,958
Right, so…

1145
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:22,750
You probably know this,

1146
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:27,916
but back then, whenever you teased me,

1147
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:32,500
I'd make myself do sit-ups or push-ups.

1148
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,625
I remember that.

1149
01:33:37,916 --> 01:33:41,041
You teased me every single day,

1150
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:44,250
so I got pretty pumped up.

1151
01:33:45,666 --> 01:33:48,833
And then even after you moved,

1152
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:52,083
I kept doing my exercises.

1153
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:58,125
I guess that's sort of why…

1154
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,500
or at least part…

1155
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:03,208
of why I became a gym teacher.

1156
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:06,500
I see.

1157
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:16,416
So it's your fault I became a teacher.

1158
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:21,666
Well, not exactly "fault…"

1159
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:25,458
-Thanks to me?
-Thanks to you.

1160
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:39,958
I used to think a lot about you
after you left.

1161
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:45,166
About how you'd tease me
when we were sitting here.

1162
01:34:46,666 --> 01:34:50,416
Or what you'd do on the way back home.

1163
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:55,375
So,

1164
01:34:56,875 --> 01:35:00,625
when you came out
of that closet right there…

1165
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:03,875
I mean,

1166
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:06,583
I was completely surprised,

1167
01:35:07,833 --> 01:35:10,000
but I was really happy.

1168
01:35:12,625 --> 01:35:13,791
Really?

1169
01:35:16,375 --> 01:35:19,125
So, what I mean to say is,

1170
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:21,875
I'm really glad…

1171
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:26,041
I was able to meet you again.

1172
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:32,291
Thank you.

1173
01:35:35,791 --> 01:35:37,208
This is weird.

1174
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:40,666
-What are you thanking me for?
-What?

1175
01:35:41,791 --> 01:35:44,916
For meeting me again.

1176
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:50,583
Then I should thank you too.

1177
01:35:53,208 --> 01:35:54,833
I'm glad we met again too.

1178
01:35:57,291 --> 01:35:58,333
Thank you.

1179
01:36:06,583 --> 01:36:09,708
This is a bit embarrassing to say,

1180
01:36:10,958 --> 01:36:13,583
especially at my age, but…

1181
01:36:15,041 --> 01:36:16,083
What?

1182
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:23,166
I don't really understand the feeling…

1183
01:36:23,875 --> 01:36:25,625
of loving someone.

1184
01:36:27,375 --> 01:36:28,375
Huh?

1185
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:32,708
But I realized something…

1186
01:36:33,708 --> 01:36:38,291
over these past three weeks
spent with you.

1187
01:36:41,583 --> 01:36:45,458
Being with you is so much fun.

1188
01:36:46,625 --> 01:36:49,958
I don't understand love…

1189
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:56,750
but I like who I am when I'm with you.

1190
01:36:57,958 --> 01:37:01,958
I enjoy every single day.

1191
01:37:06,125 --> 01:37:07,458
So if…

1192
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,083
If you also…

1193
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:18,333
have fun being with me,

1194
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:22,166
would you…

1195
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:25,916
like to go out with me?

1196
01:37:28,625 --> 01:37:30,458
I know it'll be long-distance.

1197
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:38,541
Even though you don't know if it's love?

1198
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:46,541
You want to go out with me
even though you don't know if it's love?

1199
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:54,625
You're right.

1200
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:57,458
It's weird, isn't it?

1201
01:37:58,708 --> 01:37:59,750
You…

1202
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:04,708
Normally, you date
when you both love each other.

1203
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,916
Well, yes.

1204
01:38:13,166 --> 01:38:16,333
Jeez, I'm so hopeless.

1205
01:38:19,625 --> 01:38:24,333
That was a bit self-centered of me,
I'm sorry.

1206
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:27,291
It's okay.

1207
01:38:36,708 --> 01:38:37,750
You know…

1208
01:38:42,458 --> 01:38:47,500
I actually have fallen in love.

1209
01:38:48,875 --> 01:38:49,916
For real.

1210
01:38:51,916 --> 01:38:52,916
Really?

1211
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,250
I see.

1212
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:09,166
So what made that person so special?

1213
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,166
Special?

1214
01:39:13,541 --> 01:39:14,583
I don't know.

1215
01:39:19,958 --> 01:39:22,000
He's very unpretentious…

1216
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,666
and sincere.

1217
01:39:28,416 --> 01:39:29,708
He's honest.

1218
01:39:30,833 --> 01:39:32,083
And a horrible liar.

1219
01:39:35,125 --> 01:39:37,708
He sounds like a great guy.

1220
01:39:38,583 --> 01:39:40,375
Yeah, he is.

1221
01:39:42,166 --> 01:39:46,583
And he never tells anyone he loves them.

1222
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:52,000
Same as me.

1223
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:57,833
I've been in love with him
for ten years now,

1224
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:01,041
but he doesn't realize at all.

1225
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:10,750
Hold on. Wait a minute.

1226
01:40:14,416 --> 01:40:18,416
Unpretentious and sincere.

1227
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:22,291
And what else did you say?

1228
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:26,833
-Honest, and a horrible liar.
-Right.

1229
01:40:28,458 --> 01:40:31,958
Never tells anyone he loves them.

1230
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:37,791
And you've loved him for ten years?

1231
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:41,375
What?

1232
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:45,000
Do you mean…

1233
01:40:47,125 --> 01:40:48,291
Figured it out yet?

1234
01:40:48,958 --> 01:40:50,791
I'll give you one more hint.

1235
01:40:52,291 --> 01:40:57,041
I think he really enjoys
being teased by me.

1236
01:41:02,875 --> 01:41:03,916
Me?

1237
01:41:06,041 --> 01:41:07,375
What?

1238
01:41:09,250 --> 01:41:10,708
What? Really?

1239
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,625
Don't be so surprised.

1240
01:41:13,708 --> 01:41:15,541
How could I not be?!

1241
01:41:16,916 --> 01:41:17,916
What?!

1242
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:25,791
Remember when I called you
before coming here?

1243
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:29,250
I said I was going back
to where I wanted to go.

1244
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,750
The time I spent here helped me realize…

1245
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:42,708
where I really wanted to return to.

1246
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:49,333
Where? Is it not here then?

1247
01:41:50,541 --> 01:41:54,125
Not the island or the school?

1248
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:02,500
Not this island or this school.

1249
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,250
I wanted to come back…

1250
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:13,250
so I could be near you.

1251
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:17,416
What?

1252
01:42:19,750 --> 01:42:22,208
Being with you helped me realize that.

1253
01:42:24,541 --> 01:42:27,583
I've wanted to be back here with you
for ages now.

1254
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:31,791
Because I always loved you.

1255
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:40,000
Even if you don't know
whether you love me or not…

1256
01:42:42,666 --> 01:42:48,291
I'm just glad you enjoy being with me.

1257
01:42:50,041 --> 01:42:51,541
I feel the same way.

1258
01:42:57,833 --> 01:43:00,875
So, would you…

1259
01:43:15,416 --> 01:43:16,416
Would you…

1260
01:43:18,416 --> 01:43:20,291
like to go out with me?

1261
01:43:35,041 --> 01:43:36,041
What?

1262
01:43:37,166 --> 01:43:38,166
No?

1263
01:43:44,791 --> 01:43:49,458
Didn't you just say
that you wanted to go out with me?

1264
01:43:51,833 --> 01:43:52,916
I did.

1265
01:43:57,708 --> 01:43:58,708
But…

1266
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:00,958
I'm sorry.

1267
01:44:02,500 --> 01:44:04,916
Can I say something?

1268
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:14,416
When you said you loved me,

1269
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:18,666
I was genuinely really happy.

1270
01:44:20,833 --> 01:44:22,083
But honestly,

1271
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:26,541
I'm a little confused.

1272
01:44:31,875 --> 01:44:32,916
Actually,

1273
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:38,041
I've never thought about it before.

1274
01:44:39,041 --> 01:44:44,458
About whether or not I loved you.

1275
01:44:47,125 --> 01:44:48,125
But…

1276
01:44:51,375 --> 01:44:57,250
But when Nakai said
you might be seeing someone,

1277
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:03,541
I didn't like that at all.

1278
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:11,041
I said I didn't know if I loved you,

1279
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:14,958
but now I know for sure.

1280
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,416
I love you.

1281
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:25,625
Sorry, I know I just said I didn't know.

1282
01:45:27,041 --> 01:45:28,041
It's okay.

1283
01:45:28,875 --> 01:45:29,916
But…

1284
01:45:32,958 --> 01:45:34,000
But?

1285
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:37,208
Well…

1286
01:45:39,458 --> 01:45:40,875
Go on, say it.

1287
01:45:42,041 --> 01:45:43,083
What is it?

1288
01:45:46,500 --> 01:45:47,500
But…

1289
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:51,791
At Nakai's wedding,

1290
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:57,583
I imagined you in a wedding dress.

1291
01:45:59,833 --> 01:46:04,666
And when you said
you wouldn't mind students teasing you

1292
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:08,166
if you were with someone
you could see yourself growing old with,

1293
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:14,458
I imagined you as an old granny.

1294
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:19,541
So…

1295
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:23,958
I want to…

1296
01:46:25,291 --> 01:46:28,583
always be with you.

1297
01:46:35,458 --> 01:46:36,750
I do too.

1298
01:46:38,833 --> 01:46:39,916
So…

1299
01:46:41,416 --> 01:46:42,791
shall we go out?

1300
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:48,041
Yeah, well…

1301
01:46:48,125 --> 01:46:49,416
Not that.

1302
01:46:51,208 --> 01:46:56,833
I don't just want love or to date you…

1303
01:46:58,208 --> 01:46:59,250
I want…

1304
01:47:00,833 --> 01:47:01,875
You see…

1305
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:09,583
Will you…

1306
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:13,083
marry me?

1307
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:19,166
What?

1308
01:47:20,666 --> 01:47:22,458
Not right now, of course.

1309
01:47:23,583 --> 01:47:26,041
Either I come to you,

1310
01:47:26,708 --> 01:47:29,583
or you come back to the island.

1311
01:47:30,416 --> 01:47:31,500
Either's fine.

1312
01:47:32,750 --> 01:47:36,375
I'm embarrassed
I can't say I love you for sure.

1313
01:47:38,958 --> 01:47:40,000
But I…

1314
01:47:42,541 --> 01:47:44,250
want to always be together.

1315
01:47:46,833 --> 01:47:47,875
I want you…

1316
01:47:49,750 --> 01:47:53,708
to be by my side.

1317
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,708
Nishikata…

1318
01:48:02,041 --> 01:48:03,041
So…

1319
01:48:08,291 --> 01:48:09,458
Takagi-san…

1320
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,666
will you marry me?

1321
01:48:35,541 --> 01:48:36,916
Let's get married.

1322
01:48:43,083 --> 01:48:44,083
Great.

1323
01:48:54,166 --> 01:48:55,916
Then first…

1324
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:04,083
Let's hold hands.

1325
01:49:26,541 --> 01:49:27,791
Hey, Nishikata?

1326
01:49:28,791 --> 01:49:33,666
These past ten years,
did anyone else ever turn your head

1327
01:49:33,750 --> 01:49:36,916
or make you think about dating them?

1328
01:49:37,708 --> 01:49:39,791
Huh? I don't know.

1329
01:49:41,375 --> 01:49:45,500
You never thought about
going to a singles mixer?

1330
01:49:46,333 --> 01:49:49,541
All your friends
were in relationships, right?

1331
01:49:51,250 --> 01:49:53,958
Well, I guess maybe once or twice.

1332
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:56,916
I knew it.

1333
01:49:57,625 --> 01:50:00,750
What? I was just curious.

1334
01:50:01,708 --> 01:50:04,375
I didn't want to date anyone specifically.

1335
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,666
That's normal, right?

1336
01:50:08,708 --> 01:50:11,208
That means you might cheat on me.

1337
01:50:11,291 --> 01:50:13,916
No, I wouldn't cheat on you.

1338
01:50:16,333 --> 01:50:17,708
Is that so?

1339
01:50:22,958 --> 01:50:24,958
What are you laughing about?

1340
01:50:25,041 --> 01:50:26,041
Nothing.

1341
01:50:26,666 --> 01:50:31,666
When you talk about cheating,
it feels like we're really dating.

1342
01:50:34,458 --> 01:50:35,833
We are.

1343
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:38,541
I know, but…

1344
01:50:43,791 --> 01:50:46,666
Hey, where's your bike?

1345
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,958
My bike? I left it behind.

1346
01:50:49,666 --> 01:50:52,125
I wanted to hold hands on the way home.

1347
01:51:01,416 --> 01:51:02,583
Nishikata,

1348
01:51:03,666 --> 01:51:05,166
we should break up.

1349
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:06,750
What? Why?

1350
01:51:07,875 --> 01:51:10,791
It's too hard to tease you
when we're dating.

1351
01:51:10,875 --> 01:51:15,166
It's fine. Totally fine.
This way is better, actually.

1352
01:51:15,916 --> 01:51:21,000
If dating means no more teasing,
then I'm never breaking up with you.

1353
01:51:27,375 --> 01:51:28,375
Actually,

1354
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,791
just what does teasing mean to you?

1355
01:51:40,166 --> 01:51:42,208
-It's a secret.
-Huh?

1356
01:51:45,375 --> 01:51:46,416
Why?

1357
01:51:47,166 --> 01:51:48,166
No reason.

1358
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:56,750
Where are we going?

1359
01:51:57,375 --> 01:51:58,708
You'll see soon.

1360
01:52:21,625 --> 01:52:23,916
THANK YOU, MS. TAKAGI
FROM YEAR 2 CLASS 3

1361
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,125
Wow!

1362
01:52:28,333 --> 01:52:31,833
Thank you for these three weeks,
Ms. Takagi.

1363
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:34,875
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1364
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:39,208
Thank you all.

1365
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:52,375
I don't know
if you remember this song or not…

1366
01:53:09,833 --> 01:53:12,125
<i>You were there</i>

1367
01:53:12,208 --> 01:53:14,833
<i>I was there</i>

1368
01:53:14,916 --> 01:53:20,125
<i>There's a smile all around</i>

1369
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:22,833
<i>The cherry blossoms bloom</i>

1370
01:53:22,916 --> 01:53:25,541
<i>And the seasons turn</i>

1371
01:53:25,625 --> 01:53:31,250
<i>Still you are there by my side</i>

1372
01:53:31,333 --> 01:53:36,500
<i>Far, far, far away</i>

1373
01:53:36,583 --> 01:53:41,916
<i>The heat shimmers above the hill</i>

1374
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,250
<i>Even if someday things around me change</i>

1375
01:53:47,333 --> 01:53:50,708
<i>There's something in my heart</i>

1376
01:53:51,583 --> 01:53:55,083
<i>That will never change</i>

1377
01:53:56,666 --> 01:54:01,375
<i>I reflect upon the joy of having met you…</i>

1378
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:51,250
<i>The feeling of love is so uncertain.</i>

1379
01:54:52,208 --> 01:54:56,166
<i>If you're always together,</i>
<i>you can lose that feeling.</i>

1380
01:54:57,083 --> 01:55:00,375
<i>Love alone might not be enough</i>
<i>to make a relationship last.</i>

1381
01:55:03,875 --> 01:55:09,208
<i>However, Nishikata and I</i>
<i>aren't only tied together by love.</i>

1382
01:55:10,166 --> 01:55:14,458
<i>We have a much deeper bond than that.</i>

1383
01:55:19,666 --> 01:55:24,958
<i>And that is the bond</i>
<i>of the teaser and the teased.</i>

1384
01:55:30,833 --> 01:55:36,166
<i>Even a year or ten years from now</i>

1385
01:55:36,250 --> 01:55:41,041
<i>These feelings will never change</i>

1386
01:55:41,833 --> 01:55:48,708
<i>For now and forever</i>

1387
01:56:08,125 --> 01:56:09,125
Fantastic!

1388
01:56:18,541 --> 01:56:24,708
<i>So even if we get married,</i>
<i>I think we'll stay as we are.</i>

1389
01:56:26,375 --> 01:56:28,333
<i>I don't think we'll ever change.</i>

1390
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:34,125
In sickness and in health…

1391
01:56:34,208 --> 01:56:37,708
<i>So I guess the question is,</i>

1392
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:41,916
<i>do I promise to keep on teasing Nishikata?</i>

1393
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,416
I do.

1394
01:58:22,333 --> 01:58:24,833
-Can you see, Chi?
-No.

1395
01:58:24,916 --> 01:58:27,166
No? Want to jump?

1396
01:58:27,250 --> 01:58:28,250
Yeah.

1397
01:58:28,916 --> 01:58:31,083
-One, two, jump!
-One, two, jump!

1398
01:58:32,041 --> 01:58:34,041
-Did you see?
-Yeah.

1399
01:58:34,125 --> 01:58:36,458
-What did you see?
-The ocean.

1400
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:38,666
-The ocean!
-The ocean! That's right.

1401
01:58:39,791 --> 01:58:40,958
It's big, isn't it?

1402
01:58:41,041 --> 01:58:42,666
-Big!
-Very big.
