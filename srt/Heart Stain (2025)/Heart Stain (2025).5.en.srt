1
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,940
I like you, Mr. Nam.

2
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,670
What?

3
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,729
Sorry, I have to take this.

4
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,470
Something urgent came up, so I have to leave.

5
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,540
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,080
Woohyeon, what should we eat?

7
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,490
Doha, what do you want to eat?

8
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,670
Tteokbokki?

9
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,390
At the snack bar?

10
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,820
I don't think they have it.

11
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,680
Sori, want to go get tteokbokki with me?

12
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,590
You dropped this.

13
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,700
Huh?

14
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,900
Your attention.

15
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,620
It fell out of your head.

16
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,260
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,810
Yoon Woohyeon.

18
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,900
Why are you so distracted today?

19
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm not!

20
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,110
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:51,720
Woohyeon, Mr. Nam is looking for the class rep.

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,810
Huh? Oh.

23
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,730
Doha.

24
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,410
Can you go on my behalf?

25
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,090
Me?

26
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,630
Woohyeon—

27
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,660
It's you, Doha.

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,990
Yes, Woohyeon is not feeling well.

29
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,370
Oh...

30
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,160
I see.

31
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,650
Um, it's nothing much.

32
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,270
Can you share this with the class?

33
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,450
Yes.

34
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,870
Wait, Doha.

35
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,090
Doha, please take good care of Woohyeon.

36
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,110
Sorry?

37
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,290
Aren't you his best friend?

38
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,910
Mr. Nam.

39
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,190
Please don't make Woohyeon's heart sway.

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,700
As more and more students are accepted into college through early-action applications,

41
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,050
you guys are getting distracted and more lax.

42
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,740
There are still students who need to study for the college entrance exams,

43
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,870
so please be considerate.

44
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,780
-Yes.
-Yes.

45
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,470
In particular...

46
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,589
Don't doze off in class.

47
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,220
Keep your uniform neat and clean.

48
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,350
You don't get a free pass even though you're a third year.

49
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

50
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,230
Yoon Woohyeon!

51
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,430
Yeah?

52
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,590
Are you going to leave alone?

53
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,300
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,409
Let's go together.

55
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,850
We're at school.

56
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,820
Is something bothering you?

57
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,960
Something?

58
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,020
You look upset.

59
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,620
No, it's nothing. Bye.

60
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,850
Is it because of Mr. Nam?

61
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,620
I knew it.

62
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:25,530
I told you it's not him. Why do you assume it is?

63
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,210
It's written all over your face.

64
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,950
I told you last time.

65
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,950
After I know that you like him, it's very obvious.

66
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,130
What do you know?

67
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,520
And when Mr. Nam called for you,

68
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,610
why did you ask me to go on your behalf?

69
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,420
I'm tired.

70
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,340
Woohyeon.

71
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,610
Am I not someone you can rely on?

72
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,680
If you're troubled, you can lean on me.

73
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,730
We are... dating after all.

74
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,870
Don't you keep secrets from me too?

75
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,360
Huh?

76
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,890
You won't tell me about you and Kwon Junsu.

77
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,350
Why are you bringing that up now?

78
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,480
I don't like that guy!

79
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,790
Hey...

80
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,430
About me and Kwon Junsu...

81
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,920
Huh?

82
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,380
I don't mean to hide it.

83
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,550
I just...

84
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,850
I don't want to recall it.

85
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,170
I was in the same class with Kwon Junsu in the first year.

86
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,760
From the first day of school, everyone avoided him because of the rumors.

87
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,990
Watch out.

88
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,920
Everyone around him were delinquents

89
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,810
and he always got into trouble.

90
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:11,240
Even the school staff left him alone.

91
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,110
But he was caring and approached me first,

92
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,720
so we quickly became close.

93
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,900
Don't you want to pierce your ears?

94
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,650
No, thanks. Not interested.

95
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,800
Why? You have pretty ears.

96
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,620
Get it pierced. I have mine pierced too.

97
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,580
What do your pierced ears have to do with me?

98
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,260
I don't know. Let's get the same earrings.

99
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,180
I know a shop where it doesn't hurt at all.

100
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,770
Okay?

101
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,190
In that moment, I realized I was different.

102
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,070
I...

103
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,350
I think I like boys.

104
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,150
And?

105
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,570
It's none of my business.

106
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,560
Uh...

107
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,280
Thank you.

108
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,059
For what?

109
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,470
It's nothing.

110
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,860
Hey, why have you been hanging out with Park Doha so much?

111
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,350
Because he's cute.

112
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,930
Cute?

113
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,770
He's not cute. He's pretty.

114
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:54,750
What are you talking about?

115
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,100
You know, I heard he's gay. Is that true?

116
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,550
Huh? Really?

117
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,010
He looks like one.

118
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,950
It'd be a shame if he wasn't.

119
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,580
Kwon Junsu, are you gay too?

120
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,470
What the hell?

121
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,020
Oh my god, you are?

122
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,350
What? Are you two really dating?

123
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,590
Disgusting!

124
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,680
Are you really gay?

125
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,870
Don't get me involved. I'm not.

126
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,360
It's not that.

127
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,580
It's fun to hang out with him.

128
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,340
Huh?

129
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,010
He's handsome, so it's not embarrassing.

130
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,640
He's also rich.

131
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,190
If I ask him to buy me something,

132
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,490
after some whining, he buys it for me.

133
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:30,620
Damn! You've got yourself a pushover.

134
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,120
Bring him to us sometime.

135
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,760
Let me get some free stuff from him too.

136
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,940
But it's still weird to meet him alone.

137
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,420
What if he really likes you?

138
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,630
Then...

139
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,320
I'll stop being friends with him.

140
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,750
That serious?

141
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,560
By the way, you know what?

142
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,330
If I touch him, his reaction is really funny.

143
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,640
Oh my god!

144
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,710
Am I fun to play with?

145
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,330
I really thought we were friends.

146
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,500
I didn't think you'd think of me like this.

147
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,400
That was the last thing I said to Kwon Junsu.

148
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:42,400
After that, we've been ignoring each other.

149
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,380
But he suddenly talked to me that day.

150
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,710
How could he've done that?

151
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,250
And if that happened, why is he talking to you again now?

152
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,920
I have no idea.

153
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,400
I really don't know what he's thinking.

154
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,700
I really don't like him.

155
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,610
Why do you hate him so much?

156
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,420
Why wouldn't I hate him?

157
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,450
What do you mean?

158
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,170
I can tell that you hate him,

159
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,220
and he's not nice to you.

160
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,270
Of course I hate him.

161
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,110
I’m done with my secret. Now, can you tell me yours?

162
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:38,610
Didn't Lee Sori fail to get with my brother?

163
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:39,740
Yeah.

164
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,120
Actually, I expected it.

165
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,330
But when it actually happened,

166
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,050
I felt bad for her.

167
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,890
I met Mr. Nam on my way to the study cafe that day.

168
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,560
When I heard what he said, my heart has been a mess.

169
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,700
I don't know how to face him either.

170
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,740
That's all.

171
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,100
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,150
I understand how you feel.

173
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,830
Being frustrated and anxious,

174
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,730
with your mood dependent on their every word.

175
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,190
How could I not understand?

176
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,170
But Woohyeon,

177
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,420
you have me now.

178
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,360
Don't forget that.

179
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,050
I'm sorry for showing you my pathetic side.

180
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,840
You said that's not how people make up.

181
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,690
I...

182
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,590
I'm ready to say "I'm okay."

183
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,670
Woohyeon.

184
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,850
Yes?

185
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,990
Isn't the second class self-study?

186
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,230
Yes.

187
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,190
Some students need academic counseling.

188
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,770
Can you tell them to come to me in order during the self-study class?

189
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,890
Yes.

190
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,660
Thank you.

191
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,650
Do you want me to hold your hand?

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,890
No, but I appreciate the thought.

193
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,980
Hi.

194
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,530
I don't think we're close enough to chat.

195
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,360
Why? We're not enemies.

196
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,800
I think this is the first time we've talked like this.

197
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,630
Get lost.

198
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,550
Do you like Park Doha?

199
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,100
No.

200
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,480
I phrased it wrong.

201
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm sure Park Doha likes you.

202
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,540
Do you like each other?

203
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,520
What if I say yes?

204
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,520
So... you're both gay?

205
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm surprised.

206
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,020
Park Doha aside, you don't look like it.

207
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,100
It's up to you to say whatever you want.

208
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,090
But you'd better get lost now.

209
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,800
I don't care whether you're dating or not.

210
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,060
Then what's all this talk?

211
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,510
I just... have a tip for you.

212
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,620
A tip?

213
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,770
How far have you gone with Park Doha?

214
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,960
What?

215
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,830
Doha...

216
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,010
He does everything you ask for.

217
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,310
There's a fight!

218
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,800
What? Where? Who's fighting?

219
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,150
Kwon Junsu and Yoon Woohyeon!

220
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,890
-Let's go there now!
-Yoon Woohyeon?

221
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,480
What are you doing when the college entrance exams are around the corner?

222
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,210
When will you come to your senses?

223
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,960
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

224
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,810
Kwon Junsu.

225
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,340
You've been quiet for a while. Are you back at it again?

226
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,870
And Yoon Woohyeon.

227
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,610
You weren't like this before. What's going on?

228
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,910
I didn't do anything.

229
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,970
He started it.

230
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,630
Write a letter of apology before you leave today.

231
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,160
The Woohyeon I know

232
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,150
never resorts to physical violence.

233
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,750
Why did you fight?

234
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,270
I just... found him annoying since forever.

235
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,200
Sit down.

236
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,670
Sorry?

237
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,350
Wounds on your handsome face

238
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,560
will scare your parents.

239
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,770
So...

240
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,750
You beat up someone you don't like.

241
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,010
Was it cathartic?

242
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,310
No.

243
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,740
This is how it feels to hurt someone else.

244
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,360
You're really a wise adult.

245
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:17,420
Am I? I'm very ordinary.

246
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,330
No.

247
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,320
When I stand in front of you,

248
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,500
I feel really immature.

249
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,390
You think so?

250
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,510
That might not be true.

251
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,590
Huh?

252
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,400
That day...

253
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,280
I like you, Mr. Nam.

254
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,530
What?

255
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,230
I'm sorry. I need to take this.

256
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,280
I'm sorry for leaving without saying goodbye.

257
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,680
I felt that you meant it,

258
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,210
so to be honest, I was at a loss.

259
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,080
You're not the type of person to joke about something like that.

260
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,680
So I thought about how I should reply you...

261
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,380
but I ended up not saying anything in response.

262
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,820
That was really immature of me.

263
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,900
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,870
No, I...

265
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,560
Woohyeon.

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,280
Yes?

267
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,230
I can't accept your feelings,

268
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,030
but you're still my favorite student.

269
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,960
That has never changed.

270
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,740
Yes.

271
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,650
Thank you.

272
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,330
I suddenly wanted to see Doha.

273
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,040
Let's go.

274
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,210
Yoon Woohyeon!

275
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,510
Why did you fight?

276
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,830
I was annoyed when he mentioned you.

277
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,400
Damn it. You don't even know how to fight!

278
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,140
Were you worried about me?

279
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,110
Of course, you fool.

280
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,070
I'm sorry.

281
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,350
Should we...

282
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,170
have some fun?

283
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,150
I wish time would stop.

284
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,520
Are you serious?

285
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,500
What's wrong?

286
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,030
I want to finish the exams quickly so I can play with you.

287
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,250
I like to stay like this with you.

288
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,410
Your names are on the gifts. Take what's yours.

289
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,140
Here, I got you yours too.

290
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,620
Thank you.

291
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,440
(Woohyeon, you've always been doing so well, so be confident. Fighting!)

292
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,980
Good luck on your exams.

293
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,380
Thanks.

294
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,700
Good luck to you too.

295
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,270
You still have this.

296
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,620
There's a good luck message on it for my exams.

297
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,630
I was worried opening it would bring bad luck.

298
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,440
Now that the college entrance exams are over,

299
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,190
can I open it?

300
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,290
You can throw away the note too. I don't care for it.

301
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,560
Then I'll take it with me.

302
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,610
And...

303
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,490
And?

304
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,110
Kiss me.
