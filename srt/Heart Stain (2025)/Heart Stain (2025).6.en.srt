1
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,840
Your act of deviance is... watching a movie?

2
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,760
Yes.

3
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,900
Is this a movie you like?

4
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,460
No.

5
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,840
It's just the one that's starting the soonest.

6
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,570
Let's just chill.

7
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,620
Now I feel like I'm home.

8
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,020
Home?

9
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,640
This is your place. Since you're my sister, you're now also my mom.

11
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,740
Mom?

12
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,670
Please take care of me!

13
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,900
Mom!

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,229
Seriously!

15
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,789
I'm sorry!

16
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,640
What did you say?

17
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,560
Nothing.

18
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:35,220
I'm sure we'll get along, right?

19
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,720
Doha.

20
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,860
Huh?

21
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,430
The movie is over.

22
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,050
Ah... Yeah.

23
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,829
-Let's go.
-Okay.

24
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,610
But, is this okay?

25
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,579
What is?

26
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,690
I thought you were going to do something big

27
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,870
since you said you were going to do an act of deviance.

28
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,060
But I didn't expect to be watching a movie and walking by the beach.

29
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,070
So this is your so-called deviance.

30
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,640
What were you imagining?

31
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,579
It's something worth the news.

32
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,130
To a senior who only has a month left to CSAT,

33
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,280
this is deviance.

34
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,780
You're right.

35
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,940
I wish time would stop.

36
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,590
Really?

37
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,200
Why?

38
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,240
I want it to end quickly so I can hang out with you.

39
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,450
I like to just stay with you like this.

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,240
There are many things we can do when we become adults.

41
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,490
We can travel and play all night.

42
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,940
Really?

43
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,210
Are you cold?

44
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,480
It's a little cold, but it's okay.

45
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,460
Put it on.

46
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,659
No.

47
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,480
Put it on. You might catch a cold.

48
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,630
I had fun today.

49
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,710
Me too.

50
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,230
See you tomorrow.

51
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,190
I’m back.

52
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,750
Lee Sori?

53
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,930
Your face is quite a sight.

54
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,670
Don't pick a fight.

55
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,290
Did you lose in a fight?

56
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,590
How can that be?

57
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,910
Right.

58
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,300
Have some rice cake.

59
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,320
For me?

60
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,010
Who else? My mom told me to give it to you.

61
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:19,630
Oh.

62
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,550
Have it, get into college,

63
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,350
and stay by Doha's side.

64
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,020
The CSAT,

65
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,520
also known as the first hurdle in one's life,

66
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,440
is finally right before us.

67
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,490
The college entrance exam is in a few weeks.

68
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,800
Life slowly passes with nothing much going on.

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,260
When I meet Kwon Junsu,

70
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,159
we stare at each other like enemies,

71
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,490
but we don't make a big fuss.

72
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,230
Next, for X,

73
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,000
X is...

74
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,350
What's amazing is

75
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,500
I feel much lighter when facing Mr. Nam.

76
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,830
(CSAT D-10)

77
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,170
(CSAT D-3)

78
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,900
Woohyeon.

79
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,050
-You're here.
-Yeah.

80
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,070
Let's go. It's cold.

81
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,159
By the way, I have something to ask you.

82
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,470
What?

83
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,550
Do you like snacks?

84
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,170
Yes.

85
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,140
What about chocolate?

86
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,020
Of course.

87
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,490
What about malt?

88
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,240
Malt?

89
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,990
It's nothing much.

90
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,390
I just want you to do well for CSAT.

91
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,470
I've never received a gift like this.

92
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,070
You're lying.

93
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,220
It's your first time giving me this.

94
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,090
Hey.

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,960
It looks delicious.

96
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,230
Yoon Woohyun! What are you eating?

97
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,800
-Get lost.
-I want some too.

98
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,250
-I want it too. I want it too.
-No!

99
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,930
What do we do with these elementary school kids?

100
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,090
Right.

101
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,470
Let's go.

102
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,390
It's really winter. It's cold even in the day.

103
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,420
Right. It won't snow on the day of the CSAT, right?

104
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,120
I hate snow.

105
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,760
Really? I don't hate it.

106
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,270
We should live in somewhere with no snow in the future.

107
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,710
You hate it that much?

108
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,320
Yeah.

109
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,210
When it snows, transport becomes really inconvenient and the road gets slippery.

110
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,820
Road conditions wouldn't be good too.

111
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,900
So you won't go skiing with me, right?

112
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,190
What?

113
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,840
I wanted to go skiing

114
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,320
when winter comes.

115
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,440
You can also roll on the snow.

116
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,800
Why roll around on the snow?

117
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,410
You're so unromantic. Don't you watch dramas?

118
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,320
I want to go to a ski resort.

119
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,310
Really?

120
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,800
Then let's go in January next year.

121
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,050
In January next year?

122
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,270
Yes.

123
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,840
Let's talk about it then.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,340
Talk about it then?

125
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,590
Got it.

126
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,430
Everyone, sit down.

127
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,620
Oh, my. Mr. Nam, what is that?

128
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,390
The CSAT is in three days.

129
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,530
So I prepared malt.

130
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,150
Oh, my!

131
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,320
Park Taemin, go back to your seat.

132
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,690
I wrote down your names.

133
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,090
Take those with your names on it.

134
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,950
-Yes.
-Yes.

135
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,750
Mr. Nam, I'm so touched!

136
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,720
Take it.

137
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,620
Bring me mine!

138
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,740
Thank you.

139
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,340
Here, I took yours.

140
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,020
Thank you.

141
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,610
(Woohyeon, you've been doing well. Be confident. Good luck!)

142
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,790
Woohyeon, are you really going to my alma mater>

143
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,220
If that's the case...

144
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,530
(Woohyeon, you've been doing well. Be confident. Good luck!)

145
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,560
Let's keep it as an amulet for CSAT.

146
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,970
As a memento.

147
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,030
(2022 College Scholastic Ability Test
Jeollanam-do Office of Education's Section 75's 3rd Examination Venue)

148
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,640
The CSAT is finally here.

149
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,380
Right. It doesn't feel real.

150
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,560
Good luck on your exam.

151
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,010
Okay.

152
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,460
Same to you.

153
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,910
I feel empty.

154
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,040
Right.

155
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,090
Did you do well?

156
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,920
So-so. Not bad.

157
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,110
What about you?

158
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,520
If I tell you the exam I've done

159
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,260
the worst for up till now is CSAT, will you believe me?

160
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,560
What's going on? Did you screw up?

161
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,290
No, I was just kidding.

162
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,780
You scared me.

163
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,200
It's warm.

164
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,630
There's someone.

165
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,620
Oh.

166
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,830
Let's go on a trip. A graduation trip.

167
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,550
-A graduation trip.
-A graduation trip.

168
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,640
The CSAT is over, we should go have fun.

169
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,070
When?

170
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,870
January. Like that we can drink.

171
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,820
You want to drink already?

172
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,370
You don't?

173
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,720
Anyway, you have to make time. Okay?

174
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,600
All we have is time now. Of course.

175
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
Then let's go in January. Let's match our schedules.

176
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,620
I'm leaving.

177
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,210
Me too.

178
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,640
Why are you leaving?

179
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,200
I'll take you home.

180
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,200
Go away.

181
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,430
Sori, wait for me. Let's go together.

182
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,970
Have a good date.

183
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,260
Don't you want to go on a graduation trip?

184
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:14,350
Ah... No, I was distracted.

185
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,680
Shall we finish this?

186
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,930
Okay.

187
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,840
Why do you have so many video games?

188
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,360
Because I like them.

189
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,060
They're fun.

190
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,830
Then...

191
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,620
What about me?

192
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,290
What?

193
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,130
You don't like me?

194
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,800
No.

195
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,570
You don't like me? Hmm?

196
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,420
What are you talking about?

197
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,940
Let's date.

198
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,510
I'm not asking you to answer me right away.

199
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,330
No!

200
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,870
Huh?

201
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,380
Let's date.

202
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,400
Hey!

203
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,320
Bye, Yoon Woohyeon.

204
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,050
I've been dating Doha for two months.

205
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,010
We decided to date not because we like each other,

206
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,150
but somehow, I'm used to having Doha by me.

207
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,720
If someone asks me if I like Doha,

208
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,600
the answer wouldn't be yes.

209
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,250
But just given what I feel about it now,

210
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,040
would it be considered as me liking him too?

211
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,530
Doha.

212
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,000
What?

213
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Shall we go hang out in my room?

214
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,370
Sure.

215
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:16,730
Ah! I want Coke.

216
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,610
I'll bring it to you.

217
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,600
Okay.

218
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:52,520
(Woohyeon, you've been doing well. Be confident. Good luck!)

219
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,000
That's...

220
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,109
Are you angry?

221
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,240
No.

222
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,050
Why would I be angry?

223
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,400
All right.

224
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,119
You kept that.

225
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,360
Don't you like it?

226
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,810
No, I do.

227
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,120
There's a good luck message for CSAT.

228
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm afraid it'll bring bad luck if I open it up.

229
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,330
That's all. Please believe me.

230
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,480
True. I guess there are such sayings.

231
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:49,970
Yes.

232
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,010
But it's been a month since the CSAT ended.

233
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,170
I... I forgot about it.

234
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,670
Why are you stuttering?

235
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,250
I mean... Trust me.

236
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,580
Trust me, Doha.

237
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,790
Now that the CSAT is over, I can open it, right?

238
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,080
Of course.

239
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,480
You can eat it all if you want.

240
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,970
You can throw away the note.

241
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,210
Really?

242
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,910
Huh?

243
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,410
Then I'll take it with me.

244
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,390
And...

245
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,300
I have a wish.

246
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,060
Tell me. I'll make it come true.

247
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,450
Tell me you like me.

248
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,880
Kiss me.

249
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,760
Why? You don't want to?

250
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:07,960
That's not what I meant.

251
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,530
You can accept my candy,

252
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,420
but you don't want to kiss me?

253
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,320
Got it. Sure.

254
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,200
Are you scared?

255
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes.

256
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,750
I need to use the bathroom.

257
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,830
Are you leaving?

258
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,140
Yes.

259
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,530
Let me send you home.

260
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,320
No need.

261
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,760
Wait for me.

262
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,110
Are you going to Seoul next year?

263
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,300
Yeah.

264
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,760
When are you going to tell me your college application results?

265
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,550
If you don't want to go to college...

266
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:14,990
Many people don't go to college these days.

267
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,390
Woohyeon.

268
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,890
I have something to tell you.

269
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,800
What is it?

270
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,450
I'm going to study abroad.

271
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,830
What?

272
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,880
Let's break up.

273
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm going abroad in two months.

274
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,790
I'm going to live with my relatives in Germany.

275
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,850
What about the graduation ceremony?

276
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,840
I'll leave after the graduation ceremony.

277
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,420
Are you listening?

278
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,550
Yeah.

279
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,760
My family kept talking to me about studying abroad.

280
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,570
I didn't want to leave thinking

281
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,430
all my friends are here.

282
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:31,210
But I decided to last month.

283
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,590
If you're going to study abroad...

284
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,650
When will you return?

285
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,790
You're not going to return at all?

286
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,440
I don't know.

287
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,770
Maybe in four or five years later?

288
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,990
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

289
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,580
I'm sorry.

290
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,440
I can't say it when I look at your face.

291
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:05,940
But... I can't keep postponing it any longer.

292
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,010
Do you have to go?

293
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,320
Yes.

294
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,030
Doha.

295
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,940
Hmm?

296
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,210
Uh... Nothing.

297
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,650
I knew it...

298
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,930
You wouldn't ask me to stay.

299
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,440
You still like Mr. Nam, right?

300
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,110
I lost our bet.

301
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,510
Doha!

302
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,060
Thank you for everything.

303
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,650
Yoon Woohyeon.

304
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,330
You're late for the ceremony.

305
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,540
You have a fever.

306
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,410
I got caught in the rain.

307
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,320
Do you have to go?

308
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,610
Yeah.

309
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,230
I don't know since when,

310
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,830
but I've liked you for a long time.

311
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,510
I miss you so much.

312
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,310
Yoon Woohyeon. Did you fight with Doha?

313
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,310
What's going on?

314
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,240
There's something weird between you two now.

315
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,900
You're so slow-witted.

316
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,330
I...

317
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,320
broke up with Doha.

318
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,550
What?

319
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:02,870
Doha!

320
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,190
Yoon Woohyeon.

321
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,940
Are you here to see Park Doha?

322
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,270
He just left.

323
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,790
How did you know?

324
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,770
Because I confessed to Park Doha.

325
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,780
What?
