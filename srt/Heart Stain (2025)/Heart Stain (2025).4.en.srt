"Heart Stain"
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:21,129
(Kim Ji Oh as Yoon Woohyun)

3
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,886
(Hamin as Park Doha)

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,850
(Kang Yeon Jae as Nam Jeongmin)

5
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,785
(Shin Siye as Lee Sori
Yoo Hosoo as Park Taemin)

6
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,310
(Kim Leegon as Kwon Junsu)

7
00:01:14,192 --> 00:01:15,902
I'll start.

8
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:37,715
Alright. Shall we see?

9
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:44,520
Wait.

10
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:49,341
Are you a heartbreaker?

11
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:51,388
Huh?

12
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:53,950
Did you see this card?

13
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:56,473
Your cards say you have two

14
00:01:56,481 --> 00:01:58,463
romantic interests at the same time,

15
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:01,177
and you'll be super confused.

16
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:04,091
What nonsense is that, Lee Sori?

17
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:05,567
No.

18
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:09,544
Hwatu cards never lie.

19
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,411
What are you bawling in the morning for?

20
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:31,840
Suyoung got a girlfriend!

21
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:35,052
What am I supposed to do?

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,091
You just found out?

23
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,652
Wait, you already knew?

24
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:43,810
Jerk!

25
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:45,249
Can you choose one thing?

26
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,436
Either hit me or cry.

27
00:02:46,717 --> 00:02:50,560
I don't know. What do I do?

28
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:52,854
What do I do?

29
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:56,575
- Oh, Doha.
- Are you still at home?

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,032
Yeah, just go ahead without me today.

31
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:02,052
I have to take this Lee Sori to school.

32
00:03:02,385 --> 00:03:03,833
- Is that so?
- Sorry about that.

33
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:04,858
See you later.

34
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:08,689
Stop crying already.

35
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,150
My brother didn't just

36
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,606
have a girlfriend.

37
00:03:12,002 --> 00:03:14,228
That was when we were in middle school!

38
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:15,806
It's different now.

39
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:17,222
How is it different?

40
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,689
I'm almost an adult now.

41
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,728
Who knows what will happen.

42
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:29,283
Still, to him, you're too young for him.

43
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,927
Fine! I won't ever be with him.

44
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,107
Happy now?

45
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:37,185
How annoying!

46
00:03:42,204 --> 00:03:45,064
I'm not that different from you.

47
00:03:58,393 --> 00:03:59,416
Park Doha.

48
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:02,142
Kwon Junseo.

49
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,994
How have you been?

50
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,072
Playing hard to get as usual.

51
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,166
But you're still as pretty as ever.

52
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,127
Why didn't you accept my friend request?

53
00:04:21,869 --> 00:04:23,892
Why should I?

54
00:04:26,814 --> 00:04:28,689
So you saw it.

55
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,510
- Hello.
- Hey.

56
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:48,760
- Oh, Woohyun.
- Hello.

57
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:51,282
Hello, Teacher.

58
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:53,705
Sori, are you sick?

59
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,900
- She's heartbroken.
- No, I'm not!

60
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,627
She wasn't planning to

61
00:04:58,651 --> 00:04:59,548
come to school today.

62
00:04:59,572 --> 00:05:01,049
I had to drag her here.

63
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:03,844
Woohyun is a good kid,

64
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,603
looking after your friend like that.

65
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,307
Alright, I'll see you later.

66
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:13,252
- See you later, sir.
- Mm.

67
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,650
Why is my heart beating so hard?

68
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:22,752
What?

69
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,682
We're both on the same boat.

70
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:28,631
Are you making a snide remark about me?

71
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,252
I really envy science students.

72
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,486
It's annoying to take the stairs.

73
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:38,095
You don't like stairs either, right?

74
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,658
What are you trying to do now?

75
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:47,744
Go on ahead.

76
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,792
Hey, why are you avoiding me?

77
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,431
Don't do that.

78
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,876
It's all in the past anyway.

79
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,822
It's all in the past?

80
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:00,642
You're the type to hold onto the past.

81
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,627
I've already forgotten.

82
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:06,330
We're graduating soon,

83
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:07,947
there's no harm in it.

84
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,486
You jerk.

85
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,416
- What's going on?
- Woohyun.

86
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:20,064
Hello. Are you his boyfriend?

87
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,111
The hell with "hello," just get lost.

88
00:06:23,432 --> 00:06:25,033
That's a bit harsh.

89
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:35,690
What kind of relationship

90
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:36,901
do you have with him?

91
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:42,642
A super strong relationship.

92
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:46,213
Not bad, Park Doha.

93
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,744
What was that about?

94
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:08,900
What?

95
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,007
What were you talking about

96
00:07:11,023 --> 00:07:12,132
with Kwon Junseo earlier?

97
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:14,572
It's none of your business.

98
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,057
How can I not care?

99
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,603
Keep your voice down.

100
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:21,783
It's nothing.

101
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,971
You...

102
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,682
Class is starting.

103
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:30,986
Where did everyone go?

104
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:33,408
Is everyone all seated?

105
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:34,703
- Yes.
- Yes.

106
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:36,407
The midterm exam schedule is out,

107
00:07:36,432 --> 00:07:37,472
so check it.

108
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:38,962
After the exam,

109
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:40,978
we'll have college counseling.

110
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,549
Oh, this is my favorite.

111
00:08:05,775 --> 00:08:07,822
How is it? Good?

112
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,524
Do you know Kwon Junseo?

113
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:11,432
Yeah, how could I not?

114
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:13,642
He's famous for having a bad reputation.

115
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,346
He caused a big scandal

116
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,717
when we were freshmen.

117
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:17,741
Don't you remember?

118
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,535
I don't know, I don't remember.

119
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,502
I even know. Why don't you know?

120
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:24,330
You don't care much about others.

121
00:08:26,861 --> 00:08:28,243
Weren't you and Park Doha

122
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,470
in the same class in grade 10?

123
00:08:29,572 --> 00:08:31,549
Yeah. Ahh...

124
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,774
Doha and Kwon Junseo were close.

125
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:38,346
- Doha was close to that guy?
- Doha?

126
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,752
- That's surprising.
- Right?

127
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,144
Kwon Junseo's gang is

128
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:43,378
a gang of delinquent.

129
00:08:43,402 --> 00:08:44,722
But Doha was the only one

130
00:08:44,738 --> 00:08:45,911
who didn't belong.

131
00:08:45,935 --> 00:08:47,315
But at some point,

132
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:49,206
he stopped hanging out with them.

133
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,736
Did they fight or something?

134
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:54,189
Maybe.

135
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:02,222
(Okay, I'll study too)

136
00:09:02,247 --> 00:09:04,142
(Okay, keep it up)

137
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,206
(Are you going to study alone?
Let's do it together. Won't be boring)

138
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,012
(Doha: Let me study alone.
See you at school tomorrow)

139
00:09:11,476 --> 00:09:14,252
Can't you at least tell me?

140
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,549
It's making me worried.

141
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:38,252
Ah, it's over.

142
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:40,057
let's go, guys.

143
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,346
Wait a second,

144
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,720
I have something to say to Woohyun.

145
00:09:47,307 --> 00:09:49,830
Then we'll go first.

146
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:51,713
-I'll head out first.
- Okay.

147
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:53,674
- You're going?
- No, no.

148
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,408
Did you do well on the exam?

149
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:06,260
So-so.

150
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,978
And you?

151
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,103
Me too.

152
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:14,760
Well...

153
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:16,838
About the other day...

154
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:20,361
- I'm sorry.
- Huh?

155
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:24,189
You were just worried about me,

156
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:27,221
but I was being unreasonable.

157
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:30,799
But really, that day was nothing.

158
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,384
It's just that Kwon Junseo

159
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:35,501
and I had a little problem before.

160
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:39,228
I'm saying I'm sorry.

161
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:46,672
Doha.

162
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,461
That's not

163
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:51,408
how you make up.

164
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,041
Huh?

165
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:55,580
Didn't you learn in kindergarten?

166
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:59,236
When you make up, you hug each other

167
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:02,947
and say, “I'm sorry,” and “It's okay.”

168
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:22,603
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:24,775
It's okay, buddy.

170
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,267
Aren't I heavy?

171
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,470
Not at all.

172
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,377
You need to eat properly.

173
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:34,775
I eat three meals a day.

174
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:43,103
Is things between you and

175
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,166
Kwon Junseo really that bad?

176
00:11:48,432 --> 00:11:49,432
Yes.

177
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:54,908
You don't really want to talk about it?

178
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:57,924
Yes.

179
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:04,057
Then you don't have to.

180
00:12:06,424 --> 00:12:07,650
Okay.

181
00:12:23,572 --> 00:12:25,424
- Oh.
- Teacher.

182
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:27,994
You guys still haven't gone home?

183
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:29,784
Yes.

184
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:34,182
Am I interrupting something?

185
00:12:34,562 --> 00:12:36,510
No, umm...

186
00:12:36,885 --> 00:12:38,444
We were comforting each other

187
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,772
after the exam disaster.

188
00:12:40,533 --> 00:12:42,799
Ah, I see.

189
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,853
Here it is.

190
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,774
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

191
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,649
Get home and rest.

192
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:55,274
You worked hard on the exam.

193
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:56,797
We'll get going.

194
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,079
There's someone I like,

195
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,079
but he's a guy.

196
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:15,203
It's Doha?

197
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:23,860
- You want to date brother?
- You want to date brother?

198
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,383
Yes. Just this once,

199
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:27,735
please help me.

200
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,313
But how exactly do I help?

201
00:13:29,735 --> 00:13:31,766
You want me to compliment you to him?

202
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:35,297
Are you kidding? Do you have no brain?

203
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:37,111
So you want to go

204
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,766
on a date with Suyoung?

205
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,836
That's right, you're smart, Doha.

206
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,868
I feel like if I can

207
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:42,893
just go on one date,

208
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,908
I'll be able to let go of him.

209
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:47,118
But that's really selfish.

210
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,031
Doesn't he already have a girlfriend?

211
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:51,344
What do you know, Park Doha?

212
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,500
I know I'm being selfish.

213
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,516
But what can I do?

214
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,297
I want to try something

215
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,666
before I give up.

216
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,329
So how can I help you?

217
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:07,249
The three of us haven't eaten

218
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:08,358
together in a long time.

219
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,444
Let's have a meal together in Seoul.

220
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:11,758
And I'll step out midway?

221
00:14:12,095 --> 00:14:13,376
Your brain has returned?

222
00:14:14,516 --> 00:14:16,305
Okay, fine.

223
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:18,235
Thanks, really!

224
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:21,774
What are you trying to do?

225
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,984
She wanted to be rejected first

226
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:25,063
before giving up.

227
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:32,368
Is she arriving soon?

228
00:14:33,438 --> 00:14:35,383
Probably.

229
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:37,000
I called earlier, and she said

230
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,875
she'd be arriving around now.

231
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:44,938
How did Sori sound over the phone?

232
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:46,930
Well...

233
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:53,243
Well, just like now.

234
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,805
Seems like it hurt a lot.

235
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:04,852
Yeah.

236
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,196
- Yes, brother?
- Yoon Woohyun.

237
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:21,649
- Mm.
- Where are you?

238
00:15:21,674 --> 00:15:23,868
- Oh, you arrived?
- I'm asking where you are.

239
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,040
I'm still at home.

240
00:15:26,311 --> 00:15:29,227
- Did you just wake up?
- No, I didn't just wake up.

241
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:30,916
I took off from part-time job to come,

242
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:32,013
what the hell are you doing?

243
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:33,594
Oww, I...

244
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,897
I suddenly had a really bad stomachache.

245
00:15:35,922 --> 00:15:37,187
Yeah right, just say

246
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:38,453
you're too lazy to come.

247
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:40,110
I'm not lazy.

248
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:42,273
What I'm saying is,

249
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:43,937
just meet up with Sori.

250
00:15:43,961 --> 00:15:45,554
Are you serious? Why would I

251
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:46,844
meet with Sori alone?

252
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,070
I should have known when

253
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:49,500
you said you were coming up here...

254
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:51,032
What are you even doing?

255
00:15:51,057 --> 00:15:52,657
Think I have all the time in the world?

256
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:55,718
- I made the time to come see you.
- Hello. Hello.

257
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,173
- Are you even listening?
- Yeah, yeah.

258
00:15:57,198 --> 00:15:58,579
Have fun.

259
00:15:58,604 --> 00:16:00,243
- Oh, Sori.
- Yes.

260
00:16:00,477 --> 00:16:02,493
You... I'll call you back.

261
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Okay.

262
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,649
That went as planned.

263
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:12,141
Seriously, is Yoon Suyoung

264
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,531
the only guy in the world?

265
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,438
Stop being so dramatic.

266
00:16:15,813 --> 00:16:17,859
Yeah, Sori, you can meet someone better.

267
00:16:17,884 --> 00:16:19,047
There's only one.

268
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:25,594
To me, the only man is Suyoung.

269
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:28,875
What are you even saying?

270
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:32,993
I really liked him.

271
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:37,968
When I asked him how he felt

272
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:39,733
now that he got a girlfriend.

273
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:42,071
He said he was happy.

274
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,304
And he really looked

275
00:16:44,312 --> 00:16:45,992
so happy saying that.

276
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:51,472
So what could I possibly say?

277
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,602
I wanted to tell him I liked him...

278
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,375
But I couldn't say anything.

279
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,709
You already knew it wouldn't

280
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,084
work out, Yoon Woohyun.

281
00:17:34,884 --> 00:17:37,506
But why do I still feel bad?

282
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,108
How's Sori?

283
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:56,147
If

284
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,897
I had liked Doha from the beginning...

285
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:01,178
I like you.

286
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,201
If that were the case,

287
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:16,279
at least I wouldn't feel this guilt.

288
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,791
If only my heart

289
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,272
could be controlled by me,

290
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:25,061
how great would that be?

291
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:29,897
I really want to stop everything.

292
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,920
Thanks for the date yesterday.

293
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:50,412
And I'm not giving up yet.

294
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:53,416
(Thanks for the date yesterday)

295
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:56,343
(And I'm not giving up yet)

296
00:18:56,368 --> 00:19:00,850
(Sori: I'm not giving up yet.)

297
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:09,451
(Doha)

298
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,615
Oh, Doha.

299
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,100
Mm, Woohyun.

300
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,061
Sorry, I fell asleep early yesterday.

301
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,475
I figured.

302
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:21,295
Sori's fine now.

303
00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:25,432
Sori's incredible.

304
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,053
What incredible?

305
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,420
She knew it wouldn't work out. How dumb.

306
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:33,381
But hey, are you feeling sick?

307
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:34,998
Huh?

308
00:19:35,452 --> 00:19:36,842
Your voice doesn't sound great.

309
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:40,496
Oh, I just woke up, maybe that's why.

310
00:19:41,998 --> 00:19:43,420
Wanna meet today?

311
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:47,506
Nah, I'll just study at the cafe today.

312
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:49,850
I see.

313
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:53,061
I'll hang up. Make sure to eat.

314
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,694
Mm.

315
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,623
They look so happy.

316
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,373
So this is what it means

317
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,076
to like each other.

318
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,020
Probably...

319
00:20:26,045 --> 00:20:27,365
doesn't have zero chance

320
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,755
to confess like I do, right?

321
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,428
I wish I could just graduate already.

322
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,352
That way...

323
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:41,529
I wouldn't have to run

324
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:42,803
into Teacher anymore.

325
00:20:46,467 --> 00:20:48,084
Woohyun?

326
00:20:50,498 --> 00:20:51,998
Teacher.

327
00:20:57,107 --> 00:20:58,600
Why aren't you drinking?

328
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,350
Do you not like strawberry smoothies?

329
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:02,686
No, sir.

330
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,614
Sorry. Are you alright?

331
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:14,178
I'm fine.

332
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,146
Where were you headed?

333
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:21,834
You dressed nicer than usual.

334
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,432
Really?

335
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:28,350
I met someone.

336
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,764
A date?

337
00:21:33,184 --> 00:21:35,334
Well, not exactly a date.

338
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:38,031
I'm at the age to get married.

339
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,231
Getting married?

340
00:21:41,303 --> 00:21:44,233
Maybe I'm sentimental because it's fall?

341
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:53,192
If you weren't a 12 grade student,

342
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,365
I would have invited you to drink beer.

343
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:56,429
What a shame.

344
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,912
I know I'm being selfish.

345
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:04,787
But what can I do?

346
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,720
I want to try something

347
00:22:06,745 --> 00:22:07,814
before I give up.

348
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,819
Teacher.

349
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:17,076
Yes?

350
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,983
I said I liked someone before, right?

351
00:22:23,654 --> 00:22:24,756
Mm.

352
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:29,959
That person is you.

353
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:40,693
(Next Episode)
Yoon Woohyun,

354
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:43,005
why are you so absent-minded today?

355
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,373
What of it?

356
00:22:44,398 --> 00:22:45,335
Class president,

357
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,529
the teacher called for you.

358
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:47,740
Doha.

359
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:51,358
- Could you go instead of me?
- Me?

360
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:55,584
- Woohyun.
- Woohyun's not feeling well.

361
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,193
Doha.

362
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:01,459
Doha, can you look after Woohyun?

363
00:23:01,889 --> 00:23:02,983
Yes, sir.

364
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:06,373
Please don't do it for Woohyun.

365
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:09,311
This is because of Mr. Jeongmin?

366
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:10,897
I so no.

367
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,061
Can't you lean on me?

368
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:16,108
If you're struggling, you can tell me.

369
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:18,412
You're also hiding things from me.

370
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,092
Park Doha?

371
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,548
And Park Doha obviously likes you.

372
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:23,911
What are you going to do about it?

373
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,505
I'm giving you a tip.

374
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,530
A tip?
