"Heart Stain"
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:17,867
(Kim Ji Oh as Yoon Woohyun)

3
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,835
(Hamin as Park Doha)

4
00:00:39,846 --> 00:00:42,846
(Kang Yeon Jae as Nam Jeongmin)

5
00:00:46,432 --> 00:00:49,492
(Shin Siye as Lee Sori
Yoo Hosoo as Park Taemin)

6
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:52,017
(Kim Leegon as Kwon Junsu)

7
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,525
Woohyun.

8
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,908
Woohyun.

9
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:39,705
Sorry.

10
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,329
I was lost in thought.

11
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,633
What were you thinking about that

12
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:46,517
you didn't even answer when called?

13
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:47,868
It's the school break so you're

14
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:49,032
staying up late, huh?

15
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,274
You have to take good care

16
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,490
of your health.

17
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,564
Got it?

18
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:01,345
Woohyun.

19
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,470
Are you feeling sick?

20
00:02:06,313 --> 00:02:07,571
Sorry.

21
00:02:07,596 --> 00:02:09,673
I was just startled.

22
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,289
I have some studying to do,

23
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:12,391
so I'll head in first.

24
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:26,814
I wonder how the teacher thinks of me.

25
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:33,626
The teacher only touch my forehead.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,634
Ah. You've come to your senses.

27
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:07,947
It's all your fault.

28
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:09,573
Huh? What?

29
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:11,962
It's true. It's all your fault.

30
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,197
Regardless, it's all your fault.

31
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,947
Don't flirt at school.

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,548
- What are you talking about?
- Right.

33
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:21,947
Mr. Jeongmin was looking for you two.

34
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:23,775
- Mr. Jeongmin?
- Yes.

35
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,079
- Why?
- No idea.

36
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,259
I don't know why he called you two.

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,400
You're the class president,
so it makes sense,

38
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,064
but why me?

39
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:38,494
You'll find out when you get there.

40
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,657
Teacher,

41
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:44,376
I heard you were looking for us?

42
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:46,416
Me?

43
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,166
Yes. I heard from Park Taemin.

44
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,408
I only called for Woohyun.

45
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,814
Me? What is it?

46
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,528
Recommended letter from the headmaster.

47
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:58,981
You'll need it when you

48
00:03:58,989 --> 00:03:59,975
apply for admission., yes?

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,184
I just need to confirm

50
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,517
a few things with you.

51
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:05,048
- Yes.
- Come to the faculty office later.

52
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,689
Okay, when should I come?

53
00:04:07,818 --> 00:04:10,142
It's not urgent, just come whenever.

54
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:13,486
Then, is it okay if I come tomorrow?

55
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:15,361
Ah, here we go again.

56
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:19,408
Oh, the bell rang.

57
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:21,330
Now both of you get back to class.

58
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:24,369
Yes. I'll come by the office later.

59
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,025
See you then.

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,213
About you liking the teacher…

61
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,516
Huh?

62
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,104
I didn't notice before, but

63
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,095
now that I know, it's so obvious.

64
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,666
Really?

65
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:45,642
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:49,494
Why are you apologizing?

67
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,510
I am the one who is at a disadvantage.

68
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:52,869
What can I do?

69
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,081
Still…

70
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,369
Then,

71
00:04:57,174 --> 00:04:58,377
can we hold hands?

72
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:01,811
We're at school.

73
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,161
Everyone's in class now.

74
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,408
Do you like holding hands that much?

75
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,080
Of course!

76
00:05:21,241 --> 00:05:23,502
We're dating, so why wouldn't I like it?

77
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:26,631
Not my problem if someone sees.

78
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:29,002
No one would notice.

79
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:30,205
Yoon Woohyun.

80
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,455
Lee Sori?

81
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,908
What were you two saying earlier?

82
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,033
Don't tell me you two are dating?

83
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,197
How could this be?

84
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:46,177
- Sori, it's not...
- How could you be dating?

85
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:02,635
Since when have you two been dating?

86
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,183
Did you seriously call me here

87
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,650
during lunch break for this?

88
00:06:05,674 --> 00:06:07,306
- You see...
- Of course!

89
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:08,752
This is a matter of life
and death for me!

90
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:10,220
Why is this a life-or-death matter
for you?

91
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,361
Of course, it is! Because I...

92
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,017
I care about your matter.

93
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,283
Why do you even care about me?

94
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,806
That's my business.

95
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,919
Lee Sori has been friends with Woohyun
since they were young.

96
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:25,283
Their relationship is like siblings.

97
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,968
If my intuition is right,

98
00:06:27,992 --> 00:06:29,078
Sori

99
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:30,760
thinks of Woohyun...

100
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:33,650
Yoon Woohyun, how can you be dating?

101
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,791
Sori, just now

102
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,048
what you saw at school

103
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,485
just forget about it, okay?

104
00:06:39,994 --> 00:06:41,735
I'm totally in shock right now.

105
00:06:41,744 --> 00:06:44,210
There's no way I'll ever forget this.

106
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:48,049
You like holding hands that much?

107
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:49,689
Of course!

108
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:51,953
We're dating, so why wouldn't I like it?

109
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:53,782
Not my problem if someone sees.

110
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:55,502
No one would notice.

111
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,368
Ah, seriously!

112
00:06:57,393 --> 00:06:59,213
Yoon Woohyun, how can you be dating?

113
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:00,549
It already happened.

114
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:01,775
Sori, regardless...

115
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:03,674
Sorry.

116
00:07:03,764 --> 00:07:04,845
Huh?

117
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,806
Huh?

118
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:08,721
Why are you apologizing for

119
00:07:08,737 --> 00:07:10,161
dating Yoon Woohyun?

120
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:13,674
Well, are you okay?

121
00:07:14,074 --> 00:07:15,080
What do you mean?

122
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,416
That we're both guys?

123
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,697
I have no prejudice against that, okay?

124
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:21,470
No, that's not what I mean.

125
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,485
Park Doha, what are you

126
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:24,766
even saying right now?

127
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,345
I mean… Sori,

128
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,002
likes you, right?

129
00:07:29,322 --> 00:07:30,877
- What?
- What?

130
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:32,525
No?

131
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,563
That's the most awful thing

132
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,829
I've heard all year.

133
00:07:37,661 --> 00:07:39,635
- She actually likes my older brother.
- Hey, Yoon Woohyun!

134
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,854
- That was supposed to be a secret?
- Exactly!

135
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,493
How is it a secret?

136
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:45,433
You compliment him a 100 times a day.

137
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:48,228
It's only a secret to other people.

138
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:49,508
Your brother?

139
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:50,635
Suyoung, right?

140
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,306
Yes, but...

141
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:54,541
He doesn't care about her at all.

142
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,241
A completely one-sided crush.

143
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,281
The chance of it being mutual?
Less than 1%.

144
00:07:58,326 --> 00:07:59,924
Shut up, Yoon Woohyun.

145
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:01,600
Come to think of it, I've never

146
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,186
seen your brother before.

147
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,936
You'd be shocked if you saw him.

148
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,228
He's insanely handsome.

149
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:07,861
- Completely different from someone.
- Insanely handsome.

150
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,541
- Because he looks like me.
- Stop talking nonsense.

151
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,707
You only get treated like a human being

152
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:13,900
because of Suyoung.

153
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,658
He is so good-looking,

154
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,994
Everything is perfect. Flawless.

155
00:08:18,019 --> 00:08:20,275
Light skin. Monolids.

156
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,202
Anyway, the fact that

157
00:08:25,227 --> 00:08:27,041
you two are dating is a secret, right?

158
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,579
Yeah, there's no reason

159
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:29,680
for others to know.

160
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,352
Right. Understood.

161
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:34,416
Since Doha is cute,

162
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:35,619
I'll make an exception

163
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:36,776
and keep the secret.

164
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,275
What? You sound like your old man.

165
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,767
Anyway, Doha. Congratulations.

166
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,252
But is this something to congratulate?

167
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:49,377
Having Yoon Woohyun as your boyfriend.

168
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,424
- Thanks.
- Haa...

169
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,286
Oh. Lunch break is already over.

170
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:58,681
I'm heading out first. See you.

171
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,885
What?

172
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,159
The college entrance exam

173
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:16,425
is still far away.

174
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,010
Far away? More like

175
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:19,452
there's not much time left.

176
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,956
I'm so sick of this.

177
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,775
Hey, aren't you supposed to go to

178
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,956
the teacher's office for

179
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:26,846
the recommendation letter?

180
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,010
Right!

181
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,425
- I totally forgot because of Sori.
- Sori.

182
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,662
- My Sori? What about her?
- What do you mean yours?

183
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:49,159
Now, if you start preparing now,

184
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:51,121
it'll be easier when applying.

185
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:52,818
Thank you.

186
00:09:54,143 --> 00:09:55,697
Are you really going to be

187
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,409
my junior in college?

188
00:09:58,127 --> 00:09:59,370
I'd like that.

189
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,229
Thank you.

190
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:08,760
Okay. Oh?

191
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:11,424
Why are there only three books?

192
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,362
Huh?

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,213
Oh, one's missing.

194
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,932
It must be at my place.

195
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,698
Do you have time tomorrow?

196
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,018
- I can meet up and give it to you.
- Huh?

197
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:28,409
Yes.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,893
Alright, see you tomorrow.

199
00:10:46,284 --> 00:10:48,041
Just dress normally.

200
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,737
Act natural.

201
00:11:12,997 --> 00:11:14,299
Teacher.

202
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,634
You're here.

203
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:22,862
I'm thinking of treating you.

204
00:11:23,185 --> 00:11:24,635
It's okay.

205
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:26,518
How can I make a student buy for me?

206
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:30,322
Still, it's the weekend,

207
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:32,221
and you came all the way out

208
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:33,823
just to give me the book.

209
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:35,604
Because it's you, Woohyun.

210
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:40,565
Here.

211
00:11:41,478 --> 00:11:43,143
Thank you, teacher.

212
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:45,049
Because it's you,

213
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,588
I made time for this specially.

214
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:48,346
Yes.

215
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,353
What are you doing?

216
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:07,867
Nothing.

217
00:12:07,905 --> 00:12:09,132
Since it's the weekend,

218
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:10,632
don't you have any plans?

219
00:12:11,284 --> 00:12:13,916
Like, hanging out with someone?

220
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,268
Or going on a date?

221
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:19,932
Date?

222
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,698
Haa... I don't know.

223
00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,385
Now I am an advisor for grade 12.

224
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,268
No one is interested. Why?

225
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:30,323
Do you think I'm someone

226
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:31,737
who is in a relationship?

227
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:32,761
Huh?

228
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:36,183
Yes.

229
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:40,573
Right now, they're too busy

230
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:41,644
taking care of you guys

231
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,323
to think about dating.

232
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:49,684
Still, I'm at the age to get married.

233
00:12:50,948 --> 00:12:52,760
So, what about Woohyun?

234
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:54,517
You're not dating anyone?

235
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:56,073
Yes?

236
00:12:57,034 --> 00:12:59,401
Last time, you said you liked someone.

237
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,299
Oh.

238
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:04,526
About that...

239
00:13:06,463 --> 00:13:08,142
I think Woohyun would make

240
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,678
a great boyfriend.

241
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:35,642
Are you heading straight home?

242
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:36,726
Want me to send you?

243
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:39,049
No, I'm going to the study café.

244
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,196
Wow. That's admirable.

245
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:44,243
Alright, study hard.

246
00:13:44,268 --> 00:13:46,159
- See you on Monday.
- Yes.

247
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:06,698
Hello.

248
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:08,479
What are you doing? Are you outside?

249
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,432
You're not answering my texts.

250
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:13,578
Oh, I was busy.

251
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:15,134
Huh?

252
00:14:15,674 --> 00:14:17,384
I met Mr. Jeongmin.

253
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:20,034
Are you still with him?

254
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:21,983
No, he left, and I'm heading

255
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,061
to the study café.

256
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,213
- Do you want to come?
- Mm...

257
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:29,194
Instead of that, why don't you

258
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,570
come to my place?

259
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,276
Did the teacher give you something?

260
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,025
Yeah, a set of three books

261
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:42,541
on essay strategies.

262
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:43,838
One was missing.

263
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:47,854
Ah. I see.

264
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:58,440
But why do you sound

265
00:14:58,456 --> 00:14:59,901
so down after meeting him?

266
00:15:01,156 --> 00:15:02,346
Me?

267
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,963
Yes.

268
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:06,869
You seem to be feeling weirdly

269
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:07,940
low since earlier.

270
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:11,476
The teacher just asked

271
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,180
if I was studying well

272
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,127
telling me to work harder,

273
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:16,591
nagging as usual.

274
00:15:17,854 --> 00:15:20,088
And that made you feel down?

275
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:21,291
Grade 12 students can

276
00:15:21,315 --> 00:15:22,932
easily lose their mind like this.

277
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,596
You have a scar on your forehead.

278
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:33,784
Huh?

279
00:15:34,526 --> 00:15:35,674
Let me see.

280
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,494
Oh...

281
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:47,276
It must have been a shadow.

282
00:15:47,597 --> 00:15:48,768
I saw it wrong.

283
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:18,651
I'm going outside for a bit.

284
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:50,299
Hey.

285
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,049
That startled me.

286
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:56,088
- You look really tired.
- Huh?

287
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,666
Right, Woohyun.

288
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:00,627
You left your book behind.

289
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:02,635
Thanks for grabbing it for me.

290
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,463
Hey, guys.

291
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,065
- Did you have a good weekend?
- Yes.

292
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:16,831
Teacher, we'll get going first.

293
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:19,135
Woohyun, let's go.

294
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,956
Ugh, I'm so hungry.

295
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,174
You just ate less than two hours ago.

296
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:39,400
Exactly.

297
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,985
Who else but you gets hungry

298
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,050
at this time?

299
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,690
It's not just me.

300
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,064
What are you eating again?

301
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,127
Didn't you eat?

302
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:49,534
Don't bother me.

303
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,082
- Sori.
- What?

304
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,979
How do you keep getting prettier?

305
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,252
Yoon Woohyun, buy me chocolate milk.

306
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,034
Take it, it's from my heart.

307
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:06,565
Thanks.

308
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:15,065
So good!

309
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,752
You know, an old man downing

310
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,119
a shot of liquor looks just

311
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:19,744
like you right now.

312
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:23,256
What? I take after my mom.

313
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,863
Oh, so your mom is beautiful.

314
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:27,609
But you actually look exactly

315
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:28,834
like your dad.

316
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,564
No way! My dad looks like a bear,

317
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:33,111
and I totally have a puppy face.

318
00:18:33,136 --> 00:18:34,323
See? Dog style girls

319
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,947
are the most beautiful.

320
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:37,393
You don't even know

321
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,089
what a puppy looks like.

322
00:18:40,516 --> 00:18:42,618
Get lost.

323
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,563
Your dad would be sad

324
00:18:45,579 --> 00:18:47,019
- if he heard that.
- Hey.

325
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:48,909
My brother also said that

326
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,658
you look like your dad.

327
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,619
- Huh?
- He looks exactly like you.

328
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:57,555
Yoon Woohyun!

329
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,760
How dare you drag Suyoung into this?

330
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:03,174
- That hurts!
- You're dead!

331
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:05,658
- You deserve death!
- Stop fighting.

332
00:19:05,683 --> 00:19:07,549
You think you're so tough?

333
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:09,651
Sori!

334
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,156
Yoon Woohyun, you jerk,
did you just hit a girl?

335
00:19:12,181 --> 00:19:13,626
Sori, are you okay?

336
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,774
That hurt!

337
00:19:24,737 --> 00:19:26,321
What are you guys doing?

338
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,516
What's going on?

339
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:35,563
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

340
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:38,673
Enough.

341
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,441
Sori. Go back to the classroom first.

342
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:45,141
Yes. I'm sorry.

343
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:55,079
Woohyun.

344
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,571
Did I misunderstand you?

345
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:01,287
How could a man fight with a woman?

346
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:02,844
- But Teacher...
- Is this really something

347
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,330
that needs an explanation?

348
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:09,946
No.

349
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:11,813
Yoon Woohyun.

350
00:20:11,923 --> 00:20:13,016
You're in grade 12 and

351
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:14,082
you're the class president.

352
00:20:14,107 --> 00:20:15,844
You should be setting an example

353
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,141
but you acted this way.

354
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:20,306
I'm disappointed in you.

355
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,540
I'm sorry.

356
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,556
Are you okay?

357
00:20:36,524 --> 00:20:37,970
I feel bad.

358
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:41,743
Oh. Mmm.

359
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:52,118
Drink this and cheer up.

360
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:54,704
Thanks.

361
00:20:57,079 --> 00:20:59,430
Did the teacher scold you a lot?

362
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:01,218
Yes.

363
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:02,609
I've never seen he

364
00:21:02,633 --> 00:21:03,848
make that face before.

365
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:06,472
Because he always saw you as a good kid.

366
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:22,914
Do you...

367
00:21:24,024 --> 00:21:25,485
feel that awful?

368
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,407
Just a little.

369
00:21:29,948 --> 00:21:31,290
Mm...

370
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,259
What should I do?

371
00:21:43,946 --> 00:21:45,251
Comfort me.

372
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:48,806
Comfort?

373
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:53,641
Pat my head.

374
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:00,306
Like this?

375
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:09,071
And...

376
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,227
And?

377
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,579
Let's go home. It will be late.

378
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:21,625
Mm.

379
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,587
(School behavior record)

380
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,165
Did I say it too harshly?

381
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:10,087
The semester started
and you went all out.

382
00:23:10,215 --> 00:23:11,845
If you're jealous,

383
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,595
just say you're jealous.

384
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:19,415
- Where are you going?
- To see the teacher for a moment.

385
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,970
Park Taemin, change seats with me.

386
00:23:24,993 --> 00:23:28,139
Is Doha sad for dating me?

387
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:29,976
What do you do when you want to

388
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,734
make up with your friend?

389
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:33,516
That friend...

390
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:34,937
Is it the one you said

391
00:23:34,962 --> 00:23:36,898
you liked last time?

392
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:39,522
- No.
- I'm jealous of that friend.

393
00:23:39,547 --> 00:23:40,882
Because Woohyun cares

394
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:42,491
about him this much.

395
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:44,969
Can you not go to the teacher's office?

396
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,367
What do you mean?

397
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:47,743
If no one called or

398
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,220
you don't have any business,

399
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:50,423
can't you stay with me?

400
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:52,190
I'm relieved that it's a trivial matter.

401
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,633
A trivial matter?

402
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:55,750
Doha.

403
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,250
You see,

404
00:23:57,985 --> 00:23:59,578
I like you.

405
00:23:59,697 --> 00:24:02,296
Sorry. I'm the bad one.

406
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:03,635
I shouldn't have done that.

407
00:24:07,008 --> 00:24:08,805
(Heart Stain)
