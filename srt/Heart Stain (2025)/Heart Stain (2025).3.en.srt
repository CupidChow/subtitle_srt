"Heart Stain"
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:21,129
(Kim Ji Oh as Yoon Woohyun)

3
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,886
(Hamin as Park Doha)

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,850
(Kang Yeon Jae as Nam Jeongmin)

5
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,785
(Shin Siye as Lee Sori
Yoo Hosoo as Park Taemin)

6
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,310
(Kim Leegon as Kwon Junsu)

7
00:01:12,582 --> 00:01:15,105
- What to study first?
- I don't know.

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,089
- Not sure. Math?
- Is it not English?

9
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:21,113
Can we skip math?

10
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:29,715
So sleepy.

11
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,949
- You're here.
- Mm.

12
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:41,114
- You're cold?
- Yeah.

13
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,346
I thought it'd be hot in the afternoon,

14
00:01:44,362 --> 00:01:45,690
so I didn't wear a gym uniform.

15
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,254
But I should have.

16
00:01:48,279 --> 00:01:49,965
Want to wear my gym uniform?

17
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,512
Is it okay?

18
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,645
Why do gym clothes smell so good?

19
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:03,512
I washed them yesterday.

20
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:06,020
Why does it look so big on you?

21
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:08,653
No, it's not!

22
00:02:09,078 --> 00:02:10,840
You just want to believe that.

23
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,957
The semester just started and

24
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:15,211
you two are wild already.

25
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,262
Honestly, how many days

26
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:17,229
have you two dated?

27
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:18,163
Huh?

28
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,644
You can be honest with me,

29
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,814
little brother.

30
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:22,176
What are you talking about? Scram.

31
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,450
I understand everything.

32
00:02:23,475 --> 00:02:25,106
Even if you guys said you're going to

33
00:02:25,131 --> 00:02:26,879
the U.S. to get married,
I'd still attend.

34
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:27,961
What are you saying?

35
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:29,684
Just don't throw a fit here because

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,191
you're not in a relationship.

37
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,660
It's not that I'm unable
to find someone,

38
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:34,833
I'm just not looking for one.

39
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,332
I'm just holding back because

40
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:37,566
we're in grade 12.

41
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:40,356
Thinking that a friend is "holding back"

42
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,379
is sad.

43
00:02:41,415 --> 00:02:42,348
Even a dog knows that

44
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:43,292
you're unable to find one.

45
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:44,918
What are you saying?

46
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:47,270
Come on, just admit it.

47
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,043
- What?
- When you're jealous,

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,934
just say you're jealous.

49
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:59,793
Ugh. This is so annoying.

50
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:07,693
Was it obvious?

51
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:09,857
He's always talking nonsense,

52
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:10,904
just ignore him.

53
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,905
And

54
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:16,622
it's the truth isn't it?

55
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,896
Huh?

56
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,693
We're actually dating.

57
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,139
You...

58
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:29,997
Don't want to make it obvious?

59
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:33,958
No, it's not like that.

60
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:40,490
Then should I go around telling
people you're mine?

61
00:03:40,529 --> 00:03:42,623
- Hey, Park Doha!
- What?

62
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,178
You're getting more shameless.

63
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,061
What?

64
00:03:47,865 --> 00:03:49,990
How can you say things like that

65
00:03:50,015 --> 00:03:51,336
so casually?

66
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:01,936
Hello, students.

67
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:04,053
Good morning.

68
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,357
I want to announce it that

69
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:09,927
even the teacher finds out?

70
00:04:11,357 --> 00:04:12,903
EMX2.

71
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:15,071
From EMX2 to X2.

72
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:16,663
From the experiment choice one,

73
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,145
place the reaction vessel for MX and W,

74
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,544
and let them react.

75
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,672
Choice two. Measure the mass of MX,

76
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:27,881
Choice three. Measure the volume of X2.

77
00:04:29,873 --> 00:04:32,123
Then the experimental result

78
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,951
shows the mass of MX.

79
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,865
Then

80
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,428
the atomic weight of MX

81
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,489
is the answer, which is option three.

82
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:49,412
Next, let's solve problem number four.

83
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,833
Who will try to solve question

84
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:52,858
number four?

85
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,678
Alright. Class is over.

86
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:02,070
See you during home room time.

87
00:05:02,095 --> 00:05:03,718
- Yes.
- Yes.

88
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:14,506
- Where are you going?
- I'll go see the teacher for a bit.

89
00:05:26,514 --> 00:05:27,865
Teacher.

90
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,154
Yes, Woohyun?

91
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,787
The books you gave me were really good.

92
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,756
Thank you.

93
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,030
Okay.

94
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,029
I'm glad to hear that.

95
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,006
Did you have something to say?

96
00:05:45,223 --> 00:05:46,653
Teacher...

97
00:05:46,865 --> 00:05:48,670
I didn't hit Lee Sori.

98
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:50,802
I was trying to stop her,

99
00:05:50,826 --> 00:05:51,830
but it turned that way.

100
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:53,772
I didn't mean it at all.

101
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:00,615
- I know.
- Huh?

102
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:02,506
I don't really believe

103
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:05,724
that you hit Sori on purpose.

104
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,413
You said you were trying

105
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:08,452
to stop it, right?

106
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,178
And I also know you're not

107
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:11,256
that kind of person.

108
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,561
Even so why did you...

109
00:06:15,045 --> 00:06:16,263
Even so,

110
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:18,661
it's not right to fight in school.

111
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,084
Because you're the class president

112
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:23,549
I trust the most.

113
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,404
That's why this made me

114
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,896
even more disappointed.

115
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:32,936
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:39,061
I also have a younger sister like Sori.

117
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,576
There were so many times

118
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:43,722
I felt unfairly treated.

119
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,396
- Really?
- Of course.

120
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,374
Especially every time I get scolded.

121
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,717
But I always feel this way,

122
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:55,128
giving up to the person we love

123
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:57,722
means we have won.

124
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,795
I don't treasure Sori that much.

125
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,670
Woohyun, you've grown up so much,

126
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,562
but you're still just a kid.

127
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:14,771
Alright, see you later.

128
00:07:46,036 --> 00:07:48,067
Park Taemin, switch seats with me.

129
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:51,231
- Suddenly?
- Next period is self-study.

130
00:07:51,256 --> 00:07:52,490
I like sitting here and study.

131
00:07:53,482 --> 00:07:55,553
Alright.

132
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:11,240
Did you hear? Kim Jinsol and Lee Hana…

133
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:13,825
Really?

134
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,920
Yeah, but turns out Kim Jinsol

135
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,624
liked Lee Hana first.

136
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:21,606
And then it turns out,

137
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:23,396
Lee Hana has always liked Kim Jinsol.

138
00:08:24,685 --> 00:08:25,864
Seriously?

139
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:27,576
That's so crazy, isn't it?

140
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:28,802
They already liked each other

141
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:29,880
the whole time.

142
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:31,982
Yeah.

143
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:34,302
Haa... I'm so jealous.

144
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:37,045
When will I have a love like that?

145
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:45,896
Having someone I like

146
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:47,943
like me back

147
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,833
is like a miracle.

148
00:08:57,724 --> 00:08:58,967
What?

149
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:01,341
Are you saying I shouldn't even hope

150
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,624
for that kind of miracle?

151
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,950
Hey, Park Doha!

152
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:08,936
Wait for me! Dammit!

153
00:09:09,029 --> 00:09:10,545
Yoon Woohyun, let's go to karaoke.

154
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,889
No. I'm not going.

155
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:14,732
Woohyun, seriously, just once.

156
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:16,998
- Sori, let's go.
- No, not going.

157
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,592
Yoon Woohyun, just today!

158
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:20,756
Just sing three songs. Let's go.

159
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:22,624
You useless guys. Is no one

160
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:24,448
coming to karaoke with me?

161
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:26,551
We're seniors, we don't have
time for karaoke.

162
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,583
Seniors should go, that's exactly why!

163
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:31,512
We need to relieve stress from studying.

164
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:32,646
You should actually study first

165
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:33,474
before saying that.

166
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,334
I don't care, let's just go.

167
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:37,061
Let's go, Doha.

168
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,631
I'm not going.

169
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,599
I know, if Yoon Woohyun's not going,

170
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:43,825
you won't go either.

171
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:46,795
It can't be helped.

172
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,061
Shall we go just the two of us?

173
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,475
- Sure!
- Really?

174
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:53,561
Mm.

175
00:09:53,586 --> 00:09:55,217
Yeah. I've been feeling stressed

176
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,733
about forgiving Yoon Woohyun,

177
00:09:56,757 --> 00:09:58,326
so I need a change of mood.

178
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,436
That's just an excuse.

179
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:00,873
It's not an excuse!

180
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,896
Hey, you two enjoy your date!

181
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:05,568
Mind your own business.

182
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,607
Doha,

183
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,006
wait for me.

184
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:14,334
You should go with Taemin.

185
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,693
Properly make up with Sori.

186
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,411
Those two would probably

187
00:10:18,427 --> 00:10:19,567
be happier going alone.

188
00:10:19,592 --> 00:10:21,144
And...

189
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:23,565
And what?

190
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:24,866
When I go home,

191
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,303
I have to go back with you.

192
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,607
Do you have something on your mind?

193
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:37,123
No.

194
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,655
You've been acting strange

195
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,687
since yesterday.

196
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:51,240
What's wrong?

197
00:10:53,856 --> 00:10:55,121
Could it be that

198
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,443
I did something wrong?

199
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:02,529
It's not that. I'll go home first today.

200
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:04,834
Bye-bye.

201
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:09,076
Doha!

202
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,318
(Time sale)

203
00:11:18,343 --> 00:11:19,850
(The reason why your
ISFJ partner avoiding you)

204
00:11:20,155 --> 00:11:21,155
Oh!

205
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:24,912
Park Doha is an ISFJ.

206
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:26,598
(Because you're ugly)

207
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,238
(Tired of the other person doing the
same thing over and over again)

208
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:31,693
(Regret that you two are dating)

209
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,139
No way.

210
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,896
Is Doha regretting dating me?

211
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:43,678
So tired.

212
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,092
Hey.

213
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,904
The handsome Taemin is here.

214
00:11:58,006 --> 00:11:59,482
So noisy.

215
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:05,215
Why are you sighing so much?

216
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,592
- Hey.
- What?

217
00:12:07,741 --> 00:12:09,529
- Am I ugly?
- No.

218
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,856
Really?

219
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:12,014
You're seriously so ugly.

220
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:13,693
Not just ugly,

221
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,615
- but extremely ugly.
- Hey!

222
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,193
Honestly, what else is there to look at

223
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:18,231
in our classroom besides me?

224
00:12:18,256 --> 00:12:20,904
Ah, these foolish mortals…

225
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,685
Scram.

226
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:27,638
- Where are you going?
- The teachers' office.

227
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,342
Again.

228
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,912
Teacher.

229
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,568
Oh, Woohyun. What's up?

230
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:46,514
Are you worried about something?

231
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:50,154
How did you know?

232
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:53,615
It's all over your face.

233
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:58,748
Sit down.

234
00:13:06,358 --> 00:13:07,811
Well,

235
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,240
When you want to make up

236
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,249
with a friend, what do you do?

237
00:13:13,178 --> 00:13:15,107
Did you fight with a friend?

238
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,529
No, it's not that.

239
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,552
They keep avoiding me.

240
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:23,631
Even when I ask, they don't answer me.

241
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:25,200
It's frustrating.

242
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:27,631
If it's something that needs to be said,

243
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,619
they would have spoken about it.

244
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:32,294
But if you keep asking just

245
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:33,569
because you're frustrated,

246
00:13:33,623 --> 00:13:36,053
they might not like it.

247
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,857
There must be a reason

248
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,342
they're not saying anything.

249
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:43,186
How about waiting for them?

250
00:13:45,163 --> 00:13:46,163
Yes.

251
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,521
Is that friend the one

252
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:58,225
you said you liked before?

253
00:13:59,219 --> 00:14:01,365
No, it's not.

254
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:03,436
It's someone else.

255
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:07,084
Oh, I see.

256
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,756
I'm jealous of that friend.

257
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:14,803
Huh?

258
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:17,161
Because Woohyun cares

259
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:18,689
about them so much.

260
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,623
Park Doha, where are you going?

261
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:36,053
Hey, well...

262
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:41,225
Can you not go to the teacher's office?

263
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:44,740
What do you mean?

264
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:47,908
If no one calls you or

265
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,306
there is no business there,

266
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:51,639
can't you just stay with me?

267
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,787
Or go with me instead?

268
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,764
Are you

269
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,771
jealous by any chance?

270
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,529
What? Are you serious?

271
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,599
Don't come.

272
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Park Doha.

273
00:15:12,998 --> 00:15:14,350
Don't tell me,

274
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:15,935
was the reason you were

275
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:16,927
in a bad mood yesterday,

276
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,428
was because of the teacher?

277
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,350
Well...

278
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,372
What? Is it so funny?

279
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,193
That's all it was?

280
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,795
Why are you getting closer?

281
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:35,008
I'm relieved.

282
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,678
Huh?

283
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,748
I thought it was something serious.

284
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,409
Since it's nothing major,

285
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:42,697
that's a relief.

286
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:45,472
Nothing major?

287
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,873
Was I too sulky?

288
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,975
Still, it's really annoying.

289
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,053
Hey, Doha.

290
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:19,873
I have something to say.

291
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,100
With me?

292
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:25,472
Doha,

293
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,435
are you seeing someone?

294
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,623
Well, you see...

295
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:38,490
I...

296
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,654
Like you.

297
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:49,349
Sorry, I already like someone else.

298
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:53,850
I see.

299
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,811
I'll be going, then.

300
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,404
Was I just as nervous?

301
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,592
Oh, Park Doha!

302
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,974
I don't know why, but I

303
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,639
just felt like going that way.

304
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:23,966
I didn't expect to see him

305
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:25,373
getting confessed to there.

306
00:17:25,404 --> 00:17:28,298
That girl confessed so amazingly,

307
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,323
And Park Doha just went,

308
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,779
"Sorry, I already like someone."

309
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,334
Enough already.

310
00:17:34,638 --> 00:17:35,951
So, Park Doha,

311
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,023
who is it that you like?

312
00:17:39,093 --> 00:17:40,436
Park Doha.

313
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:42,397
Huh?

314
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,981
Let's talk after school.

315
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:50,717
I'm sorry.

316
00:17:51,435 --> 00:17:52,857
I really messed up.

317
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:57,162
I shouldn't have done that.

318
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:59,459
Now do you understand my feelings?

319
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:00,678
Mm.

320
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,646
So...

321
00:18:05,662 --> 00:18:07,232
Can I not eat it?

322
00:18:08,436 --> 00:18:10,029
You don't seem all that sorry.

323
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:11,740
No, I really am.

324
00:18:13,014 --> 00:18:14,654
If you're really sorry, eat another one.

325
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:18,537
I can't handle spicy food.

326
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:19,693
That's exactly why

327
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,123
I'm telling you to eat it.

328
00:18:31,137 --> 00:18:32,842
This reduces my stress.

329
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,637
I'm getting more stressed.

330
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:47,936
- Park Doha.
- What?

331
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:49,576
If nothing special comes up,

332
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:50,654
I won't go to the

333
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,983
teacher's office anymore.

334
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,335
I wasn't thinking properly.

335
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,459
I'm sorry.

336
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:01,410
And I'm also sorry

337
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,152
for saying it was nothing.

338
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,199
I don't think that your liking me

339
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:06,264
is worthless.

340
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:09,670
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:14,396
If you do it again, you have to

342
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:15,788
eat it three times spicier.

343
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:17,107
I won't do it again.

344
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,006
But...

345
00:19:26,021 --> 00:19:28,139
About dating me,

346
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,842
you don't regret it, right?

347
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:31,749
Huh?

348
00:19:32,295 --> 00:19:33,959
I mean, since you got confessed

349
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:35,407
to today and all…

350
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:38,021
- Just wondering.
- Eat it three times spicier now.

351
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,037
No, I was just...

352
00:19:40,342 --> 00:19:42,357
I'm afraid that you might regret it.

353
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:46,153
Why?

354
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:47,920
What if I say I regret it,

355
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:50,583
would we break up?

356
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:55,130
No.

357
00:19:56,982 --> 00:19:58,896
It's too late for regrets.

358
00:19:59,105 --> 00:20:00,552
Resetting things in the middle

359
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,600
is cheating.

360
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,193
I won't regret it.

361
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,513
Do you know how nervous I was,

362
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:12,794
worried that you might

363
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:14,036
say you regret it?

364
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:16,076
I won't.

365
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,311
You really can't regret this.

366
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:20,061
I said I won't.

367
00:20:20,092 --> 00:20:21,142
Promise me.

368
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,260
Geez...

369
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,342
I suddenly regret this.

370
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:25,795
Park Doha!

371
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,756
- Go inside.
- Mm.

372
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:37,077
You too.

373
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:42,154
Woohyun, I have something to say.

374
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,451
Come closer.

375
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,209
What is it?

376
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,752
Hey!

377
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,561
Hey, take care, Yoon Woohyun.

378
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,693
(Woohyun, I would like to upload
the photos today...)

379
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,873
Oh, you answered right away.

380
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:18,476
I just finished taking a shower

381
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,759
and you called me.

382
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,998
Really? Mm...

383
00:21:22,194 --> 00:21:23,194
Woohyun.

384
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,178
I have a favor to ask.

385
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:27,318
A favor?

386
00:21:27,459 --> 00:21:28,888
Can I upload those pictures

387
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:29,937
on Instagram?

388
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:32,967
What pictures?

389
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:38,725
I just sent it to you. Look.

390
00:21:46,623 --> 00:21:48,654
What is this?

391
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:51,357
I cropped you out a bit.

392
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:53,397
Why did you crop me out?

393
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,803
Just upload it as it is.

394
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,286
No.

395
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,224
I was worried someone might notice.

396
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,693
You want to hide it?

397
00:22:04,163 --> 00:22:05,514
Half and half.

398
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:07,154
I want to hide it,

399
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:08,686
but I also want to let people know.

400
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,607
Actually, I'm a bit worried

401
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:16,748
about what people will think.

402
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,395
One of my brother's friends is gay,

403
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,975
my brother beat up those guys

404
00:22:23,991 --> 00:22:25,926
who were criticizing his friend.

405
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,177
I'll beat them, too. Don't worry.

406
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:29,427
What's with you?

407
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:32,880
But if I get taken in,

408
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:34,629
you have to come visit me.

409
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:39,386
Haa... This is why I like you.

410
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,670
Huh?

411
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,482
Never mind. I'll upload it, so check it.

412
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,826
I'm hanging up.

413
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:47,638
Okay.

414
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:54,123
(Happy to eat together)

415
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:57,316
(Happy to eat together)

416
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:58,872
What? Park Doha met the girl

417
00:22:58,896 --> 00:23:00,075
who confessed to you?

418
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:04,802
(junseo_k sent a request to follow you)

419
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:08,522
Kwon Junseo?

420
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:15,209
(Next Episode)
Are you a heartbreaker?

421
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:16,677
Did you see this card?

422
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:18,567
Your cards say you'll have two

423
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:20,746
romantic interests at the same time,

424
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:22,371
and you'll be super confused.

425
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:24,856
What nonsense is that, Lee Sori?

426
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:26,802
No.

427
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:28,887
Hwatu

428
00:23:29,386 --> 00:23:30,888
never lies.

429
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,255
Hey, why are you avoiding me?

430
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:35,708
Don't be like that.

431
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,380
It's all in the past, anyway.

432
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:41,295
- What's going on?
- Woohyun.

433
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:43,334
Hello. Are you his boyfriend?

434
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:45,662
No need to say hello. Scram.

435
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,216
What's your relationship with him?

436
00:23:47,524 --> 00:23:49,130
A super strong relationship.

437
00:23:49,338 --> 00:23:50,826
Not bad, Park Doha.

438
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:53,552
Where are you going, Teacher?

439
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,388
I'm at the age to get married.

440
00:23:56,107 --> 00:23:57,373
Getting married?

441
00:23:58,349 --> 00:23:59,708
Maybe I'm sentimental because it's fall?

442
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,396
- Teacher.
- Yes?

443
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:04,060
I said I liked someone before, right?

444
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:05,606
Mm.

445
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,474
That person is you.

446
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,966
"Heart Stain"
