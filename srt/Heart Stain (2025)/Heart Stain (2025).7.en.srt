"Heart Stain"
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:17,386 --> 00:00:21,129
(Kim Ji Oh as Yoon Woohyun)

3
00:00:27,959 --> 00:00:30,886
(Hamin as Park Doha)

4
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,850
(Kang Yeon Jae as Nam Jeongmin)

5
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,785
(Shin Siye as Lee Sori
Yoo Hosoo as Park Taemin)

6
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,310
(Kim Leegon as Kwon Junsu)

7
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,208
I'm going to study abroad.

8
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:05,724
- Lee Sungjin.
- Yes.

9
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,349
- Lee Sori.
- Yes.

10
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,856
- Jeon Jaehee.
- Yes.

11
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:10,950
- Jung Jaewon.
- Yes.

12
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:19,091
Yoon Woohyun.

13
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:20,596
Why are you late on

14
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:21,755
the closing ceremony?

15
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:22,802
Yes.

16
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,395
Come here.

17
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,474
Are you sick?

18
00:02:30,263 --> 00:02:31,622
You have a fever.

19
00:02:32,912 --> 00:02:34,481
I got caught in the rain.

20
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,786
The ceremony is almost over.

21
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:39,169
Go rest in the infirmary.

22
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,310
Okay.

23
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,279
Today is the closing ceremony,

24
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:45,553
so it might end early,

25
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,379
but there are still friends who

26
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:48,512
have to clear up their pending work.

27
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:49,980
Don't bother your friends.

28
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:52,477
I understand that you're excited

29
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,083
about legally becoming an adult,

30
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,919
but don't do anything dangerous.

31
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:58,950
(Infirmary)

32
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:38,583
Do you…

33
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,247
really have to go?

34
00:03:45,617 --> 00:03:46,617
Yeah.

35
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,942
Can't you just go for a year

36
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:52,700
and return?

37
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:12,209
And so our final semester break begins.

38
00:05:35,944 --> 00:05:37,983
How pathetic.

39
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:49,014
Yoon Woohyun, what are you doing?

40
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,851
What?

41
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,608
Did you break up with Park Doha?

42
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,342
Yes, he's going to study abroad.

43
00:05:57,134 --> 00:05:58,225
Where to?

44
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:59,842
Germany.

45
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,193
Whoa.

46
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,701
Are you okay?

47
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:09,389
What do you mean by okay?

48
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,311
Well, you're probably not okay.

49
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,717
And what's not okay?

50
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:19,725
What?

51
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:21,897
I'm not sure either

52
00:06:22,185 --> 00:06:23,920
whether I'm okay or not.

53
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,693
I don't even know if I like Doha or not.

54
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:33,754
Feels like my brain has turned to stone.

55
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,006
I can't think straight.

56
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,514
You're just feeling really sad.

57
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:38,076
And what can you even do?

58
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,343
He's leaving no matter what.

59
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:40,698
I didn't even get to

60
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:42,193
properly confess to Suyoung.

61
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,311
But in the end,

62
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:44,912
time fixes everything.

63
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:47,584
You'll be okay eventually.

64
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:51,998
Wanna grab some tteokbokki? My treat.

65
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,849
No, it's fine. You don't have to

66
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,150
worry about me.

67
00:06:58,155 --> 00:06:59,155
See you.

68
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,381
Bye!

69
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,733
I don't know when it started…

70
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,213
But I have started to

71
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:22,346
fall in love with you.

72
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,529
I miss you so much,

73
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,576
Doha.

74
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:44,858
I couldn't even say a single damn word.

75
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,717
I'm the one who lost the bet.

76
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,037
Park Doha.

77
00:08:12,147 --> 00:08:13,975
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable…

78
00:09:06,494 --> 00:09:07,642
Haa...

79
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,009
I'm jealous of Yoon Woohyun.

80
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,086
You already got into college

81
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:11,915
through early admission.

82
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,537
When will results come out for you?

83
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:15,179
Me? Next week.

84
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:17,548
Haa...

85
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:19,168
What if I have to retake the exam?

86
00:09:21,577 --> 00:09:22,671
But Sori,

87
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,977
no matter what, I'll make sure

88
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,030
to go to your school.

89
00:09:25,054 --> 00:09:26,952
I'm getting goose bump.

90
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:29,288
Do you need to apply there just for me?

91
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,036
Haa...

92
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,023
With Doha leaving,

93
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,179
it's just the three of us now.

94
00:09:34,203 --> 00:09:35,327
It's gonna be boring.

95
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,585
Right?

96
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,060
And why did Park Doha

97
00:09:39,085 --> 00:09:40,539
wait so long to tell us?

98
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,111
If we knew earlier, we could've gone

99
00:09:42,136 --> 00:09:43,669
on a graduation trip together.

100
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,241
He probably had a lot on his mind.

101
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:50,226
- You okay?
- Huh?

102
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:52,460
Of course, I'm okay.

103
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,815
He's busy dreaming about
moving to Seoul.

104
00:09:55,842 --> 00:09:57,280
That's all he thinks about now.

105
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:58,350
Not really.

106
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,093
Have you ever been hurt by heartbreak?

107
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,210
You could teach me.

108
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:06,576
By the way, are you really against

109
00:10:06,601 --> 00:10:08,036
dating someone from the same college?

110
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:09,201
I'm starting to get really

111
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:10,906
annoyed because of you.

112
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,452
Should I just date Park Taemin for

113
00:10:12,492 --> 00:10:13,538
a month and get it over with?

114
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:15,065
Sure, I'm certain I'm up for it.

115
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,726
Hey, get away from me.

116
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:22,843
After this winter…

117
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,257
What will happen to us?

118
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:35,984
Sorry.

119
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:37,500
It's fine.

120
00:10:38,195 --> 00:10:39,421
I didn't see you either.

121
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:44,367
Doha.

122
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:48,617
I called you yesterday,

123
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,367
why didn't you pick up?

124
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,976
Oh.

125
00:10:54,342 --> 00:10:55,962
I was watching a movie with my parents,

126
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:57,126
so I didn't see the call.

127
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,523
I saw the missed call later,

128
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,632
but it was too late to call back.

129
00:11:04,662 --> 00:11:05,789
By the way,

130
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,328
can you let go now?

131
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:09,275
Huh?

132
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:13,296
Ah, sorry.

133
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,554
Sorry.

134
00:11:30,765 --> 00:11:32,757
Is this something that needs
to be thought about?

135
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:34,827
It means that they pass
the entrance exam.

136
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:36,670
I might not be able to graduate.

137
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,025
I told you this guy doesn't know

138
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,132
what he's talking about.

139
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,506
I won't mind.

140
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:49,875
Yoon Woohyun, did you and

141
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,260
Park Doha fight?

142
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:53,889
Seriously, what's going on?

143
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,593
You two seem off, you know?

144
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:57,351
You're so dense.

145
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,352
I...

146
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,218
broke up with Doha.

147
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,421
Huh?

148
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:08,070
Taemin, use your brain a little.

149
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,148
So you two were actually dating?

150
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:14,577
Hey, go back to your seat.

151
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:15,602
Wait.

152
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,829
Everyone, sit down.

153
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:32,859
Did you enjoy your last vacation?

154
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:34,211
- Yes.
- Yes.

155
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,165
It's finally time to send you off.

156
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,189
- No, sir.
- Don't let go of us.

157
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,524
I'll hand out the diplomas.

158
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,056
- Yes.
- Yes.

159
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:47,165
- Park Taemin.
- Yes.

160
00:12:53,548 --> 00:12:55,001
- Lee Sori.
- Yes.

161
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,103
Yoon Woohyun.

162
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,751
Thank you.

163
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:23,399
Lee Sungjin.

164
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:24,634
Yes.

165
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:31,837
Han Maru.

166
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:35,408
Kim Minjae.

167
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,024
Yoo Bomin.

168
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:43,001
It's so cold.

169
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,720
How beautiful.

170
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:47,681
We already actually graduated?

171
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,012
The field suddenly looks smaller.

172
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:52,751
You sound like an old man.

173
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,875
Like a mature, reliable boyfriend, yes?

174
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,899
- Nonsense.
- Congratulations.

175
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:59,235
Anyway, Doha already left?

176
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,316
Yeah, he said he's having
a meal with his family.

177
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:02,860
I saw him in the classroom.

178
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:05,782
- I see.
- I'll go to the classroom for a bit.

179
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,650
What's with him?

180
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,517
Doha!

181
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:13,774
It's you.

182
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:19,064
You're here to see Park Doha?

183
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,321
He just left.

184
00:14:23,867 --> 00:14:25,032
How do you know that?

185
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,579
Because I confessed to him.

186
00:14:27,814 --> 00:14:28,939
What?

187
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:31,843
Calm down.

188
00:14:31,994 --> 00:14:33,220
I got rejected.

189
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:36,134
You got rejected?

190
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,095
He said he's going to study abroad.

191
00:14:41,236 --> 00:14:42,314
Still, at least,

192
00:14:42,877 --> 00:14:44,470
I admitted that all the times

193
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:45,978
I messed with him,

194
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:48,812
All the times I teased him.

195
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:50,026
It was because I liked him.

196
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,345
I was able to say the last goodbye.

197
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:01,680
Weirdly enough, it felt good to
finally say it out loud.

198
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,892
Congrats on graduating, Yoon Woohyun.

199
00:15:25,653 --> 00:15:28,446
(Woohyun special person)

200
00:15:33,123 --> 00:15:37,837
(Woohyun special person)

201
00:16:38,513 --> 00:16:41,156
(Woohyun special person)

202
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:56,961
What about you? Are you staring at

203
00:16:56,988 --> 00:16:58,721
my face because I'm cool?

204
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,459
- Wear it.
- It's fine.

205
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:05,601
Wear it or you'll catch a cold.

206
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:14,882
Let's date

207
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,711
until graduation.

208
00:17:31,915 --> 00:17:35,343
(Woohyun, you've been doing well.
Be confident. Do your best!)

209
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:40,742
Umm... That is...

210
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:48,109
I miss you.

211
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,195
Teacher.

212
00:18:55,293 --> 00:18:56,687
Oh, Yoon Woohyun.

213
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,273
What's wrong?

214
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,328
Did something happen?

215
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,109
Actually, I had something

216
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:09,726
I wanted to tell you after graduation.

217
00:19:12,891 --> 00:19:14,414
But now I can't remember

218
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,312
what it was.

219
00:19:26,992 --> 00:19:28,218
Teacher,

220
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,179
I have a problem.

221
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:34,320
What is it?

222
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,671
There's someone I like.

223
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,086
Yoon Woohyun.

224
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,156
But they're leaving.

225
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,490
I still have so many things

226
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:50,795
I haven't said.

227
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:55,945
I want to ask them to stay.

228
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:58,485
But all I've ever done

229
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:00,099
is make them suffer.

230
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:01,507
I can't hold them back.

231
00:20:02,129 --> 00:20:03,836
But I can't let them go either.

232
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:09,836
What should I do?

233
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:18,937
You have to choose.

234
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,828
Either forget them

235
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:26,554
or

236
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:28,781
wait for them.

237
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,148
Everything happens in its own time.

238
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:41,902
Just like you forgot what

239
00:20:41,927 --> 00:20:43,607
you wanted to say to me,

240
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:46,082
maybe one day, you'll get

241
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:47,549
the chance to say all the things

242
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:49,531
you couldn't say to them now.

243
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,359
Congratulations on graduating.

244
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:09,484
Good luck.

245
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,601
I...

246
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,031
Think I should let them go.

247
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:30,171
But really… I just lost them.

248
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,171
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

249
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:38,304
Long time no see, you look different.

250
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,929
- Me?
- That's right.

251
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:42,375
- Or is it because Park Doha isn't here?
- Hey.

252
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,125
What?

253
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,796
You still can't forget Park Doha, right?

254
00:21:46,274 --> 00:21:48,086
How can I forget Doha?

255
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,171
How did you get here?

256
00:21:58,492 --> 00:21:59,671
I missed you,

257
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:01,312
Doha.

258
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:09,905
I thought we're like other couples who have
broken up and will eventually forget each other.

259
00:22:10,109 --> 00:22:11,703
I found out too late.

260
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,898
Doha, I'm sorry.

261
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:16,671
Me too.

262
00:22:17,484 --> 00:22:19,195
I also regret a lot of things.

263
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,304
I like you, Doha.

264
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:27,546
Me too.
