(Goheung-gon)

8
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,231
Yes, Mom.

9
00:01:26,318 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm leaving now.

10
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,817
Of course. Don't worry.

11
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:35,450
I'll tell Auntie that you missed her.

12
00:01:37,293 --> 00:01:38,481
Yes.

13
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,075
I'll call you again when

14
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,386
I arrive in Incheon.

15
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:46,334
Okay.

16
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:00,569
There's no way he'd come,

17
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:01,710
idiot…

18
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,576
Has Doha…

19
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:24,997
already left?

20
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:29,897
(4 years later)

21
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:31,734
- Hey, Yoon Woohyun.
- Hey!

22
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,726
Whoa, you actually came, Yoon Woohyun.

23
00:02:34,558 --> 00:02:36,026
It's been a while.

24
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:37,993
What have you and your brother

25
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,146
been up to? You're so busy

26
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:40,467
I almost forgot your face.

27
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:41,521
Do you even know what

28
00:02:41,548 --> 00:02:42,593
a Hongdae student's life is like?

29
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:44,291
No, what she means is,

30
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,648
why haven't you kept in touch?

31
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,898
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

32
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:57,507
You've changed a lot.

33
00:02:57,538 --> 00:02:58,687
Me?

34
00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:00,882
Your whole vibe feels different.

35
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,577
Really?

36
00:03:02,984 --> 00:03:05,343
Yeah. Or it's because Doha's not around?

37
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,882
Hey!

38
00:03:07,007 --> 00:03:08,051
What? You still haven't

39
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:09,324
gotten over Park Doha?

40
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,694
How could I ever forget Doha?

41
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,984
You should meet someone new!

42
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,523
You didn't date any new at all?

43
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,163
No one.

44
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,577
He is more earnest than I thought.

45
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,796
What?

46
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:39,235
He should've treated her better

47
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,488
when he had the chance!

48
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:42,765
Yeah.

49
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:45,488
I should've treated him better.

50
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:48,264
I kept thinking about the bad things

51
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,409
I did to him.

52
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,038
Have you tried reaching out?

53
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,796
How dare I?

54
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,686
Besides,

55
00:03:58,234 --> 00:03:59,334
I don't want to disrupt

56
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:00,380
his life if he's happy.

57
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:05,968
Hey. Actually...

58
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:09,194
I'm in touch with Doha.

59
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,327
He asked if you were doing well.

60
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,983
Just my gut feeling, but…

61
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:18,616
I think he still has feelings for you.

62
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:20,163
Really?

63
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:21,617
How would you know?

64
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,663
I know these things.

65
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:25,874
He's coming back next week.

66
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:29,600
Aren't you going to see him?

67
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:31,944
Me?

68
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:36,116
That's right. Doha must be missing you.

69
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,557
Do I even deserve to?

70
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,905
If you don't, then who does?

71
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:46,157
Yes. He asks about how you're doing

72
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:47,319
every time we talk.

73
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:49,568
Doha does?

74
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,210
See? You care so much.

75
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:53,421
Don't regret it later. Just go to him.

76
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:58,257
Why are you here?

77
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:00,452
I missed you,

78
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:02,311
Doha.

79
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:16,553
Were you waiting for me?

80
00:06:18,232 --> 00:06:19,387
Yeah.

81
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,725
How did you even know

82
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,039
I was coming today?

83
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,007
Taemin told me.

84
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,647
He, Sori, and I met up a few days ago.

85
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:30,577
Ah…

86
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,397
You say you waited for me,

87
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:39,270
but you can't even look me in the eyes.

88
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:43,600
Woohyun.

89
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,327
If I look at you,

90
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:55,975
I feel like I'll just start crying.

91
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,530
I must look so pathetic.

92
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:12,866
I've never seen you like this before.

93
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,569
Have you been well?

94
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:27,968
After you left…

95
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:31,452
I regretted a lot of things.

96
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,483
I thought that,

97
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:38,905
like any other couple

98
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:40,637
that breaks up,

99
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:42,164
I'd slowly move on.

100
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:44,546
But…

101
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,436
I kept thinking

102
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,186
about my feelings for you,

103
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:02,561
the times we spent together,

104
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:04,577
or the little, ordinary moments.

105
00:08:07,773 --> 00:08:09,382
I just realized it too late,

106
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:11,569
Doha.

107
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:15,788
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:31,577
I feel the same.

109
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:38,054
I also regret a lot of things.

110
00:08:39,445 --> 00:08:40,876
I thought putting distance between

111
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:42,009
us would make it easier.

112
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,195
But it didn't.

113
00:08:52,258 --> 00:08:53,499
I missed you

114
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:55,780
so much, Woohyun.

115
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:05,804
- This is all your fault.
- Huh?

116
00:09:06,468 --> 00:09:07,882
I told myself I wouldn't come back.

117
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,163
But in the end, here I am.

118
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,273
How long are you staying in Korea?

119
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:22,749
About three weeks.

120
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:28,351
Then there's somewhere I want to go.

121
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:32,148
Will you come with me?

122
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,054
There's something I want to ask you.

123
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:54,453
Huh?

124
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,046
No.

125
00:09:58,617 --> 00:09:59,617
Never mind.

126
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,780
What is it?

127
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:05,382
Do you have a boyfriend?

128
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:07,546
Huh?

129
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,624
Or

130
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,718
do you have a girlfriend?

131
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,359
You idiot, no.

132
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:19,390
You don't?

133
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,625
What about you?

134
00:10:22,726 --> 00:10:24,093
Of course not.

135
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,187
I see.

136
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:28,983
But shouldn't you have asked

137
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,877
that before holding my hand?

138
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:41,405
- Doha.
- Huh?

139
00:10:42,812 --> 00:10:44,335
How about a bet?

140
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,359
Huh?

141
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,155
Date me.

142
00:10:53,515 --> 00:10:55,351
Just until you leave again.

143
00:10:58,343 --> 00:10:59,577
What?

144
00:11:00,195 --> 00:11:01,679
Before that day,

145
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:03,984
if you like me,

146
00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:05,585
it means I win.

147
00:11:06,505 --> 00:11:09,468
If not, it means you win.

148
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:22,492
What?

149
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,366
You're being serious?

150
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:26,890
Yeah.

151
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,451
Suddenly making a bet like this...

152
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:33,109
Need time to think?

153
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,960
I can't give you much.

154
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:44,195
You already won.

155
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:48,765
Both before, now and in the future,

156
00:11:49,765 --> 00:11:51,304
I've always liked you.

157
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:57,163
Then let's settle an old bet, too.

158
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,624
What bet?

159
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:03,424
Remember? If I fell for you,

160
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,111
you'd win.

161
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:06,932
Mm.

162
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,385
You won,

163
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:11,783
so make a wish.

164
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,478
I don't know.

165
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:16,924
What do you want?

166
00:12:17,484 --> 00:12:18,718
Hey.

167
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,853
How can I win?

168
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:23,666
Why?

169
00:12:23,721 --> 00:12:26,682
Before I left, you were winning.

170
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,658
Now, you've won.

171
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:32,752
I'll grant your wish.

172
00:12:33,424 --> 00:12:34,682
So tell me.

173
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,627
Don't leave me.

174
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:44,408
That's my wish.

175
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:47,357
I know going to study abroad is

176
00:12:47,382 --> 00:12:48,894
related to your future.

177
00:12:49,627 --> 00:12:50,986
And even if we're far apart,

178
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,103
but our hearts are still here.

179
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,111
I never want to

180
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,533
lose you again.

181
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,580
It's the same as before.

182
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:16,400
Why would it change?

183
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:18,049
Is your family out?

184
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:20,041
They went on a trip.

185
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:25,103
I like you,

186
00:13:25,584 --> 00:13:26,846
Doha.

187
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,291
Me too.

188
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,471
My arm hurts.

189
00:14:33,737 --> 00:14:34,893
Wait,

190
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:36,393
you weren't sleeping?

191
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,689
You were sleeping so peacefully.

192
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:43,033
What?

193
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:52,011
Walking like this, feels like

194
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:53,630
we're high schoolers again.

195
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,971
- Right?
- Yeah.

196
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:57,889
Both then and now,

197
00:14:57,914 --> 00:14:59,509
I still feel the same way.

198
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,236
Maybe I am still a high schooler.

199
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,525
What are you even saying?

200
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,682
Is that Yoon Woohyun and pretty Doha?

201
00:15:07,995 --> 00:15:09,119
Lee Sori.

202
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:11,213
Park Taemin, you too?

203
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,197
Why? Surprised?

204
00:15:16,377 --> 00:15:18,611
Doha, how have you been?

205
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:21,721
Oh, you know, just living.

206
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:24,260
You two have been together a while now.

207
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,377
What? You guys are dating?

208
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,158
You didn't know, Yoon Woohyun?

209
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,844
Hey! Lee Sori! I told you.

210
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,658
Park Taemin was off-limits!

211
00:15:33,987 --> 00:15:35,846
Since when?

212
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,049
What the hell? It's been over a year!

213
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:41,212
When you come back home,

214
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,952
you just stay cooped up in the house.

215
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,176
You didn't contact us at all.

216
00:15:44,196 --> 00:15:45,656
How would you know?

217
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,779
How did you know?

218
00:15:48,804 --> 00:15:50,217
You should keep in touch

219
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,723
with friends, Woohyun.

220
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:55,827
So have you two made up now?

221
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:58,764
You guys are unbelievable.

222
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:01,806
No, Yoon Woohyun, you're just clueless.

223
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,436
Dammit.

224
00:16:04,912 --> 00:16:05,918
Right, are you guys going

225
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:07,450
to Mr. Jeongmin's wedding?

226
00:16:08,436 --> 00:16:09,517
Wedding?

227
00:16:09,542 --> 00:16:10,975
Our homeroom teacher from senior year.

228
00:16:10,982 --> 00:16:11,706
Nam Jeongmin.

229
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,222
He sent a message in the group saying

230
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:14,777
that he was getting married in 2 weeks.

231
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:16,549
Oh. Right.

232
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:19,698
I didn't know.

233
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,143
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,730
No.

235
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,628
Geez, Yoon Woohyun,

236
00:16:24,843 --> 00:16:26,518
are you still hung up on the past?

237
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:27,854
No, I'm not.

238
00:16:28,511 --> 00:16:30,706
- You're still hung up.
- That's not it.

239
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,179
- Dang.
- I knew it.

240
00:16:33,204 --> 00:16:34,268
It's certain.

241
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:43,915
Who are you texting?

242
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,322
Why are you laughing that much?

243
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:46,995
Huh?

244
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:48,159
A friend.

245
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:49,784
What friend?

246
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,940
A friend from university in Germany.

247
00:16:53,323 --> 00:16:54,448
Right.

248
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,745
- I'm going to Seoul tomorrow.
- What?

249
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:58,589
Did I not mention it?

250
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,361
My friend's visiting Korea,

251
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,747
so I'm meeting them.

252
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,878
Oh…

253
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:06,221
Mm.

254
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:16,979
Are you going to the wedding?

255
00:17:17,761 --> 00:17:20,042
No! Absolutely not!

256
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,307
You can go, you know.

257
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:26,948
What?

258
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:31,120
I said you can go. Don't worry about me.

259
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:35,034
Is that so?

260
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,018
Aren't you going to shower?

261
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,308
No.

262
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,604
Then I'll go first.

263
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:57,245
No matter what…

264
00:17:57,745 --> 00:17:59,815
Did he maybe forget who I used to like?

265
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,370
Or is he mad?

266
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:17,822
You startled me!

267
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,345
Surprised, weren't you?

268
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,469
But why are you sitting

269
00:18:20,494 --> 00:18:22,174
here alone without Doha?

270
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:24,417
Doha went to Seoul to see a friend.

271
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:27,307
So that's why you look so miserable?

272
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:33,690
I don't think Doha likes me anymore.

273
00:18:35,297 --> 00:18:37,065
What kind of nonsense is that?

274
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:38,471
Did you guys fight?

275
00:18:38,496 --> 00:18:40,496
No, it's not that.

276
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,472
It's like he's starting to

277
00:18:42,486 --> 00:18:44,353
feel indifferent towards me.

278
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,283
I've been anxious all day

279
00:18:46,304 --> 00:18:48,013
about him meeting his friend,

280
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:50,729
But Doha wasn't like that at all.

281
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,890
That's surprising. I thought Doha

282
00:18:52,904 --> 00:18:54,337
would be the one to worry more.

283
00:18:57,281 --> 00:18:59,846
I have no idea what he's thinking.

284
00:19:01,566 --> 00:19:02,932
I think it's because you don't

285
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,633
express yourself much.

286
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:06,581
- Expressing?
- Yeah.

287
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,034
How often do you tell Doha you like him?

288
00:19:09,464 --> 00:19:10,729
How about saying ‘I love you'?

289
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,065
Do I have to say those words?

290
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:16,131
Because you didn't express it,

291
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,817
Doha became distant from you.

292
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,861
The closer you are to someone,

293
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:21,468
the more you should express it.

294
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:23,412
Right, Taemin?

295
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,315
Whatever Sori says is right.

296
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:27,429
Hey, Yoon Woohyun,

297
00:19:27,437 --> 00:19:29,203
if you just stay calm like this

298
00:19:29,422 --> 00:19:30,992
he's really gonna leave you.

299
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:41,405
You even came to pick me up.

300
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:42,412
What's this?

301
00:19:43,036 --> 00:19:44,568
Of course, I did!

302
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,747
Thanks.

303
00:19:49,178 --> 00:19:50,599
How was Seoul?

304
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:54,302
Noisy and overwhelming as always.

305
00:19:55,974 --> 00:19:59,079
Did you have fun with your friend?

306
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,521
It was okay.

307
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:04,911
Doha,

308
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:08,075
- what are you doing tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

309
00:20:08,896 --> 00:20:10,005
Let's go on a date.

310
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,090
A date?

311
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:13,690
(Please select the desired images)

312
00:21:23,631 --> 00:21:26,084
Remember when we were in grade 12?

313
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:29,061
Oh, right.

314
00:21:30,085 --> 00:21:31,686
You were pretty popular back then.

315
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:34,654
So were you.

316
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:36,897
I wouldn't know,

317
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:38,030
I only had eyes for you.

318
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,755
You're just saying that.

319
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,342
You know…

320
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:49,920
If we get to come here again,

321
00:21:50,194 --> 00:21:51,943
I have something I want to tell you.

322
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:54,475
What is it?

323
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,129
I want to know if

324
00:21:59,154 --> 00:22:00,194
you're bored of me yet.

325
00:22:01,178 --> 00:22:03,045
What? Me?

326
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:05,666
You even told me to go to

327
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,726
teacher's wedding.

328
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:13,107
Seriously.

329
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:15,670
You're unbelievable.

330
00:22:15,866 --> 00:22:17,795
How could I ever get tired of you?

331
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:20,397
I was just teasing.

332
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,272
I wanted to see you get jealous.

333
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:23,631
Hey!

334
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,149
So that's why my boyfriend

335
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:29,483
dressed up so nicely

336
00:22:29,897 --> 00:22:31,373
and asked me out today?

337
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,889
It's not just because of that.

338
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:42,022
I like you.

339
00:22:45,944 --> 00:22:48,529
Woohyun, I really, really like you.

340
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:53,451
I was hoping that you wouldn't go to his wedding.

341
00:22:55,014 --> 00:22:56,342
I want you to

342
00:22:57,356 --> 00:22:58,451
stay with me. Forever.

343
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:03,623
Hey, you!

344
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,545
What? You don't want to?

345
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:09,373
It's not that.

346
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,357
I'm irritated now.

347
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:14,639
Irritated?

348
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,838
I was going to say it first.

349
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,581
Is this…

350
00:23:30,316 --> 00:23:31,542
Couple rings.

351
00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:34,760
We're going to be apart again soon.

352
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,260
How am I supposed to let you go?

353
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,393
So I need to lock you down with this.

354
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:47,112
You'll wear it, right?

355
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:03,065
You're really going all out, huh?

356
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,282
I'll make something delicious.

357
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:06,587
Just sit down.

358
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,096
- Try it.
- Mm.

359
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:25,565
How is it?

360
00:24:25,917 --> 00:24:27,284
Mm...

361
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,362
It's fine.

362
00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:32,190
Edible.

363
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:34,221
Just edible?

364
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,878
No.

365
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:40,862
It's amazing.

366
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:42,417
Like!

367
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:45,988
Hurry up and eat.

368
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:47,325
Okay.

369
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,099
(Goheung-gon)

370
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:01,433
Are you upset that I'm leaving?

371
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:03,572
No.

372
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:04,941
Just worried.

373
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:06,488
About what?

374
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:09,945
I keep thinking if I miss my Doha,

375
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,152
I'll have to go to Germany.

376
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,091
And if that's the case,

377
00:25:14,105 --> 00:25:15,498
I should just go with you now.

378
00:25:16,053 --> 00:25:18,044
Ugh, that's so cheesy.

379
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:21,191
But truthfully...

380
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:22,374
Haa...

381
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,288
How am I supposed to let you go again?

382
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,222
I'll visit at least once a year.

383
00:25:29,222 --> 00:25:30,659
I'll go to Germany too.

384
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:32,469
And when I do,

385
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,149
you better give me the best tour.

386
00:25:34,676 --> 00:25:35,972
Of course.

387
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:41,495
- Hey!
- What? It's just for a second.

388
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:48,490
Have a safe trip.

389
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:50,966
Mm.

390
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:52,818
I'll be right back.

391
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,700
Now, even waiting feels exciting.

392
00:25:58,764 --> 00:26:00,661
I love you, Doha.
