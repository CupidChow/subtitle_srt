1
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,254
Today's class ends here. Everyone,

2
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,894
Our last summer break is ending.

3
00:00:27,544 --> 00:00:29,200
Everyone!

4
00:00:30,474 --> 00:00:31,700
Gather up!

5
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,312
Woohyun, the volunteer work is over.

6
00:00:56,386 --> 00:00:57,776
So why haven't you left?

7
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:00,691
I just wanted to watch

8
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:01,941
the sea a little longer.

9
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,684
What about you, teacher?

10
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,032
Me too.

11
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:13,574
I also wanted to look at the sea

12
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:14,628
before returning.

13
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:17,902
Also...

14
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,387
I get to talk to you a bit more.

15
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:31,309
- Teacher.
- Hmm?

16
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,746
There's something troubling me.

17
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:39,309
What is it?

18
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:43,301
There's someone I like,

19
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:50,512
but he's a guy.

20
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:54,902
I just came out to my teacher.

21
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:01,113
"Heart Stain"
(Episode 1)

22
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:15,293
(Kim Ji Oh as Yoon Woohyun)

23
00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:28,426
(Hamin as Park Doha)

24
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:40,342
(Kang Yeon Jae as Nam Jeongmin)

25
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,924
(Shin Siye as Lee Sori
Yoo Hosoo as Park Taemin)

26
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:49,556
(Kim Leegon as Kwon Junsu)

27
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,647
Next, the molecular formulas

28
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:14,765
of three molecules are

29
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:17,616
H2O, CH4, BF3.

30
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,762
Comparing the bonding and

31
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:21,684
size of these molecules...

32
00:03:24,092 --> 00:03:25,685
Help me wake Taemin up.

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,935
(Teacher: Nam Jeongmin)

34
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:29,584
If it's correct, so now

35
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,975
we should draw it, right?

36
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:34,569
Okay, place oxygen in the center.

37
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,084
My name is Yoon Woohyun.

38
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,934
With the college entrance
exam approaching,

39
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,717
I'm distracted by a crush.

40
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:42,826
Nam Jeongmin,

41
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:43,973
our club advisor and

42
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:45,192
our homeroom teacher.

43
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,951
He's kind, and his classes are fun.

44
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:54,037
And there's a

45
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,756
closer bond between him and me.

46
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,303
There's someone I like,

47
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,639
but he's a guy.

48
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:11,506
So, saying this much

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,522
should be okay, right?

50
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,287
Woohyun.

51
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:18,709
Liking someone of the same gender...

52
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:20,975
Is not wrong.

53
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,152
Besides,

54
00:04:24,983 --> 00:04:26,154
at your age, it's natural

55
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,859
to have these thoughts.

56
00:04:33,428 --> 00:04:35,075
If it's Teacher,

57
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:37,428
I'm sure he would say it's okay.

58
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,842
Today's class ends here.

59
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,349
You worked hard on the summer class.

60
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:45,257
Don't slack off just because it's hot.

61
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:47,071
- Yes.
- Yes.

62
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:49,382
Take care of yourselves.

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,055
Class dismissed.

64
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,075
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

65
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,242
Were you sleeping with your eyes open?

66
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:06,968
Huh?

67
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:09,304
I thought you were asleep

68
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,444
since you didn't move.

69
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:11,764
Class is over.

70
00:05:12,288 --> 00:05:13,288
Mm.

71
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,889
- I want to eat mala.
- Park Doha.

72
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:20,311
My best friend.

73
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,315
We've been in the same
class since grade 11.

74
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,389
He's very friendly,

75
00:05:23,413 --> 00:05:24,920
so we became close quickly.

76
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,256
It's true that Doha and I

77
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:28,368
get along in everything.

78
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:30,205
But I never tell him about my worries.

79
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,830
And I don't plan to.

80
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,180
If I say it,

81
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:36,189
what if Doha ends up hating me?

82
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:45,311
Yoon Woohyun, you're always late.

83
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:47,266
I don't want to end up

84
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:48,079
being unable to face you.

85
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,156
Park Doha.

86
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,087
Let's go.

87
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:54,559
By the way,

88
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,231
The Korean language teacher told a story

89
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,746
about a seven-year unrequited love.
Isn't that cool?

90
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,130
Haa... I wish I had

91
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:00,835
true love like that too.

92
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,473
Who are you to say that when

93
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:03,976
you change your girlfriend every day?

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,328
That's why I said true love.

95
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,992
But why aren't you two dating anyone?

96
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:14,171
I've never dated anyone.

97
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:16,063
Me too.

98
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,210
Do you think Yoon Woohyun is one of

99
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:20,906
those who has a seven-year
unrequited love,

100
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,453
like the Korean language teacher?

101
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,524
Do you have someone you like?

102
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,328
What?

103
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,845
Why are you smiling to yourself?

104
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:39,141
I don't know, I just feel like smiling.

105
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,798
You're not talking about an idol,

106
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:41,673
are you?

107
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:43,323
Who is it? Tell me!

108
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:44,625
Is it Honey? Is it Kim Chaewon?

109
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,836
- Come on, tell us!
- Geez!

110
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,131
(Teacher: Nam Jeongmin)

111
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,016
Want to use it?

112
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,766
Who is it that you like?

113
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:40,462
It's a secret.

114
00:07:57,048 --> 00:07:58,883
Taemin, if you were just going to leave

115
00:07:58,907 --> 00:08:00,850
right after coming, why even show up?

116
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,258
I have a basketball match

117
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:03,882
against class three.

118
00:08:04,641 --> 00:08:05,782
You wanna join?

119
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:09,660
Wait, but you're too short,

120
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:11,108
it might not work.

121
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,360
Hey, Yoon Woohyun.

122
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Huh?

123
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:23,211
You

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
like Teacher Jeongmin?

125
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,984
How did you know?

126
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:33,398
What? So it's true?

127
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:40,408
Do you really think that is possible?

128
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,171
I don't know how you found out,

129
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:45,984
but whoever I like,

130
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,304
that's my business.

131
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,226
So, you don't have to care...

132
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:56,552
Park Doha.

133
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,327
I'm leaving first.

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,115
At first, he was just teaching

135
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,342
my favorite subject.

136
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:32,234
Whenever I had a problem, I'd go to him.

137
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:34,261
So I like that he teaches

138
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:35,566
with sincerity.

139
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:38,491
At some point,

140
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:40,952
I started wishing that

141
00:09:40,968 --> 00:09:42,773
I was the student closest to him.

142
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,343
And then I realized

143
00:09:51,741 --> 00:09:52,818
that this

144
00:09:54,155 --> 00:09:56,398
isn't just a simple feeling.

145
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:04,719
A teacher and a student,

146
00:10:04,744 --> 00:10:06,141
moreover we're both men.

147
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,109
I know it can never happen anyway.

148
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:12,592
Of all people, our homeroom teacher

149
00:10:12,616 --> 00:10:14,216
had to be Jeongmin.

150
00:10:15,944 --> 00:10:17,382
If I confessed, it would

151
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,046
only make things difficult for him.

152
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,577
And once I graduate,

153
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:23,265
I won't see him again.

154
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:25,133
So I decided to keep it to myself

155
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,509
and bury it quietly.

156
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,999
But how did Doha find out?

157
00:10:32,843 --> 00:10:34,749
I didn't want him to know.

158
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:45,054
- Okay, okay.
- Fighting!

159
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:46,398
Pass!

160
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,944
Senior Woohyun is so cool!

161
00:10:56,969 --> 00:10:58,843
- Go!
- Pass!

162
00:11:02,982 --> 00:11:04,265
- Pass!
- Shoot!

163
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,890
Awesome!

164
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:10,898
Amazing.

165
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:12,805
Let's go.

166
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:17,641
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

167
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:18,805
Hey, Park Doha.

168
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:20,508
Trying to stare a hole through my face?

169
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:24,446
- What the hell are you saying?
- Our class won.

170
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:26,383
Class three is buying us ice cream.

171
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,032
Let's go to the convenience store
together.

172
00:11:28,056 --> 00:11:29,056
Mm.

173
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:36,804
You sure have a lot of girls liking you.

174
00:11:37,485 --> 00:11:38,485
What do you mean?

175
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:40,602
When you were playing

176
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:41,826
basketball earlier,

177
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,016
the girls were saying

178
00:11:43,024 --> 00:11:44,172
that you looked cool.

179
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,375
So, do you keep staring at me

180
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,640
because you think I look cool too?

181
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:54,844
No? Alright, then.

182
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:57,813
You

183
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:58,946
are cool, though.

184
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:07,956
Doha eye color has

185
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,660
always been like that?

186
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:20,608
Your face is red.

187
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:22,929
- Are you feeling unwell?
- Umm...

188
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,187
No.

189
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,351
Let's go inside after we finish eating.

190
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,804
The teacher said to go straight home.

191
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:38,905
Sure, I'll go now.

192
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,179
You saw, right?

193
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:57,007
It's all my own skill.

194
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,944
Doha sure came fast.

195
00:13:01,296 --> 00:13:03,169
Aren't you guys the ones who are late?

196
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,991
We were playing basketball.

197
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:07,983
I showered and came here.

198
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,155
Quiet, Park Taemin.

199
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,429
Sorry, my heart beating too fast, right?

200
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:24,523
Umm...

201
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:27,913
Hey.

202
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,069
Hey.

203
00:13:56,108 --> 00:13:57,522
You're here.

204
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:02,632
Yeah. I just felt suffocated.

205
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:08,958
Doha.

206
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,639
Umm...

207
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,507
Well...

208
00:14:15,335 --> 00:14:17,577
I also think it's strange.

209
00:14:23,647 --> 00:14:25,100
But it's not like

210
00:14:25,124 --> 00:14:27,190
I want to do anything about it.

211
00:14:27,905 --> 00:14:30,241
There's no possibility anyway.

212
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:36,913
I just like him, that's all.

213
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,373
So don't let it bother you.

214
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:48,934
I'd really hate to grow apart

215
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,481
from you because of this.

216
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,554
I don't understand what you're saying.

217
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:07,575
Are you avoiding me because

218
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,052
of what happened yesterday?

219
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:11,710
That's not it.

220
00:15:12,226 --> 00:15:13,631
Then why?

221
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:16,600
You left first yesterday and today,

222
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,101
and you've been so cold.

223
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:25,749
I...

224
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,733
Like you.

225
00:15:32,053 --> 00:15:33,343
What?

226
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,998
Taemin called, I'll go first.

227
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,108
He likes me?

228
00:16:26,179 --> 00:16:27,772
This makes me feeling uneasy.

229
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:31,265
Why does Doha like me?

230
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,976
Today was exhausting.

231
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:01,794
Yoon Woohyun, see you at the match.

232
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:02,819
See you later.

233
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,956
Yoon Woohyun.

234
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:14,358
Why are you walking so slowly today?

235
00:17:14,546 --> 00:17:15,780
Huh?

236
00:17:16,663 --> 00:17:17,780
Oh.

237
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:26,593
What are you thinking about?

238
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,616
Ah, well,

239
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,428
just wondering when you

240
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,892
started liking me.

241
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:37,896
To be honest, I never even thought

242
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,512
you'd have feelings for me.

243
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:42,671
- And you?
- Huh?

244
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:45,022
When did you start

245
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,389
liking Teacher Jeongmin?

246
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:50,562
I don't know.

247
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:53,663
See?

248
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,351
I also don't know.

249
00:17:56,554 --> 00:17:58,288
But how did you know

250
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,904
I liked our teacher?

251
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,499
Are you an idiot?

252
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,272
It was obvious.

253
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:10,374
But I want to give up.

254
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,872
Why?

255
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,663
I know it'll never happen.

256
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:17,866
Just because I like him,

257
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:19,163
doesn't mean it'll work out.

258
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:20,779
Right now,

259
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:22,874
I see him every day,

260
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,712
so it's hard to forget.

261
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:28,382
But after graduation,

262
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:30,241
when we don't see each other,

263
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:31,749
maybe it'll be better.

264
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,397
Why?

265
00:18:38,737 --> 00:18:40,952
What if we make a bet?

266
00:18:42,343 --> 00:18:43,967
A bet?

267
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,391
Let's date

268
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,772
until graduation.

269
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:57,712
Before that day,

270
00:18:58,161 --> 00:19:01,013
If if you like me, I win.

271
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:05,366
If not, you win.

272
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:13,632
I'll give you time to think about it.

273
00:19:14,137 --> 00:19:16,609
- I'm not asking for an answer now.
- No.

274
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,468
Let's do it.

275
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:20,187
Huh?

276
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:22,093
Let's make that bet.

277
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,229
Let's date.

278
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,601
Agreeing to Doha's bet

279
00:19:27,617 --> 00:19:29,297
was an impulsive choice.

280
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:33,476
But my feelings for Teacher Jeongmin,

281
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,843
and my desire to move on, were real.

282
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,257
So I wanted to lean on this bet.

283
00:19:39,632 --> 00:19:41,194
Can I really like someone else,

284
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:43,136
someone who isn't my teacher?

285
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:44,258
No.

286
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,186
Can I fall for Doha?

287
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,194
Woohyun.

288
00:20:30,024 --> 00:20:31,437
But

289
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,280
in the end, it was my arrogance.

290
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,499
Because the moment

291
00:20:36,523 --> 00:20:38,203
I met my teacher's gaze,

292
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:40,827
I lost all control.

293
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:49,746
(Next Episode)
- It's all your fault. - What?

294
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,819
Just everything. It's all your fault.

295
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:54,687
Don't flirt at school.

296
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,397
Teacher, did you call us?

297
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:59,390
I only called Woohyun.

298
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,194
The fact that you like Teacher,

299
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:04,343
after I knew, it was so obvious.

300
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,756
- Sorry.
- Then...

301
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,765
can we hold hands?

302
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,390
What were you two talking about earlier?

303
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:12,530
Don't tell me you two are dating?

304
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:14,653
You've been friends with Woohyun
since you were young.

305
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:16,888
Their relationship is like siblings.

306
00:21:17,577 --> 00:21:18,842
If my intuition is right,

307
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:20,873
Sori thinks of Woohyun...

308
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,635
And you, Woohyun?

309
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,347
Aren't you dating anyone?

310
00:21:24,405 --> 00:21:26,170
- Excuse me?
- Earlier...

311
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:28,076
You said you like someone.

312
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,202
That...

313
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:33,671
I think you'd make a good boyfriend.
