1
00:01:50,613 --> 00:01:52,368
What's going on?

2
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,750
Are you going
to bury our hogs again?

3
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,440
It's just a routine inspection.

4
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,444
There's a small leak
at the bio site.

5
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:02,578
You don't have to worry about it.

6
00:02:02,658 --> 00:02:04,927
You also said that the last time.

7
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:09,365
If you're going
to bury our hogs again,

8
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:11,467
I'm going to kill myself.

9
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:14,224
Don't worry.

10
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:16,739
Go and do your business.

11
00:02:17,473 --> 00:02:18,794
Go now.

12
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:20,576
- I can't believe them.
- Goodbye.

13
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:27,650
Are they serious?

14
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:31,221
I don't believe a word they say.

15
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:39,295
Come on.

16
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,531
Come on.

17
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:53,409
Oh, my God.

18
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,455
I'm so unlucky today.

19
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:59,509
(Train to Busan)

20
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,331
Sir,

21
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:02,732
if we sell it right now,
the other people's

22
00:04:02,812 --> 00:04:05,415
stocks will become useless.

23
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,937
And we don't even know
the reason yet.

24
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:09,852
And this might be a set-up.

25
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,889
Yes, I understand.

26
00:04:15,425 --> 00:04:16,792
Excuse me?

27
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,482
No, it isn't.

28
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:21,564
I'm still an amateur.

29
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:23,018
Okay.

30
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:25,468
I'll be waiting for you
on the field.

31
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:28,003
Okay. Goodbye.

32
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:46,422
Tell Director Kim to come in.

33
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:54,997
(Unknown death of fish
in Jinyang reservoir)

34
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:04,694
What should we do?

35
00:05:04,774 --> 00:05:06,776
Sell all of our stocks right now.

36
00:05:07,076 --> 00:05:08,431
Everything?

37
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:09,665
Yeah.

38
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:11,981
It's going to become a problem.

39
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,069
But how about the stability
of the market?

40
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:15,738
And
what about the small investors?

41
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:18,521
- Director Kim.
- Sir?

42
00:05:19,021 --> 00:05:21,691
Don't think about
the small investors.

43
00:05:23,559 --> 00:05:25,161
Sell all of our stocks now.

44
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:28,030
Okay.

45
00:05:30,433 --> 00:05:31,867
Wait a minute.

46
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:37,573
What gift do children like
nowadays?

47
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:43,899
Never mind.

48
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,103
Let's not go to the trial.

49
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:49,839
I don't care what you do.

50
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,806
I'm going to raise Su-an.

51
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:53,689
You're not a good dad to Su-an.

52
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:55,958
Do you even talk to her?

53
00:05:56,992 --> 00:05:58,448
Su-an wants to come here alone.

54
00:05:58,528 --> 00:05:59,995
She wants to come here alone.

55
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:01,717
Did you know about this?

56
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:03,666
What are you talking about?

57
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:06,656
Are you really her dad?

58
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:08,658
She can't go there alone.

59
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:10,706
Then, you can bring her here.

60
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:12,762
She wants to come here.

61
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,130
I can't go tomorrow.

62
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,032
Do you know tomorrow is
her birthday?

63
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:18,748
I know.

64
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,875
Hello.

65
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,697
Did you eat dinner?

66
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,064
Yeah.

67
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:50,400
Where is Su-an?

68
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,750
She's sleeping in her room.

69
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:58,821
I can take the train by myself.

70
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:03,193
You can pick me up at the station.

71
00:07:07,763 --> 00:07:09,232
Mom, I have to go. He's here.

72
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:24,534
You don't have to hang up.

73
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:26,148
I already hung up.

74
00:07:29,152 --> 00:07:31,754
Did you tell mom you'll go
to Busan alone?

75
00:07:32,988 --> 00:07:36,592
Su-an, I'm so busy nowadays.

76
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,049
I think
I can go to Busan next week.

77
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,232
Can you wait until then?

78
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,602
Ah...

79
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:52,608
Here you go.

80
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't forget your birthday.

81
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,715
Happy birthday.

82
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,685
Go on. Open it.

83
00:08:19,902 --> 00:08:22,772
Why? Don't you like it?

84
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:38,788
You gave me this before...

85
00:08:42,892 --> 00:08:47,797
Then, tell me what you want.

86
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,820
Busan.

87
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,269
I want to go to mom.

88
00:08:53,736 --> 00:08:54,790
Tomorrow...

89
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,826
I already told you

90
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:58,861
that we can go when I'm free.

91
00:08:58,941 --> 00:08:59,929
No.

92
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,697
Tomorrow.

93
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,799
You never

94
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,015
keep your promise.

95
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,305
I won't take your time.

96
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:11,721
I can go there alone.

97
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,796
Are you busy nowadays?

98
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:22,865
As usual.

99
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:27,737
Will you go to Busan
with Su-an tomorrow?

100
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,825
Yes.

101
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,694
Nice decision.

102
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:33,796
If you go to Busan this time,

103
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:35,745
talk with your wife.

104
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:39,835
Try to solve the problem well

105
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:42,385
with your wife when you meet her.

106
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:47,157
It's not right
to break-up like that.

107
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,013
You guys should think about Su-an.

108
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:52,148
Mom,

109
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:54,096
don't mind my business.

110
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:59,302
I'm so busy nowadays.

111
00:10:01,136 --> 00:10:02,992
Okay,

112
00:10:03,072 --> 00:10:06,676
I believe that
you'll solve the problem well.

113
00:10:07,843 --> 00:10:11,201
Su-an was disappointed

114
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:13,449
since you didn't go to
her recital.

115
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,821
It's really important time
for Su-an too.

116
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:02,765
It's okay.

117
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,820
It's okay. You're doing fine.

118
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,737
Su-an, continue.

119
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,873
Hello?

120
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:25,775
Hi, mom.

121
00:11:25,855 --> 00:11:27,357
Yeah.

122
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:28,711
No.

123
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,526
Dad is also going.

124
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:32,415
Okay.

125
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,716
Goodbye.

126
00:11:33,796 --> 00:11:35,251
See you later.

127
00:11:35,331 --> 00:11:37,167
Okay.

128
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:52,468
I saw

129
00:11:52,548 --> 00:11:55,785
you singing
at the recital yesterday.

130
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,273
When?

131
00:11:57,353 --> 00:11:59,389
You didn't come to my recital.

132
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,812
I'm always watching you.

133
00:12:02,892 --> 00:12:04,827
And I know
what you're doing every day.

134
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,863
You stopped singing in the middle,
right?

135
00:12:08,097 --> 00:12:09,752
Am I right?

136
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,401
Yes.

137
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:12,988
Why did you stop?

138
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,171
You should've sung until the end.

139
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:17,793
You must finish what you start,

140
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:20,343
whatever you do.

141
00:12:20,843 --> 00:12:23,012
It's worse than not doing it.

142
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:36,091
What the...

143
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:42,932
What's going on?

144
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:51,026
Su-an, are you okay?

145
00:12:51,106 --> 00:12:52,608
Are you okay?

146
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:55,278
That startled me.

147
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:08,591
I think there's something wrong
over there.

148
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:24,560
To all departing passengers,

149
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,896
kindly board KTX 101

150
00:13:26,976 --> 00:13:30,913
heading to Busan.

151
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,169
Where is car 4?

152
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,004
It's that way.

153
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:36,472
Thank you.

154
00:13:36,552 --> 00:13:39,075
To all departing passengers,

155
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:41,244
the train to Busan

156
00:13:41,324 --> 00:13:45,014
will be leaving soon.

157
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:46,662
Please board the train...

158
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,545
- Ah!
- Ah.

159
00:14:03,613 --> 00:14:05,835
- Hye-young.
- Sir?

160
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,137
- Your scarf.
- Okay.

161
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:08,951
Fix it.

162
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,279
Let's be quiet

163
00:14:16,359 --> 00:14:17,547
and sit down.

164
00:14:17,627 --> 00:14:19,362
Okay.

165
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:22,885
It's Jin-hee.

166
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,634
What? Wow.

167
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,091
Jin-hee, what are you doing here?

168
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,025
I'm your cheerleader
starting today.

169
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:30,526
- Oh.
- Really?

170
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:32,228
Didn't you hear?

171
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:33,028
That's awesome.

172
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:34,897
You wanted to become
a cheerleader.

173
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:36,979
- Do you want to sit here?
- Do your best.

174
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:40,069
Jin-hee, hello.

175
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:42,372
- Hello.
- Oh.

176
00:14:42,452 --> 00:14:44,287
What are you listening?

177
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,944
Can you sit elsewhere?

178
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:50,546
You're not listening to anything.

179
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:52,915
Hey,
you should just say 'thank you'

180
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,617
if I say I like you.

181
00:14:54,697 --> 00:14:57,052
You should just accept it.

182
00:14:57,132 --> 00:14:58,121
She's right.

183
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,423
You guys are destined
for each other.

184
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:07,177
Accept her. Accept her!

185
00:15:10,246 --> 00:15:12,348
Jong-gil, try this.

186
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:15,238
When did she make it?

187
00:15:15,318 --> 00:15:15,971
Why did you bring it?

188
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:17,907
It only takes an hour to go
to Daejeon.

189
00:15:17,987 --> 00:15:19,675
- It's okay.
- Eat it.

190
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,691
I don't want to eat it.

191
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:23,246
Sir,

192
00:15:23,326 --> 00:15:24,580
are you on the train?

193
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,316
Yes, why?

194
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:28,318
I've been receiving
a lot of calls.

195
00:15:28,398 --> 00:15:31,334
There was a strike
in Ansan factory.

196
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:33,269
Is that so?

197
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:36,092
Gather some information

198
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,561
and prepare a report for me.

199
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:40,196
I'll be back before lunch.

200
00:15:40,276 --> 00:15:41,744
Okay.

201
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,748
Let me go.

202
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:47,363
I'm sorry...

203
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:49,565
I'm really sorry...

204
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:53,316
I'm sorry...

205
00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:55,751
I'm sorry...

206
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:07,463
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

207
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:10,386
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

208
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:12,422
A weird person is on the train.

209
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:13,656
Where?

210
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:16,406
Someone in the restroom

211
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:19,229
and she's not coming out.

212
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:21,097
- It's been a while.
- She's right.

213
00:17:21,177 --> 00:17:22,798
Sir, I'm sorry.

214
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:24,100
I'll check right away.

215
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,748
Okay.

216
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:37,293
Ma'am?

217
00:17:39,229 --> 00:17:40,796
Ma'am?

218
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:45,435
Ma'am?

219
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,180
Excuse me.

220
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,302
Excuse me?

221
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:04,340
Can I see your ticket?

222
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,809
If you don't have a ticket,

223
00:18:06,889 --> 00:18:07,743
you need to get off the train

224
00:18:07,823 --> 00:18:10,493
at the next station.

225
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,329
They're all dead...

226
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:16,466
- They're all dead...
- What?

227
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,736
All... All...

228
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:23,826
What is wrong with him?

229
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:25,561
Hey, kid.

230
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:26,629
If you don't study hard,

231
00:18:26,709 --> 00:18:28,611
you'll end up like him.

232
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,334
My mom told me that whoever

233
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,549
says that isn't a good person.

234
00:18:34,484 --> 00:18:37,340
I guess
your mom didn't study hard.

235
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,589
Sir, you shouldn't stay here.

236
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,244
Come out first.

237
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:42,925
Let's first move to the back.

238
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:19,595
Is it an emergency?

239
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:23,319
Two people are inside.

240
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:25,788
So you should use
the another restroom.

241
00:19:25,868 --> 00:19:27,570
Go on.

242
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:32,007
It's going to take some time.

243
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:33,363
Honey,

244
00:19:33,443 --> 00:19:35,445
how's it going?

245
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:39,169
Ah, I'm sorry. Take your time.

246
00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:40,803
Take your time.

247
00:19:40,883 --> 00:19:42,685
Use the another restroom. Go on.

248
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,408
Take your time.

249
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:46,509
She's gone.

250
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:48,324
Yeah, take your time.

251
00:19:56,699 --> 00:19:57,653
Ma'am.

252
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:59,255
Ma'am, are you okay?

253
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:00,456
Ma'am.

254
00:20:00,536 --> 00:20:02,305
What should I do?

255
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:05,695
Sir, there's a patient in car 11.

256
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,443
Sir!

257
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,911
- Hello?
- Yeah?

258
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:24,780
Sir, it's more serious
than we expected.

259
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,982
A lot of things happened
during the night.

260
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:29,919
I'm not sure right now

261
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:31,621
but it's not a normal strike.

262
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:33,856
They say it's worldwide.

263
00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,425
- Is she breathing?
- Hello?

264
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:36,559
Is she breathing?

265
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,594
Yes, she's breathing.

266
00:20:38,674 --> 00:20:40,796
She's having a seizure.

267
00:20:40,876 --> 00:20:42,798
Sir, what should we do?

268
00:20:42,878 --> 00:20:44,680
Hey, I'll call you later.

269
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:55,278
(Indiscriminate violence
at the strike)

270
00:20:55,358 --> 00:20:56,712
Oh, my.

271
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,980
They're going to get hurt.

272
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,382
That's not right.

273
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:00,516
Nowadays, people

274
00:21:00,596 --> 00:21:02,818
riot over everything.

275
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:05,555
It the old days,
they got captured.

276
00:21:05,635 --> 00:21:07,770
Hey, you shouldn't say that.

277
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:10,773
Oh, my.

278
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:14,630
Oh, my...

279
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,546
Ma'am?

280
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,582
What should I do?

281
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:23,005
Sir.

282
00:21:23,085 --> 00:21:25,388
Sir, where are you?

283
00:21:27,723 --> 00:21:29,659
What should I do?

284
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:40,803
Sir?

285
00:21:55,851 --> 00:21:56,872
Min-ji.

286
00:21:56,952 --> 00:21:58,721
Min-ji?

287
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,507
What is it?

288
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:23,045
What is she doing?

289
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,904
Hey, what are you doing?

290
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:30,753
What is she doing?

291
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:34,490
Who is she?

292
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,893
Hey, who are you?

293
00:22:48,204 --> 00:22:51,841
Excuse me.

294
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,167
Run away!

295
00:23:17,633 --> 00:23:20,470
Everyone run!

296
00:23:20,936 --> 00:23:22,725
Conductor,
we have a situation here.

297
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:23,659
Sir,

298
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:26,676
there's a fight in the cabin.

299
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:03,112
- Who is she?
- What's wrong with her?

300
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:15,791
Run! Run!

301
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:23,018
Run fast!

302
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:25,000
Stand up.

303
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,125
Dad!

304
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,364
Run, run!

305
00:25:31,767 --> 00:25:33,669
Honey?

306
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:35,525
Hey, Ahn Sang-hwa!

307
00:25:35,605 --> 00:25:36,292
Why!

308
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,641
Ah, I'm sorry...

309
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:41,143
Help me!

310
00:25:51,954 --> 00:25:54,056
What are you doing? Save her.

311
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:56,879
Sir,

312
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,661
Sir, what's wrong?

313
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:04,167
Are you crazy? Help her.

314
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:20,103
Honey.

315
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:22,051
Hey, Sung-kyung!

316
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:25,855
Can you run?

317
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:45,441
(Massive violence.
The victims are increasing)

318
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:46,662
Run!

319
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:48,411
We need to run away!

320
00:26:58,288 --> 00:26:59,742
Close the door!

321
00:26:59,822 --> 00:27:01,644
Close the door now!

322
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:03,226
Close the door!

323
00:27:04,194 --> 00:27:06,196
Close the door now!

324
00:27:06,396 --> 00:27:08,164
Close it!

325
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:10,900
Hey, close the door fast.

326
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:14,003
Just close it!

327
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:23,045
Hey, behind you!

328
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:37,427
How can I lock this?

329
00:27:38,294 --> 00:27:40,263
Hey, how can I lock this?

330
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:42,185
Tell me.

331
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:44,200
Are you deaf?

332
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:49,439
Just let it go.

333
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,474
What?

334
00:27:53,843 --> 00:27:56,011
They don't know how to open it.

335
00:28:06,189 --> 00:28:08,090
They attack us when they see us.

336
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,466
What are they?

337
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:32,782
What are they?

338
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,920
Su-an, are you okay?

339
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:40,956
Excuse me.

340
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:43,125
What?

341
00:28:44,294 --> 00:28:46,416
You owe me an apology.

342
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:48,118
What are you talking about?

343
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:49,932
Are you crazy?

344
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,921
How can you close the door?

345
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,055
Are you out of your mind?

346
00:28:53,135 --> 00:28:56,038
Be careful with your words.

347
00:28:56,439 --> 00:28:58,974
What? Do you want to die?

348
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,330
Come here.

349
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,064
I'm going to kill you right now.

350
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:03,833
Honey, stop it.

351
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:05,915
Everyone is scared.

352
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,285
Damn it...

353
00:29:10,253 --> 00:29:12,308
To all the passengers.

354
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:13,776
Our train won't stop

355
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:18,027
at Cheon-an, Asan Station.

356
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:19,949
So please be seated

357
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,165
for your safety.

358
00:29:23,233 --> 00:29:25,134
Let me go through.

359
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:29,292
Can I talk to a cabin crew?

360
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:31,161
Speaking. What's the matter?

361
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:32,328
Do you know

362
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:35,131
what's going on the train?

363
00:29:35,211 --> 00:29:36,999
Why aren't you stopping
at the station?

364
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,268
No, we already know.

365
00:29:38,348 --> 00:29:39,935
So we evacuated already.

366
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:41,904
And the order was
from our control center.

367
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:43,173
So listen to our order.

368
00:29:43,253 --> 00:29:45,208
What are you talking about?

369
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:46,342
The people are

370
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:48,244
going crazy right now.

371
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:49,445
So stop the train at the station.

372
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:51,126
Do you get it?

373
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:53,629
Wait a minute.

374
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:58,354
Excuse me.

375
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:00,022
Can she sit down?

376
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:01,524
- She's pregnant.
- Stop it.

377
00:30:01,604 --> 00:30:03,459
- Okay.
- Sit.

378
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:07,009
(Mom)

379
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:09,199
Mom?

380
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,283
Are you okay?

381
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:15,618
Yeah, we're okay.

382
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:18,408
Where are you?
What's all the noise?

383
00:30:18,488 --> 00:30:20,410
What's happening?

384
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,012
Everyone's fighting.

385
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:26,582
Are you guys okay?

386
00:30:26,662 --> 00:30:27,850
Mom, are you okay?

387
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,432
Are you hurt?

388
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,556
Seok-woo. Seok-woo...

389
00:30:33,636 --> 00:30:38,594
Take care of Su-an.

390
00:30:38,674 --> 00:30:40,410
Mom, are you okay?

391
00:30:41,311 --> 00:30:43,065
Take care of...

392
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:45,014
Su-an...

393
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:49,038
I love her so much.

394
00:30:49,118 --> 00:30:53,389
But she only looks for her mom.

395
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:58,228
That bastard...

396
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:07,470
Mom?

397
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:10,640
Dad.

398
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,444
Dad!

399
00:31:15,711 --> 00:31:18,314
Is grandma okay?

400
00:31:25,054 --> 00:31:27,643
What's going on?

401
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,245
What's happening?

402
00:31:29,325 --> 00:31:31,327
Su-an, let's sit down first.

403
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,709
Open the door!

404
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:17,773
My fellow citizens,

405
00:32:18,274 --> 00:32:21,211
violent riots have erupted

406
00:32:21,411 --> 00:32:25,034
in our major cities resulting

407
00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:30,119
in many injuries to civilians
and the police.

408
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:32,275
Some cities are paralyzed

409
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:34,510
because of these riots.

410
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,214
And some rioters have

411
00:32:38,294 --> 00:32:39,982
tried to take over

412
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:42,218
the police buses.

413
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:44,066
You're so good.

414
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:48,070
So the government is declaring

415
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:52,262
a state of emergency to secure

416
00:32:52,342 --> 00:32:55,044
the safety of the citizens.

417
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,568
However, the government is

418
00:32:58,648 --> 00:33:00,470
getting under
the control of this situation

419
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,706
with their rapid response.

420
00:33:03,786 --> 00:33:07,590
So the situation will end soon.

421
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:10,413
My fellow citizens,

422
00:33:10,493 --> 00:33:12,515
don't be startled

423
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:16,619
because of the baseless rumors

424
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,254
and stay in your house

425
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:22,592
so that you can be safe.

426
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:25,995
Everyone needs to stay calm

427
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:29,612
and trust our government
and work together.

428
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:32,235
And base on our knowledge,

429
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:34,350
your safety isn't in jeopardy.

430
00:33:48,731 --> 00:33:51,367
(Analyst Kim Jae-wook)

431
00:33:55,738 --> 00:33:58,474
Mom's phone is off.

432
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:05,268
Can you move faster?

433
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:06,849
Su-an, let's sit here first.

434
00:34:07,483 --> 00:34:09,885
Don't worry. I'll call her later.

435
00:34:11,721 --> 00:34:13,276
Jong-gil, come here and sit down.

436
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:15,578
It's okay. You should sit down.

437
00:34:15,658 --> 00:34:17,280
Come on.

438
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,429
Honey, come here and sit down.

439
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:25,688
Grandma, sit here.

440
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:27,123
It's okay.

441
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:29,539
No, you can sit here.

442
00:34:33,142 --> 00:34:34,664
Hey,

443
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,379
do you want to eat this?

444
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:40,570
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

445
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,752
She's so kind.

446
00:34:47,357 --> 00:34:49,792
Move faster.

447
00:34:50,426 --> 00:34:51,894
Your bag is irritating me.

448
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:54,350
Su-an,

449
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,898
you don't have
to give away your seat.

450
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,487
What do you mean?

451
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,122
You don't have to do
that in this situation.

452
00:34:59,202 --> 00:35:01,091
You should think only
about yourself.

453
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,672
Do you get it?

454
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,776
Answer me.

455
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:14,950
My grandma also had problems
with her knees.

456
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:17,853
Su-an...

457
00:35:22,525 --> 00:35:25,748
To all the passengers,

458
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,383
we are sorry to tell you that

459
00:35:27,463 --> 00:35:29,632
the train will run until Daejeon.

460
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:32,788
The army is
waiting at Daejeon Station

461
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:35,791
to suppress the riot.

462
00:35:35,871 --> 00:35:37,893
So everyone should leave

463
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,795
the train at Daejeon Station.

464
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,864
I repeat,

465
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:44,767
the train will run until Daejeon.

466
00:35:44,847 --> 00:35:47,370
Where can I go right now?

467
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,604
Yeosu, Uljin, Busan?

468
00:35:48,684 --> 00:35:49,905
How about Daejeon?

469
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:52,408
Let me use the restroom.

470
00:35:52,488 --> 00:35:54,310
How about Daejeon?

471
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,359
Why?

472
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,263
Su-an, wait here.

473
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:05,255
Hey, kid.

474
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:06,322
Yes?

475
00:36:06,402 --> 00:36:08,471
Who is he? Is he your dad?

476
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:09,759
Yes.

477
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,907
- Your real dad?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:14,410
Why? He's weird.

479
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:16,399
What's his job?

480
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:18,501
A fund manager.

481
00:36:18,581 --> 00:36:21,571
- A fund manager?
- Yes.

482
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:23,586
He's a bloodsucker.

483
00:36:24,387 --> 00:36:26,309
They suck the blood of the people.

484
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:29,512
Hey, you're in front of a kid.

485
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:30,746
It's okay.

486
00:36:30,826 --> 00:36:34,564
I already know that.

487
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,871
Do you want this?

488
00:36:42,538 --> 00:36:44,640
This is for Jam-jami.

489
00:36:45,608 --> 00:36:48,644
Jam-jami is inside here.

490
00:36:49,512 --> 00:36:51,981
Her name is Jam-jami?

491
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:53,436
No, it's a fetus name.

492
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:55,605
It's like a nickname.

493
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:58,541
His dad hasn't decided her name
yet

494
00:36:58,621 --> 00:37:00,756
because her dad is too lazy.

495
00:37:02,057 --> 00:37:03,679
Touch her

496
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,060
Try it.

497
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,897
Try it.

498
00:37:12,835 --> 00:37:14,937
Can you feel her?

499
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,540
I made her.

500
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,746
- What the...
- Am I wrong?

501
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:26,449
(The ants)

502
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:30,085
(Lieutenant Min from Daejeon)

503
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:37,012
Sir?

504
00:37:37,092 --> 00:37:39,349
I can talk right now.
Can I call you later...

505
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:42,618
Wait, let me ask you something.

506
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:44,066
What is it?

507
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,689
I'm in the train to Daejeon.

508
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:48,391
The train?

509
00:37:48,471 --> 00:37:50,793
Ah, then, are you on KTX 101?

510
00:37:50,873 --> 00:37:52,708
I guess you know about it.

511
00:37:53,443 --> 00:37:56,846
Are there soldiers at the station?

512
00:37:57,513 --> 00:37:59,382
Yes, it's true.

513
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:01,617
Really?

514
00:38:01,951 --> 00:38:04,053
Well, I guess it's safe there.

515
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:08,424
Ah... Wait...

516
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:11,026
Lieutenant Min,

517
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:13,062
will we be safe there?

518
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:15,318
Sir, if you come to Daejeon,

519
00:38:15,398 --> 00:38:17,653
you'll be isolated first.

520
00:38:17,733 --> 00:38:18,521
I'm sorry.

521
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:20,135
What?

522
00:38:23,072 --> 00:38:25,508
Hey, I'm with my daughter.

523
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:30,366
Can you help us?

524
00:38:30,446 --> 00:38:32,535
Ah, sir...

525
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:36,886
I'll recommend
a good stock for you later.

526
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:40,776
Then,
don't go out to the main entrance.

527
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:42,512
Use the east entrance.

528
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:44,514
I'll tell my men about you.

529
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:46,749
Thank you.

530
00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:48,698
Thank you.

531
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:57,940
Everyone's going to die.

532
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,479
Everyone's going to die...

533
00:39:13,623 --> 00:39:15,191
What happened here?

534
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:16,579
Why is this place so quiet?

535
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:17,993
Are we in Daejeon?

536
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,789
There's no one here.

537
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,704
Why?

538
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,909
What's happening?

539
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,467
This is what I talked about.

540
00:40:44,547 --> 00:40:46,169
I told you, right?

541
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:47,537
Conductor!

542
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:49,785
- Are you a conductor?
- Yes.

543
00:40:49,985 --> 00:40:51,441
How many people can fit in
the main car?

544
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:52,742
- What?
- Let's get rid

545
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:53,743
of the other cars and go to Busan.

546
00:40:53,823 --> 00:40:54,977
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

547
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:56,612
- No!
- Why?

548
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:59,028
I can't do it here.

549
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:02,152
Where's the army?

550
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:05,721
I don't know...

551
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:07,903
My name card is in here somewhere.

552
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:11,561
I'm a senior executive
of Chunrima Bus.

553
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:13,729
Every road coming
into Dae-jeon is closed.

554
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:14,997
So my buses can't come
into Dae-jeon.

555
00:41:15,077 --> 00:41:16,699
What do you mean?

556
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:19,235
Dae-jeon isn't letting people in.

557
00:41:19,315 --> 00:41:21,537
I bet they won't let us in too.

558
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,773
I heard Busan is still open.

559
00:41:23,853 --> 00:41:25,675
Let's go there now.

560
00:41:25,755 --> 00:41:28,578
Wait, if that's true,

561
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:30,080
we need to take all the people.

562
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,747
What do you mean?

563
00:41:31,827 --> 00:41:33,549
Let's check the station first.

564
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:35,198
Hey!

565
00:41:37,733 --> 00:41:39,569
Damn it.

566
00:42:01,056 --> 00:42:04,194
(Restricted Area)

567
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,975
(Restricted Area)

568
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:23,313
Don't mind them. Let's go.

569
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:27,116
(Restricted Area)

570
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:30,240
Follow me.

571
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,021
Where are you going?

572
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:34,144
We'll use this entrance.

573
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:35,745
How about the others?

574
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:37,727
Don't mind them. Let's go.

575
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:44,967
Why?

576
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:48,338
I'm going that way too.

577
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:50,093
You should use the main entrance.

578
00:42:50,173 --> 00:42:51,794
Just follow the others.

579
00:42:51,874 --> 00:42:53,843
I heard you talking on the phone.

580
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:56,666
I heard everything

581
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:58,881
about pulling you two out.

582
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,219
And the others will be isolated.

583
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,642
Wait, Su-an. Let's just go...

584
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:08,043
I want to tell the others.

585
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:10,346
Su-an, you don't have to do that.

586
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:11,947
I have to tell the others.

587
00:43:12,027 --> 00:43:14,797
Just think about yourself.

588
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:20,002
You only know about yourself.

589
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:23,659
That's why

590
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,108
mom left you.

591
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:46,729
Su-an...

592
00:43:49,965 --> 00:43:50,986
Over here!

593
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:54,190
Over here! Help us!

594
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,759
Su-an, don't move and wait.

595
00:43:56,839 --> 00:43:58,474
Help us!

596
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:18,861
What the...

597
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,031
Hold me.

598
00:44:33,108 --> 00:44:35,110
Go up!

599
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,415
Hurry up!

600
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:50,793
Over here!

601
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:54,217
- Hello?
- Sir.

602
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:55,118
I'm at Daejeon.

603
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:56,186
Did you meet my men?

604
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:57,753
I lost contact with them.

605
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,155
What?

606
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:00,223
Hello?

607
00:45:00,303 --> 00:45:05,508
Save me...

608
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,991
Su-an!

609
00:45:36,306 --> 00:45:38,007
Hurry up.

610
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:44,267
Hurry up!

611
00:45:44,347 --> 00:45:47,917
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

612
00:45:57,993 --> 00:46:00,496
Hurry!

613
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:01,917
Close the door.

614
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:03,499
Okay!

615
00:46:20,216 --> 00:46:21,951
Hurry!

616
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:28,458
Hey, hurry up!

617
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:37,967
Hurry!

618
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:41,604
Close the door!

619
00:47:14,504 --> 00:47:16,826
- Over here.
- Come here.

620
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:19,095
Come over here.

621
00:47:19,175 --> 00:47:21,076
Over here!

622
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:25,401
- Over here!
- Over here!

623
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:27,237
Run fast!

624
00:47:27,317 --> 00:47:28,371
Come over here.

625
00:47:28,451 --> 00:47:31,307
Start the train!

626
00:47:31,387 --> 00:47:33,042
People are still there.

627
00:47:33,122 --> 00:47:37,046
- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

628
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:41,397
- Hurry!
- Over here.

629
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,965
Grandma.

630
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:59,182
Grandma, stand up.

631
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:08,378
No.

632
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:10,913
- Stand up.
- Hey!

633
00:48:10,993 --> 00:48:12,528
Hey!

634
00:48:18,334 --> 00:48:20,370
Go up!

635
00:48:40,122 --> 00:48:41,544
Let me in!

636
00:48:41,624 --> 00:48:44,013
Let me in!

637
00:48:44,093 --> 00:48:46,028
Let me in!

638
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:05,034
When are we going to leave?

639
00:49:05,114 --> 00:49:05,701
Aren't we leaving?

640
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:07,303
No, my friends are still there.

641
00:49:07,383 --> 00:49:09,139
Hey!

642
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:11,507
Those who are
on board must survive first.

643
00:49:11,587 --> 00:49:13,256
Am I wrong?

644
00:49:13,523 --> 00:49:15,358
Am I wrong?

645
00:49:19,595 --> 00:49:21,231
Sir,

646
00:49:21,497 --> 00:49:24,267
start the train...

647
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,175
Hey, run.

648
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:46,722
Run!

649
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:03,426
Hey, the train.

650
00:50:03,506 --> 00:50:05,175
Run faster.

651
00:50:24,126 --> 00:50:25,828
Hey, stay focus!

652
00:50:54,857 --> 00:50:56,592
Hey, move!

653
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,402
To the control center,

654
00:51:19,482 --> 00:51:22,172
the 101 train couldn't stop
at Daejeon.

655
00:51:22,252 --> 00:51:25,475
Can you look for another station?

656
00:51:25,555 --> 00:51:28,311
To the 101 train, we lost

657
00:51:28,391 --> 00:51:30,646
contact with the other stations.

658
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:32,782
To the control center,

659
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:36,232
can we go to Busan?

660
00:51:38,534 --> 00:51:41,691
To the 101 train,

661
00:51:41,771 --> 00:51:43,506
we'll open the railroad.

662
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,410
Let me know
when you contact with Busan.

663
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,745
101, out.

664
00:53:04,787 --> 00:53:07,577
To all the passengers,

665
00:53:07,657 --> 00:53:10,313
our train will

666
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:12,948
go to Busan directly

667
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:15,565
for the safety of the passengers.

668
00:53:16,566 --> 00:53:19,255
Conductor, can you hear me?

669
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:20,856
Yes, I can hear you.

670
00:53:20,936 --> 00:53:22,725
Did you contact Busan?

671
00:53:22,805 --> 00:53:26,229
No, not yet.

672
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:29,445
Just run the train
as fast as you can.

673
00:53:29,645 --> 00:53:32,315
We won't go into Busan
if we're late.

674
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:41,657
Min Young-guk, where are you?

675
00:53:41,824 --> 00:53:43,679
Ah,

676
00:53:43,759 --> 00:53:46,982
I thought you're dead.

677
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:49,332
I'm sorry.

678
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:52,968
Everyone died except for me.

679
00:53:53,703 --> 00:53:55,571
I'm sorry.

680
00:54:04,914 --> 00:54:06,269
Can't contact right now...

681
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,951
- Honey.
- Sir!

682
00:54:09,652 --> 00:54:12,308
Where are you?

683
00:54:12,388 --> 00:54:14,444
We're in the restroom.

684
00:54:14,524 --> 00:54:15,411
The restroom?

685
00:54:15,491 --> 00:54:17,513
What is the number of the car?

686
00:54:17,593 --> 00:54:20,015
Let me think...

687
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:21,551
It's car 13!

688
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:23,966
- Get over here.
- Sung-kyung.

689
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:27,290
Damn it.

690
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:29,859
Did you talk with my kid?
How is she?

691
00:54:29,939 --> 00:54:32,007
They're in the bathroom of car 13.

692
00:54:46,856 --> 00:54:48,591
Are you going to go there?

693
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:52,448
Let's say we made it until there.

694
00:54:52,528 --> 00:54:54,764
Then,
how are you going to come back?

695
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:00,503
There are people

696
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:03,573
in car 15.

697
00:55:09,379 --> 00:55:11,581
(Car 9)

698
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:30,733
We only have to move 3 cars only.

699
00:55:32,402 --> 00:55:33,936
I'll take the lead.

700
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,672
You should be in the middle.

701
00:55:37,807 --> 00:55:39,175
And you should be in the back.

702
00:55:42,178 --> 00:55:44,680
Stop everyone
who is attacking from behind.

703
00:55:56,526 --> 00:55:58,728
By the way,
I heard you're a fund manager.

704
00:56:01,731 --> 00:56:03,199
Well, I guess you know I'll

705
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,702
leave you if you become useless.

706
00:56:13,443 --> 00:56:15,211
We'll move when the tunnel ends.

707
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:31,694
Let's go!

708
00:57:42,698 --> 00:57:43,553
Hurry!

709
00:57:43,633 --> 00:57:45,100
Hurry.

710
00:57:46,068 --> 00:57:47,703
Move!

711
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:05,621
Move out of my way.

712
00:59:36,646 --> 00:59:38,181
Move out of my way.

713
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:42,051
Run!

714
00:59:48,424 --> 00:59:50,125
Move!

715
00:59:53,696 --> 00:59:57,800
They stopped
when we entered the tunnel.

716
00:59:58,133 --> 00:59:59,689
I guess it's because
of the darkness.

717
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:02,238
Yes, I think so too.

718
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,942
There are more here.

719
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:09,312
What should we do?

720
01:00:10,446 --> 01:00:12,282
We don't have a choice

721
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:14,317
but to go in.

722
01:00:17,753 --> 01:00:19,955
- Why?
- Give me your cellphone.

723
01:02:24,447 --> 01:02:26,115
Get that out of my face.

724
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:29,885
Hey, jerk.

725
01:02:30,486 --> 01:02:32,275
How do you feel about meeting

726
01:02:32,355 --> 01:02:34,077
your daughter again because of me?

727
01:02:34,157 --> 01:02:35,278
Huh? Tell me.

728
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:37,180
Are you grateful or what?

729
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,995
What's wrong with your ringtone?

730
01:02:40,596 --> 01:02:43,065
What do you mean?

731
01:02:44,367 --> 01:02:47,102
How can I change it?

732
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:50,993
Am I funny to you?

733
01:02:51,073 --> 01:02:52,942
You little kid.

734
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:54,230
How tall are you?

735
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:56,078
I'm 181cm.

736
01:02:56,412 --> 01:02:57,933
Since it's 10km away

737
01:02:58,013 --> 01:02:59,302
and the train runs with 300km/h...

738
01:02:59,382 --> 01:03:01,150
What?

739
01:03:03,486 --> 01:03:04,840
2 minutes.

740
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,876
The upcoming tunnel will give us
2 minutes.

741
01:03:06,956 --> 01:03:08,111
Can we do it?

742
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:10,313
We don't have a choice.

743
01:03:10,393 --> 01:03:12,482
If we miss this tunnel,

744
01:03:12,562 --> 01:03:16,031
the next one is 6km away.

745
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:17,853
I bet you don't play
with your daughter

746
01:03:17,933 --> 01:03:19,502
often since you're busy.

747
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,872
When your daughter gets older,

748
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:27,142
she'll know
why you worked so hard.

749
01:03:28,978 --> 01:03:32,648
A dad always gets all the blames.

750
01:03:32,915 --> 01:03:35,885
That's what a dad is.

751
01:03:38,654 --> 01:03:40,143
Why are you looking at me
like that?

752
01:03:40,223 --> 01:03:42,112
Did I sound cool?

753
01:03:42,192 --> 01:03:43,959
Huh?

754
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:52,435
(We have the people.
We're on our way)

755
01:03:53,603 --> 01:03:55,291
They are coming back.

756
01:03:55,371 --> 01:03:56,826
What?

757
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:57,593
Who's coming?

758
01:03:57,673 --> 01:04:01,164
My friend is over there
and he'll come here.

759
01:04:01,244 --> 01:04:02,332
Who's coming?

760
01:04:02,412 --> 01:04:03,366
My friend.

761
01:04:03,446 --> 01:04:05,135
He was in car 9
and he'll come here

762
01:04:05,215 --> 01:04:07,403
with the rescued people.

763
01:04:07,483 --> 01:04:09,219
The rescued people?

764
01:04:10,253 --> 01:04:13,223
They have rescued the people.

765
01:04:13,389 --> 01:04:15,458
It's impossible to
not get infected

766
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:17,660
while passing through
the monsters.

767
01:04:18,961 --> 01:04:20,996
Are you sure they're not infected?

768
01:04:21,631 --> 01:04:25,000
Are you sure?

769
01:04:26,001 --> 01:04:27,623
What are you talking about?

770
01:04:27,703 --> 01:04:31,094
Look at them.

771
01:04:31,174 --> 01:04:32,928
They don't know

772
01:04:33,008 --> 01:04:38,080
if their family is
still alive or not.

773
01:04:38,314 --> 01:04:40,483
And we don't even

774
01:04:40,716 --> 01:04:43,473
know those people are

775
01:04:43,553 --> 01:04:45,308
infected or not.

776
01:04:45,388 --> 01:04:47,022
How can we let them in here?

777
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,496
I can't believe it.

778
01:05:02,104 --> 01:05:03,673
Sir.

779
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:08,278
Sir, say something.

780
01:05:08,711 --> 01:05:11,013
They're on their way.

781
01:05:12,648 --> 01:05:14,650
Sir!

782
01:05:15,318 --> 01:05:17,320
Sir...

783
01:09:02,345 --> 01:09:03,846
Just get over here.

784
01:09:12,688 --> 01:09:14,324
One,

785
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,593
two,

786
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:25,368
run!

787
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:29,505
Hurry up!

788
01:09:37,913 --> 01:09:40,350
Hey, Jin-hee. Jin-hee!

789
01:09:42,718 --> 01:09:44,587
What are you doing? Open the door!

790
01:09:54,364 --> 01:09:55,851
Jin-hee.

791
01:09:55,931 --> 01:09:58,934
Jin-hee! Open the door!

792
01:10:00,336 --> 01:10:02,572
Open the door! Open it!

793
01:10:02,805 --> 01:10:04,740
Open up!

794
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:06,596
Open the door.

795
01:10:06,676 --> 01:10:08,411
Jin-hee...

796
01:10:12,047 --> 01:10:13,883
(Young-guk)

797
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:19,342
Hey, open the door!

798
01:10:19,422 --> 01:10:22,458
Jin-hee. Jin-hee!

799
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:34,390
Hey, open the door.

800
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:35,891
I can't open the door.

801
01:10:35,971 --> 01:10:37,293
It's not opening.

802
01:10:37,373 --> 01:10:38,974
Just break it!

803
01:10:39,375 --> 01:10:40,876
Move.

804
01:10:47,016 --> 01:10:48,884
Hurry up!

805
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,416
Those bastards!

806
01:11:33,663 --> 01:11:35,398
Come on!

807
01:11:46,476 --> 01:11:48,010
Sis...

808
01:11:52,648 --> 01:11:54,116
Young-guk!

809
01:11:56,419 --> 01:11:58,508
Move.

810
01:11:58,588 --> 01:12:00,623
Young-guk!

811
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,025
Don't come here!

812
01:12:42,632 --> 01:12:44,099
Honey, don't come here.

813
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:45,688
Go!

814
01:12:45,768 --> 01:12:47,470
Please go!

815
01:12:52,842 --> 01:12:54,897
Hey!

816
01:12:54,977 --> 01:12:58,514
Take her and go!

817
01:12:59,048 --> 01:13:01,050
- What?
- Just go!

818
01:13:02,017 --> 01:13:03,953
Get out of here.

819
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:07,923
I'm losing my strength.

820
01:13:10,593 --> 01:13:15,698
Take care of her for me.

821
01:13:15,865 --> 01:13:18,621
I'll stop them here.

822
01:13:18,701 --> 01:13:20,236
Hurry up!

823
01:13:28,978 --> 01:13:32,848
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

824
01:13:42,858 --> 01:13:45,161
We need to go now!

825
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:48,264
Yun Seo-young!

826
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:52,602
It's our daughter's name.

827
01:13:53,269 --> 01:13:55,037
Get it?

828
01:13:59,709 --> 01:14:01,797
No.

829
01:14:01,877 --> 01:14:04,180
No.

830
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:56,359
Why did you do it!

831
01:15:58,394 --> 01:16:00,163
Everyone could've made it.

832
01:16:01,797 --> 01:16:03,666
Why!

833
01:16:05,768 --> 01:16:07,670
He's infected.

834
01:16:08,171 --> 01:16:10,072
He's infected.

835
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,563
He's infected!

836
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:15,064
Look at his eyes.

837
01:16:15,144 --> 01:16:16,299
Look at his eyes!

838
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:17,200
Look at his eyes!

839
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,136
He's going to change
like those monsters.

840
01:16:20,216 --> 01:16:21,704
Do you want to die?

841
01:16:21,784 --> 01:16:23,786
We need to kick him out.

842
01:16:28,123 --> 01:16:29,925
Hey!

843
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:37,233
I think those who came

844
01:16:37,967 --> 01:16:40,903
from the another car
can't stay here.

845
01:16:42,137 --> 01:16:44,374
Please move to another car.

846
01:16:59,289 --> 01:17:01,056
Go away!

847
01:17:01,924 --> 01:17:05,381
- Get out of here.
- Go away!

848
01:17:05,461 --> 01:17:07,830
Get out of here.

849
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:15,271
- Leave.
- Leave!

850
01:17:16,172 --> 01:17:18,040
Get out now!

851
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:20,343
Get out of here!

852
01:17:22,111 --> 01:17:23,733
Get out!

853
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:25,268
Get out!

854
01:17:25,348 --> 01:17:26,669
Get out of here!

855
01:17:26,749 --> 01:17:29,105
Get out!

856
01:17:29,185 --> 01:17:31,821
Go away!

857
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:33,243
Go away!

858
01:17:33,323 --> 01:17:35,225
Get out of here!

859
01:17:37,059 --> 01:17:38,348
Jin-hee,

860
01:17:38,428 --> 01:17:39,849
you'll be safer here.

861
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:41,384
No.

862
01:17:41,464 --> 01:17:43,333
It's scarier here.

863
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:45,355
I want to go with you.

864
01:17:45,435 --> 01:17:46,822
What...

865
01:17:46,902 --> 01:17:48,724
Leave!

866
01:17:48,804 --> 01:17:51,194
What are you doing? Leave!

867
01:17:51,274 --> 01:17:53,108
Okay, let's go.

868
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:58,214
Leave! Get out of here!

869
01:17:59,882 --> 01:18:02,152
Are you guys deaf?

870
01:18:19,902 --> 01:18:21,471
Let's go.

871
01:18:46,829 --> 01:18:48,364
Leave!

872
01:18:58,208 --> 01:19:00,176
Tie there too.

873
01:19:00,576 --> 01:19:01,764
Give me some more ties.

874
01:19:01,844 --> 01:19:03,899
I'm tying it right now. Be quiet.

875
01:19:03,979 --> 01:19:05,235
You should do it!

876
01:19:05,315 --> 01:19:07,450
Hurry up! Hurry!

877
01:19:14,056 --> 01:19:16,359
We need to tie more ties.

878
01:19:16,926 --> 01:19:18,894
What are you doing?

879
01:19:20,196 --> 01:19:22,131
You idiot.

880
01:19:22,298 --> 01:19:24,133
Look what happened to you.

881
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,889
Always helping others

882
01:19:26,969 --> 01:19:29,505
instead of yourself.

883
01:19:33,209 --> 01:19:35,845
Why did you live like that?

884
01:19:36,946 --> 01:19:38,268
What was the point?

885
01:19:38,348 --> 01:19:40,082
Why did you live

886
01:19:40,516 --> 01:19:42,585
like that...

887
01:19:45,455 --> 01:19:47,557
Hey, shut up.

888
01:19:49,192 --> 01:19:51,427
Be quiet! Be quiet!

889
01:19:51,927 --> 01:19:53,996
Sit down!

890
01:19:54,264 --> 01:19:57,333
What a load of shit...

891
01:20:01,537 --> 01:20:04,440
Tie there too.

892
01:20:14,617 --> 01:20:19,155
Hey, thank you for everything.

893
01:20:20,156 --> 01:20:21,144
Hey, look at her.

894
01:20:21,224 --> 01:20:23,125
Hey, stop her!

895
01:21:16,712 --> 01:21:19,335
To the control center, we're

896
01:21:19,415 --> 01:21:21,717
on our way to Busan.
Confirm the status.

897
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:24,540
Control?

898
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,456
Control!

899
01:22:52,442 --> 01:22:54,644
Today is your birthday.

900
01:22:58,714 --> 01:23:00,416
Don't worry.

901
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:02,785
I'll take you to your mom.

902
01:23:06,622 --> 01:23:09,259
Aren't you scared?

903
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:16,332
I'm scared.

904
01:23:17,767 --> 01:23:19,535
I'm scared.

905
01:23:23,706 --> 01:23:26,209
I was so scared

906
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:30,112
because I thought
I can't see you anymore.

907
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:34,504
The song I sang yesterday

908
01:23:34,584 --> 01:23:37,153
was for you.

909
01:23:41,157 --> 01:23:43,459
That's why I stopped singing

910
01:23:45,528 --> 01:23:47,697
since you weren't there.

911
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:57,540
Are you going to stay next to me?

912
01:24:12,155 --> 01:24:15,791
(Su-an's mom)

913
01:24:25,268 --> 01:24:29,539
Can't contact right now...

914
01:24:39,815 --> 01:24:44,387
(Director Kim)

915
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:47,790
Hey.

916
01:24:49,192 --> 01:24:50,513
Did you arrive at Busan?

917
01:24:50,593 --> 01:24:52,282
Not yet.

918
01:24:52,362 --> 01:24:54,230
Where are you?

919
01:24:55,465 --> 01:24:58,288
Busan succeeds in defending
the monsters.

920
01:24:58,368 --> 01:25:01,391
What? Are you sure?

921
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:03,373
Where did you get the information?

922
01:25:03,873 --> 01:25:05,695
Sir,

923
01:25:05,775 --> 01:25:08,578
this happened from Yu-sun Biotech.

924
01:25:10,613 --> 01:25:12,602
The company we saved

925
01:25:12,682 --> 01:25:15,285
from bankruptcy on purpose.

926
01:25:19,255 --> 01:25:20,656
Sir...

927
01:25:20,923 --> 01:25:21,844
Is this situation our fault?

928
01:25:21,924 --> 01:25:24,327
Is it our fault?

929
01:25:25,261 --> 01:25:27,883
We just did what we were told.

930
01:25:27,963 --> 01:25:32,335
It isn't my fault, right?

931
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,872
Director Kim...

932
01:25:37,373 --> 01:25:39,209
It's not your fault.

933
01:25:42,745 --> 01:25:44,547
Thank you.

934
01:25:45,981 --> 01:25:47,783
Hey...

935
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:15,605
(East Daegu station)

936
01:27:32,388 --> 01:27:34,410
To all the passengers,

937
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:36,011
our train will stop

938
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:38,548
at East Daegu Station

939
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:41,016
since the railroad is blocked.

940
01:27:41,096 --> 01:27:44,820
So we'll have to wait here for

941
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,557
the rescue team or move to

942
01:27:47,637 --> 01:27:49,905
another train and go to Busan.

943
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,595
As soon as
I end this announcement,

944
01:27:52,675 --> 01:27:54,029
I'll go out and look

945
01:27:54,109 --> 01:27:55,765
for the train

946
01:27:55,845 --> 01:27:58,334
and move it to the left railroad.

947
01:27:58,414 --> 01:28:01,904
- What is he saying?
- To the left railroad.

948
01:28:01,984 --> 01:28:03,819
I hope all the survivors

949
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:07,122
transfer safely.

950
01:28:08,824 --> 01:28:10,660
Good luck to everyone.

951
01:29:15,858 --> 01:29:17,993
Will the rescue team come?

952
01:29:20,463 --> 01:29:22,798
I heard Busan is safe.

953
01:29:24,967 --> 01:29:26,769
We have to go now.

954
01:29:50,092 --> 01:29:51,694
Let's go.

955
01:30:21,591 --> 01:30:23,058
Oh, my.

956
01:31:11,774 --> 01:31:13,243
Can we go out now?

957
01:31:15,911 --> 01:31:17,313
Yes.

958
01:31:19,915 --> 01:31:21,317
Go out first.

959
01:31:45,575 --> 01:31:47,577
We have to find a way
to cross here.

960
01:31:53,115 --> 01:31:54,684
Let's go.

961
01:32:11,301 --> 01:32:13,068
What the...

962
01:32:24,947 --> 01:32:26,716
Sir!

963
01:33:03,186 --> 01:33:04,307
No...

964
01:33:04,387 --> 01:33:06,021
What should we do?

965
01:33:06,356 --> 01:33:07,610
Hey,

966
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,892
what should we do...

967
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:12,428
Let's go. We have to go now.

968
01:33:20,203 --> 01:33:22,104
Hold my hand!

969
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:39,755
Move.

970
01:33:52,368 --> 01:33:54,069
Jin-hee!

971
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,352
Jin-hee!

972
01:34:20,763 --> 01:34:22,298
What should we do...

973
01:34:28,171 --> 01:34:30,005
I'm sorry...

974
01:34:52,362 --> 01:35:02,505
Dad, wake up!

975
01:35:02,938 --> 01:35:07,777
Dad! Dad!

976
01:35:08,444 --> 01:35:10,546
Dad! Dad!

977
01:35:22,492 --> 01:35:25,228
What happened?

978
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,986
Hurry. Hurry up!

979
01:35:31,066 --> 01:35:32,802
Hurry up!

980
01:35:37,807 --> 01:35:39,575
Ah, damn it.

981
01:35:41,477 --> 01:35:43,346
Stand up.

982
01:35:55,425 --> 01:35:57,893
Save me!

983
01:36:40,135 --> 01:36:42,172
Su-an, come here.

984
01:36:46,276 --> 01:36:48,978
Su-an, Su-an!

985
01:37:04,494 --> 01:37:06,362
Hey!

986
01:37:24,146 --> 01:37:25,067
Su-an!

987
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:27,470
Su-an, hurry up.

988
01:37:27,550 --> 01:37:28,404
Sir...

989
01:37:28,484 --> 01:37:31,174
Move! Move! Go fast!

990
01:37:31,254 --> 01:37:32,375
Go fast!

991
01:37:32,455 --> 01:37:34,123
Go fast!

992
01:37:35,024 --> 01:37:36,526
Come on!

993
01:37:56,045 --> 01:37:57,613
Let's go!

994
01:39:20,363 --> 01:39:22,332
Hurry up!

995
01:39:25,268 --> 01:39:26,702
Dad!

996
01:41:47,943 --> 01:41:49,545
Hey,

997
01:41:50,913 --> 01:41:52,682
I'm so scared.

998
01:41:55,518 --> 01:41:57,373
Can you take me to my house.

999
01:41:57,453 --> 01:41:59,722
My mom is

1000
01:42:00,356 --> 01:42:02,925
waiting for me.

1001
01:42:06,396 --> 01:42:08,431
The address is

1002
01:42:08,798 --> 01:42:11,387
Su-young gu, Busan.

1003
01:42:11,467 --> 01:42:13,269
Kwon-hyun dong...

1004
01:42:15,871 --> 01:42:17,973
Help me...

1005
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:20,710
Help me...

1006
01:42:21,477 --> 01:42:22,912
Hey,

1007
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:25,481
you're infected.

1008
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:32,822
No.

1009
01:42:33,989 --> 01:42:35,725
No.

1010
01:42:35,925 --> 01:42:37,593
No.

1011
01:42:37,993 --> 01:42:43,799
That's not true.

1012
01:42:55,611 --> 01:42:57,780
Dad!

1013
01:43:08,558 --> 01:43:10,460
Dad!

1014
01:43:19,435 --> 01:43:21,904
Dad!

1015
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:29,579
Dad!

1016
01:43:41,491 --> 01:43:43,459
No.

1017
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:54,069
Dad!

1018
01:45:08,711 --> 01:45:10,433
Su-an, come here.

1019
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:12,702
Sit here.

1020
01:45:12,782 --> 01:45:14,584
Sung-kyung,

1021
01:45:15,385 --> 01:45:17,153
try to listen to me.

1022
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:20,576
I think this is the brake.

1023
01:45:20,656 --> 01:45:22,458
If you arrive somewhere safe,

1024
01:45:22,858 --> 01:45:24,080
just pull this.

1025
01:45:24,160 --> 01:45:26,061
You understand?

1026
01:45:31,066 --> 01:45:32,702
Su-an,

1027
01:45:34,069 --> 01:45:34,924
Look at me.

1028
01:45:35,004 --> 01:45:36,972
Look at me.

1029
01:45:41,411 --> 01:45:43,145
Look at me. Look at me.

1030
01:45:44,013 --> 01:45:45,468
Su-an,

1031
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,116
listen to me.

1032
01:45:47,983 --> 01:45:49,072
You need to stay

1033
01:45:49,152 --> 01:45:50,806
with her.

1034
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:52,488
Do you get it?

1035
01:45:53,756 --> 01:45:56,892
You'll be safe in Busan.

1036
01:45:57,059 --> 01:45:59,061
- So...
- Dad, don't go!

1037
01:45:59,829 --> 01:46:02,632
Don't go! I'm sorry!

1038
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:05,488
Dad, don't go...

1039
01:46:05,568 --> 01:46:07,570
Don't go...

1040
01:46:08,838 --> 01:46:10,706
Please don't go...

1041
01:46:12,442 --> 01:46:14,109
Don't go...

1042
01:46:15,445 --> 01:46:18,047
Stay with me.

1043
01:46:18,448 --> 01:46:20,683
Don't go...

1044
01:46:22,452 --> 01:46:24,220
Don't go...

1045
01:46:25,588 --> 01:46:28,691
Don't go...

1046
01:46:29,124 --> 01:46:31,927
Please don't go.

1047
01:46:35,064 --> 01:46:39,735
Don't go...

1048
01:46:41,136 --> 01:46:45,428
Dad! Dad!

1049
01:46:45,508 --> 01:46:48,564
Dad!

1050
01:46:48,644 --> 01:46:53,703
Dad, don't go!

1051
01:46:53,783 --> 01:46:55,605
Dad!

1052
01:46:55,685 --> 01:46:57,920
Don't go!

1053
01:51:49,144 --> 01:51:50,846
Lieutenant Song,

1054
01:51:59,255 --> 01:52:01,777
two subjects are approaching
from the tunnel.

1055
01:52:01,857 --> 01:52:04,260
A woman and a child, over.

1056
01:52:06,162 --> 01:52:08,364
Check if they're infected, over.

1057
01:52:11,567 --> 01:52:14,404
Where did you guys come from?

1058
01:52:19,175 --> 01:52:21,110
Tell him
it's impossible to verify.

1059
01:52:23,379 --> 01:52:25,501
We can't tell
if they're infected or not.

1060
01:52:25,581 --> 01:52:27,383
What should we do? Over.

1061
01:52:29,419 --> 01:52:31,254
Kill them, over.

1062
01:53:20,370 --> 01:53:22,472
Survivors are approaching!

1063
