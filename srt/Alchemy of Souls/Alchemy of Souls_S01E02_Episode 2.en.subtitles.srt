1
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,706
20 YEARS AGO

2
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,293
My lady…

3
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,505
My lady…

4
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,724
My lady…

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,772
I shall make Do-hwa mine.

6
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,483
If she bears a child,
know that it is mine.

7
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,282
My lady…

8
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,534
My lord.

9
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,203
Where are you going, my lord?

10
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,590
I heard about Do-hwa.

11
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,801
We were just about to head over.

12
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:36,805
Why are you here
when you should be mourning her?

13
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,558
I came here because this was
the only way to change his fate.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,121
What are you doing?

15
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,149
What have you done?

16
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,276
I have blocked his gate of energy.

17
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,571
He will not be able
to learn any spells while he is alive.

18
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,161
I forbid anyone from opening
his gate of energy!

19
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,915
How could you do this to your son?

20
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,043
My son?

21
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,513
Why would he decide my own fate?

22
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,017
No one even considers him
as my true father anyway!

23
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:05,977
I will find someone.

24
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,438
A master who will open my gate of energy

25
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,523
and teach me how to practice spells.

26
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,318
I will find someone myself.

27
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,030
Then I will take out that sword
and break it in two.

28
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:26,039
I have met a total of 12 masters
and have been kicked out every time.

29
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,252
And finally, I have met the master
who will change my fate.

30
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,724
I knew the moment I saw you.

31
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,852
You are my master.

32
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,283
Did you find something special about me,

33
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,409
Young Master?

34
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,248
I told you that you have beautiful eyes.

35
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,667
Right, sorry.
Only your eyes are beautiful.

36
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,837
The soul shifter's blue mark
has bloomed inside them.

37
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,508
So the mark was inside my eyes.

38
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,180
You are going to fight me?

39
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,974
Killing you would be a breeze.

40
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,850
But this is Songrim.

41
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,019
You will get caught.

42
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,617
I am planning to save you.

43
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,745
You will not get caught
if you stay by my side.

44
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,928
How should you address me
if you want to lie low?

45
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,724
"Young Master."

46
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,904
Jang Uk?

47
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,781
Yes, it is me.

48
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,742
Why are you here?

49
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,538
And who is she?

50
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,749
Right.

51
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,002
She is Mu-deok, my maid.

52
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,839
Mu-deok?

53
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,763
Yul, you startled her.
Can you put your blade down?

54
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,765
Right.

55
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,519
Mu-deok, are you all right?

56
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,440
Mu-deok.

57
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,819
I am fine, Young Master.

58
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,321
Good.

59
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,364
Uk?

60
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,075
Hey.

61
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,995
Hold on. Why are you here?

62
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,624
I came to visit the leader.
We took refuge here after hearing a fight.

63
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,127
There were intruders.
You cannot even fight.

64
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,089
Jeez. Thank goodness
they did not spot you.

65
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,632
No.

66
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,051
It was wise of you to hide here.

67
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,346
My maid ran away,
so I just followed her, you…

68
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,680
Gosh, that hurts…

69
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,141
Who is she?

70
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,523
What is with that blade?

71
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,072
You…

72
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,202
Were you trying to protect him with that?

73
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,955
I am proud of you.

74
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,333
That is right. Your young master
is extremely weak,

75
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,335
so you need to protect him.

76
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,672
Of course.

77
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,966
I ought to protect my young master.

78
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,302
No, that is not true.

79
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,348
I should protect you instead.

80
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,143
What is with the strong grip?

81
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,978
Let go.

82
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,573
Mu-deok! You should not glare like that!

83
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,491
You should look down.

84
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,371
Yes, Young Master.

85
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:38,916
So you were the one who ran away from me.

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,334
Mu-deok, was it?

87
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,795
I am sorry to have startled you.

88
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,684
Are you injured?

89
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,573
Mu-deok.

90
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,951
I am fine, Young Master.

91
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,040
-Has the dust settled?
-No.

92
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,291
It is still chaotic.

93
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,835
Soul Shifter Naksu's body
has gone missing.

94
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,797
I knew it. They were the Danju's men.

95
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,509
Now, I just need
to get out of here safely.

96
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,969
What a pity.

97
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,971
The soul shifter.

98
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,098
Naksu, the Shadow Assassin.

99
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,895
I was always curious about how she looked.

100
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,316
He knows who I am.

101
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,652
I must kill him before I leave.

102
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,368
They must have broken
the pine forest barrier and gone out.

103
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,466
So they broke the barrier.

104
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,885
-We will go after them.
-It is too late.

105
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,931
Only those of Songrim
can break the barrier.

106
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,809
There is a spy among us.

107
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,729
We must ask the Jin family for help.

108
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,489
Naksu's body was in this secret room.

109
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,994
Uk, did you notice anything suspicious
while hiding in Jeongjingak?

110
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,620
Suspicious?

111
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,456
No. I was only watching Mu-deok.

112
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,464
Do you think Naksu shifted her soul
into another woman's body

113
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,966
and came to retrieve her body?

114
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,264
Can women only shift souls
to the same gender?

115
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,473
Not really.

116
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,144
But for everything to go smoothly,
I heard they should pick someone similar.

117
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:06,022
Gender, age, and build.
They all need to be similar.

118
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,525
I am only asking
because I have not seen her.

119
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,654
Was Naksu thin with short limbs?

120
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,407
Did she have a round face
like Mu-deok right here?

121
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,326
What the hell is his problem?

122
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,457
If that was the case,
she would not have been nicknamed "Naksu".

123
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,416
Look at her.

124
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,961
What kind of an assassin
looks this adorable?

125
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,838
You are right.

126
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,174
I bet she was a monster.

127
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,426
No, she was human.

128
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,348
Let us not belittle the dead,
even if she was an assassin.

129
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,314
Master Heo Yeom wants to see you.

130
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,358
Go without me. He dislikes me anyway.

131
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,151
Right. Being here would be safer.

132
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,402
Let us go.

133
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,624
The body was frozen here.

134
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:10,503
Seeing how there is no rotting smell,
your body must still be fine.

135
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,506
Naksu.

136
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,300
That is right.

137
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,470
I am the Shadow Assassin.

138
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,474
Naksu.

139
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,398
I thought long and hard
about why you helped me.

140
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,485
Did the Danju send you too?

141
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,987
No. No one sent me here.

142
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,989
Then why did you help me?

143
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,451
I already told you,
but I guess you did not get the message.

144
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,539
You have beautiful eyes.

145
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,541
Do not tell me

146
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,085
you really fell for me.

147
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,422
Do not laugh.

148
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,174
That is the only thing that makes sense.

149
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,176
I do admit repeatedly calling you pretty.

150
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,012
But it was because I desired something.

151
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,806
Which was?

152
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:08,769
I have been searching for someone who
can break this spell to call my master.

153
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,021
And then, I found you.

154
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,108
Naksu.

155
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,861
I want you to be my master.

156
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,919
I heard.

157
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,046
You borrowed
the Jin family's ghost Sapsali?

158
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,089
Yes, my lord.

159
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,135
Are you certain that thing is in Songrim?

160
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,303
I am.

161
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,057
A soul shifter is lurking within Songrim.

162
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,522
The son of Jang Gang of Songrim

163
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,066
is asking me, an assassin,
to be his master?

164
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,487
What original nonsense.

165
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,617
You will open your pupil's gate of energy
and help him master spells.

166
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,037
As your pupil,
I will keep you safe and hidden.

167
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,457
We could form a beautiful relationship
where we benefit from each other.

168
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,417
-Not interested.
-If you do not want to be my master,

169
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,211
you could be my wife instead.

170
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,587
-Would you like that?
-Shut it.

171
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,216
I heard you visited many masters
and got kicked out every time.

172
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,259
Was it because you were this stubborn?

173
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,558
I could not threaten my former masters
since they had no weakness.

174
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,896
But you have a pretty big one.

175
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,443
You cannot get out of here alive
without my help.

176
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,112
You will die if they find out who you are.

177
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,156
Is that so?

178
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,450
In that case,

179
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,205
I will just kill you.

180
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,585
How merciless. After all, I helped you.

181
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:59,630
Sorry that I am so merciless
for such a cute face.

182
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,141
I brought you to our house
with the Jade Plaque

183
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,852
and to Songrim with the Spirit Plaque.

184
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,730
And now, look where we are.

185
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,115
This is Songrim's secret room.

186
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,536
Once that door closes, we can only get out
if someone opens from the outside.

187
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,372
We are locked in here together.

188
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,792
Do not move!

189
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,879
Step on the wrong spot,
and the ground will cave in.

190
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:47,303
Kill me, and you will be killed
by the Songrim mages who will enter.

191
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,764
But if you agree to be my master,
we will get out of this unscathed.

192
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,271
I do not have the strength
to break his gate of energy right now.

193
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,648
He will catch wind of it if I stay here.

194
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,275
I need my sword.

195
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,612
I have become weak due to shifting souls.

196
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,531
I need my sword's energy
to open your gate of energy.

197
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,241
Without that,

198
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,536
there is nothing I can do in here.

199
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,122
To retrieve my sword,

200
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,708
I need to go out there.

201
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:18,918
So stop that.

202
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,463
Did you not hear me?

203
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,633
I cannot do that. I need to wait
until it fully closes first.

204
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,470
You! You lied, did you not?

205
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,807
Do not move!

206
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,060
-If you do, the ground will cave in!
-Wait!

207
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:40,773
Grab tightly! You are slipping!

208
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,276
-Where is your face touching?
-Shut it!

209
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,070
-Hey!
-Hey!

210
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,112
You little…

211
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,532
-That hurts!
-It was not intentional.

212
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,743
-It hurts!
-Just wait.

213
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,203
Let me go.

214
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,252
By the way, how will we find your sword?

215
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,130
I know who took it. I can find it.

216
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,342
It is too dangerous to get out of Songrim.

217
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,052
We need to stay inside.

218
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,263
Does it have to be that specific sword?

219
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,140
Get another sword with that energy
and do it here.

220
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,351
I cannot. It has to be mine.

221
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,104
Let us go out and find it.

222
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,191
I will lure him out and then kill him.

223
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,277
You said you became weak.

224
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,533
I thought you were pretending
to be clumsy.

225
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,077
How weak have you become?

226
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,581
The mages are coming.

227
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,708
Stay alert.

228
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,547
Why would I? They are on my side.

229
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,551
Taking sides?
Are you seriously that childish?

230
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,469
Why are you talking casually
in this situation?

231
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,762
Fine, Young Master.

232
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,097
I will look down.

233
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,974
Look at you.

234
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,274
Who is she?

235
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,111
I am Mu-deok, his maid.

236
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,615
You heard her, right? She is my maid.

237
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,909
You all seem busy. Go on, then.

238
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,412
-Let us go, Mu-deok.
-You may not leave.

239
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,084
The leader ordered everyone
to gather at the Training Center.

240
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,838
I am not a member of Songrim.

241
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,174
He wants every living thing
within these walls

242
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,052
to gather there.

243
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,145
-Uk.
-Hey.

244
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,483
What is going on?
Why are we gathered here?

245
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,652
They are going to catch
Naksu's men who are in here.

246
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,073
Naksu?

247
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,043
One of you

248
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,004
has helped Naksu's men
who sneaked in here today.

249
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:10,839
My lord.

250
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,093
Everyone here knows each other.

251
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,805
On the outside,
you all look like those of Songrim.

252
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,975
That is why I asked someone for help.

253
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,438
Lady Jin Cho-yeon of the Jin family
has brought Gwigu.

254
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,142
Hello, my lady.

255
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,241
Why is Jang Uk here?

256
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,368
I am not sure.

257
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,965
That must be Gwigu,
the Jin family's heirloom.

258
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,091
Gwigu?

259
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,968
-As in a dog?
-Yes.

260
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,762
It is a ghost Sapsali
that detects sorcery.

261
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,476
There is

262
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,812
a soul shifter among us.

263
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,359
And Gwigu will find that individual.

264
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,654
They look like one of us on the outside.

265
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,116
But Gwigu will find the one
who has a different soul within them.

266
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,041
Close all the doors.

267
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,000
-Yes, my lord!
-Yes, my lord!

268
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:19,134
Whoever tries to leave this building

269
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,471
will be considered a spy and killed.

270
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,057
You may begin.

271
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,830
The alchemy of souls, a type of sorcery,
has one weakness.

272
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,873
There is a gap
between the body and the soul.

273
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,376
The evil energy seeps out from it.

274
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,837
And Gwigu can detect that.

275
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,577
Uk, feign ignorance even if I get caught.

276
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,123
-Is this loyalty?
-It is my duty.

277
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,757
I do not want to become a laughingstock

278
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,384
once they find out I asked you for help.

279
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,969
Stay right by my side.

280
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:30,807
No one here will let that thing attack me.

281
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,298
He is a soul shifter! Get him!

282
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,015
I heard soul shifters get petrified
when they run wild and lose their energy.

283
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,308
It was true.

284
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,339
We thank you for your great help.

285
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,967
I am sure one day
we will ask you for help too.

286
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:16,723
I see that Daeho's four families
have all gathered here.

287
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,892
I heard you are called the Four Seasons.

288
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:22,646
Seeing you all together makes me happy.

289
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,106
We used to gather often,

290
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,401
but it is our first time after Uk
and Cho-yeon called off their wedding.

291
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,279
You little…

292
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,324
I told them to prepare some tea
in the reception room.

293
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,617
Please come.

294
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,084
You were here as well.

295
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,878
I heard you were kicked out of Gisan.

296
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,505
Right.

297
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:52,217
You should stop
keeping track of what I am doing.

298
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,889
Everyone was talking about
how you got kicked out yet again.

299
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,516
I just happened to hear it.

300
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,934
I see.

301
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,854
Our precious guest here
seems uncomfortable around me,

302
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,314
so let me excuse myself.

303
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,027
What a scumbag.

304
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,947
Let us go.

305
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,242
Let us go.

306
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,673
Hey, excuse me.

307
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,718
Did you see my maid?

308
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,929
She is short, thin, and has a round face.

309
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,306
Darn it.

310
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,808
Where did she go?

311
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,646
The spy the Danju had sent here
was a soul shifter.

312
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,983
I must find the Danju.

313
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,538
You were not loyal,
but you said you knew your duties.

314
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,041
Can you say the same thing about this?

315
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,544
That is exactly
why I am leaving you behind.

316
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,047
My original plan
was to take you with me and kill you.

317
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,089
I see.

318
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,258
How evil.

319
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:19,012
I am not the round-faced Mu-deok,
your loyal maid.

320
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,891
You are Naksu. The merciless assassin.

321
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,313
You had the chance to kill me
when I was bathing.

322
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,607
I even risked my life
bringing you here with me.

323
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,985
It is up to you
whether to still kill me now

324
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,030
or become my master
after opening my gate of energy.

325
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:46,623
By the way, you have the habit
of glaring at others.

326
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,958
Keep doing that, and you will get caught.

327
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,253
Can you see the mark
from where you are at?

328
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,714
No.

329
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,593
What about now?

330
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,847
I can see it since I know already.

331
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,975
And now?

332
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,110
I can definitely see it.

333
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,862
But I doubt you will be
this up-close with someone often.

334
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,407
Just be careful when you kiss someone.

335
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,619
Come on. I am just helping you out.

336
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:27,163
Anyone who came that close to me
died in my hands.

337
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,042
You could die tonight.

338
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,628
It is the ghost Sapsali.

339
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,595
If that thing attacks you,

340
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,472
will you turn to stone like that guy?

341
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,517
Run.

342
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:50,729
I will try to save you.

343
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,188
Gwigu's pottery.

344
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,398
It was our family heirloom.

345
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,611
I just wanted to take a look at it.

346
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,781
But what kind of an heirloom
is this fragile?

347
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,199
Jang Uk!

348
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,663
We need to talk. Come here.

349
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,414
Uk.

350
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,584
Uk.

351
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,631
Hey, Uk. Jang Uk!

352
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,428
Uk!

353
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,848
Uk!

354
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,808
Jang Uk!

355
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,768
Darn it!

356
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,062
Uk!

357
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,314
Gather all the pieces

358
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,608
since I will have to
put them back together.

359
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,985
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

360
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,501
Jeez.

361
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,962
That is the work of your young master.

362
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,341
So that is how he saved me.

363
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,509
Gosh, that kid.

364
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,137
Last year, he broke off the engagement
with the Jin family.

365
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,639
This time, he broke their heirloom.

366
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,975
-Engagement?
-Yes.

367
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,061
He called off the wedding with her.

368
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:41,274
He got kicked out 12 times,
broke off a wedding, and now, an heirloom.

369
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:42,817
What a disaster.

370
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,280
What will you do about him?

371
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,365
Where is he?

372
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,284
He got dragged away.

373
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,288
I am afraid he will face
severe punishment this time.

374
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,214
I sent you to Gisan.

375
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,509
Then you were kicked out
in less than six months.

376
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,095
Why did you come here tonight?

377
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,223
I heard you were troubled by the news,
so I came to apologize.

378
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,184
Is this how you apologize?

379
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,689
Why did you break the pottery?

380
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,484
I was fascinated by it
and wanted to take a look,

381
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,736
but it slipped out of my hands.

382
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,364
Had I learned spells,
that would not have happened.

383
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,907
I guess I lack the teachings.

384
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,575
Jang Uk!

385
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,079
He also tampered

386
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,331
with the door of the secret room
and damaged it.

387
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,960
He definitely did that on purpose.
He is just jealous.

388
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,838
I will not let it slide this time around.

389
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,968
Until I say so, I forbid Jang Uk

390
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,721
from moving or talking.

391
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,349
Repent.

392
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,577
Do not worry.

393
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,914
He will not punish him for too long.

394
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,960
He almost died of a cold
after he was punished

395
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,169
all night long one day.

396
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,382
Uk's gate of energy is opened
just enough to keep him alive.

397
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,051
So extreme cold or heat
can be life-threatening.

398
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,053
He cannot recover when he falls ill.

399
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,516
Then open his gate of energy for him.
He desperately wants it.

400
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,852
You are his friends.

401
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,771
We are still too weak to do that.

402
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,566
But no one in Songrim…

403
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:50,278
No. No one in Daeho is allowed to do that.

404
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,619
Then he is already being punished
for his entire lifetime.

405
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,364
You are allowed to have a hot cup of tea.

406
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,036
Young Master.

407
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:43,581
I will go first and leave you behind.

408
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,542
You are leaving without me?

409
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,385
You are loyal and know your duties.

410
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,639
That is why you took me in,
brought me here,

411
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,892
and protected me.

412
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,271
You must know very well
that you cannot tell that to anyone.

413
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,662
I will be safe thanks to you.

414
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,676
The people I have met so far
only wanted me dead.

415
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,846
You are the first person

416
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,849
who tried to save me.

417
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,816
Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,

418
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,985
I will spare you.

419
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,961
I will send a gift of apology to Gisan

420
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,216
and pay the Jin family a hefty sum
for what he did.

421
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,220
Uk made too many mistakes this time.

422
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,473
I had no choice but to punish him.

423
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,391
I am glad you punished him.

424
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,771
Since you have done enough,
I will take him home now.

425
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,689
Sure.

426
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,525
Thank you.

427
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,534
-Are you all right?
-No, I am not.

428
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,747
Did Mu-deok stop by our place?

429
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,333
Why would she?

430
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,879
Speaking of which, where did she go
while you were being punished?

431
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,589
Forget it.

432
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,762
By the way, why did you tamper
with the secret room?

433
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,431
The stone door will not close.

434
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,433
I do not know.

435
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,814
-Why did you break the pottery?
-I do not…

436
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,401
I said I do not know.

437
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,361
Stop asking me.

438
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,373
Here are the firecrackers you wanted.

439
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,500
They will be able to see them
from miles away.

440
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,671
All right.

441
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,633
Why does Young Master Jang want them?

442
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,094
Rumor has it that
he was punished severely.

443
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,679
So what is he scheming this time?

444
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,682
It is a secret.

445
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,351
Do not tell anyone about this, okay?

446
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,396
Ju-wol.

447
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,317
He should lie low for now.

448
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,450
This is Songrim's Spirit Plaque.

449
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,910
Are you free to enter there?

450
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,163
Your young master must really trust you.

451
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,999
This is such a precious item.

452
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,626
He wants me to sell it.

453
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,213
You cannot sell
something like this that easily.

454
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,298
Is that so?

455
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,134
He said I would be able
to sell it somewhere.

456
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,761
But then again,

457
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,222
there is a merchant
who purchases black market goods.

458
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,226
But it will not be easy to hook you up.

459
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,860
You will be getting a hefty sum.

460
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,862
Can I have another chicken?

461
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,531
Sure. I will put it on
your young master's tab.

462
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,533
Eat up. Eat lots.

463
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,087
Naksu's body may be here,
but her soul lives on in another body.

464
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:45,883
You will also be given new bodies
through the alchemy of souls.

465
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:50,346
So do not be afraid
to sacrifice yourselves for me.

466
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,597
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

467
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,660
Fire!

468
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,847
I need my sword.

469
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,974
I have become weak due to shifting souls.

470
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,602
I need my sword's energy
to open your gate of energy.

471
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,313
Even if we meet again
and come this close to each other,

472
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,399
I will spare you.

473
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,656
-I have no appetite.
-Young Master Jang.

474
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,660
Young Master Jang, they caught them.

475
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,913
-Mu-deok?
-Why would anyone catch her?

476
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,041
Never mind.

477
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,835
Jin Mu, the Assistant Gwanju
of Cheonbugwan,

478
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,337
caught Naksu's men who raided Songrim.

479
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:06,964
Really?

480
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,429
Jin Mu brought the bodies
of Naksu's men into the palace.

481
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,639
We were the ones who caught Naksu.

482
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,517
So I am worried
we will become a laughingstock.

483
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,604
Is it true that he spared

484
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,814
none of the men?

485
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,399
He killed them all.

486
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,737
We have no way to track
the source of the alchemy of souls.

487
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,200
Jin Ho-gyeong of Jinyowon is here too.

488
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,457
I heard Jin Mu,
the Assistant Gwanju of Cheonbugwan,

489
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,335
caught the assassins
that Songrim could not.

490
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,172
How did they break
Songrim's barrier twice?

491
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,262
There was a soul shifter spy
inside Songrim.

492
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,641
Thankfully, the Jin family's Gwigu
caught him.

493
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,893
Gwigu?

494
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,853
I would like to see it too.

495
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,231
I am afraid I cannot show you right now.

496
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,150
They made the mistake
of accidentally breaking it.

497
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,487
How could you make such a foolish mistake?

498
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,198
My apologies, Your Majesty.

499
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:19,411
Since Jin Mu made this contribution,
I summoned you all to tell you

500
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,747
that I am considering
promoting him to Gwanju.

501
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,208
That is not right.

502
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,002
Jang Gang is still the current Gwanju.

503
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,089
For he was given the robe
and the sword by the late king,

504
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,049
Jang Gang is the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

505
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,302
Furthermore, he has a son, Jang Uk.

506
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,220
Jang Gang…

507
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,430
has been away for decades

508
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,140
using his training as an excuse.

509
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,269
His son, Jang Uk,
physically cannot learn spells.

510
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,354
Assistant Gwanju Jin Mu has been the one

511
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,606
to fill in for him.

512
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,735
Your Majesty, the dark soul-related spell

513
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,197
is forbidden sorcery among mages.

514
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,408
And Songrim has always been the one

515
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,785
to keep this under control.

516
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,872
Songrim could have gotten to the bottom
of this soul shifter incident

517
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,416
and gotten rid of it all.

518
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,921
But Jin Mu
killed every single one of them.

519
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,508
He actually ruined everything.

520
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,218
Are you unhappy

521
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,888
that Cheonbugwan took the credit?

522
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,099
Songrim was the one who caught Naksu!

523
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,059
And you took credit for it!

524
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:28,314
We are not here to discuss that.

525
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,486
As for the Gwanju position,
we will hold a mage meeting

526
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,573
and make a decision
once Jang Gang returns.

527
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:41,702
Please grant him a different reward.

528
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,457
Jin Mu.

529
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,210
Tell me what you desire.

530
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,007
The people are troubled by this sorcery.

531
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,509
Allow me to burn
Naksu's body in front of Cheonbugwan.

532
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,761
As for Naksu's sword…

533
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,182
Allow us to keep it
since Songrim has lost it once already.

534
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,312
You may do that.

535
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:21,700
The best swords of the mages
have always been stored

536
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,536
in the Sword Room of Jeongjingak.

537
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,082
But things have changed
after that incident.

538
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,710
Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan took Naksu's sword?

539
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,381
Yes. He will burn Naksu's body there too.

540
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,050
She will be there to witness
her body getting burned.

541
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,176
Who?

542
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,177
Naksu?

543
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,138
Do you still think
Naksu has switched souls?

544
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,809
Are you serious
about accepting Naksu as your master?

545
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,103
Forget it.

546
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,355
Pour me some more tea.

547
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,277
You can do that yourself,

548
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,904
lazybones.

549
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,284
Where is your maid, Mu-deok?

550
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:09,456
I will find her.
But first, I need that sword.

551
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,133
Seeing how he got rid
of everything that was mine,

552
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,219
he must think I failed
to switch souls and died.

553
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,640
I cannot look for the Danju
since I do not know who he is.

554
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:38,026
Find the merchant
who is selling a drawn Spirit Plaque,

555
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,528
and you will find me.

556
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,405
I will be waiting.

557
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,596
That is Danhyanggok.

558
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,227
CHEONBUGWAN

559
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,021
I am here for Naksu's sword.

560
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,023
Why would you?

561
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:19,151
I heard His Majesty allowed
Cheonbugwan to keep it.

562
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,738
Since Jang Gang is the Gwanju,
it is right for his family to keep it.

563
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,072
Since your father is not here,

564
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,492
it is only right that
the Assistant Gwanju keeps it.

565
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,540
Since my father is not here,
I, his son, should keep it.

566
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,672
I heard you are searching everywhere
for your master.

567
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,133
I would like to take you in myself.

568
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,512
But I cannot defy your father's commands
since he was my master once.

569
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,266
Why did he close
his own son's gate of energy?

570
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,186
I just cannot fathom it.

571
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,276
The mage's energy
flows through this sword.

572
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,447
Someone as ordinary as you
will not be able to unsheathe it.

573
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,973
Are you afraid I will do it?

574
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,478
If I unsheathe it,
I will be qualified as the next Gwanju.

575
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,439
meaning you will be disqualified
from getting that position.

576
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:45,904
Do not worry.

577
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,073
I cannot unsheathe it for now.

578
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,211
"For now"?

579
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,759
I saw firecrackers
coming from Danhyanggok.

580
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:09,678
Are you sure it was Danhyanggok?

581
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:10,596
Yes, my lord.

582
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,223
They came from the valley,
Naksu's former home.

583
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,870
I am looking for the one
with the Spirit Plaque.

584
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,131
Ma'am, they are here.

585
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:52,679
I guess someone wants to buy it.

586
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,103
The very last room, please.

587
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,819
How could you lose it?

588
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,280
I did not lose it. Someone stole it.

589
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,865
I am certain it was Ae-hyang.

590
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,328
Are you the one who brought this?

591
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,083
I am here to buy the Spirit Plaque.

592
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,460
You have come to the right person.

593
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,511
She is no longer useful.

594
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:34,429
Kill her to avoid further problems.

595
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,776
You know me, right?

596
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,070
I told you to let me know
if someone brought that drawing.

597
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,571
And I did.

598
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,533
She is meeting them upstairs.

599
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,661
So it was Ae-hyang.

600
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,459
We are mages from Cheonbugwan.

601
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,255
We just caught a thief.
You can mind your own business.

602
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,637
He killed her.

603
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,223
He thought it was me.

604
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,588
The Danju has cut me off.

605
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,242
Is that truly you?

606
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,041
-Begin.
-Yes, my lord.

607
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:55,028
Cheonbugwan caught Naksu
when Songrim failed?

608
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,489
Songrim was pretty much humiliated.

609
00:51:57,572 --> 00:52:00,992
The Assistant Gwanju is over there.

610
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,035
You are right.

611
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,220
So the Danju was Jin Mu,

612
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,974
the Assistant Gwanju
of the royal Cheonbugwan.

613
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,113
I am burning.

614
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,952
Just like how my house
and parents burned on that day.

615
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,043
I will give you power.

616
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,837
Will you come with me?

617
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,209
Young Master Jang.

618
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,755
As you can see, there is nothing I can do

619
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,716
but watch my body burn.

620
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,511
There is nothing I can do for you either.

621
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,145
I found your sword.

622
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,988
You said you could retrieve
your power with this.

623
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:12,040
Why are you standing still?
Pick it up and unsheathe it.

624
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:32,519
An excellent blade recognizes its owner.

625
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,365
Now, I just need to receive its energy.

626
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,195
You are too weak to handle

627
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,740
and unsheathe your own sword.

628
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,952
You are just as powerless as me.

629
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,246
We are useless.

630
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:41,087
That is enough. Forget it.

631
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:42,922
Just go.

632
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:52,474
I doubt you will be a threat to Songrim,
and Naksu is already gone.

633
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,935
Just live as Mu-deok.

634
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,484
I would rather die…

635
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,073
than live like this.

636
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,285
Then be my guest.

637
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,422
This is the grave of the Soul Shifters.

638
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,009
The one who taught me this spell

639
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,637
also disposed of their bodies here.

640
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:24,691
So this will be

641
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,944
my grave as well.

642
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,392
Young Master Jang,
how long should we keep this place closed?

643
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,103
I am done now.

644
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,481
What is wrong with Mu-deok?

645
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,232
She seemed out of it.

646
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,696
I am just worried.

647
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,908
She was heading
toward Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

648
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,828
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

649
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,791
I would rather die…

650
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,794
than live like this.

651
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,338
Then be my guest.

652
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,121
Mu-deok!

653
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,164
Mu-deok!

654
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,920
Darn it…

655
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,649
SEJUKWON, SONGRIM

656
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:04,577
You are in Sejukwon.

657
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,330
Master Heo Yeom's infirmary in Songrim.

658
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,417
Thanks to you, I could come here
even though I was once forbidden.

659
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:17,507
Your eyes are probably sore.
I put in some eye drops.

660
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,344
He said the blue marks in your eyes
were like bruises.

661
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,971
These eye drops will lighten their color.

662
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,682
Put them in regularly.

663
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,191
I unsheathed this before.

664
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:38,069
I definitely did.

665
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:39,654
I know. I saw it.

666
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,198
But you are still too weak.

667
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,534
You could only do it
thanks to that lake's energy.

668
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,954
I had regained my power inside that lake.

669
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,873
I should go back there.

670
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,419
Then what?
Will you live underwater like a fish?

671
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:03,010
I felt a surge of energy underwater.

672
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,721
That is how I regained my power.

673
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:06,472
That is it.

674
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,017
Someone who has energy
as powerful as that lake

675
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:13,438
should push out the energy within me.

676
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,357
And who exactly?
Will you be searching for a master too?

677
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,194
Do you think there is anyone
that powerful, to begin with?

678
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:23,239
Even if there was,
would they want to help you?

679
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,075
You are Naksu, an assassin
who shifted her soul.

680
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,496
What?

681
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,166
Uk came to Sejukwon?

682
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,918
He came to treat his maid who was injured.

683
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,670
He barged in.

684
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,880
His maid?

685
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,716
Mu-deok, was it?

686
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,259
How bad were her injuries

687
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,721
that he would come
all the way here himself?

688
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,989
I have only heard of Sejukwon.

689
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,450
It sure is an incredible infirmary.

690
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,453
There are all sorts of medicinal herbs.

691
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,497
And poisonous ones too.

692
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:22,006
I am sure these eye drops
will make your eye color faint.

693
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,633
Lie low and live as Mu-deok.

694
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,010
This is all I can do for you.

695
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,386
You are wrong.

696
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:31,098
I want you to be my Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

697
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,188
You said you risked your life
many times for me.

698
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,149
Do it one more time.

699
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:47,907
It will be pretty painful.

700
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,666
What did you put in here?

701
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,003
One of the poisonous herbs.

702
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,595
I am betting everything on you.

703
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,642
So I hope you will survive.

704
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,410
If you do,

705
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,707
I will be your master.

706
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,176
Uk!

707
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:52,179
What is wrong? Uk!

708
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,347
Uk!

709
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:54,724
What is wrong with him?

710
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:56,475
He ingested poison.

711
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,687
-Poison?
-What poison?

712
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,316
His heart will stop in six hours.

713
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,567
What poison was it?

714
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,069
It will be too late
by the time you find out

715
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,905
and concoct an antidote.

716
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,532
There is only one way to save him.

717
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:12,950
Open his gate of energy

718
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,621
and remove the poison
with both of your energy.

719
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:17,914
-What?
-What?

720
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:21,083
Open his gate of energy.

721
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,294
Or else, he will die.

722
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,758
Yul…

723
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,260
Uk ingested poison.

724
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,346
They say he's going to die.

725
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,265
-What?
-Mu-deok was the one who gave it to him.

726
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,726
But she will not say
what kind of poison it was,

727
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,604
so my uncle is torturing her right now.

728
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,861
What was the poison?

729
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,951
Keep going.

730
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,411
-She could die, my lord.
-Uk is dying.

731
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,832
We must find out what it is
in the next two hours.

732
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,340
Young Master Jang.

733
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:11,300
Young Master Jang…

734
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,595
Open his gate of energy.

735
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,682
That is the only way.

736
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,560
We are running out of time!

737
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,312
Please…

738
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,399
Please save Young Master Jang!

739
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,581
-My lord.
-How is Uk?

740
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,291
Did something happen to him?

741
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,293
Master Heo Yeom removed the poison.

742
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,421
Young Master Jang is safe.

743
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,590
-Did he concoct the antidote?
-No, my lord.

744
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,428
He opened
the young master's gate of energy.

745
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,789
Young Master Jang, are you awake?

746
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,845
Am I alive or dead?

747
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,806
You barely made it out alive.

748
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,433
Master Heo saved you

749
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,811
by opening your gate of energy.

750
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,899
He opened it?

751
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,442
Mu-deok that lunatic

752
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:55,154
would not tell us
what kind of poison you took.

753
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:59,033
So he had no choice
but to do that to remove the poison.

754
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,372
I am betting everything on you.

755
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,168
So I hope you will survive.

756
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,589
Where is Mu-deok?

757
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,734
Mu-deok…

758
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:41,659
Mu-deok!

759
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,170
Mu-deok.

760
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:57,842
Mu-deok.

761
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:03,430
Mu-deok.

762
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,738
Both of us could have died.

763
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:21,740
You are…

764
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,410
You are really crazy.

765
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,081
So you survived…

766
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,209
my pupil.

767
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,758
That is right.

768
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,470
I almost died thanks to you.

769
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,770
My crazy master.

770
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:06,845
Uk has opened his gate of energy
in the end.

771
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:10,724
Since I survived as promised,
I will serve you as my master.

772
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,395
In order to become the best mage,
you must go through several steps.

773
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:16,855
You are worse than what I had expected.

774
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,190
We were looking at Yul.

775
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,566
Mu-deok asked me to come.

776
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,318
That girl, Mu-deok…

777
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,612
She seems to be hiding something.

778
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:25,447
I am in love with you!

779
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:29,535
Young Master!
The prince has come to see you.

780
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:31,829
There is another sword here that
you cannot unsheathe.

781
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,248
It will not bode well for me
if I lose that sword as well.

782
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,165
It cannot be helped.

783
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,167
Whoever wins shall take the sword.

784
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:44,174
