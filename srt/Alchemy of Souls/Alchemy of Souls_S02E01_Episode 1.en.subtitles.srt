ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,448
We have brought the liquor
to be used for Jinyowon's ancestral rites.

3
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,340
You have used different water to make it.

4
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,011
You see, due to the drought
for the past three years,

5
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,263
the well we always used had dried up.

6
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,765
So we had to use a different source.

7
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,023
-Goodness!
-Goodness!

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,652
-No!
-What--

9
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,196
Make them again.

10
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,865
Pardon?

11
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,284
But we have no water.

12
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,121
How could we possibly make any liquor?

13
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,458
Or could you let us use
some of Jinyowon's water, my lady?

14
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,551
He can come inside and get it.

15
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,511
-Yes, my lady.
-Me?

16
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,515
Go.

17
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,269
-Hurry.
-Go.

18
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,616
The young lady has disappeared
from her room again.

19
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,535
Stay right here and wait for me.

20
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,370
Yes, I will.

21
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,088
How beautiful.

22
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,348
Is that liquor?

23
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,356
Here you go.

24
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:04,994
This is of good quality.

25
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,163
It is fragrant.

26
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,207
Do you have more?

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,669
I do have one more bottle.

28
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,796
-Give it to me.
-All right.

29
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,633
My lady!

30
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,594
-Search over there.
-Hurry.

31
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,554
Yes, here you go.

32
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,515
Wait.

33
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,247
How beautiful.

34
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,922
I have never seen
such a beautiful woman before.

35
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,008
I think she is from the Jin family.

36
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:04,012
Young Lady Jin Cho-yeon
is the only daughter they have.

37
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,888
It is Jinyowon, after all.

38
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,057
He was likely possessed by a relic.

39
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,311
They have forbidden outsiders
from entering for three years.

40
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,895
It must be teeming with ghosts.

41
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,110
Whether she was a ghost or not,
I hope I can see her again.

42
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,445
You little…

43
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,531
Do not talk about ghosts
when we are delivering funeral drinks.

44
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:24,782
-Jeez.
-My apologies.

45
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,075
Before we go inside…

46
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,745
This charm will fend off ghosts. Take one.

47
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:29,787
What is this?

48
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,583
This works on soul shifters too.

49
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,878
You remember Naksu, the soul shifter
who devastated Songrim three years ago?

50
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,881
Her petrified body was ground to a powder

51
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,008
and used to make these charms.

52
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,426
-With her petrified body?
-Yes.

53
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,136
That is absurd.

54
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,264
Her body is at the bottom
of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

55
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,432
Jeez.

56
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:53,061
I cannot believe you bought this.
You wasted your money.

57
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,812
Come on!

58
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,023
Trust me on this.

59
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,816
If you see a soul shifter,

60
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,445
show it this charm
that contains Naksu's energy and--

61
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,160
Did you do that?

62
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,126
No!

63
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,671
Wait for me! Do not leave me!

64
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,771
-What is that?
-Darn it!

65
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,617
Is this the deed of a soul shifter?

66
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,579
-Who is that?
-Who is that?

67
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,522
Is he a soul shifter?

68
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,190
Are we going to die?

69
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,775
Stay away!

70
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,944
-Go away.
-Stay away!

71
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,028
-Go away!
-Leave!

72
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,530
-Stay back!
-We should go!

73
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,865
Wait.

74
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,784
He must not be a soul shifter.

75
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,204
What is that?

76
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,165
A charm.

77
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,583
Does that fend off soul shifters?

78
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,086
Where did you get it? Gaema Village?

79
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,297
Yes.

80
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,716
-For how much?
-One silver nyang.

81
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,426
-For three?
-No.

82
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,052
For one. It was three nyang in total.

83
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,638
My lord.

84
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,515
That is expensive.

85
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,101
That village lacks business ethics.

86
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,937
You can get ten for one nyang elsewhere.

87
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,647
Really? Which village?

88
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,608
That is not the point!

89
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,942
Darn it.

90
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,153
You should get your money's worth.

91
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,212
If you want to live,

92
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,506
step aside and duck.

93
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,315
Despite having the ice stone,

94
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,276
can your Tansu skills only make one drop?

95
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,987
Since your body has died already,

96
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,656
you are a soul shifter just like me.

97
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,159
To others,

98
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,619
we are both monsters.

99
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,663
Are you done?

100
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,876
If not, hurry up because that one drop

101
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,378
is going to be quite painful.

102
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,317
You do not deserve to say anything
when you shifted into your son's body.

103
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,722
So you are not a soul shifter

104
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,933
but a mage who kills soul shifters.

105
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,270
Thank you for saving us, my lord.

106
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,273
-Is that a bottle of liquor?
-Yes, my lord.

107
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,746
Goodness.

108
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,540
His father shifted into his body?

109
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,417
Poor boy.

110
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,920
It is true that soul shifters petrify
when they are dead.

111
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,339
My lord.

112
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,174
Then Naksu died and was petrified, right?

113
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,552
I told you, I was right.

114
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,557
These charms were indeed made
with the remains of her petrified body.

115
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,646
This charm will protect us
from monsters like her.

116
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,231
My lord.

117
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,150
Would you like one?

118
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,332
This charm

119
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,461
will protect you from Naksu?

120
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,424
People must think

121
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,469
she is still alive.

122
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,472
Goodness. Naksu is dead, of course.

123
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,266
Despite her body
lying in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

124
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,895
people are still terrified of her.

125
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,074
The men from Songrim
will clean up here soon.

126
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,039
My lord, what is your name?

127
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,085
I think I know who he is.

128
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,796
He is the one who reached Hwansu

129
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:20,424
with the ice stone.

130
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,344
He is that mage.

131
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,262
The one whom Naksu almost killed?

132
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,723
Young Master Jang?

133
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,186
What kind of relationship
did those two have?

134
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,700
This charm will protect us from Naksu.

135
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:49,912
If I keep this with me,

136
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,958
I will not be able to see you
even if you come.

137
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,256
Naksu was a maid of his.

138
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,384
She was also his betrothed.

139
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,763
And in return for his unconditional love,

140
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:51,640
she stabbed him

141
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,895
in the heart with a sword.

142
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,613
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

143
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,287
The energy of the sky
rules the wind, clouds, and rain.

144
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:59,583
This energy reached the ground
and created a huge form of energy.

145
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,711
A country was built around
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

146
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,838
a lake that embodied that energy.

147
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,424
The name of the country was Daeho

148
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,385
due to the enormous lake it had.

149
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,181
This story is about the mages of Daeho,
a place that does not exist

150
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,642
in both history books or maps.

151
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,029
That looks delicious.

152
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,284
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

153
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,697
It must be a soul shifter.

154
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,532
I am terrified.

155
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,879
Did you lose her?

156
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,758
She fled into Jinyowon, of all places.

157
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,846
Jinyowon?

158
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,603
JINYOWON

159
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,731
Outsiders are not allowed
to enter Jinyowon.

160
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,566
I am aware that for the past three years,

161
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,944
Jinyowon has forbidden
outsiders from entering.

162
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,697
But this is an urgent situation.
A soul shifter has hidden inside.

163
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,158
Ask Lady Jin to come and see me.

164
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,243
She will still say no.

165
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,412
He is the leader of Songrim.

166
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,583
How dare a low-ranking priestess
refuse to relay his message?

167
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,628
-My apologies.
-Open the gate this instant!

168
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,037
Young Lady Jin.

169
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,291
I have not seen you for three years.

170
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,086
Have you been well?

171
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,338
I did not come out here
to send my regards.

172
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,676
My mother refuses
to allow outsiders to enter Jinyowon.

173
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,762
So you should go.

174
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,014
It is a dangerous situation.

175
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:04,226
A soul shifter has harmed
dozens of lives at Yeongpo Dock.

176
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,145
The people of Jinyowon could get hurt too.

177
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,646
Just like my father did?

178
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,068
How could you possibly save anyone
when you failed to save

179
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,280
the father of your betrothed?

180
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,535
After what happened,

181
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,874
you never gave me the chance to apologize.

182
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,418
So it laid heavy on my heart.

183
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,711
Then keep feeling guilty.

184
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,630
I hope you never forget it.

185
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,216
Young Lady Jin.

186
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,509
You should go.

187
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,261
Did someone

188
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,306
just enter Jinyowon?

189
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,726
Yes.

190
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,187
I believe it was Jang Uk.

191
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,358
He has been chasing
the soul shifter with us.

192
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,276
Jang Uk?

193
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,988
Are you saying he just stepped inside?

194
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,615
He is only obeying

195
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,993
the order of the royal family
and the Unanimous Assembly.

196
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,497
I shall close the gate.

197
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,250
You should go.

198
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,392
There is no doubt
that Uk will catch the soul shifter.

199
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,227
We can just wait here.

200
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:12,980
Sure.

201
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,157
Jang Uk

202
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,701
is in Jinyowon?

203
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,618
Yes.

204
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,413
He is here to catch
the soul shifter in hiding.

205
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,041
Is Bu-yeon still in the annex
as she was told?

206
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,794
There is a barrier around her room,

207
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,921
so it will be near invisible
to the naked eye.

208
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,633
Jang Uk will never find her.

209
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,853
You must have shifted a long time ago.

210
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,489
What is this?

211
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,823
What is this place?

212
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,784
A prison?

213
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,607
Do not touch that.

214
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,533
Who are you? How did you get in here?

215
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,213
You must be insane.

216
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,340
You seem to be a lousy Jinyowon priestess.

217
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,092
How dare you aim that fire poker at me?

218
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,304
Incredible.

219
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,933
Did you enter this room
after breaking the surrounding barrier?

220
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,019
As a priestess, you must know who I am.

221
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,146
Who are you?

222
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,064
And what is this place?

223
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,650
Is this a prison?

224
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,694
Are you locked in here?

225
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,739
It is not a prison.

226
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,495
I could use this as a step.

227
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,711
Throw this onto the wall too.

228
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,296
What?

229
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,007
Is it too flat?

230
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,718
Then…

231
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,185
Is this better? Or this?

232
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,690
Which one would be better?

233
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,238
You must be locked up here.

234
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,364
Are they no good?

235
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,950
You must be ill.

236
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,077
Would this be better?

237
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,745
Are you leaving?

238
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,831
All right, then take me with you.

239
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,715
You want

240
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:52,926
to leave with me?

241
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:55,512
I have not gone out in ages.

242
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,894
I smell the flowers on your clothing.

243
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,272
The roses must have bloomed already.

244
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,108
Look.

245
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,486
I understand that you are crazy
about going outside.

246
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,780
But I cannot help you.

247
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,408
You can use that instead to go outside.

248
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,493
But that will be exhausting.

249
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,704
-I want to go with you.
-Hey, Lousy Priestess.

250
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,667
Step back unless you want
to end up like that fire poker.

251
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,379
I am not used

252
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,257
to having people stand so close.

253
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,939
That is a pretty stone.

254
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,485
You must have

255
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,030
the energy of the sky.

256
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,034
I guess you are not all that lousy.

257
00:26:59,117 --> 00:26:59,951
You.

258
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,120
Can you see what is inside me?

259
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:03,872
Yes.

260
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,207
I can see the energy of the world.

261
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,627
I have heard of a priestess
who could do that.

262
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,463
So it was you?

263
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,383
Tell me. Who are you?

264
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,887
I cannot reveal who I am
due to a certain reason.

265
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,431
But once you find out who I am,

266
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,601
you will definitely want
to take me out of here.

267
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,067
Where is Jang Uk?

268
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,486
I found traces of
his fight with the soul shifter.

269
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,904
Even near Bu-yeon's annex?

270
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,698
I did not look there due to the barrier.

271
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:41,534
No. That is the most vulnerable place.

272
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,579
It would be terrible
if he ever were to run into her.

273
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,170
Seeing how they even
imprisoned you with a barrier,

274
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,005
I guess you are not simply crazy.

275
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,175
If you get me out of here,
I will tell you who I am.

276
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,260
You will be utterly shocked.

277
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,182
-Forget it.
-Are you not curious about me?

278
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,976
Jinyowon and I have bad blood.

279
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,271
I do not want to let you out
and worsen our relationship even more.

280
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,191
You have bad blood with Jinyowon?

281
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,945
You.

282
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,869
Was this to help you escape?

283
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,373
Well, it is pretty lousy.

284
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,166
It took me three whole days to make that.

285
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,170
Three days?

286
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:39,926
Hey!

287
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,890
If you do not want to take me, fine.

288
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,392
But did you have to do that?

289
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,978
They will suspect me
if you escape soon after I leave.

290
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,730
I want to avoid unnecessary trouble.

291
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,732
It took you three days, right?

292
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,609
So postpone your escape by three days
so it will not affect me.

293
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,534
It will just be an outing, not an escape.

294
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,538
Even if I get out of here,

295
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,416
I have no choice but to return.

296
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,843
Why did they lock up
such an incredible priestess?

297
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,262
What crime are you guilty of?

298
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Being alive.

299
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,101
Existing in this world.

300
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,646
I am guilty

301
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,608
of existing in this world
when I should not.

302
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,529
I am someone who died a long time ago.

303
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:48,578
It must have been Jang Uk's doing.

304
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,624
He must have come very close to the annex.

305
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:09,933
Bu-yeon.

306
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:14,979
Bu-yeon.

307
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,482
Did anyone come in here?

308
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,650
No.

309
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,153
Who else could come in here
except for you and Mother?

310
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,243
What is the matter?

311
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,119
Did something happen?

312
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,081
A soul shifter entered
and hid in Jinyowon.

313
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,209
A mage also entered to catch her

314
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,294
and caused havoc.

315
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,504
A soul shifter?

316
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,465
A monster whose soul
is different from its body?

317
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,009
Yes.

318
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,429
But we killed the soul shifter,
so do not worry.

319
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:06,030
So he was a mage
who came here to kill the soul shifter.

320
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,331
This will be enough to help you escape.

321
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,587
Remember what I said.

322
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,631
Do not tell them about me
and wait before you get out.

323
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,800
I will.

324
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,971
Can you do two more?

325
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,724
I am not as tall as you.

326
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:33,850
Will two suffice?

327
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,686
-You are pretty short.
-Then you will do three?

328
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,397
Thanks.

329
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,816
Jeez.

330
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,696
By the way, why are you helping me?

331
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,907
Why the change of heart?

332
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,951
Because we are guilty of the same crime.

333
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,371
I am also guilty of existing

334
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:57,874
when I should not.

335
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,349
Someone guilty of the same crime…

336
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,912
The roses must have really bloomed.

337
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:59,310
SONGRIM

338
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,441
This soul shifter entered
a cargo boat at Yeongpo Dock

339
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,610
and slaughtered everyone inside.

340
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,863
We are constantly finding
soul shifters running rampant.

341
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,659
And Uk killed them all.

342
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:19,414
That is because everyone agreed
that would be how to make use of Jang Uk,

343
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,417
who was reborn
with the power of the ice stone.

344
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,668
That is not true.

345
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,462
He just complied with that decision.

346
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,506
Are you still

347
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,260
awkward around him?

348
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,305
Yul has returned to Seoho Fortress.

349
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,849
You are the only friend he has.

350
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,227
You should not distance yourself from him.

351
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,397
That is not my intention.

352
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,898
I just

353
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,569
do not know how to act around him.

354
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,657
I cannot laud him by claiming
to envy the great power he holds.

355
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,077
But I cannot empathize with him

356
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,538
and tell him to give up either.

357
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,375
Things are not how they used to be.

358
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,461
Since he used the ice stone's power

359
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,338
to kill this soul shifter,

360
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,259
he will have trouble
sleeping tonight as well.

361
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,302
Oh, dear.

362
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,896
Songrim told me.

363
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,316
Young Master, are you all right?

364
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,277
I am always fine.

365
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,947
Worrying about me
will be the death of you.

366
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,324
I told you not to worry.

367
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,246
Since you used that sword,

368
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,916
you will struggle tonight as well.

369
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,626
I am used to it now.

370
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,920
It is bearable.

371
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,806
Did you heat up his room?

372
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,476
Prepare some strong liquor
and place a brazier inside.

373
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,064
I am too scared to enter his room.

374
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,441
I get goosebumps,
and chills run down my spine

375
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,693
-if I am nearby.
-Goodness.

376
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,822
Light the brazier,
and I will carry it inside.

377
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:16,739
Yes, ma'am.

378
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,103
-Save me.
-Please help me.

379
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,606
I do not want to die.

380
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,693
Give me the ice stone!

381
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,660
Since he used the energy of the sky,

382
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,913
the wraiths swarm toward him
to feed on that power.

383
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,960
They are noisy, cold,
unsightly, and pitiful.

384
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,505
That is the price one must pay
for taking the ice stone

385
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,923
and using the energy of the sky.

386
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
Yeongpo Dock will be closed for now

387
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,112
due to losing many workers
to the soul shifter.

388
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,823
You must deliver the goods
to Wol Fortress by land.

389
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,326
Daegangtongun will be the quickest.

390
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,243
Yes, my lord.

391
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:53,920
Young Master Park finally looks like
the leader of Songrim.

392
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,173
He may not have been
the best at casting spells,

393
00:36:57,256 --> 00:37:00,009
but he is an excellent businessman.

394
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,223
-Young Lady Heo.
-Yes?

395
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,656
Has Young Lady Heo decided not
to return to Wol Fortress?

396
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:25,576
She is tending to the body
that the Queen's soul resides in.

397
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,078
So she cannot leave.

398
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:30,206
Did you say she visited your place again?

399
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,874
Yes, my lord.

400
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,211
She is worried about how
our young master cannot sleep well,

401
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,464
so she always brings him medicine
that she concocts.

402
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:43,052
And has Uk ever thanked her
by offering her some tea?

403
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:48,182
I understand how she feels,
so I try my best to help out.

404
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,059
But it is difficult.

405
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,227
Goodness.

406
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:55,231
I keep telling her to give up on him,

407
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,857
but it is not working.

408
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,484
I will keep trying.

409
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,071
Goodness. By the way,
will you be visiting Park Jin?

410
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,531
-Yes, my lord.
-If you do,

411
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,492
can you please dissuade him

412
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,745
from continuing his new hobby?

413
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,666
All the people of Songrim
have pickled tongues thanks to him.

414
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,167
Pickled tongues?

415
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,794
Our tongues are a mess.

416
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,879
What could he possibly be doing?

417
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,797
Goodness.

418
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,680
My lord.

419
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,016
What are you up to?

420
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,768
Hello, Maidservant Kim.

421
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,936
I am making cubed radish kimchi today.

422
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,230
You are making all of this?

423
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,442
You have no idea
how delighted those in the kitchen are

424
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,028
whenever I give them
new batches of kimchi.

425
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,613
Right.

426
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,823
I did hear that you gave them five crocks

427
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,284
of mustard leaf kimchi
and green onion kimchi last time.

428
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,286
It was not that tiring to make,

429
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,747
and I only did it to kill time.

430
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,793
But they seem
to be waiting for my kimchi now.

431
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,088
I do not think they are
that desperate for the kimchi.

432
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:44,882
There is no need for all this.

433
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,427
They cannot openly ask for more
since they are intimidated by me.

434
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,554
But I am not that dense.

435
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,681
I ought to give them more.

436
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,892
I need more garlic.

437
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:56,685
I will be back.

438
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,484
Gosh, everyone told me to stop him.

439
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,129
I get why Maidservant Park said
this was driving her crazy.

440
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,258
This is too much to throw away.

441
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,009
It will only torment the eater.

442
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,310
I see.

443
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,690
My lord, I need some radish.

444
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,567
Can I use those?

445
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,568
Sure.

446
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,320
But then I will not have enough
to make cubed radish kimchi with.

447
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,448
Come on. This is already enough.

448
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,075
They will appreciate it more
if it is not abundant.

449
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,077
That is true.

450
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,622
-Have a seat.
-Yes, my lord.

451
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,718
Do you feel empty inside
after stepping down from being a leader?

452
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,722
I tend to the field and the flowers.

453
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,308
I also do housework. It is all quite fun.

454
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,282
You have planted many balsam seeds.

455
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,496
Young Master Jang

456
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,081
is still very ill.

457
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,961
I am afraid

458
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,131
I will have to be
by his side this year as well.

459
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,760
I understand.

460
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,179
Three years ago,

461
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,766
you took responsibility
for everything and stepped down.

462
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,769
I did not once dissuade you.

463
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,105
Rather, I brazenly thanked you.

464
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,152
I was only relieved that my young master

465
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,863
was spared.

466
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,869
We have not peeled the garlic yet,
but you are already crying.

467
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,123
We need to peel all of these.

468
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,293
Yes, my lord.

469
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,921
I will peel them all for you.

470
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,300
But the kimchi will be too bitter
if you put them all in.

471
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,594
The bigger the amount,
the tastier it will be.

472
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,351
I need some garlic too,
so let me take half.

473
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,063
Will the kimchi still be tasty?

474
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,356
Half is more than enough.

475
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,691
I see.

476
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,738
Jinyowon is preparing for a wedding?

477
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,366
Do you remember how we placed

478
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,660
Young Lady Jin's wedding supplies
in the storage?

479
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,455
Jinyowon asked for them back today.

480
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,004
Someone must be getting married.

481
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,881
But if someone from the Jin family
is getting married,

482
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,342
it can only mean Young Lady Jin.

483
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,147
The wedding date has been set already?

484
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,524
This is too sudden, Mother.

485
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,444
It was not easy to find a suitor.

486
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,738
She must obey my words.

487
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:38,741
Mother.

488
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,201
Why are you so cruel?

489
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,205
As I expected,

490
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:47,958
is she not Bu-yeon,

491
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,669
but that other woman?

492
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,087
Jin Cho-yeon.

493
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,008
She is Bu-yeon.

494
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,469
The original soul was already dead

495
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,472
when we retrieved the body
from the lake three years ago.

496
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:05,643
That body belongs to my daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon.

497
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,790
Bu-yeon.

498
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,211
Yes, Mother.

499
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,133
I am getting married?

500
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,888
Does that mean I will leave this room?

501
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,264
He will be married into the family.

502
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,266
Once your husband arrives for the wedding,

503
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:51,105
you will continue living in this room.

504
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:56,735
If I cannot get out of here,
why must I get married?

505
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,738
Because we need a girl
who will lead Jinyowon in the future.

506
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,325
Children with the greatest divine powers

507
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,911
always come from the eldest daughters.

508
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,041
Give birth to a beautiful daughter
with great divine powers.

509
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,840
So you expect me to stay
locked up here and just give birth?

510
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:21,802
No.

511
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,054
I do not want that kind of marriage.

512
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,681
It has already been decided.

513
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,766
You just need to follow my orders.

514
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,646
If I get married like you want me to,

515
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,066
I will forever be stuck here.

516
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,445
Bu-yeon.

517
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,823
It took me many years to find you again.

518
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,244
Marry the man I have chosen for you

519
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,830
and stay by my side forever.

520
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:53,959
Mother.

521
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,463
Who will Bu-yeon

522
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,465
get married to?

523
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,884
He is from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress.

524
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,386
He will temporarily stay
at Chwiseonru upon arrival.

525
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:07,514
The wedding will take place
at his uncle's house.

526
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,394
He is excellent husband material.

527
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,594
We will arrive at Daeho Fortress soon.

528
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,554
Has it been three years for you?

529
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,472
Yes.

530
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,935
I did not know
it would take me this long to return.

531
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,728
But Yul,

532
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,691
why did Master Heo forbid you
from returning to Daeho Fortress?

533
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,152
I doubt you caused any kind of trouble.

534
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,404
Did you have bad blood
with someone at Songrim?

535
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,949
He was protecting me.

536
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,161
And I was cowardly enough to listen.

537
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,002
Due to the ongoing drought,
the water level has dropped.

538
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:20,587
Its energy is weak now.

539
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,507
I heard they are planning
to perform a rite for the lake again.

540
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,593
The Unanimous Assembly
will be discussing it.

541
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,719
But to do that,

542
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,932
they will need the help
of Jinyowon's priestesses.

543
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,440
Jang Uk of Songrim

544
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,402
caught and retrieved the soul
of the 29th soul shifter.

545
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,695
Then as usual,

546
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,616
the Crown Prince shall visit him
and reward him with 1,000 gold nyang.

547
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,078
Please allow Cheonbugwan

548
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,498
to deliver them
instead of His Royal Highness from now on.

549
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,041
I decline.

550
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:02,296
I ask that the Crown Prince
reward Uk himself as always.

551
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,810
Jang Uk has been earning
1,000 gold nyang every time.

552
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,980
At this rate, he will be
the richest man in Daeho.

553
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:23,025
If that is the price
for taking all the credit,

554
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,526
then you should do it happily.

555
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,030
The people of Daeho believe
you have ordered Jang Uk

556
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,073
to kill all the monsters.

557
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:33,493
They praise you
for being born under the King's Star.

558
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,704
On the other hand,

559
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,040
they call Uk a monster
who catches other monsters.

560
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,250
They are terrified and avoid him.

561
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,960
He brought that upon himself.

562
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,964
Why is he carrying
Naksu's sword that once killed him?

563
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,091
Some say he is bearing a bitter grudge,

564
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,219
while others say
he is just painfully in love with her.

565
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,808
What do you think, Your Royal Highness?

566
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,143
He is nothing but a lunatic.

567
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,936
He chose to carry her sword

568
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,272
and kill soul shifters
who are just like her.

569
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,649
He feels dark and ominous.

570
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,737
That is how people perceive him as of now.

571
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,365
Is that not what you wanted
in the first place?

572
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,167
He is living the life you wanted for him.

573
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,210
So please visit him,

574
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:27,381
and praise and congratulate
that ominous lunatic yourself.

575
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:55,325
Visiting the now-empty Jeongjingak
always makes me forlorn.

576
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,078
Since every mage except Jang Uk has left,

577
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,206
the energy that fills this place
must be his own.

578
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,792
I heard it is
always dark and cold where he is.

579
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,179
I am here to reward you
for killing the soul shifter.

580
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,265
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

581
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,142
You can leave it and go.

582
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,191
How dare he not accept it in person?

583
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,318
Shall I call him back?

584
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,236
That is fine.

585
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,666
I heard you followed
the soul shifter into Jinyowon.

586
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,420
How did you get in
when they forbade outsiders from entering?

587
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:51,381
No one can stop me from going anywhere.

588
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,676
And I am used to feeling unwelcome.

589
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,390
Is that why you drink alone
in this dark and gloomy place?

590
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,772
Park Dang-gu used to be
so affectionate toward you.

591
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,898
Then again,

592
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,943
I do not blame him.
His wedding fell through because of you.

593
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,321
And Seo Yul is at Seoho Fortress.

594
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,574
I heard all the Jeongjingak mages left
because of you.

595
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,704
You are truly all alone.

596
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,466
I would rather be blunt
than sugarcoat things.

597
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,722
Hey, why do you drink such strong liquor?

598
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,224
My insides are melting.

599
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,142
You should force yourself to have it.

600
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,813
The liquor will protect you
from the chill emitted by wraiths.

601
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:48,730
Wraiths?

602
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,651
But this is Jeongjingak.

603
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:54,945
Did you not hear?

604
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,696
Wraiths follow me everywhere.

605
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,744
What?

606
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,746
But it is broad daylight.

607
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:07,916
That is absurd.

608
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,377
Feel free to leave
if you feel uncomfortable.

609
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,462
You must not have come here
because you missed me.

610
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:16,299
Why do you ask me to reward you every time
if you know how uncomfortable I am?

611
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,218
You do not lack money.

612
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,097
It makes me feel at ease to use this power

613
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,350
only to atone for my sins and be rewarded.

614
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,687
I take credit for punishing
and rewarding you.

615
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,648
I must look like a joke to you.

616
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:37,988
This is what I dislike about you.

617
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:41,116
You look down on me and mock me
for the things I desire and obsess over.

618
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,409
That is what offends me.

619
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,119
And you should be.

620
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,539
That is exactly why I am doing this.

621
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,213
I am too intimidating
to be considered acting out of stupidity.

622
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,592
Yet your ego does not let you accept
that I am acting out of vigor.

623
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,428
I am sure it bothers you.

624
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:08,810
You are right.

625
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,981
You are always as annoying
as a splinter in my finger.

626
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,858
A splinter in your finger?

627
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,819
What a joke.

628
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,781
Did Jin Mu tell you

629
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,868
to think that of me
to make you feel better?

630
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,249
Am I not too strong

631
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,794
and too significant to be a mere splinter?

632
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,344
I understand that you are frustrated,
but you are not the victim here.

633
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,388
That splinter cannot be

634
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,599
more painful

635
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,518
than a sword through my chest.

636
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,327
Well, then.

637
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,287
We will meet again
once I kill the next soul shifter.

638
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,138
Bu-yeon disappeared?

639
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,765
Look at this, my lady.

640
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,309
She must have climbed using this

641
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,228
and escaped through the window.

642
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,356
Why are these on the wall?

643
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,150
How in the world did she do that?

644
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,068
I am not sure.

645
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,115
We must find her before Mother finds out.

646
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,784
She has the tracking bracelet.

647
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,328
It may take some time,
but we will eventually find her.

648
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,597
Last time, they caught me in four hours.

649
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,433
I must meet my betrothed before then.

650
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,436
He is from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress.

651
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,313
He will temporarily stay
at Chwiseonru upon arrival.

652
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,481
Chwiseonru.

653
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,364
A man from the Seo family
who will come from Seoho Fortress?

654
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:27,574
That is right.

655
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,576
I heard he will be staying there.

656
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,287
Yes. We do have reservations.

657
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,832
There are two of them.
Which one of them are you looking for?

658
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:42,714
A man who is excellent husband material.

659
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:44,758
I see.

660
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,801
Then it must be Young Master Seo Yul.

661
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,511
Seo Yul?

662
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,847
Have you never heard of him?

663
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,184
You must not be from Daeho Fortress.

664
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,479
Every woman here knows about him.

665
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,233
I cannot reveal
a guest's information to a stranger.

666
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,825
Can you tell me more in detail?

667
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,459
Check if this is authentic or not.

668
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,252
Yes, my lady.

669
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,214
There are four men

670
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:27,592
at Daeho Fortress
whom all the women want to marry.

671
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,510
First.

672
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,763
The prince who will sit
on the throne one day.

673
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,309
Crown Prince Go Won.

674
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,854
He is single,
but not everyone can marry him.

675
00:56:41,689 --> 00:56:44,526
The next candidate
is from the wealthiest family here.

676
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,945
He is the new leader of Songrim,
Park Dang-gu.

677
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,032
His wedding fell through
at the very last minute.

678
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,450
But that is not a big deal.

679
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,745
The third candidate is Seo Yul.

680
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,126
He is from the most distinguished family
and lacks nothing.

681
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,837
But the catch is that
his hometown is Seoho Fortress.

682
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,005
It is too far away.

683
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,008
And lastly, there is Jang Uk.

684
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:13,513
He is probably
the strongest man in the world right now.

685
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:16,266
But I do not recommend him.

686
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,183
Why not?

687
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:22,021
You should never date a man with a past
as painful as a stab to the heart.

688
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:29,529
So among those men,
you are here to meet Seo Yul, right?

689
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,990
I believe so.

690
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,658
When is he coming?

691
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:36,077
The boat that departed
from Seoho Fortress will arrive soon.

692
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,370
He should be here shortly.

693
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,915
By the way,
what is your relationship with him?

694
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:44,794
You talked about him being a husband.
Are you his betrothed?

695
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,214
I will only make that decision

696
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,551
after we meet and discuss the matter.

697
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,471
Goodness, you are confident.

698
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,974
He is not someone you can have
solely based on good looks.

699
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,268
Which family are you from?

700
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,147
Madam.

701
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,197
It is indeed authentic,

702
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,282
but this is the crest of Jinyowon.

703
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,826
She is offering something from Jinyowon?

704
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:18,912
She must be a thief.

705
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:24,167
My lady.

706
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,461
What is your relationship with Jinyowon?

707
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:29,964
How suspicious.

708
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,468
I must go there
and check if this is really yours.

709
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,263
Get her! Get that thief!

710
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:41,017
Hello, my lord.

711
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,686
-Is Yul here?
-He has not arrived yet.

712
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,501
He will be arriving on a boat.

713
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,170
Probably from over there.

714
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,216
If he lacks nothing,

715
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,802
he must be handsome too.

716
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,103
Excuse me. Are you from the Seo family?

717
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,438
No, I am not.

718
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,856
But I would like to know your name.

719
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,316
Forget it, then.

720
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,842
This boat will depart
for Bisan-dong in the capital.

721
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,886
This boat will depart
for Bisan-dong in the capital.

722
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,496
Have you been well,

723
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,374
Young Master Seo?

724
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,511
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

725
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,644
If my betrothed accepts
my mother's wishes,

726
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,646
I will be locked up there forever.

727
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,067
I must speak with him before I get caught.

728
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:56,694
What should I do?

729
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,705
Look over there.

730
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,208
Is he not Jang Uk?

731
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,210
Yes, the ice stone man.

732
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,295
He is Young Master Jang
from the Jang family.

733
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,269
Is that man over there Jang Uk?

734
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,854
-Yes, he is.
-Yes.

735
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:32,897
Jang Uk.

736
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,484
The fourth candidate.

737
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,914
He is probably
the strongest man in the world right now.

738
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,333
The strongest man?

739
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:22,947
I heard that people avoid you.

740
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,366
So it is true.

741
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,201
You must have successfully escaped.

742
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,829
Right. You said it was just an outing.

743
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,665
Yes, thanks to you.

744
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,172
I smell something delicious.

745
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,678
Can I have one of those?

746
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,602
Never mind. I have no money.

747
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:56,355
Here is your strong liquor, my lord.

748
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:58,858
Excuse me.

749
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,362
I want one of those.

750
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:05,031
Yes, my lord.

751
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,912
Thanks, Jang Uk.

752
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,332
How do you know my name?

753
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,042
I learned it by accident

754
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,169
while searching for my betrothed.

755
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,087
Betrothed?

756
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,048
I will get married soon.

757
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:24,383
He will move into Jinyowon.

758
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:28,346
Even regular priestesses' husbands
move in there?

759
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,806
Of course not.

760
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,225
Only the heir of the Jin family
brings in her husband.

761
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,143
But that is Jin Cho-yeon.

762
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,854
She is the second daughter.

763
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,733
The future leader of Jinyowon

764
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,318
will be me, the eldest daughter.

765
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:44,153
Jin Bu-yeon.

766
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,201
What? You are who?

767
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,080
She died ages ago.

768
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:57,792
I told you already
that I died a long time ago.

769
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,964
I was locked up there
because I should not have existed

770
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,590
in the first place.

771
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,470
My mother wants my future husband
to secretly move in.

772
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,305
She wants me to give birth to an heir.

773
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,643
But if I do get married,
I will be stuck in that room forever.

774
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:18,271
So you are Jin Bu-yeon.

775
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,523
And you want to run away
and not get married?

776
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,277
I cannot flee.

777
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,321
So I wanted to find my betrothed
and ask for his help.

778
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,784
But I just came up with a great idea.

779
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,915
I should find a husband
who suits me instead.

780
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,169
Speaking of which,

781
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,255
Jang Uk.

782
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,758
Will you marry me?

783
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:49,802
What?

784
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,180
I want you to be my husband.

785
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:07,945
There are no mages
who train at Jeongjingak anymore.

786
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,240
There is only Uk.

787
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,951
But he was the reason

788
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:15,536
why everyone left.

789
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,416
I left first.

790
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:24,795
I fled by myself

791
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,299
when you two were struggling the most.

792
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:33,888
I am sorry.

793
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,102
You were struggling too.

794
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:44,482
You knew,

795
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,193
did you not?

796
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:50,655
That she was Naksu.

797
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,493
Yes.

798
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,788
Uk was the first to recognize her.

799
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,417
But I was the first to meet Naksu.

800
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,893
We only met once,
but you want me to marry you?

801
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,270
You must be out of your mind.

802
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:27,274
-I should have never helped you escape.
-I am not out of my mind.

803
01:06:27,858 --> 01:06:30,027
You are strong enough
to go against my mother.

804
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:32,113
And you have bad blood with Jinyowon.

805
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,573
If we get married, she might kick me out.

806
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:36,993
That is exactly what I want.

807
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,415
I cannot believe I ran into
the perfect potential husband.

808
01:06:48,337 --> 01:06:50,339
I cannot believe I ran into
the craziest potential bride

809
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,674
when we only met once.

810
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,218
-So you see me as a potential bride?
-No.

811
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,013
Look me in the eye.

812
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,141
Look at me and reconsider.

813
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,189
Do you not want to wed me?

814
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,190
Why?

815
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,108
Because…

816
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,779
my beauty is unmatched.

817
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:18,826
You are driving me crazy.

818
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:20,745
You cannot deny the fact

819
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,582
that I turn heads wherever I go.

820
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,129
I am sure you can see for yourself.

821
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:31,172
Yes, you are beautiful.

822
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:35,342
I hope you find a better match
with that beauty of yours.

823
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,679
Enjoy the chicken.

824
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:39,764
Jang Uk.

825
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:44,852
You.

826
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,563
Do you think I am a pushover?

827
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:49,523
That is enough.

828
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,284
That looks good.

829
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,912
Enjoy your outing and go home.

830
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,222
Darn it. They will catch me soon.

831
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,851
There is one thing that bothers me.

832
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,980
Seeing how they are
determined to find you,

833
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:13,816
you must not be just some lousy priestess.

834
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:16,735
Are you really Jin Bu-yeon?

835
01:09:17,444 --> 01:09:19,822
Yes. I am her.

836
01:09:19,905 --> 01:09:21,282
She went missing ages ago.

837
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,659
But they found me three years ago.

838
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:25,870
They also found a fake daughter back then.

839
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,415
If I were fake, why would they hide me
for all those years?

840
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:31,542
I am the real Bu-yeon.

841
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:35,004
Then again, I did hear

842
01:09:36,088 --> 01:09:38,174
that Bu-yeon could see energy.

843
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:43,387
And you saw the ice stone within me.

844
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:45,264
That is right.

845
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,892
I am the eldest daughter
with the greatest divine powers.

846
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:50,436
If my looks do not move you,

847
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:51,562
consider my skills.

848
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:54,064
You might need my help one day.

849
01:09:58,319 --> 01:09:59,153
All right.

850
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:02,156
If I ever need your help,

851
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,325
I will find you then.

852
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,082
I will get married
on the full moon of this month.

853
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:15,002
And once I do,
I will never be able to leave that room.

854
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,505
I need a new groom to avoid that fate.

855
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,845
I would like you to come and take me away.

856
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,306
I will be waiting.

857
01:10:28,515 --> 01:10:30,559
Please come for me.

858
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:43,989
Jang Uk.

859
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:48,327
Everyone seems to avoid you.

860
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,121
Just get married while you still can.

861
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,666
I am willing to marry you.

862
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,253
Forget it.

863
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,847
There you are.

864
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,140
Let us go.

865
01:11:21,026 --> 01:11:22,528
Have you been well, my lord?

866
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,822
I am no longer the leader of Songrim.

867
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,157
Dang-gu is the leader now.

868
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,076
Come on.

869
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,244
Uncle.

870
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,621
I feel uneasy
whenever someone calls me that.

871
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:34,623
Can you take the position again

872
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:36,500
and let me just assist you?

873
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,626
Forget it.

874
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,587
I have become so carefree.

875
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,800
What do you do these days?

876
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:48,554
I farm and do housework.

877
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:50,889
Yul,

878
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:56,353
I have prepared a grand feast
just for you.

879
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,357
Did you do the cooking, Uncle?

880
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,026
He should have a taste too.

881
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,486
Yul, you can look forward to it.

882
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:17,916
He is right. I cannot be the only victim.

883
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,085
You should have a taste as well.

884
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:24,631
Here comes another victim.

885
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,187
You are back.

886
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,485
Yes, I am back.

887
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:18,435
I dug out this deodeok myself,
added a bit of red pepper paste,

888
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:21,105
and charbroiled it.

889
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:23,357
Is it not fragrant?

890
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,945
This was deodeok?

891
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:31,782
I did not know.

892
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:37,204
Yul must have a dull palate.

893
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:40,207
Right? Try savoring it.

894
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,338
It has a strange smell.

895
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:52,928
I truly appreciate your thoughtfulness.

896
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,472
But I cannot eat this anymore.

897
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,893
I understand.

898
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,521
It may not be to your liking.

899
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:03,439
-Right.
-Right.

900
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,859
Dang-gu and Uk can have the rest.

901
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,293
I am delighted to see you three

902
01:14:24,376 --> 01:14:25,878
sitting before me once again.

903
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:28,464
Cheers.

904
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:41,393
-Eat up.
-Eat up.

905
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:48,150
Park Dang-gu of Songrim is aware

906
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,527
that we are preparing for a wedding?

907
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:52,112
Yes, my lady.

908
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,823
I heard that he kept asking
who the bride was.

909
01:14:58,702 --> 01:15:00,454
Since he does not know about Bu-yeon,

910
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,915
we should tell him it is me.

911
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,925
I loved you, Jin Cho-yeon.

912
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,429
I hope you will be happy!

913
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:23,101
I miss you so much…

914
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,021
I will tuck him in.

915
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:26,939
-Sure.
-Jin Cho-yeon…

916
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,400
-I loved you, Jin Cho-yeon.
-Bye.

917
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:34,905
I loved you so much…

918
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,198
That poor kid.

919
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,742
Seeing how drunk he is,

920
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:43,330
Sang-ho must have been right
about a wedding happening in Jinyowon.

921
01:15:47,167 --> 01:15:50,128
There really is a wedding
taking place in Jinyowon?

922
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,881
I heard they brought in wedding supplies.

923
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:56,718
They locked their gate
and lay low for the past three years.

924
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:01,139
I guess the wedding
will be held in secret as well.

925
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,979
Do you know who the bride is?

926
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,230
Jin Cho-yeon, probably.

927
01:16:09,314 --> 01:16:12,234
She is the only daughter of the family.

928
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,404
There is also the eldest daughter.

929
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,531
But she is dead.

930
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:21,535
She was trying to retrieve
the ice stone that was sealed in the lake

931
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:23,287
when the waters swept her away.

932
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,788
Her father came clean

933
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,708
about everything before he died.

934
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,795
Her death was such a waste.

935
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:35,173
With the divine powers
she had at such a young age,

936
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:39,011
she would have grown to be
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran,

937
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:41,054
the first leader of Jinyowon.

938
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:44,683
If a priestess

939
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,936
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran exists,

940
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,316
will she be able
to extract the ice stone within me?

941
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,651
If she can,

942
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:56,945
would you extract it?

943
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:06,872
You are only alive thanks to that stone.

944
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:08,457
You said the ice stone

945
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:12,085
should be destroyed
since no human can control its power.

946
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:14,421
Yes.

947
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,465
You are right.

948
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,134
It is too much for me…

949
01:17:21,386 --> 01:17:22,220
to handle.

950
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:29,227
Maidservant Kim told me

951
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:33,899
that it was too painful to watch you live

952
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,984
with a wounded heart.

953
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:38,945
Is it still very painful?

954
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,866
I should have died then.

955
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,160
As a human,

956
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:48,705
I should have died then and there.

957
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,041
Do you think removing the ice stone

958
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:55,295
would heal your wounded heart?

959
01:18:01,468 --> 01:18:04,346
But if you do that,

960
01:18:05,972 --> 01:18:06,890
you will die.

961
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,603
At least…

962
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:17,693
I will lift the weight off my shoulders
and finally be at peace.

963
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:27,763
Uncle Yun-o,

964
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,014
you are getting married?

965
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,892
You never told me.

966
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,062
It was meant to be a secret,
so I could not tell you.

967
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,485
I will be wedding the eldest daughter
of Jinyowon, Jin Bu-yeon.

968
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:52,245
It is our tradition to have
the wedding at the groom's place

969
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:55,040
and then return to Jinyowon with him.

970
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:04,841
What is that?

971
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:07,260
A petal?

972
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,222
It came to me
when I was at my most desperate.

973
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:14,351
I hope it will return.

974
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:21,024
I know you hate it,
but you should not run away again.

975
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:23,819
I know.

976
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:25,737
I am waiting.

977
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:28,824
Waiting? For whom?

978
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:32,452
My groom.

979
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:38,416
Please come and take me away.

980
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:07,654
The bride has left Jinyowon

981
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,447
and will be here soon.

982
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:14,828
Is he the one Bu-yeon will wed tonight?

983
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:15,745
Yes.

984
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,456
He is the cousin
of General Seo of Seoho Fortress

985
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,541
and the Queen.

986
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,334
He lost his parents early

987
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:23,295
and has no one to rely on.

988
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,590
He needs our help,

989
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:29,718
so I can be assured that he will do well.

990
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:34,973
He will not be able

991
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,268
to free my sister.

992
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:57,078
I guess he will not come.

993
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:35,343
I knew it.

994
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,387
I knew you would come.

995
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:39,973
You might be of some use.

996
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:42,183
I told you I would be useful.

997
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,275
Let us go.

998
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:51,192
Sure.

999
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:57,949
Let us go, my dear husband.

1000
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:07,310
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1001
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:10,271
You see, I remember nothing
before Jinyowon.

1002
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:13,274
Search all of Songrim
and find Park Dang-gu.

1003
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,568
I thought the wedding ceremony
was for Young Lady Jin.

1004
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:19,197
Although I wanted to ruin the ceremony,
I did not.

1005
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,115
WHOEVER FINDS THIS LADY
WILL BE REWARDED GENEROUSLY

1006
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:22,826
The entire world ended up
finding out about Bu-yeon.

1007
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:26,329
Were you going to ask her
to take out the ice stone for you?

1008
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:29,999
Have we ever met before?

1009
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:33,753
What is it that you need me for?

1010
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:37,340
I just need your great divine powers.
That is why I need you.

1011
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:42,679
