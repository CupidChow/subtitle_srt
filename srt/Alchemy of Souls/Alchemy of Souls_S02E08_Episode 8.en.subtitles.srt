00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,961
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,601
Uk and Bu-yeon have promised
to go their separate ways.

3
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,606
I heard there was
no physical intimacy between them,

4
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,734
so it will be easier to part ways.

5
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,528
It is a relief that they were not
in a deep relationship.

6
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:11,738
But I remember

7
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,949
the two of them
drinking together at night.

8
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,787
They both clearly told me that
their relationship was pure and innocent,

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,539
for nothing ever happened between them.

10
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,936
Just now,

11
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,897
I felt the energy within you.

12
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,524
The ice stone?

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,984
Yes.

14
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,987
What a powerful energy.

15
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,657
Do you really think I will be able
to control this and take it out?

16
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:39,868
I have always wanted to stop,

17
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,288
but right now, I do not.

18
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,208
Do not ever think that again.

19
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,921
Although, even if you do,

20
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,883
I will never grant it to you.

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,804
I am sorry.

22
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:00,722
And…

23
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,349
thank you.

24
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,617
Since we have stopped, let us think
about how to deal with this situation.

25
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,827
Why are you turning the light on?

26
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,203
Turn it back off.

27
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,507
If we want to be together,
we must retract the promise.

28
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,636
The promise was made, after all.

29
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,431
Lord Park was there as well
when I made that promise,

30
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,934
which also makes it a promise
between Songrim and Jinyowon.

31
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,646
That promise saved Seo Yul's life,
so it was worth it.

32
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,773
I will ask the leader
for his understanding

33
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,734
and have your mother agree
to retract the promise we made.

34
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,236
Have her agree to it?

35
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,029
Do you plan to threaten my mother?

36
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,740
I will convince her
just like anybody would.

37
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,248
"I promise to be a good man."

38
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,375
"Please allow me to marry your daughter."

39
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,752
Sounds convincing.

40
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:16,798
Try convincing me too.

41
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,510
No, we need to take care
of the situation first.

42
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,886
If we get distracted again,

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,930
it will not be easy to keep our heads.

44
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,848
All right.

45
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,351
Let us save it for later
and focus on taking care of things.

46
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,023
You have met my mother
without me a few times, right?

47
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,400
How was she then?

48
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,116
What have you done?

49
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,368
Perhaps you happen
to enjoy things like that?

50
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,204
Being locked up in a dark room
and getting poked by needles?

51
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,462
-I should not have mentioned the needles.
-Needles? What do you mean?

52
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,839
No, it is nothing.

53
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,258
I shall comply with her
even if she pokes me with needles.

54
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,845
Leaving you to deal with this
may not be the best idea.

55
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,806
I should go home as promised.

56
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,057
You are going to leave?

57
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,561
If I do not go,
it will be troublesome for Lord Park,

58
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,565
and my mother will only hate you more.

59
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,484
First, I shall go home
and put her at ease.

60
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,570
Then I will try talking to her.

61
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,281
All right, you do that.

62
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,868
I will also discuss it with Lord Park
and come up with a solution.

63
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,339
Naksu's soul will disappear
from her body soon.

64
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,550
Once the soul of Jin Bu-yeon,
the true owner of that body, awakens,

65
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,637
Naksu's soul will disappear.

66
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,570
Where is Young Master Seo?

67
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,113
He woke up and is well.

68
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,158
He left to meet Lord Park.

69
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,076
Goodbye.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,168
I guess he went to tell him directly

71
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,629
what he had written in the letter.

72
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,882
Does that mean everyone will find out
that the woman with Young Master Jang

73
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,885
is Naksu?

74
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,311
Jang Uk, I want you
to sleep at home from now on.

75
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,979
-Do not sleep here.
-All right.

76
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,524
And tell Maidservant Kim
that I will be back soon.

77
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,691
I will.

78
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,529
I bought honey biscuits
and left them in my room.

79
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,446
Go and eat them.

80
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,989
-Honey biscuits?
-Yes.

81
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,659
I heard they were your favorite,
so I bought some every time I went out.

82
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,410
-How much did you buy?
-A lot.

83
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,955
You might fall down. Walk facing forward.

84
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,500
We will be apart for a while.
I want to look at you every chance I get.

85
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,379
There is not a single place
where I cannot go,

86
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,841
but I do not want your mother
to hate me even more,

87
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,925
so you should hold on.

88
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,011
You should secretly visit.

89
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,763
Climb over the wall
like Seo Yul did last time.

90
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,349
Look at you,
excitedly asking me to break in.

91
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,271
By the way,

92
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,815
how did you find the entrance
to where I was locked up?

93
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,693
That door is hard to find.

94
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,278
Door?

95
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,281
What is this?

96
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,366
It just opened

97
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,076
as if someone had left it open.

98
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,328
It just opened?

99
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,875
It is likely that I broke it
while fighting the soul shifter.

100
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,418
That might be why the barrier broke.

101
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,211
I see.

102
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,507
Then what did you think of me
when we first met?

103
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,094
I found you unusual

104
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,763
and suspicious for being locked up
in a room like that.

105
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,433
I liked you from the start.

106
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,437
I knew the moment I saw you.

107
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,230
You are my husband.

108
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,412
I knew the moment I saw you.

109
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,415
You are my master.

110
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,680
You once felt the same way.

111
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,016
The blue marks

112
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,102
bloomed in her eyes like flowers.

113
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:45,858
I do not care

114
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,819
that you did not recognize me
when we first met.

115
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:52,615
This time…

116
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,953
I recognized you first.

117
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,173
Let us go.

118
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,684
You should still be resting.
What was it that could not wait?

119
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,519
There is something I feel responsible for.

120
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,772
Is it something that I also need to hear?

121
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,482
What is it?

122
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,985
It is about Uk and Jin Bu-yeon.

123
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,530
Goodness, Yul is unbelievable.

124
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,783
Grandfather.

125
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,453
Did Young Master Seo tell you something?

126
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,666
He talked about Jin Bu-yeon.

127
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,377
He said he wishes
to take full responsibility.

128
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,382
The promise with Lady Jin
was made to save my life,

129
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,801
so I will visit her
and make sure it is retracted.

130
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,683
Was that all he said?

131
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,603
Did he say anything else
about Jin Bu-yeon?

132
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,729
Yun-ok.

133
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,689
I have told you time and again

134
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,109
to take your mind off anything
and everything that involves Jang Uk.

135
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,320
Do not even be curious about him.

136
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,829
He did not tell them about Naksu?

137
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,667
Even after he had planned
to get rid of her at Danhyanggok?

138
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,254
Cho-yeon left by herself?

139
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,007
Yes, Young Master Seo asked her
to leave without you.

140
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,344
Seo Yul?

141
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,554
How do you think

142
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,891
Yul is going to convince Lady Jin?

143
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,267
I do not know.

144
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,855
He just said that
my mother would wait if I told her

145
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,359
that Seo Yul will visit her soon
to talk about what he knows.

146
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,655
He is not one to speak rashly,

147
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,865
so his plan is one that will work.

148
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,661
Shall I ask him
to convince your mother about us too?

149
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,579
Our situation is not the same.

150
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,206
She utterly detests Jang Uk,

151
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,793
but she does not dislike you.

152
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:11,837
But…

153
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,757
why does she disapprove of Uk so much?

154
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,471
Because it agonizes her
to see the person she hates…

155
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,849
be so happy.

156
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,105
Yul is going to meet Lady Jin

157
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,857
and try to convince her
to retract the promise.

158
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,401
Yul is truly amazing.

159
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,653
He is helping his friend
as soon as he wakes up.

160
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,407
So I told him,
"Uk has already made up his mind."

161
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,326
"Do not get involved
and just focus on recovering."

162
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,703
And I stopped him.

163
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,749
Why would you stop him
from helping out a friend?

164
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,419
You told me that
you were going to give up.

165
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,674
-My lord.
-That is what he said.

166
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,884
If Young Master Seo helps,

167
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,262
are you willing to try
and convince Lady Jin?

168
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,101
I took her daughter from her
without even asking for permission,

169
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,061
so I understand her anger.

170
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,314
I will do what I can
to get rid of her hatred.

171
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,201
I heard the news.

172
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,454
Thank you for helping.

173
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,415
I am merely taking responsibility.

174
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,000
You genuinely helped us.

175
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,919
You may have noticed
from what I said last time,

176
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,255
but there was no room for me in his heart.

177
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,592
But now I get to stay by his side.

178
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,260
Is it not great?

179
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,558
I am not sure.

180
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,895
You will cause each other pain.

181
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,732
Why would you say that?

182
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,193
We are all friends, are we not?

183
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,363
Friends?

184
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,701
If you knew what I had planned
to do at Danhyanggok…

185
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,288
you would not smile and call me a friend.

186
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,125
You look unhappy.

187
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,754
Is it because it still hurts?

188
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,256
Yes.

189
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,466
It hurts.

190
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,595
Perhaps it is because I woke up
from a horrible dream.

191
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,764
Did you have a bad dream?

192
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,643
There is someone I have cherished
for a very long time…

193
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,271
and I dreamt of disappearing with her.

194
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,736
But when I woke up, it turns out…

195
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,573
that I will remain and she will disappear.

196
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,120
I feel both angry and disheartened.

197
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,916
But most importantly,
my heart aches for her…

198
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,836
and it agonizes and saddens me.

199
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,177
I cherish all the memories
I had in Danhyanggok.

200
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,641
Have we…

201
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,229
ever met before at Danhyanggok?

202
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,652
You wanted to go there
to find your true identity.

203
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,739
Go and find out who you really are.

204
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,492
Then you will realize what it was
that I had planned to do at Danhyanggok

205
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,537
and why you and Uk will only end up

206
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,707
causing each other pain.

207
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,044
No, I do not wish to.

208
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,964
I will not go
if that is what is waiting for me.

209
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,384
If I cannot be with Jang Uk
because of the truth…

210
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,012
I do not wish to find out.

211
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,017
You may not wish to find out…

212
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,063
but you will.

213
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,273
You asked me

214
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,735
to turn a blind eye
even though you were dying.

215
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,030
I ask the same of you.

216
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,323
Please turn a blind eye.

217
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,712
Your foolish friend will give you time.

218
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,131
But if you ever need me…

219
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,092
you can come and find me.

220
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,458
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

221
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,336
I heard the news.

222
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,338
I am very happy for you.

223
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:06,757
Thank you.

224
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,968
Young Master Jang even asked Lord Park

225
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,054
to help him convince your mother
to change her mind.

226
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,597
He did?

227
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,516
I knew things would turn out this way.

228
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,437
I am glad that it was you
who ended up with him.

229
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,981
Do you really think…

230
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,318
it will be all right for me
to stay by his side?

231
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,611
Of course.

232
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,824
Now all that is left for us to do
is to prepare for the wedding.

233
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,620
Young Master Jang
is meeting someone from the palace.

234
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,414
We should head home first.

235
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,582
-All right.
-Come on.

236
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,590
His Majesty the King
will be summoning you today.

237
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,051
But before that,
the Crown Prince wishes to see you.

238
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,432
Inside this chest is an item
that belongs to His Royal Highness.

239
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,727
If you happen to have the same item,
he wants you to bring it with you.

240
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,064
He has ordered that you open it
when no one is around you.

241
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:22,082
This is the Gold Plaque
that the King left behind for his son.

242
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,667
What is he playing at?

243
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,802
Is that the King's Star?

244
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,598
He is a dangerous star
who can take your place whenever he wants.

245
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,310
Your Royal Highness.

246
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,771
I just visited Jang Uk.

247
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,522
Good.

248
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,277
As for the turtle,
I could not find it anywhere.

249
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,487
Someone must have discarded it.

250
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,868
Lord Dang-gu gave orders
to hold a funeral,

251
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:01,497
but this lad insisted that
you come to see her first.

252
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,334
She wanted to make sure
that you were all right.

253
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,379
I am sure she is happy to see you well.

254
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,595
-What is that?
-Well…

255
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,974
It was something she cherished dearly.

256
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,978
I do not understand why.
She never even used that when it rained.

257
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,036
Does she not have a family member
who can hold her funeral?

258
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,580
No.

259
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,208
She said the world she knew
was filled with filth and darkness.

260
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,961
But she said you made the world
seem clean and bright.

261
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,133
Find her a place
where it is warm with lots of sunlight.

262
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,344
I will also attend the funeral.

263
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,638
Yes, Young Master.

264
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,776
I thought those memories came from this.

265
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,862
But was I wrong?

266
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,447
What is going on?

267
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:21,952
You will realize why you and Uk
will only end up causing each other pain.

268
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,581
Will I be able to find out
if I go to Danhyanggok?

269
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,042
Young Lady Bu-yeon.

270
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,044
Young Master Jang is here.

271
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:38,969
Jang Uk.

272
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:41,763
Hey.

273
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,393
I have to go to the palace immediately.
It will not take long.

274
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:47,978
All right.

275
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,567
I need to get changed.

276
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,736
Are you going to keep staring?

277
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,657
No, now is not the time
to turn the light off.

278
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,874
Did you get that scar
from getting stabbed by that sword?

279
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,546
Yes.

280
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,759
So that was the moment

281
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,595
that you were dying to know

282
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,015
how she felt.

283
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,938
Everyone says she did it
to avenge her family's death.

284
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,983
But I just could not know

285
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,568
if she truly did not

286
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,946
go easy on me.

287
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:41,782
It is a sad…

288
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,993
and terrible wound.

289
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,378
I do not wish to see
the memory of that moment.

290
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,256
Do you

291
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,675
still see her memories?

292
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,220
I just do not wish to see
someone else's memories.

293
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,347
They are hers, not mine.

294
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,307
You said seeing that tree in Danhyanggok

295
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,559
might help you remember who you are.

296
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,270
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No.

297
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,897
I think I was confused about that too.

298
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:14,940
We do not need to go.

299
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,819
You should get changed and go.

300
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,615
All right. Wait for me here.

301
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,161
Yes, I will be waiting.

302
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,999
What is going on?

303
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,584
You were feeling elated earlier,

304
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,629
but you seem a little down.

305
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,134
It is just hard to believe
that you told me to wait.

306
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,261
You either always told me to leave

307
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,848
or just never came back.

308
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,733
Wait here. Do not go anywhere.

309
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:00,944
All right.

310
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,532
I will quickly be back by your side.

311
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,087
I promised you…

312
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,758
that I will always be by your side.

313
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,021
You were looking for Young Master Seo.
Did you see him?

314
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,147
I saw him leave earlier.

315
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,440
No, it is fine.

316
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,275
I will take care of it myself.

317
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,700
-Here it is.
-What is that medicine for?

318
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,080
It is used to examine corpses

319
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,623
to reveal hidden scars.

320
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,502
A soul shifter's blue mark is like a scar,
so applying this will reveal it.

321
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,962
What do you plan to do with it?

322
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,009
She said she did not want to find out…

323
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,223
so I plan to show her.

324
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,436
I saved your life,

325
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,730
and you come here
to threaten me with her secret?

326
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,441
If it sounds like a threat, then so be it.

327
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,903
Do not try to keep Naksu
locked up in Jinyowon.

328
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,697
Are you telling me
to let her stay with Jang Uk?

329
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,366
If that is what she wants,

330
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,826
then I will help her do that.

331
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,077
Then that leaves me

332
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,123
no reason to keep Naksu alive.

333
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,916
You must stop thinking of it that way

334
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,460
if you want your daughter, Jin Bu-yeon,

335
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,130
to return to you safe and sound.

336
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:44,548
What?

337
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,135
Bu-yeon will return?

338
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,470
What do you mean?

339
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,347
Naksu's soul will disappear soon,

340
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,392
and Jin Bu-yeon will take over the body.

341
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,019
That is what Master Lee told me.

342
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,940
He told me Bu-yeon's soul
did not remain in that body.

343
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,902
Then has he been
deceiving me all this time?

344
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,612
Ask him yourself.

345
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,407
Just let her

346
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,201
stay where she wants

347
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,787
with the person she wishes to be with

348
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,665
for a while.

349
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,043
This is both a threat…

350
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,631
and a plea.

351
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,240
Why are you empty-handed?

352
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,075
Why did you not bring what I asked?

353
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,702
You also have this.

354
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,121
I did not bring it,
as it did not seem necessary.

355
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,789
I guess that means

356
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,542
you really do possess it.

357
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,045
The fact that you know I possess it

358
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:08,089
means you also know
how I came into this world.

359
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,805
If you do not intend
to fight me over the Gold Plaque,

360
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,058
go to North Fortress, Jang Uk.

361
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,354
I will hide behind Jin Mu like you said,

362
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,397
and I order you to go far away.

363
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,240
I, Jang Uk of the Jang family,

364
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,283
will abide by the royal order
and leave for North Fortress.

365
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,369
Thank you for honoring my command.

366
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:38,787
Do not waste any more time

367
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,914
and prepare to leave in a few days.

368
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,756
I planned to threaten Park Jin of Songrim
to put pressure on Jang Uk.

369
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,592
I am surprised
that you made him succumb to you

370
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:54,636
by revealing the existence
of the Gold Plaque.

371
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,267
I realized something
as I stood against him recently.

372
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,520
Jang Uk does not fight for personal gain,

373
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,022
but to protect those around him.

374
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,067
So if I challenged him
with the Gold Plaque,

375
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:14,406
I figured he would back down
to protect his loved ones.

376
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,286
Park Jin of Songrim
also did not do anything to me

377
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,329
to protect Jang Uk.

378
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,459
They are restrained by justice
and fail to do what is necessary.

379
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,753
It is a sign of weakness.

380
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,510
I see.

381
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:39,848
Gwanju.

382
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,393
Ever since a few days ago,
I cannot seem to find my turtle.

383
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,983
That insignificant and weak animal
does not suit you, Your Royal Highness.

384
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,486
Do not allow yourself
to cling to something so trivial.

385
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,406
Did you get rid of it

386
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,909
to prevent me from doing so?

387
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,204
Do you wish to find it again?

388
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,377
No.

389
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,881
I just think it is a shame
because I was told it had good energy.

390
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,259
The peacock in the garden
also holds good energy.

391
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,305
They are nothing but animals
that merely exist to please the eye.

392
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,061
Understood.

393
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,495
So have you agreed
to go to North Fortress?

394
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,456
Yes, I have decided to go.

395
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,209
It concerns me

396
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,003
that they might be sending you away
as part of a scheme.

397
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,255
The Crown Prince showed me his Gold Plaque

398
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,883
and asked if I was willing to fight.

399
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,012
If I decide to engage in this fight,

400
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,225
will you stand behind me
like you did last time?

401
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,685
What exactly is your target in this fight?

402
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,356
What is it that you wish to protect?

403
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,235
Are you acting in careful deliberation?

404
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,321
Yes, I know where I am targeting,

405
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,366
and I have decided to accept this fight

406
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,576
in order to protect what I must.

407
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,667
What brings you here?

408
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,293
Young Lady Heo wishes to meet you.

409
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,796
At Sejukwon?

410
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,005
No.

411
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,842
She wishes to meet
where Young Master Jang frequently visits.

412
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,640
We received another message
from Seoho Fortress.

413
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,934
Your father is very worried about you.

414
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,438
I will write him a letter.

415
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,480
Right.

416
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,358
We should have asked Lord Park
to take the letter

417
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,319
that was inside your luggage
when he visited Seoho Fortress.

418
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,072
You saw the letter that was in my luggage?

419
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,075
Yes, Young Lady Heo took it.

420
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,583
Where is Young Lady Heo?

421
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,796
Why did you ask me to meet you here?

422
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,008
I heard this graveyard

423
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,846
was built by Young Master Jang
after he started killing soul shifters.

424
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:29,601
Then there should also be a grave
for Naksu, the one who killed him.

425
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,230
That must be it.

426
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,485
You said you have
no recollection of who you are, right?

427
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,153
Are you not curious?

428
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,613
Why do you care?

429
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,864
Because I am curious too.

430
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,118
So I came to confirm something.

431
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,164
What is that?

432
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,291
I am a physician.

433
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,418
I would never do anything to harm anyone.

434
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,504
I am merely trying

435
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,422
to satisfy our curiosity.

436
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,974
-There should be a blue mark here.
-What are you doing?

437
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,990
-Young Master Seo.
-What do you think you are doing?

438
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,535
Are you all right?

439
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,702
I am all right.

440
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,955
Why did you splash that on me?

441
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,082
-Because you are a soul shifter--
-Enough.

442
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,669
If you are doing this
because of my letter, just stop.

443
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,671
I will explain everything.

444
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,595
Young Lady Bu-yeon, you should hurry
and wash off the medicine.

445
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,596
All right.

446
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,940
Did you read my letter?

447
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,817
I did.

448
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,194
If everything in that letter is true,

449
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,029
why are you letting her be?

450
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:07,115
She is Naksu, is she not?

451
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,426
The blue marks

452
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,970
bloomed in her eyes like flowers.

453
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:42,859
Am I…

454
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,779
her?

455
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,282
That woman…

456
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,285
hurt Young Master Jang very deeply.

457
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,371
I could not let her stay beside him
only to see him get hurt again.

458
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,789
So I wanted to show her who she is

459
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,917
and make her leave.

460
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,922
You do not need to let her know.

461
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,216
Her soul will soon disappear.

462
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,263
I just wanted…

463
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,101
to let her stay like this
for a bit longer.

464
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,336
You have poisoned me again,

465
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,799
crazy master.

466
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,799
It is that tree.

467
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,013
I have been here before.

468
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:36,681
Do you wish to go up there?

469
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:39,767
Fine.

470
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:43,563
I will take you to the top of that tree.

471
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:47,942
I knew the moment I saw you.

472
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,235
My crazy master.

473
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,281
I do not need a pupil
who does not improve.

474
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,491
Just die if you are not
going to do anything.

475
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,827
Master!

476
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,579
You are my master.

477
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,249
Master, I finally did it.

478
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,959
They are bird's eggs.

479
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,419
I also missed you.

480
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,630
I like you a lot.

481
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,424
Just one.

482
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,927
I will hold your hand as if it is a ring.

483
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,101
They were all my memories.

484
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,690
I was the owner of the blue jade.

485
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,027
I was his master,

486
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,489
Naksu.

487
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,518
You must be Jin Bu-yeon,
the owner of this body.

488
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,770
I see you have finally realized

489
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,022
who you really are.

490
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,108
What a shame.

491
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,777
If you found out
after I retrieved all of my divine powers,

492
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,447
you would have been able to leave
with no sadness.

493
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,494
Thanks to you,
my body stayed whole without running wild,

494
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,622
and I have regained
most of my divine powers.

495
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,542
You will soon have to leave this body,

496
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,961
for it is not your own.

497
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,514
Someone from Sejukwon came to see her?

498
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,515
Yes.

499
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,809
Does that mean she went to Sejukwon?

500
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,437
No, I offered to take her there
if that was where she was headed.

501
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,273
But she said she was going somewhere else.

502
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,525
All right, you can go.

503
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,493
Where did she go? She said she would wait.

504
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,503
It is not here.

505
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,425
That jade makes things
even more confusing.

506
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,469
Seeing that tree for myself
will help me find out who I really am.

507
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,430
I wonder if she actually went there.

508
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,682
She said she did not wish to go.

509
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,152
This is where they first met each other.

510
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,237
He proposed to her here as well.

511
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,141
Young Master Seo.

512
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,518
Is something the matter
with Young Lady Bu-yeon?

513
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,900
Send someone to Uk's place
and tell them that she is here.

514
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,216
Here you are.

515
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,845
I waited but you did not come.

516
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,473
I almost went to Danhyanggok
to look for you.

517
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,643
I went there.

518
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,188
And now…

519
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,818
I found out who I am.

520
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,546
Does that mean you regained your memory?

521
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,382
Yes.

522
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,474
Then why did you come here
instead of coming home?

523
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,810
I came looking for you
because you did not come.

524
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,730
I am sorry. I know I said I would wait.

525
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,608
But…

526
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,986
I can no longer wait for you.

527
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,823
I remembered something very important.

528
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,744
Let me make myself clear.

529
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,539
I do not know what kind of person
you remember yourself to be.

530
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,833
But I do not care.

531
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,421
Whatever those memories are,

532
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,799
-they do not matter to me.
-They matter to me.

533
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
Among the many things I remember…

534
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,644
there was a man I deeply cared for.

535
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,773
You really have a way

536
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:23,444
of surprising me
when it is least expected.

537
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,697
-What is your point?
-But you see…

538
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,535
he does not recognize me,
even if I am in front of him.

539
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,413
Is that so?

540
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,087
Then why not tell him that it is you?

541
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:43,839
I cannot.

542
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,219
I hurt him too gravely.

543
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,847
I cannot tell him it is me…

544
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,434
or go near him.

545
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,399
I feel too guilty to stay with you.

546
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,566
I shall go to Jinyowon.

547
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,693
No, wait.

548
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,656
You are just going to leave?

549
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,825
You left after you said you would wait,

550
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,202
and now you are leaving me
because you remember someone else?

551
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,788
Then am I supposed to act fine

552
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,957
and wish you good luck with him?

553
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,376
No, wait.

554
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:24,130
You said you cannot be with him
and he does not recognize you.

555
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,677
I really…

556
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,598
liked him a lot.

557
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,065
I liked him more than he liked me.

558
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,987
But I never had a chance to tell him.

559
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,254
Jang Uk.

560
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,341
Turn the light back on.

561
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,469
Keep your head straight.

562
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,596
Keep your promise and let me go.

563
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,445
I am sorry.

564
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:50,591
Mother.

565
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,301
Bu-yeon came home.

566
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:54,803
Bu-yeon?

567
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,452
Mother.

568
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,871
I have returned home

569
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,666
as promised.

570
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,300
Young Lady Bu-yeon went back to Jinyowon?

571
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,053
Why? She said she was going to stay.

572
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,847
I heard Lady Jin is not doing so well.

573
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,474
Did she leave because she was worried?

574
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,893
She wants to stay there for now.

575
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,103
Do not worry.

576
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,020
I see.

577
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,900
I wonder if Lady Jin
is in a severe condition.

578
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,986
We prepared your room for you.

579
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,737
Why do you wish to stay here?

580
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,282
This place is more familiar to me.

581
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,243
Besides, I do not wish to see anyone.

582
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,787
Do not worry about me.

583
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,095
I heard you will be
heading to North Fortress.

584
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,555
Yes.

585
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,684
I have discussed it with the leader,
so do not be concerned.

586
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,686
All right.

587
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,480
Did you tell Young Lady Bu-yeon?

588
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,732
No.

589
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,318
I should have told her,

590
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:35,863
but I did not get a chance to.

591
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,338
I knew the moment I saw you.

592
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,382
You are my master.

593
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,985
I knew the moment I saw you.

594
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:16,945
You are my husband.

595
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,539
Jang Uk of the Jang family

596
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,000
will be appointed
as the general of North Fortress.

597
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,759
Seo Gyeong, who possessed
the power of Hwansu,

598
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,304
moved to Seoho Fortress to prevent himself
from becoming a threat to the royal family

599
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,098
and thus achieved unity.

600
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,058
Jang Uk's transfer to North Fortress

601
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:49,103
will bring the same kind
of peace and stability to Daeho Fortress.

602
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,899
I shall protect Daeho Fortress
with the help of Cheonbugwan.

603
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,652
We will soon begin to prepare
for the lake's rite to pray for rain.

604
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,530
Jang Uk, you shall travel north
and wait for the black clouds

605
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,073
that will bring energy to the world.

606
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,617
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

607
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,285
I hear you are married.

608
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,454
Will your wife be joining you?

609
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:12,626
The place is far and rough,
so she will not be coming with me.

610
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,213
She will be lonely here without you.

611
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,716
You have a long road ahead of you.
Travel safely.

612
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,677
Yes, Your Majesty.

613
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,231
Naksu's soul will disappear soon,

614
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,692
and Jin Bu-yeon will take over the body.

615
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,112
That is what Master Lee told me.

616
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,823
Did Naksu's soul disappear

617
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,576
just like he said it would?

618
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,710
No.

619
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,006
He said Bu-yeon would return
if that happened.

620
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,051
But that is not yet my daughter, Bu-yeon.

621
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,355
If he leaves for North Fortress…

622
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,902
I will never get to see him again.

623
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,362
Shall I try calling for her?

624
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,822
But what if she does not come?

625
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,161
There was a man I deeply cared for.

626
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,456
Who could it be?

627
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,166
Who could he be?

628
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,919
Three years have passed
since she lost her memory.

629
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,088
How could she still have
such strong feelings for him?

630
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,466
I liked him more than he liked me.

631
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,218
I guess it is possible

632
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,221
if she liked him a lot more.

633
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:51,683
But still, how could she dump me
in less than a day?

634
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,269
Am I more insignificant
than a brazier on a summer day?

635
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,941
She has a cold heart.

636
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,740
Turn the light back on.

637
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,785
You totally deceived me.

638
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:10,911
You should have

639
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:14,164
remembered everything
before I fell for you.

640
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,416
How am I supposed
to turn the light back on now?

641
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:18,961
I miss her like crazy

642
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,381
even after what she said.

643
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,094
I have informed Young Lady Bu-yeon
of your arrival.

644
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,084
Bu-yeon is aware

645
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,253
that you are leaving
for North Fortress tomorrow.

646
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,548
She wishes you a safe trip.

647
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,841
Tell her that I will visit

648
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,385
once I return.

649
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,237
What is going on?

650
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,157
Jang Uk is clinging to her.

651
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,868
Does that mean Bu-yeon is rejecting him?

652
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,887
You asked me to visit secretly

653
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,639
by climbing over the wall.

654
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,643
I took your advice to heart.

655
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,562
I should have destroyed this place
the last time I came.

656
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,023
Why are you back in this room?

657
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,150
Because I prefer it here.

658
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,779
It gives me space to think.

659
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,531
I thought you were leaving.

660
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,367
Why did you come back?

661
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,993
You stood there watching me leave,

662
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,287
so I came to say goodbye.

663
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,083
I heard you are traveling far away.

664
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,210
Goodbye.

665
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:24,878
"Goodbye"?

666
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,215
I usually have no problem leaving people.

667
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,426
But I was so dumbfounded
that I had to ask.

668
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,552
I get it.

669
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,473
He may feel more dear to you
now that you got your memory back.

670
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,391
But then,

671
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,268
why did you fall for me at first sight?

672
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,437
I want to ask if I look similar to him,

673
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,398
but that also feels inappropriate to ask.

674
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,440
Do not ask.

675
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,360
I cannot tell you anything.

676
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,361
Do we really look alike?

677
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,363
Did you fall for me

678
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:53,073
because I looked just like him?

679
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,366
Let us say that happened.

680
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,951
I liked you because you looked like him,

681
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:57,994
and you liked me
because you were confused.

682
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,874
Let us leave it at that.

683
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,751
I cannot do that!

684
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,629
I thought about it over and over again.

685
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:11,633
The reason I wanted you to stay
was not that I was confused or crazy.

686
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:13,635
I just…

687
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,391
I just like you that much.

688
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,314
I had buried my memories,

689
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,651
but you took them out
and helped me face them.

690
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,863
You held my hand
when I never thought I could.

691
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,781
You helped me sleep when I could not.

692
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,699
And for that…

693
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,869
I cannot stop anymore.

694
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,998
So I will be the brazier on a summer day.

695
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,253
This time, I will be the one waiting…

696
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,758
until you begin to miss me.

697
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,431
I will go now.

698
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,226
I will return sooner than expected.

699
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,936
Stay well.

700
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,146
Are you leaving now?

701
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,189
Yes.

702
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:51,525
The last mage of Jeongjingak is leaving.

703
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,153
That place is going to be
completely empty now.

704
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,404
This does not feel right.

705
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,282
I shall go to North Fortress with you.

706
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,909
I cannot let you go there alone.

707
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,328
Then what about me?

708
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,581
Aunt, you should stay beside my uncle.

709
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,043
Did you meet Young Lady Bu-yeon?

710
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,962
Did she not offer to go with you?

711
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,172
I thought she would insist on going.

712
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,966
She had her reasons.

713
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,428
Is Master Lee not here?
I wanted to see him before I left.

714
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:24,766
He stayed at Sejukwon
for a few days to treat Yul,

715
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,061
but he must have left again,
seeing he is no longer there.

716
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,604
I see.

717
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,863
Should we not tell Uk about Naksu?

718
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,449
I wanted to tell him,
but Lady Jin was against it.

719
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,620
Now that Naksu's soul
is going to disappear,

720
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:48,498
it makes me think that
he may be better off not knowing.

721
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:49,916
If he finds out…

722
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,879
it will be agonizing for both of them.

723
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:58,717
Jang Uk will agonize over something bigger
than the pain of losing a loved one.

724
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,511
He possesses the power of Hwansu.

725
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:05,473
If he wants, he can get rid of
Jin Bu-yeon's soul from that body

726
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,100
and keep Naksu's soul.

727
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:10,103
That is forbidden sorcery,
just like the alchemy of souls.

728
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,689
That is why it will be agonizing.

729
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,860
He will not be able to save her
even though he has the power to.

730
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,656
Jang Uk will agonize
over having to make a choice

731
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:26,369
that no ordinary human
would ever have to make.

732
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:05,784
It looks like Uk and Jin Bu-yeon
are having problems.

733
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,328
According to Young Lady Jin,

734
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,705
Uk went to see her sister,
but she refused to meet him.

735
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:14,793
Do you think Uk did not tell her
about going to North Fortress?

736
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,514
You are a sacred animal
with a rare kind of energy.

737
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,934
A turtle that possesses
the energy of the Black Tortoise.

738
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,688
They say the Black Tortoise
guides those who are lost

739
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,148
and leads them in the right direction.

740
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:51,788
I see you are heading over
to help someone find their way.

741
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,462
Will Cheonbugwan be starting
to make preparations for the lake's rite?

742
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,466
Will your secret organization
be getting involved as well?

743
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,303
I will soon introduce you
to the secret organization.

744
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,391
You promised to make me
as powerful as Jang Uk.

745
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:15,061
Tell me if you need my help
in achieving that goal.

746
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,188
I shall wholly support you.

747
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,195
-What is that?
-What happened?

748
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,698
-Goodness.
-They look like birds.

749
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,743
-What in the world are they?
-What are those things?

750
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,244
Are they birds?

751
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,497
What are they doing
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

752
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,210
Hundreds of the same kind of earthenware
were found all over the lake.

753
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,422
They must have drifted to shore

754
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,924
after being discarded
during an attempt to smuggle them in.

755
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,634
They are just bird-shaped earthenware,

756
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,678
but they give off an ominous feeling.

757
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,598
Now that people have seen them
in Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

758
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,391
it will cause an uproar.

759
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:58,063
No matter how bad the drought gets,
it will not dry up Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

760
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,522
What are you talking about?

761
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,524
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho once dried up

762
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:05,361
during the burning drought
that occurred 200 years ago.

763
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,156
-I am telling you.
-Goodness, you are right.

764
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,033
-Be careful!
-What are you doing?

765
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,868
-Why would you touch that?
-Goodness.

766
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,329
-My goodness.
-What is that?

767
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,624
The capital is in an uproar
thanks to the earthenware

768
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,292
that I discarded into the lake.

769
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,754
Everyone is worried that
Lake Gyeongcheondaeho will dry up.

770
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,800
That is good to hear.

771
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,845
Dissent among the people
will cause the Unanimous Assembly

772
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,056
to actively take part
in the rite for the lake.

773
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,850
Songrim will strengthen their guard.

774
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:39,521
It will become more difficult to bring in
the earthenware from the volcano.

775
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,403
They will be used for the rite?

776
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,826
Bring them in with the gifts for the King
that get imported from the volcano.

777
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:56,621
Then Songrim will not
be able to do anything about it.

778
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,335
We need to place them
throughout the canals before the rite.

779
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,881
Will you allow me to do that,
Your Royal Highness?

780
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,843
I will inform the men of the Night Watch
who guard the city at night.

781
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,469
You may use them.

782
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,472
With their help, it will be an easy task.

783
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,729
Will these also be used
to dry up the world?

784
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,233
They just exist
to help the one that is real.

785
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,484
And that is

786
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,446
the fire bird that lives inside Jinyowon.

787
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,198
If we want that, we must gain control

788
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,826
of Jinyowon with the help
of the Unanimous assembly.

789
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,797
I asked you to come to discuss something

790
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,008
before attending
tomorrow's Unanimous Assembly.

791
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,552
You wished to discuss something with me?

792
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:55,138
The priestess who will be
dancing for the rite

793
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,807
will be picked from another family.

794
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:58,975
What?

795
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,686
The dance for the lake's rite

796
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,314
has been the job
of a Jinyowon priestess for centuries.

797
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:06,149
Why would you pick a priestess
from another family?

798
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,235
There is no one in Jinyowon
who possesses the divine powers

799
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,488
to dance for the lake's rite.

800
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,740
I am capable, and so are my two daughters.

801
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:14,824
Ho-gyeong.

802
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,411
I am merely here to give you notice.

803
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,748
The mages of the Unanimous Assembly
have already made up their minds.

804
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,167
If you continue
to feed your ego like this,

805
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,711
you will only end up
embarrassing yourself.

806
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,926
You will be the one embarrassing yourself.

807
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,345
Jinyowon will not provide you

808
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:40,308
with any of its artifacts
to help you hold the lake's rite.

809
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,728
The royal family and Unanimous Assembly
stand on my side.

810
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,855
You will eventually have to give in.

811
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,483
Did you forget that Jinyowon owns a plaque

812
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,152
that gives us the power
to reject the King's orders?

813
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,087
Bu-yeon.

814
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,463
Is it not suffocating here?

815
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,007
I am going to meet Young Master Park.

816
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:15,093
You should also get some air.

817
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,511
Mother is not home right now.

818
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:19,764
I am fine.

819
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:20,974
My lady.

820
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,768
Lady Jin asked you
to urgently come to Cheonbugwan

821
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,436
with the Jinyowon Plaque.

822
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,396
Now?

823
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:32,110
Right this moment?

824
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,113
She had a dispute with Jin Mu,
the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

825
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,531
You should hurry over.

826
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,451
-Did you say Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan?
-Yes.

827
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,666
Then I will go instead.

828
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:47,667
You?

829
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,295
I am the eldest daughter.

830
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,966
The Jinyowon Plaque
is a very valuable item.

831
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,051
If I let you take it,

832
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,970
I could get scolded by Mother.

833
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,223
Are you going to be the heir of Jinyowon?

834
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,184
Then you will have to marry a man
who is willing to move in.

835
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,812
But you cannot marry Park Dang-gu
since he is the leader of Songrim.

836
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,400
I will go.

837
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,527
All right.

838
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:16,654
You can go instead, Bu-yeon.

839
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,791
Among the many things I remember,

840
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:30,960
Jin Mu is one of them.

841
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,100
The man who trained me to be an assassin,

842
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:48,645
used me, and killed me.

843
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,189
And now,

844
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,316
I will be meeting him.

845
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,445
The Jinyowon Plaque will arrive soon.

846
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,280
Your trusted plaque of Jinyowon

847
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:02,158
will also be taken away tomorrow
by the Unanimous Assembly.

848
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:03,242
For what good reason?

849
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:07,705
You put Jinyowon in grave danger
for personal reasons.

850
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:12,710
He says it is not something
that can be overlooked.

851
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,088
-Who in the world--
-I said that.

852
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:31,604
You made a personal promise with Songrim
and allowed them

853
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:34,482
to disturb the fire bird's barrier
inside Jinyowon.

854
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,485
I was there when it happened.

855
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,698
But you helped in that matter,
Your Royal Highness.

856
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:45,702
The truth is that you allowed them
to meddle with the barrier.

857
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,954
And a spell was used inside Jinyowon,

858
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,957
which could have woken
the relics and artifacts there.

859
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:52,750
That is why

860
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,212
I stood outside Jinyowon
to prevent that from happening.

861
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,465
I used my divine powers
to keep everything safe.

862
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:01,467
Ho-gyeong.

863
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,345
Your hair has started to turn gray.

864
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,975
Your divine powers have weakened
and are no longer like they were before.

865
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,644
That is the main reason
why we are withdrawing the plaque.

866
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,622
What are you doing here?

867
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:36,127
Did you get kicked out?

868
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,426
Now that the plaque is on its way,
you can just leave it here.

869
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,345
As your brother, I do not wish

870
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,932
to see you embarrass yourself
in front of the Unanimous Assembly

871
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:55,146
by trying to prove your strength
when we all know that you have weakened.

872
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:07,158
People from Jinyowon are here.

873
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,875
Bu-yeon, why are you…

874
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:27,345
Hello, I am Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

875
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,972
I see you came
instead of your sister, Jin Cho-yeon.

876
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:34,393
Mother, here is the plaque you asked for.

877
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:51,786
Thank you for bringing it here.

878
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:55,373
Now leave the plaque and go home.

879
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:57,333
Why should we leave it here?

880
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:00,503
It is the Jin family's most valuable item.

881
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,923
Your mother has acknowledged the fact
that no one in your family

882
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,425
is capable of protecting the plaque.

883
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,053
Ho-gyeong.

884
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,097
Put down the plaque.

885
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:16,519
My duty as the leader of Jinyowon

886
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,063
is to protect this with my life.

887
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,276
What can I do
to make you change your mind?

888
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,112
I do not recall standing like that

889
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:30,116
the last time I went to you
to beg for my life.

890
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,930
What if I prove it to you?

891
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,521
I, the heir of Jinyowon,

892
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,858
will prove that I am capable
of keeping it safe.

893
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,945
I heard you lost your memory
due to a severe illness.

894
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:11,032
They say you once possessed divine powers

895
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,284
as great as Jin Seol-ran's,

896
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,162
but you lost them with your memories.

897
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:20,416
Both my divine powers and memories
have started to come back.

898
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:21,918
Is that so?

899
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:27,214
Then allow me to test your divine powers.

900
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,591
Fine.

901
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,969
What do you wish for me to show you?

902
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:43,064
This prison in Cheonbugwan
holds those who once performed sorcery.

903
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:47,401
Behind that door is a prison named Gwido.

904
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:49,278
The door that leads to Gwido

905
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:53,115
was created by Jin Seol-ran,
the first leader of Jinyowon,

906
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,867
so you must know it well, Ho-gyeong.

907
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:57,870
Once you enter,

908
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,873
you can never escape this prison,
even as a ghost.

909
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,625
What do you think you are doing?

910
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:05,586
Is that where you are
going to send Bu-yeon?

911
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,254
I am not going to lock her up.

912
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,508
A long time ago, Bu-yeon managed to find

913
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:14,011
the ice stone that was sealed
inside Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

914
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,141
I will throw the plaque inside Gwido.

915
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:22,979
If she successfully
brings it back in a day…

916
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,609
then I shall acknowledge
your divine powers

917
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:30,903
and cancel tomorrow's Unanimous Assembly.

918
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:37,118
I will go in.

919
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:38,995
No.

920
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,831
The wraiths of those
who performed sorcery live inside Gwido.

921
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:43,666
Those wraiths could kill you.

922
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,501
Then do you plan to surrender Jinyowon?

923
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,512
Have faith in
your daughter's divine powers.

924
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,766
I promise

925
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,060
that I will bring it back.

926
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,110
Making her go inside Gwido
is too dangerous.

927
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:14,405
A mage from the Choi family
also died there 200 years ago.

928
01:07:14,488 --> 01:07:18,868
What will you do if a Jinyowon priestess
also dies in there?

929
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,706
That kind of thought
is also a sign of weakness.

930
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,133
Find the plaque before the sun goes down.

931
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,679
What is that?

932
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,977
I found it on my way here.

933
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,444
The animal possesses good energy,
so I would like to take it with me.

934
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,614
Go ahead.

935
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,244
I thought it was a prison.

936
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,788
I had no idea it would be this vast.

937
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,125
How am I going to find
that small plaque here?

938
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,963
What if it fell into the sea?

939
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:30,262
Are you all right?

940
01:12:37,978 --> 01:12:38,812
Jang Uk?

941
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,439
What are you doing here alone?

942
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:44,151
How are you here?

943
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:45,903
More importantly…

944
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:48,989
what is that?

945
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:51,950
What?

946
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,372
Those marks in your eyes.

947
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:01,001
You…

948
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:04,088
Who are you?

949
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,790
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

950
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:42,042
Keep it in mind.
Only I am allowed to come this close.

951
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,920
Did you perhaps hear the sound of bells
during that time?

952
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,715
We will live in a world
where the strong gain greater power

953
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:52,010
and continue to rule forever!

954
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,430
All of them will have to be
eradicated for this to end.

955
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,266
I will likely meet my end
in this place as well.

956
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:01,562
The world they wish to see
will never come.

957
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,522
Is this not the kind of world you wanted?

958
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,732
Take a close look at what it is like

959
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:08,819
for someone with strength
to gain and wield even greater power.

960
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:15,868
