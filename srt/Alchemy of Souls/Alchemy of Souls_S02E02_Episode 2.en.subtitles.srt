00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:44,961
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:58,808
She is nowhere to be found.

3
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,188
-Bu-yeon's boat is the only one missing?
-Yes.

4
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,151
Does that mean someone
purposely kidnapped the bride?

5
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,614
Who would do such a thing?

6
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,785
Let us go.

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,120
Sure.

8
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,141
I am very happy that you came.

9
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,399
What are you doing?

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,984
Are you not going to carry me?

11
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,488
-Can you not walk?
-Of course, I can.

12
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,240
But people will come looking for me.

13
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,535
It would be much faster to cast a spell
and run with me in your arms.

14
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,453
If that is what you are worried about,

15
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,082
do not worry and just walk.

16
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,715
You are the strongest man in Daeho.

17
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,009
Carrying me would be
a piece of cake for you.

18
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,972
I do not want to waste my energy.

19
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,723
Besides, you do not look that light.

20
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,393
That is because I am wearing layers.

21
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,270
It is difficult to walk with this.

22
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,524
Then…

23
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,735
-take it off.
-Here?

24
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,028
Yes, take it off.

25
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,407
I mean…

26
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,910
this does seem
like a pretty deserted place.

27
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,040
I get that you are impatient,
but doing it here seems inappropriate.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,293
Do you not think so?

29
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,214
After all, this is
our first night together.

30
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,217
Unbelievable. Listen.

31
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,970
I was telling you
to take off that impractical robe.

32
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,054
Why in the world…

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,641
-would I want to do anything here?
-Right?

34
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,809
I apologize.

35
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,104
I am just really anxious.
I must have gotten ahead of myself.

36
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,690
Hey, wait.

37
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,401
Do not worry.
I am only taking off this robe.

38
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:19,616
Are you sure you were not locked up
because you hurt your head?

39
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,367
No, but I was ill.

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,370
I was on the verge of death,

41
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,081
but my mother found me and treated me.

42
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,000
Why were you ill?

43
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,420
To be frank,
I do not know what it was myself.

44
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,464
Once I regained consciousness,

45
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,175
I was already a lot better.

46
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,637
How could you not know?

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,431
You may not remember anything
from when you were unconscious,

48
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,099
but what about before that?

49
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,977
Was it because you got hurt,
or was it an illness?

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,480
You see,

51
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,483
I remember nothing before Jinyowon.

52
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,860
I lost all my memories when I was ill.

53
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,073
My condition is the reason

54
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,617
why my mother kept me a secret…

55
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,745
and hidden from everyone.

56
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,844
No one knows of Bu-yeon's existence.

57
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,680
Who could have taken her?

58
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,432
Park Dang-gu of Songrim

59
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,102
knew about Jinyowon's wedding ceremony.

60
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,771
Perhaps he thought it was my wedding

61
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,899
and stole the boat carrying the bride,
hoping to ruin the ceremony.

62
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,909
The person from Jinyowon getting married

63
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,203
is Jin Bu-yeon, not Jin Cho-yeon?

64
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,247
Yes.

65
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,916
She and my Uncle Yun-o,
who came with me from Seoho Fortress,

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,252
are having the wedding ceremony in secret.

67
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,048
I am only telling you
because you will not stop crying.

68
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,220
Here.

69
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,347
Thank you.

70
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,063
Thank goodness it is not Cho-yeon.

71
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,065
But wait a minute.

72
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,402
Jin Bu-yeon is actually alive?

73
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,113
Have you met her?

74
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,240
-What is she like?
-I have not met her yet.

75
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,661
Uncle Yun-o said he would
introduce her to me after the wedding.

76
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,247
I guess I will know once I meet her.

77
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,255
I was told Jin Bu-yeon was blind,
but you are not.

78
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,298
That is also strange.

79
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,800
Apparently, I was when I was little,

80
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,761
but my sight came back after I recovered.

81
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,929
I remember none of that, though.

82
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,701
-What?
-You do not have it.

83
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,663
I do not have what?

84
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,499
The blue mark of a soul shifter.

85
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,419
The energy sometimes enters the eyes
and enables a blind person to see.

86
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,713
But I guess that was not the case.

87
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,216
I thought they were found
on the left shoulder.

88
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,176
Some have them in their eyes?

89
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,594
Yes.

90
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,013
I have never heard of such a thing.

91
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,390
I am the only one who has seen it.

92
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,728
That makes sense since you are a mage
who hunts down soul shifters.

93
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,855
You must have killed
the infamous soul shifter as well.

94
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,614
What is it? Did you fail to catch her?

95
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,618
-She died.
-"She died"?

96
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,704
Was it not you who killed her?

97
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,335
I guess not.

98
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,046
Did you know her? Were you close?

99
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,589
You ask too many questions.

100
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,760
I told you my story,
so I just wanted to hear yours.

101
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,804
I know I picked you
to be my husband on a whim,

102
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,056
but I would like to get to know you.

103
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,225
You could not stop praising me
when you wanted me,

104
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,936
but are you getting picky
now that I am here?

105
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,480
I just want to know more about you.
Is that so bad?

106
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,942
So you can leave me
if you find me insufficient?

107
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,236
I thought you wanted someone

108
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,613
who could defy your mother
and help you escape.

109
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,908
If it is a loving husband
you are looking for

110
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,578
instead of a means to escape,
then let us say goodbye now.

111
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,706
I will send you back on the boat
to where you were.

112
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,129
No way.

113
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,673
As long as you free me
from that sickening cell,

114
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,718
I will stay with you no matter what.

115
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,179
You can be a thug for all I care.

116
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,932
Fortunately, I am not that bad.

117
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,893
I will still be reasonable. Do not worry.

118
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,352
But…

119
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,730
Why did you come for me?

120
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,149
You obviously are not smitten with me,

121
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,026
and you do not seem to pity me either.

122
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,448
What is it that you need me for?

123
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,663
You told me that

124
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,999
you could see the energy inside me.

125
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,251
What you are seeing

126
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,045
is the ice stone.

127
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,549
Ice stone?

128
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,052
Long ago, Jin Bu-yeon found the ice stone

129
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,763
that was lying at the bottom
of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

130
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,058
-Me?
-You do not need to remember.

131
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,185
I just need your great divine powers.

132
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,937
That is why I need you.

133
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,780
My divine powers?

134
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,016
It is the ice stone.

135
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,102
He possesses the ice stone.

136
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,479
They say Jang Uk is

137
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,814
always followed by wraiths and grotesques.

138
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,402
That must be why every time I meet him,
it sends a shiver down my spine.

139
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,739
Then do not listen to Master Lee
and stop visiting him.

140
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,825
He still bothers me, though.

141
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,078
I get curious
about how he is doing as well.

142
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,748
Jang Uk cannot use that power
for his own personal use.

143
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,084
If he ever does,

144
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,211
Park Jin will have to give up his life.

145
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,421
He gave his word to the royal family
and Unanimous Assembly

146
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,590
as he stepped down
from the leader position.

147
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,303
And I have you to thank
for helping me keep Jang Uk

148
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,223
in the palm of my hand.

149
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,726
I am grateful for your acknowledgment.

150
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,814
Just think of Jang Uk as a tool

151
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,358
that helps you utilize
the energy of the sky.

152
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,744
Did Jin Mu tell you

153
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,247
to think that of me
to make you feel better?

154
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,506
Uncle Yun-o.

155
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,467
Were you not supposed
to get married tonight?

156
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,803
I could not.

157
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,304
Someone stole my bride.

158
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,434
Park Dang-gu,
the newly appointed leader of Songrim,

159
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,104
thought I was marrying Jin Cho-yeon
and kidnapped the bride.

160
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,567
I…

161
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,653
did what?

162
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,870
I am here to retrieve
what Park Dang-gu has stolen from me.

163
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,372
Find and bring him here this instant.

164
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,957
What exactly

165
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,585
did our leader steal from Jinyowon?

166
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,255
You cannot just come here
in the middle of the night

167
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,132
and demand what you want.

168
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,050
Have you no manners?

169
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,428
If you do not cooperate,
I will find him myself.

170
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,307
Search all of Songrim
and find Park Dang-gu.

171
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,349
Lady Jin.

172
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,273
Lord Dang-gu is here.

173
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,782
Lady Jin, do not be mistaken.
It was not me.

174
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,869
I did not kidnap the bride
on her way to the wedding.

175
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,287
"Wedding"?

176
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,498
"Bride"?

177
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,500
You knew about Jinyowon's wedding ceremony

178
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,335
and went around asking about it,
did you not?

179
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,631
Yes, that I did.

180
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,760
I thought it was for Young Lady Jin.

181
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,513
Although I wanted to ruin the ceremony,

182
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,972
I did not.

183
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,976
Dang-gu was with me all night.

184
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:32,811
He was not the person…

185
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,815
who kidnapped Jin Bu-yeon.

186
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,199
Are you saying you came here

187
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:49,036
looking for your eldest daughter,
Jin Bu-yeon?

188
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,457
My goodness, this is so confusing.

189
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,376
What is this about Jin Bu-yeon?

190
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,919
That girl is dead!

191
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,836
Cho-yeon.

192
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,338
Explain to me what is going on.

193
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,591
Well, the thing is…

194
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,429
My sister is alive.

195
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,141
She has been living in Jinyowon
for the last three years.

196
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,643
What? She is alive?

197
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,771
Yes, that is right.
I came here looking for Bu-yeon.

198
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,857
She disappeared today
during her wedding ceremony.

199
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,070
I was too flustered
having lost my precious daughter.

200
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,780
I apologize for the discourtesy.

201
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,074
I will be off now.

202
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,428
Jin Bu-yeon.

203
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,681
So you are alive.

204
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,771
Why was Young Lady Jin so angry?

205
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,857
She probably felt embarrassed and upset

206
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,067
when she found out it was not you.

207
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,614
You thought she was getting married,
but all you did was drink.

208
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,407
She has the right to feel angry.

209
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,536
I am the leader of Songrim now.

210
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,747
I can no longer do whatever I want,
so I held back.

211
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,707
What would you have done?

212
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,295
If I were you…

213
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,466
I would have done it.

214
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,139
Because now I know
how much I will regret it…

215
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,226
if I decide to walk away.

216
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,562
When I found out it was her,

217
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,565
I should have stepped forward
and held onto her

218
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,443
instead of stepping away.

219
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,280
Dang-gu.

220
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,368
The most tragic experience

221
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,913
is to live your entire life
regretting what you could have done.

222
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,458
Please do not live that way.

223
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,268
Young Master, you are back.

224
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,186
Yes.

225
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,898
Go on inside.

226
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,826
What a nice place.

227
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,327
It looks larger than Jinyowon.

228
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,540
What now?

229
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,959
Are you calculating
how wealthy your husband must be?

230
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,253
Jinyowon is extremely rich too.

231
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,882
Marrying a girl from a rich family like me
will help you boost your wealth.

232
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,342
Not interested.

233
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,261
All I need is your great divine powers.

234
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:57,766
What about other qualities?
I might have more to offer.

235
00:16:59,143 --> 00:16:59,977
No.

236
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,313
That is the only reason I need you.

237
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,029
But that is the one thing
I do not possess.

238
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,324
Gosh, I should not have said
my powers were that great.

239
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,751
Young Master Jang,
where in the world were you?

240
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:24,835
Oh, hey…

241
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,048
Who, may I ask, are you?

242
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,216
-I am--
-My bride-to-be.

243
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,136
Pardon? Your bride-to-be?

244
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:35,888
It is so sudden--

245
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,765
Maidservant Kim, I will explain later.

246
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,976
Our guest is very exhausted right now.

247
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,603
Could you prepare a room for her?

248
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,148
Please, Maidservant Kim.

249
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,525
Yes, Young Master.

250
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,903
I will find a room for her to rest in.

251
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,704
Maidservant Kim raised me
ever since I was a baby.

252
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,583
She is very dear to me,
so please treat her with respect.

253
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,212
She is kind at heart,
so she will make you feel at home.

254
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,047
You asked a person that dear to you

255
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,382
to look after me?

256
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,927
-What about it?
-It is just…

257
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,929
I thought you would give me a hard time

258
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,139
for forcing you to take me with you.

259
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,600
I did not expect you to be so hospitable.

260
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,103
Who says I was forced?

261
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,107
I know I was not the most welcoming,

262
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,859
but I went there because I needed you.

263
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,112
You are my betrothed now,

264
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,114
so you should be treated accordingly.

265
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,743
But people will be suspicious
about you bringing me here.

266
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,578
Should we not be careful?

267
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,496
I thought

268
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,666
you came with me because you were fed up
with being locked up.

269
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,293
There is nothing to be careful of.

270
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,087
Just do as you wish.

271
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,630
No one here

272
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,383
will stop you from doing what you want.

273
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,053
Thank you for saying that.

274
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,055
I will try my best to feel at home.

275
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,311
I will accept your hospitality.

276
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,066
You will find this room
the most comfortable.

277
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,570
I will quickly bring you some food.

278
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,207
I hope it suits your palate.

279
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,459
Let me know if you need anything.

280
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,961
I will.

281
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,097
When you are done bathing,
I will have clean clothes ready for you.

282
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,060
I did not have time
to get you anything new,

283
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,272
so I brought you clothes that
used to belong to Madam Do-hwa.

284
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,523
It looks nice on you.

285
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,067
It is not only pretty,
but it is also light and comfortable.

286
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,819
By any chance,

287
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,113
is it all right if I keep this?

288
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,368
It is neither in trend nor is it new.

289
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,621
But if you like it, go ahead.

290
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,998
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

291
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,297
You see…

292
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,053
I am acquainted with a lot of people.

293
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:26,433
So I know every young lady
that lives in the capital.

294
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,310
But I have never seen you before.

295
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,646
I have never left my house.

296
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,813
That is probably why.

297
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,023
I see.

298
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,068
Your parents must be very strict.

299
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,369
Where are the young master's parents?

300
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,662
Do they not live here?

301
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,414
They both passed away.

302
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,333
Did you not know?

303
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,129
We only just met.

304
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,131
By any chance,

305
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:03,095
do you also not know
what happened to him three years ago?

306
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,558
So you know nothing about him,

307
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,311
yet you followed him here
just because he asked you to marry him?

308
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,397
I was the one who asked.

309
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,732
I asked him to marry me.

310
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,734
It was me who asked.

311
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,653
And he said yes to that?

312
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:21,905
Yes.

313
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,950
How strange.

314
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:26,952
I never thought

315
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,038
he would even consider
getting married again.

316
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,958
This is hard to believe.

317
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,211
I wonder what he is thinking.

318
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,185
Jin Bu-yeon had divine powers
that were as powerful as Jin Seol-ran's.

319
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,646
Do you wish to remove the ice stone?

320
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,441
If you do that, you will die.

321
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,911
Are you all right?

322
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,873
What happened?
Why are you soaked in water?

323
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,428
Look.

324
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,683
Excuse me.

325
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,852
Are you all right?

326
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:34,853
Are you awake?

327
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,523
Where am I?

328
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,734
How did I end up here?

329
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,741
I must find the ice stone.

330
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,042
I was told I would find him in his study.

331
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,681
What are you doing?

332
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,767
Are you stealing that?

333
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,854
I am sorry.

334
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:21,691
I am just so used
to stealing food and drinks.

335
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,653
Leave it here.

336
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,293
What?

337
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,338
You said it was all right
to do as I wished.

338
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,177
I always stole alcohol and drank alone.

339
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,013
Have a drink with me
to celebrate my escape.

340
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,589
If you drink that,

341
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,342
it means we are officially married.

342
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,762
Let us think of it as a wedding drink.

343
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,267
Go on. Drink up.

344
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:41,980
A wedding drink?

345
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:58,747
Drink up.

346
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,378
Why are you not drinking it?

347
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,505
There is no need to rush
our first night together.

348
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,924
Take it slow. The night is young.

349
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,009
Summer nights are shorter.
The sun will shine any time now.

350
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,595
What does that have anything to do
with becoming a married couple?

351
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,473
I prefer it when it is dark.

352
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,644
It would be awkward to do it in daylight.

353
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,398
You really have a way
of surprising me with your words.

354
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,110
Drinking during the day is bad for you.

355
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,780
I only drank stolen alcohol at night,
so go on.

356
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,324
Drink up.

357
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,620
Fine.

358
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,747
I will drink as soon as I check something.

359
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,299
This is our first night together.

360
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,218
You said it makes you feel awkward.

361
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,896
Here.

362
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,482
You can turn off the last lantern.

363
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,025
For your information,

364
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,654
I received this as a gift from Jinyowon
for complicated reasons.

365
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,906
They said it was some kind of a lantern

366
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,116
that never turns off.

367
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,911
Anyway, the light cannot be blown out.

368
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,664
Since you are
a great priestess of Jinyowon,

369
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,458
use your divine powers to turn it off.

370
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,003
I am waiting.

371
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,286
You cannot do it.

372
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,708
Why can you not do it?
I thought you had great divine powers.

373
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,710
Apparently, I lost my divine powers

374
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,505
along with my memory.

375
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,469
All I can do is see energy with my eyes.

376
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,141
Nothing else.

377
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,226
Then you are of no use to me.

378
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,152
Go home at daybreak.

379
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,570
Tell them you got lost.

380
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,155
You said you escaped a few times.

381
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,742
Do you know why I got caught

382
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,370
every time I ran away?

383
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,757
Because of this.

384
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,801
They always used this to find me.

385
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:06,643
The tracking thread found
the bride's boat.

386
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,239
Follow the energy of the tracking thread,

387
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,157
and we will find her.

388
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,620
The thread is tightening around my wrist.

389
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,705
That means they will be here soon.

390
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,045
So this is how they find you.

391
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,965
People from Jinyowon will come,

392
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,926
and they will know it was you who took me.

393
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,344
When they come…

394
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,849
I will tell them that
we got married overnight.

395
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,351
This means

396
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,229
I cannot send you back quietly.

397
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,106
This thread comes from Jinyowon,

398
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,650
and no sword is strong enough to cut it.

399
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:58,903
Jang Uk.

400
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,906
I do not wish to go back.

401
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,993
I like it here.

402
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,206
And I like you too.

403
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,500
I cannot feel the energy
of the tracking thread.

404
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,002
The thread has been cut.

405
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,509
There.

406
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,344
I cut the thread.

407
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,805
Now you can quietly return home.

408
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,645
Leave once the sun rises.

409
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,240
I will leave now.

410
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,534
It will be more embarrassing
to be caught in broad daylight.

411
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,121
I may have deceived you,

412
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,415
but not everything was a lie.

413
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,627
I do have great divine powers.

414
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,046
And the person who treated me told me
that once I get my memory back,

415
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,883
my divine powers will come back as well.

416
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,471
I am sorry I lied to you.

417
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,599
Thank you for your hospitality.

418
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,518
When I get back,

419
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,729
I will not mention your name.

420
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,774
Bu-yeon has disappeared.

421
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,693
Do you think

422
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,821
she has regained her memories and powers?

423
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,908
If she regained her memories,
she may have run away.

424
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,536
After all, the soul inside that body

425
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,163
belongs to Naksu.

426
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,540
The body is Bu-yeon's.

427
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,251
The blood of the eldest daughter
of the Jin family runs in that body.

428
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,087
Is that the reason you confined her

429
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,089
and tried to marry her off
to carry on the family line?

430
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,427
What were you planning to do with her body
once she gave birth to a baby?

431
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,178
Get rid of it once again?

432
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,681
Did you forget what you promised me

433
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,475
when you begged me to save her life
after you found her body

434
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,062
at the bottom of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

435
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,949
The body has petrified
without a single ounce of water left,

436
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,576
yet she is still alive. How miraculous.

437
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,369
3 YEARS AGO

438
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,537
Please save her.

439
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,624
She is my long-lost daughter.

440
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:01,169
I always wondered why she never ran wild
even with Naksu's energy.

441
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,422
I guess it was because the body
belonged to a Jinyowon priestess.

442
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,385
Naksu did not take over this body
using the alchemy of souls.

443
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:12,639
Her soul was actually locked up
inside this body.

444
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,683
She called me "Mother."

445
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,935
Bu-yeon's soul

446
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:20,688
also remains inside this body.

447
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,985
The choice is yours.

448
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,155
The only way to keep this body alive

449
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,784
is to use Naksu's energy
that remains inside the body.

450
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,870
Bu-yeon's soul is clinging to that energy.

451
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,540
In order to use Naksu's energy,
we must get rid of Bu-yeon's soul

452
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,292
while leaving Naksu's.

453
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,295
Are you asking me

454
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,008
to choose Naksu's soul
over my own daughter's?

455
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,762
That or let them both die.

456
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,722
What will you do?

457
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,601
Do you wish to keep the body alive
through Naksu's soul?

458
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,270
Or will you keep your daughter's soul
and watch her die?

459
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,400
I will respect your decision.

460
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,919
She is recovering using Naksu's energy.

461
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:10,048
As the energy flows in her face
and she starts looking human again,

462
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,091
her features will
slowly resemble those of Naksu's.

463
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,012
The body and soul must be one
for her not to run wild.

464
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,682
Are you telling me to look at that face
and think of her as my daughter?

465
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,894
You made your own choice.

466
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:27,356
You decided to use all of Naksu's energy
to save your daughter's body.

467
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,196
She has a new body now,
so her memory is gone.

468
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,032
Naksu's soul may still remain,

469
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,326
but she lost both her energy

470
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,870
and memory.

471
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,355
She remembers nothing,
which is why she thinks you are her mother

472
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,066
and does not struggle to accept
that she is Jin Bu-yeon.

473
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,069
She opens the doors to Jinyowon
and sees the energy of the world

474
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,862
because my daughter's blood
runs inside her.

475
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,031
But she has no other powers.

476
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,367
My daughter

477
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,830
used to handle relics inside Jinyowon
as if they were her toys.

478
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,458
Does this mean she lost her divine powers?

479
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,544
Bu-yeon's body has no divine powers,

480
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,546
and Naksu's soul has no memory,

481
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,923
so the body and soul do not conflict.

482
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,259
If she regains her divine powers,

483
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,053
Naksu's memory will likely follow.

484
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,180
Can you bear that?

485
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,725
I would rather have her stay that way

486
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,854
than have Naksu's memory come back.

487
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,981
Then are you going to keep her confined?

488
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,442
That is my decision to make.

489
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,155
And if I decide to kill her
because I can no longer stand it,

490
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,197
then so be it.

491
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,701
You promised to respect my decisions.

492
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,329
Jang Uk loved her.

493
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,167
If you tell him,
he will help you protect her.

494
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,461
No. He was in love with Naksu.

495
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,676
She will only live
as my daughter, Bu-yeon.

496
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,389
I will not let him find out about her.

497
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:30,646
Besides, Jang Uk does not know
what Naksu's real face even looks like.

498
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,526
Even if the two ever do meet,

499
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:40,615
they will not be able
to recognize each other.

500
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,456
I have to live my life in agony
looking at that girl's face,

501
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,293
so that is the price that must be paid.

502
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,091
I respected your decision as a mother

503
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,011
and did not tell anyone
about her existence.

504
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,096
However, today…

505
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,476
the entire world ended up
finding out about Bu-yeon.

506
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,897
What is important is that I find her.

507
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,901
She has escaped a few times before,
but I always managed to find her.

508
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,403
This time…

509
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,907
it will be no different.

510
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,963
Goodbye, my lady.

511
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:01,821
What is that smell?

512
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,157
Is it the smell of water?

513
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,874
What is that?

514
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,211
I sense a strange kind of energy.

515
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,174
Are you on patrol?

516
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,926
Did something happen?

517
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,949
Mister. Wake up.

518
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,601
I am sure it came in here.

519
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,965
Hey, wake up. Are you all right?

520
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,470
It is not inside him.

521
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,890
Where did that energy go?

522
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,705
I know you are hiding in there.

523
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,125
Why did you come here?

524
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,264
This may be broken,

525
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,141
but it is a Jinyowon relic
that still holds power.

526
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,059
Eat this and go away.

527
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,540
Young Master.

528
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,418
Did something strange
enter the house again?

529
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,003
Should I wake Maidservant Kim?

530
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,421
I already took care of it.

531
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,423
Just let her sleep.

532
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,136
You will get cold tonight
because you came in contact with it.

533
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,555
Drink some strong liquor
before going to bed.

534
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,681
Yes, Young Master.

535
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,977
She came to check up on me
and tried to help me.

536
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,522
She will also be feeling cold.

537
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,690
I will bring a brazier
and some strong liquor.

538
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,088
If you drink that,

539
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,257
it means we are officially married.

540
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,885
Let us think of it as a wedding drink.

541
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,943
She is of no use to me,
and yet she is a nuisance.

542
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,865
Here is the portrait I received
before the wedding.

543
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:39,992
Can you really find her?

544
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,660
With the help
of Songrim's merchants' association,

545
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,122
every person in Daeho
will get to see this portrait by today.

546
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:50,085
I will help Young Lady Jin
find her sister.

547
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,590
WHOEVER FINDS THIS LADY
WILL BE REWARDED GENEROUSLY

548
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,927
She is Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of Jinyowon.

549
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,513
All the ladies at Jinyowon are beautiful.

550
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,058
Is it true that
whoever finds her will be rewarded?

551
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,684
Yes, it says it right there.

552
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,936
Goodness, they are giving a reward.

553
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,149
Does that mean Jin Bu-yeon is going to be

554
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,984
the next leader of Jinyowon?

555
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,110
Most likely.

556
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:19,073
Ever since she was young,
she was known for her great divine powers.

557
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,033
Lady Jin's divine powers have weakened,

558
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,951
so many have been saying
the Jin family should no longer be

559
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,536
in charge of the relics and artifacts.

560
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,374
So this is good news for the Jin family.

561
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,668
Are you saying the Seo family

562
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,003
and the Jin family were
planning to become in-laws?

563
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,588
Yes, Your Majesty.

564
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,091
Yun-o, we are cousins.

565
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,468
How could you not tell me
about the wedding?

566
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,097
I cannot believe even my own family
would disrespect me like this

567
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:46,058
because of how I look.

568
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,643
No one in the family knows.

569
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,104
Lady Jin insisted
the wedding be held in secret.

570
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,522
Please do not be angry.

571
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,274
Then I guess Lady Jin
also has no respect for me.

572
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,611
Her dead husband is the reason
why I look like this.

573
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,572
Wait a minute.

574
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,367
You were going to marry into the family

575
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,286
that did this to me?

576
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,664
Forgive me.

577
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,833
The marriage has been canceled.
Please calm down.

578
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,378
Not a single person

579
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,214
acknowledges the pain I feel.

580
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,174
Could you please

581
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,677
help me find a way
to get out of this body?

582
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,762
There is no other way.

583
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,267
I cannot let you shift souls

584
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,602
just because you are the Queen.

585
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,899
Anyway, now that we know
that Jinyowon's heir is alive and well,

586
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,571
they can appoint her as the official heir
at the Unanimous Assembly.

587
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,247
Are you telling me

588
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,334
that this is the face of Jin Bu-yeon?

589
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,252
Yes.

590
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,714
Even Songrim is helping them find her,
so it must be true.

591
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,225
This is Naksu's face.

592
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,229
I do not know about anyone else,
but her face is one I cannot forget.

593
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,230
So…

594
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,984
how can she be Jin Bu-yeon?

595
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:21,278
I should look into it.

596
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,243
She is Jin Bu-yeon?

597
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,454
That is not her.

598
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,831
Jin Bu-yeon is Mu-deok.

599
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,963
You must keep your body warm.

600
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,136
Mr. Lee told me what happened last night.

601
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,596
Thank goodness you are all right.

602
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,683
I am sorry for worrying you.

603
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:53,977
By the way,

604
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,065
I heard you were
going to leave last night.

605
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,903
Did Young Master Jang not say anything?

606
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,155
He stayed by your side all night.

607
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,865
Then he told me

608
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,868
to give you some medicine for the chills
and just left.

609
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,829
I am about to go to Sejukwon
to get some medicine for you.

610
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,747
Maidservant Kim.

611
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,208
How many days' worth did he ask for?

612
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,168
He asked for three days' worth.

613
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,087
Three days' worth?

614
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:27,469
Then I guess I will be staying here
for at least three days.

615
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,352
I bet you were

616
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,646
awfully startled last night.

617
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:42,109
Young Master Jang is
always surrounded by wicked things…

618
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,238
which is why he is never able
to sleep properly.

619
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,823
Why does that happen to him?

620
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,536
It is because of
the great power within him.

621
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,665
They are drawn to it
like moths to a flame.

622
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,421
Did he need my divine powers
to get rid of that?

623
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,049
He asked if I could
take out the ice stone.

624
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,677
Will he find peace

625
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,721
if that gets taken out?

626
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:49,843
My lord.

627
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,554
What are you doing today?

628
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,223
They are red beans.

629
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,433
Are you making red bean porridge?

630
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:01,188
I am going to make meju with red beans.

631
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,733
You are going to make meju
with red beans, not soybeans?

632
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,235
"Making meju with red beans"
is an expression

633
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,821
that people use
to describe a lie or bluff.

634
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,157
But if I actually make meju
with red beans,

635
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,203
then that expression will no longer exist.

636
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,248
Everyone thinks this is impossible,
and I will be the first

637
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,918
to prove them wrong.

638
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,548
I am going to challenge myself.

639
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,591
I bet you will lose.

640
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,385
Meju is made with soybeans.

641
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,178
-Red beans might work.
-Soybeans.

642
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:34,179
-Red beans.
-Soy.

643
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,138
-Red.
-Soy.

644
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,515
-Soybeans.
-Red beans.

645
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,766
-Red beans.
-Soybeans.

646
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:38,934
-Red.
-Soy.

647
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:39,976
-Red beans.
-Red…

648
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,311
-Soy…
-Soy, red…

649
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:50,153
You and I really do click well.

650
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,738
Goodness.

651
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:56,493
Even if you do make meju with red beans,
I will not even be that shocked.

652
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,830
Something even more shocking
happened last night.

653
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:00,997
What?

654
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,083
Young Master Jang

655
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,627
suddenly brought a lady home,
saying he will marry her.

656
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,548
Uk wants to marry someone?

657
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,300
This is more shocking
than what you are about to do, right?

658
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,221
Uk is still not over that girl, right?

659
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,305
Of course not.

660
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,390
She is still…

661
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,269
in his heart.

662
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:25,772
My lord.

663
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,151
I really do hope you succeed

664
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,944
in making meju with red beans.

665
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,656
Show me that impossible things
sometimes do happen.

666
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,369
Uk brought someone home
saying he will marry her?

667
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,128
Three days of taking medicine.

668
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,547
A man and a woman
living together for three days?

669
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:52,632
That is pretty much a married couple.

670
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,094
There is still hope.

671
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,768
Who are you?

672
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,228
I am Young Master Jang's physician.

673
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,856
I came because I heard Maidservant Kim
dropped by for some medicine.

674
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,109
I guess he sent you to take care of me,

675
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,028
although it was not necessary.

676
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,948
Who exactly are you?

677
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,116
Young Lady Heo.

678
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,203
She looks exactly like the lady
that Lord Dang-gu

679
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,996
and Young Master Seo Yul are looking for.

680
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:25,791
You are right.

681
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,460
Is your name Jin Bu-yeon?

682
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,795
How do you know my name?

683
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:32,172
No one knows who I am.

684
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,590
What are you talking about?

685
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,051
Your face is all over the capital.

686
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,511
Everyone is looking for you.

687
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,179
What are you doing
at Young Master Jang's place?

688
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,515
-You should get out of here.
-Sun-i.

689
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:46,353
Everyone knows about me,
and people are looking for me?

690
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,730
Mother would never do that.

691
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,316
Then who is looking for me?

692
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,653
Are those your clothes?

693
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,112
Is that not a wedding dress?

694
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,365
Did you say a man named Seo Yul
is looking for me?

695
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,407
Pardon?

696
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,492
Yes.

697
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,160
A man from the Seo family
at Seoho Fortress?

698
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,454
The man who lacks nothing? Is that him?

699
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,413
Yes, pretty much.

700
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,385
Why do you think Jin Bu-yeon was here?

701
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,136
I do not know.

702
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,349
Where are you going this time?

703
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,600
I am leaving.

704
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,686
Tell Uk that I do not need the medicine.

705
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,312
Pardon?

706
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,114
Seo Yul really is looking for me.

707
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,450
He is looking for me
even though I ran away on our wedding day?

708
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,704
I am guessing he went against my mother

709
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,290
seeing that he revealed
my face to the world.

710
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,002
It will not be a bad idea
to bet my life on him.

711
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,841
I had no idea you were from Jinyowon.

712
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,262
I apologize for not recognizing you
and calling you a thief.

713
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,682
Everyone is looking for you.
Shall I escort you back to Jinyowon?

714
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,310
First, I would like to meet Seo Yul.

715
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,062
Is he here?

716
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,899
Young Master Seo is…

717
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,567
Let me see if he is in his room.

718
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,610
Please wait.

719
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:20,572
Let me meet him first.

720
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,367
If he turns out to be all right,
I will choose him.

721
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,380
Does that count

722
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,174
as a wedding drink?

723
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:36,439
You should never date a man with a past
as painful as a stab to the heart.

724
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:43,154
A past as painful as a stab to the heart?

725
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,323
He must be in a lot of pain.

726
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:51,746
Young Lady.

727
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,664
Young Lady.

728
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,542
Young Master Seo is coming right this way.

729
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,276
Everyone is looking for you,

730
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,155
but I never thought
you would come looking for me.

731
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,491
I apologize for running away
on the day of the wedding.

732
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,786
Now that I have met you,
I regret having done that.

733
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,830
If I had met you first,

734
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:37,375
I would not have hesitated
about getting married.

735
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,879
Why would I have affected your decision?

736
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,547
Because you are handsome.

737
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:47,427
It is only natural to waver
when one meets a handsome man.

738
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,432
But that is as far as I can go.

739
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,102
Last night, I already gave my heart
to someone else.

740
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,647
I thought I packed all my clothes
and brought everything with me,

741
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:04,110
but last night's memory still lingers
and will not allow me to move on.

742
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,992
Are you saying you no longer wish to marry

743
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,661
a member of the Seo family?

744
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:15,622
Yes.

745
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,709
So I would appreciate it
if you would stop the public search.

746
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,254
All right.

747
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,591
I will relay the message to my uncle.

748
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,722
I was not your betrothed.

749
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,516
A man with the surname Seo
from Seoho Fortress.

750
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,893
-You came on a boat.
-I came with my uncle.

751
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,063
I guess you misunderstood
because you did not know his name.

752
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,189
So it was not you?

753
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,485
Thank goodness.

754
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,904
Now it is a lot easier
to give up the marriage.

755
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,949
To be honest,
I was worried that I might regret it.

756
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,617
But now I feel fine.

757
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,213
What is the matter?

758
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,261
Have we ever met before?

759
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,431
That is impossible.

760
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,475
I never went outside.

761
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,399
I need to go. I have three days' worth
of medicine waiting for me.

762
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,112
Please let your uncle know.

763
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,330
It is time to go back, my lady.

764
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,791
Could you just give me a bit more time?

765
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,709
Just three days.

766
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:46,379
Then I will willingly enter that room

767
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,174
and stay there, just as Mother wants.

768
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,925
Just give me three days.

769
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,178
I am here on Lady Jin's orders.

770
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,721
Come with us.

771
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,401
Was she confined?

772
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,657
Young Master.

773
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,410
Was that lady from Jinyowon?

774
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,248
The entire capital is looking for her.

775
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,710
Maybe that is why, but she suddenly left.

776
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,879
-She left?
-Yes.

777
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,256
She took her wedding dress and everything.

778
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,008
What happened?

779
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,594
What matters is that she is gone.
Forget about yesterday.

780
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,184
I knew it.

781
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,020
Some things are just impossible.

782
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,131
Now that it is broken,

783
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,884
you can go anywhere you want, right?

784
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,971
If you wish to run, I can help.

785
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:20,181
If you want, I can give you some money.

786
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,891
You promised not to say my name,

787
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,352
so think of it as a settlement.

788
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:26,938
My mother…

789
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,483
lost me when I was little

790
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,777
and looked for me for over ten years.

791
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:36,072
I do wish to come out
because it gets suffocating inside,

792
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,116
but I cannot just plainly disappear.

793
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,410
If I do that,

794
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:44,080
she will lose her daughter again.

795
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,960
And that will kill her inside.

796
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,883
I cannot do that to her.

797
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,055
I guess she went back

798
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:03,808
and got locked up again.

799
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,216
My precious daughter.

800
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,761
I thought I lost you again.

801
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,555
I am sorry, Mother.

802
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,308
My sweetheart.

803
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,560
Bu-yeon.

804
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:49,937
My daughter.

805
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:56,778
You broke off the engagement?

806
01:00:58,404 --> 01:00:59,822
The Queen is not happy with it.

807
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,825
I did not think that far ahead.

808
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,494
Then what will happen to her?

809
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,454
Why should I care?

810
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,332
They kept her hidden
because they were embarrassed by her.

811
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,250
I did them a favor
by offering to marry her.

812
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,420
But they ruined everything.

813
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,012
Is it happening again?

814
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,765
You came to Daeho
because the pain worsened.

815
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,558
Did you ask Master Heo to treat you?

816
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:35,775
Please do not tell anyone
about my condition.

817
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,998
His Majesty has ordered you

818
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:53,668
to bring Jin Bu-yeon
to the Unanimous Assembly.

819
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:58,756
Since when did the royal family
give orders to mages

820
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,341
regarding the Unanimous Assembly?

821
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,595
Did you advise them to do that
as the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

822
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,890
Just let me meet her.

823
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,478
I saw a portrait of her,
but I would like to meet her in person.

824
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:14,188
Why do you…

825
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,191
want to see her?

826
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:21,028
I am still her uncle.

827
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,533
It is only natural
that I want to meet my long-lost niece.

828
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:26,826
She is a beautiful girl.

829
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,788
Master Lee tells me

830
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,417
that she takes after me.

831
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:38,129
Master Lee? The pupil of Seo Gyeong?

832
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,046
Yes.

833
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:42,091
When we found Bu-yeon,
she was extremely ill.

834
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,969
Master Lee treated her

835
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:46,804
and looked after her.

836
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,601
Thanks to you,

837
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,896
I once humiliated myself
by welcoming a fake daughter.

838
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,689
I received Master Lee's help

839
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,066
to prevent that from happening again.

840
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:04,489
If he confirmed it for you,
then it must be Bu-yeon without a doubt.

841
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,658
But why did you keep her hidden?

842
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,701
I told you she was ill.

843
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:09,994
Is she well now?

844
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:15,416
The Unanimous Assembly will suggest
that Jinyowon's relics and artifacts

845
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:18,544
be moved elsewhere.

846
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,339
It means the duty to protect Jinyowon
could get passed on

847
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,466
to a different family.

848
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:25,051
That is nonsense.

849
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,678
This is what happens when you keep
your doors closed for three years.

850
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:29,639
The leader of Jinyowon is old,

851
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,433
which means her power
is weakening day by day.

852
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,268
Meanwhile, she has no heir
with strong divine powers.

853
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,396
Why would anyone think it would be safe
to leave the Jin family in charge

854
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,982
of all those dangerous
and valuable relics and artifacts?

855
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:40,900
Is that the advice

856
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:45,112
you are giving me
as the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan?

857
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,576
Here is my advice to you as your brother.

858
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:53,871
Bring Bu-yeon to the Unanimous Assembly.

859
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:57,124
She is known to have divine powers
as powerful as Jin Seol-ran's.

860
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:00,336
If you announce her as your official heir,

861
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,298
then you will be able to keep Jinyowon.

862
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,808
All right, then.
I will see you at the Unanimous Assembly.

863
01:04:36,330 --> 01:04:38,708
Jin Bu-yeon is going to attend
the Unanimous Assembly

864
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,042
held at Cheonbugwan.

865
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,297
Jin Bu-yeon has been
the talk of the town for a while now.

866
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,215
I guess she is finally showing up.

867
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,758
Would you like to attend?

868
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:48,676
No.

869
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,012
I do not have fond memories of her.

870
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:53,639
The last time I went to see her,
I ended up trapped inside a barrier.

871
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,640
You are right.

872
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,558
Goodness.

873
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,311
It was so foggy that I could not see.

874
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,187
-Right.
-It rained too.

875
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:01,772
Gosh.

876
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,866
I tried to make meju with red beans,

877
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,242
but I failed.

878
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,870
So I used it to make red bean porridge.

879
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:17,830
How does it taste?

880
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,125
You say you failed,
but it somehow tastes like meju.

881
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,668
It does, right?

882
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,379
I really think
I might be able to turn it into meju.

883
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,965
Did you invite me to eat
what you failed to make?

884
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:28,883
Uk.

885
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:33,179
I heard you brought home
someone you wished to marry.

886
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,682
I figured Maidservant Kim would tell you.

887
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,770
Why did you kidnap
the priestess of Jinyowon

888
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,981
on the day of her wedding?

889
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:48,778
She was pretty.

890
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,072
I was mesmerized by her beauty.

891
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,782
Were you going to ask

892
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,826
that beautiful woman
to take out the ice stone for you?

893
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,080
You punk.

894
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:02,708
You should marry someone
you wish to spend your life with,

895
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,169
not someone who will take your life away.

896
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,254
Do not worry. She ran away.

897
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:08,172
Good.

898
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:14,261
I heard she is going to be announced
as the official heir of Jinyowon tonight.

899
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:17,598
Jin Bu-yeon? How?

900
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:20,142
She is a priestess
with great divine powers.

901
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,853
It seems like there have been concerns
regarding Jinyowon.

902
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:27,358
If her eldest daughter attends
the Unanimous Assembly

903
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,859
and gets announced as the heir,

904
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,405
Jinyowon will be able to show
that they still stand strong.

905
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,032
So they are trying to make meju
with red beans.

906
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,746
Do you know how you can succeed

907
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,416
in making meju with red beans?

908
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,796
Is there really a way?

909
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:52,925
First, you hide it.

910
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:55,803
Then you make sure no one tastes it.

911
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:58,764
Does it taste that bad?

912
01:06:58,848 --> 01:06:59,682
Yes.

913
01:07:00,891 --> 01:07:01,726
It tastes

914
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:03,769
absolutely horrible.

915
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:09,567
I will bring you some honey.

916
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:12,528
Then it will be sweet red bean porridge.

917
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,084
Red beans can never turn into meju.

918
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,044
How foolish of her.

919
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,757
She should have run away.

920
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,805
I did not want to take you there,

921
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:43,684
but that is the only way
to protect Jinyowon.

922
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:45,519
Mother.

923
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,855
I have no power.

924
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,191
Will it be all right?

925
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:53,360
That is why

926
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:55,821
you must help me.

927
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:58,824
Bu-yeon, you must never
leave this place again.

928
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:03,370
You cannot ever see anyone
now that everyone knows you.

929
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:09,210
We cannot let anyone find out
that the heir of Jinyowon

930
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:11,629
has no divine powers.

931
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,382
Then I will have to stay…

932
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:19,345
in this room forever.

933
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:26,560
Please do it for me.

934
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,652
Your tracking thread has snapped off.

935
01:09:00,594 --> 01:09:02,388
Let us tie it so that it can never

936
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,265
break off again.

937
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,683
How…

938
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:50,519
did that turn off?

939
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:54,315
Apparently, I lost my divine powers
along with my memory.

940
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:56,901
She clearly told me

941
01:09:58,611 --> 01:10:00,029
that she could not turn it off.

942
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:22,885
I may have deceived you,

943
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,429
but not everything was a lie.

944
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,779
Is it true that Jin Bu-yeon has
immense divine powers?

945
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:44,823
She found the ice stone, did she not?

946
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,660
If she really does show up today,

947
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:51,372
the Jin family can continue
to be in charge of protecting Jinyowon

948
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,207
without any concerns.

949
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,808
After today's assembly, you will go home

950
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:12,893
and do as you promised.

951
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:17,273
You will never step outside
of Jinyowon ever again.

952
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,333
Is that Jin Bu-yeon?

953
01:11:44,591 --> 01:11:46,302
I would like to introduce to you

954
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,179
the heir of Jinyowon.

955
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:26,133
Hello, everyone.

956
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:27,926
I am Jin Bu-yeon, the eldest daughter

957
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:30,471
of the Jin family.

958
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,456
-What happened?
-What is going on?

959
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,499
-What?
-What is it?

960
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:00,084
-What is this?
-What is happening?

961
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:53,679
Jang Uk?

962
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:56,140
What is Jang Uk doing
at the Unanimous Assembly?

963
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,275
You left without taking your medicine.

964
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:08,318
Everyone was looking for me.

965
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:10,070
Why are you here?

966
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:11,238
To check something.

967
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:16,994
This was turned off.

968
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:18,036
Did you do it?

969
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:21,707
I turned it on again.

970
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:23,083
Try turning it off again.

971
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,009
I…

972
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,345
do not know how.

973
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:42,186
If you turn this off,

974
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:44,354
I will take you with me.

975
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:54,781
Wait…

976
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:07,127
It turned off.

977
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,256
Did…

978
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,509
Did I do that?

979
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:41,328
What are you doing?

980
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,246
Jin Bu-yeon…

981
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,375
cannot become the heir of Jinyowon.

982
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:48,752
What do you think you are doing?

983
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:51,713
Jin Bu-yeon

984
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,716
is already married to Jang Uk,
the son of the Jang family.

985
01:15:56,677 --> 01:15:58,512
-They got married?
-Married?

986
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:00,847
-Jin Bu-yeon and Jang Uk?
-What is he saying?

987
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:02,891
Bu-yeon, what is this nonsense?

988
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,524
He is right, Mother.

989
01:16:12,693 --> 01:16:15,237
This man and I shared a wedding drink

990
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:17,656
and became husband and wife.

991
01:16:19,866 --> 01:16:21,577
I will not return…

992
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:25,414
to that room in Jinyowon.

993
01:16:39,469 --> 01:16:40,887
We are married.

994
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:45,142
Please give us your blessings.

995
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:36,693
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

996
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,071
If my powers can be
considered justification,

997
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:41,365
I would like to see you
try arguing with that.

998
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:44,409
I was hoping for this.

999
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,912
Why? What is it?

1000
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:50,040
I need to find out more about Jin Bu-yeon.

1001
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:53,335
I think we have been circling
the same path.

1002
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,629
There is nothing wrong
with being airheaded.

1003
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:56,672
I was simply flustered.

1004
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:58,965
That looks delicious.

1005
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,467
Eunuch, do you have some money?

1006
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,803
Me? Were you referring to me?

1007
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:07,641
I shall summon Naksu's soul once again
to distract Jang Uk.

1008
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:15,774
