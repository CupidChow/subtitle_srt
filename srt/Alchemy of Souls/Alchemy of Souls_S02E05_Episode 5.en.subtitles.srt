ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,504
Tell me.

3
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,174
What is inside my body?

4
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,010
I would at least like to know…

5
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,138
before I die.

6
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,938
When I was gravely hurt and unconscious,

7
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,108
I heard that you gave me your blood.

8
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:10,737
Is that right?

9
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,156
I was only trying to save you.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,326
I thought the energy
of the blood parasite could save you.

11
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,869
The blood parasite?

12
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,251
So there is a parasite inside my body.

13
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,378
I was told
the medicine would make it better.

14
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,797
That is why I kept sending them to you.

15
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,840
But you did not take them?

16
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,221
Why not?

17
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,351
Did you not take what I sent you

18
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,271
because you could not
trust someone like me,

19
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:47,899
Young Master Seo?

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,619
Put it back.

21
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,747
Put the parasite back into me.

22
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,210
-Put it back--
-Do not move.

23
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,295
The cut is quite deep.

24
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,342
You are truly reckless.

25
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,892
Even someone like me gave it
by simply making a cut.

26
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,687
So why can you not do the same?

27
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,106
Once it entered my energy-filled body,

28
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,109
it entered the core of my energy.

29
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,695
It has settled there

30
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,114
and is eating away at my energy.

31
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,785
I will die once my energy runs out.

32
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,830
There must be a way.

33
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,416
Master Jin U-tak was the one
who gave it to me,

34
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,501
so it must be a relic from Jinyowon.

35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,712
They must have a way to get rid of it.

36
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,218
Is Gwanju Jin Mu of Cheonbugwan the one
who is providing you with the medicine?

37
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,060
He must have been the one
who told you to spread

38
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,813
those rumors about Naksu.

39
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,736
Does he know
that I have the blood parasite?

40
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,740
No one does.

41
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,079
Do not send me any more medicine.

42
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,081
I will not be seeing you again.

43
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,170
I returned to settle things one last time.

44
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,048
Please continue keeping this a secret.

45
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,557
Why are you letting me go

46
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,726
when I am the reason you will die?

47
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,479
Do you not want to kill me?

48
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,236
You said you only did it to save me,

49
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,321
and I believe you.

50
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,709
Maidservant Kim gave this to me.

51
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,379
I see that they are precious diamonds.

52
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,173
Are you giving them back?

53
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,552
-Please take them.
-So it is a rejection.

54
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,055
I understand.

55
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,396
Why are you trembling so much?

56
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,235
For the past three years,

57
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,990
I was anxious I would come face to face

58
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,200
with a situation like this.

59
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,330
I teared up just from thinking about it.

60
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,709
Now that it is happening,

61
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,963
the pain is unbearable.

62
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,340
Was that

63
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,468
the only thought you had during that time?

64
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,851
Then see for yourself

65
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,186
what my past three years were like.

66
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:22,947
This is

67
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,409
the charm that helps
two people become lovers,

68
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,912
Did you have it all along?

69
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,374
I have never thought

70
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,002
that you would forget me…

71
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,006
unless I abandoned you first.

72
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,550
Then…

73
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,137
does this mean you wanted to show me…

74
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,517
that you had kept it

75
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,020
all this time?

76
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,022
I would have thrown it away
if I wanted to,

77
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,024
not brought it to show you.

78
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:02,987
Thank you.

79
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,575
Just knowing that you did not discard it

80
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,161
gives me a sense of relief.

81
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,498
I appreciate your heartfelt gift.

82
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,546
But I cannot wear this in public for now.

83
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,716
That is fine.

84
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,302
You can just hold on to it.

85
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,346
But it is a gift, after all.

86
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,559
It would be a waste just to hold on to it.

87
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,063
Then would you like to wear it right now?

88
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,253
What do you think?

89
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,505
Do I look pretty?

90
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,969
Yes.

91
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,890
You are truly radiant

92
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,685
and beautiful.

93
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,743
Thank you for your help.

94
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:38,082
I did not want people
to keep talking about Naksu either.

95
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:43,588
With this, Uk erased Naksu
from this world once and for all.

96
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,341
I hope he erased her
from his heart as well.

97
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,762
Everyone knows
that Naksu was Uk's true love.

98
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:56,517
I understand why you do not welcome him
as your son-in-law.

99
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,730
Why did he take Bu-yeon?

100
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,023
I understand that she went

101
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,650
because she did not want
to become the heiress.

102
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:08,112
But I cannot wrap my head around
why he accepted her.

103
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,949
Bu-yeon is a priestess who can see energy.

104
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,912
She saw the energy of the sky
in the ice stone that burdens Uk

105
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,916
at first glance.

106
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,878
The energy of the sky in the ice stone?

107
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,964
She said she would protect him.

108
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,011
I hope those two

109
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,765
will keep each other safe.

110
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,710
So you are still dreaming.

111
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,547
It breaks my heart.

112
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,605
I am not dreaming.

113
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,024
Do you

114
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,110
recognize me?

115
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,194
Yes.

116
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,322
You woke me up.

117
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,291
I was not trying to wake you up.

118
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,460
You had mistaken me for someone else.

119
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,421
I only stayed because I could not
just leave you like that.

120
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,215
I thought you were still dreaming.

121
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,301
Then let us pretend that I am.

122
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,303
I will go back to bed, so leave.

123
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,763
I have not slept

124
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,682
so soundly in a long time.

125
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,896
You have me to thank for that.

126
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,065
Thanks to you, my sleep was interrupted.

127
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,319
Can you not feel the warmth in here?

128
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,821
The wraiths fled because of me.

129
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,698
See? You are not cold anymore, are you?

130
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,082
If I leave,

131
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,584
you will not be able
to sleep well like you just did.

132
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,506
-Should I go?
-In that case,

133
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,676
stay.

134
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,639
We both need to sleep.

135
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,060
So sleep here and do not wake me up.

136
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,440
All right.

137
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,025
I will do that.

138
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,195
After all, it would be useful of me

139
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,656
to help you sleep better.

140
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,002
I heard that
the ice stone keeps you awake.

141
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,756
Is that not why you brought me here?

142
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,758
To sleep better?

143
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,302
Yes.

144
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,055
That is why.

145
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,016
I want to fall into a deep sleep.

146
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,314
Uk,

147
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,649
are you having a hard time

148
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,569
because you have trouble going to sleep?

149
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,157
I feel bad for waking you up.

150
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,203
Should I pat you again
so you can sleep well?

151
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,417
What?

152
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,253
I patted you as you fell asleep.

153
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,672
I patted you until my wrist hurt.

154
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:38,841
ShalI I do it again?

155
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,343
Forget it. You--

156
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:44,680
Here.

157
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,973
Do not cross this line.

158
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,054
There, now you feel warm.

159
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,598
Yes.

160
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,268
It feels warm.

161
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,388
For the price of sparing Jang Uk,
who had the ice stone,

162
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,014
the mages from all the other families

163
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,017
left Jeongjingak.

164
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,396
Master Seo Gyeong,
my former master, built this place.

165
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,231
But now it is empty.

166
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:21,569
They are excluding us
out of jealousy and fear

167
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,861
that Songrim has the ice stone.

168
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,072
Thanks to Jang Uk,

169
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,366
Songrim's power has not
diminished even by a bit.

170
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,578
Yeom, you have not matured
despite growing three years older.

171
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,497
Master Seo did not build Jeongjingak

172
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,541
to see which mage was the strongest,

173
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,127
but for unity and education.

174
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,378
I apologize, Master Lee.

175
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,464
I have failed to honor his wishes.

176
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,592
No, you did your best, Jin.

177
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,261
You swore on your life and protected Uk.

178
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,055
You pacified the mages
from other families.

179
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,975
You also retired at such a young age.

180
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,898
You always favor Jin over me.

181
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,156
I heard that you treated Jin Bu-yeon.

182
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,575
Right, remember what she said last time?

183
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,245
She said she was treated
by the best physician in Daeho Fortress.

184
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,916
And that physician was our master.

185
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,545
Lady Jin desperately begged me
to treat her daughter in secret.

186
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,256
Now that she has wedded Jang Uk
and her existence has been revealed,

187
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,758
there is nothing to hide anymore.

188
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:30,304
Jang Uk must be the one
who kidnapped her on her wedding day.

189
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:33,515
He recklessly declared their marriage

190
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,809
and brought the Unanimous Assembly
into turmoil.

191
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,400
So that is what you call fate.

192
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,778
Something…

193
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,072
that humans cannot control.

194
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:57,998
How heartwarming.

195
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,959
Keep going.

196
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,357
What was that?

197
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,651
That memory was not from last night.

198
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,909
Was that also her memory?

199
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,172
Master,

200
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:48,924
I finally did it.

201
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,843
I also missed you. That is my reply.

202
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,386
Did you want to look nice for me?

203
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,440
Young Master.

204
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,316
Young Master.

205
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,068
Young Master.

206
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,279
Young Master.

207
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,753
The soul shifter you killed yesterday

208
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,421
was not Naksu, was it?

209
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:30,007
But everyone thinks it was her
due to the rumor.

210
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,592
To the public, Naksu is gone now.

211
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,969
She will never reappear.

212
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,971
Jin Mu was the one who spread the rumor.

213
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,640
I know.

214
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,312
You had suspected him too.

215
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,109
In any case,

216
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,071
we are talking about her at last
through this incident.

217
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,245
Uk.

218
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,374
She sometimes appears in my dreams.

219
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,215
In some of these dreams, she stabs me.

220
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,509
While other times,

221
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,097
I stab her in the dream.

222
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,435
It must be due to the guilt I feel

223
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,396
for fleeing without doing anything.

224
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,238
She is still just as obnoxious.

225
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,740
Why would she torment you in your dreams

226
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,742
when you did nothing wrong?

227
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:44,915
Yul.

228
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,710
Everything was my responsibility

229
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,963
from the moment I saw her eyes.

230
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,089
So you neither

231
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,675
did nothing

232
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:56,885
nor ran away.

233
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,514
Thank you for saying that.

234
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,226
Had I recognized her first,

235
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,396
I would have taken responsibility as well.

236
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,984
Uk, Yul, come and have breakfast.

237
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,319
Then take responsibility
and have breakfast.

238
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,446
I ate 100 of his dumplings recently.

239
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,157
There are about 50 left.

240
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,241
Good luck.

241
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,744
Help me with just ten of them.

242
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,081
You are on your own.

243
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,082
It is your responsibility.

244
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,043
-I have somewhere to go.
-Where?

245
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,128
The palace.

246
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,463
The people who spread that rumor

247
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,716
should take responsibility as well.

248
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,345
Where in the world is she?
Did you find her?

249
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,763
Did you search thoroughly?

250
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,141
Where could she be?

251
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,102
Let us search again carefully.

252
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,562
-Let us go.
-Sure.

253
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,109
-What is going on?
-Young Lady Bu-yeon is missing.

254
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,071
She complained of a headache,
so I thought she was in her room.

255
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,198
But she is not here.

256
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,950
-She was ill?
-Yes.

257
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,744
Strangely enough,

258
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:06,872
everyone slept well last night
due to the sudden warmth in the air.

259
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,415
But I guess she did not.

260
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,962
The wraiths fled because of me.

261
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,964
See? You are not cold anymore, are you?

262
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,801
It was she who cast away the wraiths.

263
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,971
Is that so?

264
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,097
Yes.

265
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:29,311
Does that mean
she took in all that cold energy?

266
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,188
Maybe that is why she is ill.

267
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,482
Where in the world did she go?

268
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,983
Do you have any ideas?

269
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,444
-How would I know?
-But she goes out every day.

270
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,862
Do you not know where she goes?

271
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,863
No.

272
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,281
That makes sense.

273
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,786
You have never eaten with her
or gone out with her.

274
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,288
How would you know
when you are always away?

275
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,206
Forget it.

276
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,416
She must not be here.

277
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,626
Goodness.

278
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,421
She is ill?

279
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,550
Was I the only one who slept well?

280
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,900
That jerk.

281
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,069
That horrible, mean jerk.

282
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,447
Where could she be?

283
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,084
I am drawing a blank

284
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,837
since I do not know much about her.

285
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,675
Should I go to Jinyowon?

286
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,101
Hello, you are back.

287
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,813
I will have the usual
and some honey biscuits too.

288
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:55,897
Sure thing.

289
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,575
Goodness, you are so beautiful.

290
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,910
We have many pretty ones. Pick one.

291
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,334
How much is this?

292
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,918
Just five nyang.

293
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,046
That is expensive.

294
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,132
Not at all. It is actually quite cheap.

295
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,800
Then three nyang.

296
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,052
-Three nyang?
-Yes.

297
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,636
I am selling this below the cost.

298
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,554
Three nyang?

299
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,680
-Yes.
-I will take it.

300
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,603
Goodness, they are fighting again.

301
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,646
-Here.
-Who were you with last night?

302
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,191
What were you doing outside
instead of coming home?

303
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,568
I fell asleep while I was out drinking.

304
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,028
You better not lie to me.

305
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,073
You were with some widows,
were you not? Come here!

306
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,241
-Goodness! I am sorry!
-Just die!

307
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,993
You scumbag!

308
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,078
What is going on?

309
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,330
-He is never home.
-You will never stop, will you?

310
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,248
You got it all wrong!

311
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,750
She must be so upset.

312
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,629
He is having an affair
with the oil mill widow.

313
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,599
Jang Uk?

314
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,104
The rice store man is having
an affair with the oil mill woman.

315
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,272
That is why he is never home.

316
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,274
He is a lost cause, right?

317
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,446
Are you comparing me to that guy?

318
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,074
It was satisfying
to see his hair get torn out.

319
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,242
Goodness.

320
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,286
But why are you here?

321
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,830
I heard you were sick,

322
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,332
but it seems you are fine.
You look ready to tear my hair out.

323
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,127
Did you come to find me
because you were worried?

324
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,506
You left without telling anyone.
That is why.

325
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,675
It is urgent. We need to go somewhere.

326
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,218
No wonder.

327
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,011
Where do we need to go?

328
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,147
I heard you had a headache.
You are neither hot nor cold.

329
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:01,773
Right.

330
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,985
I was a bit dizzy.

331
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,363
I thought staying home
would make it worse.

332
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,823
You should express it if you are sick.

333
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,491
Do not go out without a word.

334
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,577
Everyone at my house worries

335
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,037
and will readily take care of you
if you are sick.

336
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,458
Even you?

337
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,546
I am here, am I not?

338
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,887
It is hot. Let us go.

339
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,724
Uk, it is refreshing, right?

340
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,934
-I got it for cheap.
-Goodness.

341
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,103
She ripped you off. You paid double.

342
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,564
Seriously? She said it was at a low price.

343
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,442
-Give that back.
-Hey, come on.

344
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:46,985
Your Royal Highness.

345
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,612
Come here.

346
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,158
Leave this turtle
at Chwiseonru for a few days.

347
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,452
The sudden change of environment
could shock it,

348
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,454
so move its entire house.

349
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,456
Do not let them overfeed it.

350
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,540
Understood?

351
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,625
Right.

352
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,544
Do not say that it was from me.
Say that it was from you.

353
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,963
Why would you suddenly move this turtle?

354
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,759
I am showing kindness
to the poor Turtle Shaman

355
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,260
who lost her husband to a peacock.

356
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,262
I will do as you say.

357
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,639
But, Your Royal Highness,

358
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,850
Jang Uk and Jin Bu-yeon
are at the palace right now.

359
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,310
Why?

360
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,188
They want to apologize
for ruining the Queen's banquet.

361
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,898
Jang Uk is here to apologize?

362
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,276
-He must be demanding an apology.
-Will you be coming?

363
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,403
You were curious about Jin Bu-yeon.

364
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,529
Forget it.

365
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,531
Bring some people who can move the turtle.

366
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,575
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

367
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,500
I am the one who removed
Filthy Mu-deok from Jang Uk's side.

368
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,087
After what I have done,

369
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,423
I do not want to see Jin Bu-yeon
who took her place.

370
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:55,220
If we are here to apologize,
should we bow and brownnose them?

371
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,055
We are not here to apologize.

372
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,891
-Then?
-We are here to taunt them.

373
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,060
They tried to take what was mine,

374
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,604
so I will show them what I have.

375
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,106
And what is that?

376
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,903
You.

377
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,494
Do not bow or brownnose them.

378
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:24,040
Just look at me
as if you love me to death.

379
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,343
It was you two
who were in danger at my banquet.

380
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,554
There is no need to apologize.

381
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:40,307
No, Your Highness.
I am sorry for bringing Gwiseo

382
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,225
to a banquet you had not held in years.

383
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,102
But you see,

384
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,188
this woman is very precious to me.

385
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,607
So I had to replace her with a relic

386
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,319
since I was
extremely worried about her safety.

387
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,199
I heard that this marriage was not
approved by her mother.

388
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,076
But I guess you two are deeply in love.

389
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,662
She will approve of us soon.

390
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,249
I am the only one
who can protect her and Jinyowon.

391
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,918
You talk as if Jinyowon belongs to you.

392
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,420
There are just too many people

393
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,007
who desire to take over Jinyowon.

394
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,718
I will protect it

395
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,012
as my own.

396
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,560
For her.

397
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:30,732
When I grab your hand,

398
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,984
come up with a suitable excuse to leave.

399
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,528
-Just me?
-Yes.

400
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,447
That is all that I need you to do.

401
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,240
Remember what I said.

402
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,326
It has to be a suitable excuse.

403
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,291
A bee! I am sorry, Your Highness.
I am terrified of bees.

404
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,048
She is terrified of them

405
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,133
since they swarm
to the sweetness of her beauty.

406
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,389
She just looked plucky at the banquet,

407
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,516
but she is rather rude as well.

408
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,060
That is her charm.

409
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,105
She keeps me on my toes
due to her unpredictability.

410
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,024
You have a charming wife, Jinyowon,

411
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,027
and even the power of the ice stone.
You are quite greedy.

412
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,113
I would love
to use its power as I pleased.

413
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:21,699
But as you know, I am only allowed
to use it against soul shifters.

414
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,161
What a shame.

415
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,707
With my power, I would be able
to make your desperate wish come true.

416
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,502
That is right.

417
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:36,548
You can use Hwansu to shift my soul.

418
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,427
If you can help me,

419
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,929
I would not need
to summon another ice stone.

420
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:46,349
How would you summon another ice stone?

421
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,768
I was told it was possible
by drying out this world.

422
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,186
I see.

423
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,148
You wanted Jinyowon
so you could find a relic

424
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,400
that could do just that.

425
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,027
I finally get it now.

426
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:01,698
I knew you were trying
to hinder me by summoning Naksu.

427
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,909
But I could not understand
why you wanted me away from Jinyowon

428
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,704
to the point of hurting Jin Bu-yeon.

429
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,621
Jang Uk.

430
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,417
Shift my soul with your power.

431
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,921
If you do, I will no longer
have a reason to dry up the world.

432
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,470
I do not care
about what happens to this world.

433
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,305
But if you touch her ever again,

434
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,765
I will

435
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,934
use my power as I please.

436
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,903
Please relay this message to those

437
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,114
who plotted this scheme with you.

438
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,529
The recent incident has made it clear
that Jang Uk and I are enemies now.

439
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,155
Your Royal Highness.

440
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,408
Gwanju Jin Mu has asked you
to come to Cheonbugwan.

441
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,911
He is asking me to go there
instead of coming here

442
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,538
to see me?

443
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,332
He said it was regarding
the promise he made last time.

444
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,254
The first thing I will do
is to bring Jinyowon to the royal palace.

445
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,506
I am doing this for you,
Your Royal Highness.

446
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,427
I only kept Jin Mu by my side
to beat Jang Uk.

447
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,764
But now it seems like
I am nothing but Jin Mu's tool.

448
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,772
Are you headed to Cheonbugwan?

449
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,690
No.

450
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:01,025
I will be going to see Jang Uk's bride.

451
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,824
I think he was going
to talk about Jinyowon.

452
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:09,742
So why did he make me leave?

453
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,369
Why?

454
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,840
Be gentle with the turtle
so as not to shock it.

455
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,758
Be careful.

456
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:29,637
Wait.

457
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:33,308
Does that turtle belong to Eunuch Go
who works in the palace?

458
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,226
He serves the Crown Prince.

459
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,561
Right.

460
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,730
He is not Eunuch Go.

461
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,440
He is Eunuch Oh.

462
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,068
-Eunuch Oh.
-Yes, my lady.

463
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,945
I must have heard him wrong.

464
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,699
Eunuch Oh has ordered us
to move this turtle.

465
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,659
-Is that so?
-Yes, my lady.

466
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,040
So it really is you.

467
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,751
They must be treating you well.

468
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,711
Put it down for a minute.

469
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,465
You see, we have met before.

470
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,382
I see.

471
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,219
Goodness. How have you been?

472
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,180
It seems to recognize you.

473
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,901
The water is clean but cold.

474
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,778
Are you all right?

475
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,466
Goodness, it must be tough for you.

476
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,094
Your Royal Highness.

477
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,892
Did you change the water?

478
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,894
It could catch a cold in cold water.

479
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,730
Young Master Jang Uk
said the water was cold,

480
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,441
so he warmed it with his energy.

481
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,527
He took care of my turtle?

482
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,280
-And he knew it was mine?
-Yes.

483
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:14,158
I told him that Eunuch Oh
had ordered us to move it.

484
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,870
So he warmed up the water
knowing that it was my turtle.

485
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,163
Your Royal Highness,

486
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,291
Jang Uk must not feel hostile toward you.

487
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:26,129
If not, why would he bother
to take care of your turtle?

488
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,046
You are right.

489
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,091
He would hate my turtle if he hated me.

490
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,010
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

491
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,052
Where…

492
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,681
He just left with his bride.

493
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,892
I see.

494
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,644
All right. You may go.

495
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,062
Let us go.

496
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,944
He took care of my turtle?

497
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,531
What should I make of this?

498
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,242
Well…

499
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,161
Answer me.

500
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,418
I am sure he despises me.

501
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,712
So why did he do that?

502
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,015
I only did so because it was your turtle.

503
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,683
Exactly.

504
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,687
Why would you take care of my turtle?

505
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,605
Why?

506
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,023
Because it was yours.

507
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,984
But you despise me.

508
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,862
So why would you suddenly
warm the water for my turtle?

509
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,155
Do you still not get it?

510
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,741
Because it was yours.

511
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,704
Jang Uk.

512
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,208
Why did you treat my turtle so kindly?

513
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,834
You are only

514
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,671
giving me hope and making me think

515
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,382
that you do not hate me.

516
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,596
Thank you for taking care of the turtle.

517
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,890
The eunuch will be pleased.

518
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,355
When did you befriend a eunuch?

519
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,232
We met by chance.

520
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,692
He is a kindhearted man
who saved the turtle for me.

521
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:12,777
I see.

522
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,613
You saved a turtle, made a friend,

523
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,323
and even watched a couple fight.

524
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,033
You are having fun.

525
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,828
Only because you saved me.

526
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,621
Goodness.

527
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,874
Jang Uk.

528
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,380
I heard you got rid

529
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,882
of the tracking thread.

530
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,264
Thank you.

531
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,517
I said it worries me if you are sick.

532
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:45,977
Besides,

533
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,646
I thought you would go back home
due to the pain.

534
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,481
I will never go back.

535
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,241
I shall always stay by your side
at this distance.

536
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,631
That is my promise.

537
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,186
I will hold your hand as if it is a ring.

538
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,041
Jang Uk.

539
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,252
Let me explain.

540
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:58,341
When I woke up today,
I saw several memories.

541
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,677
They were as vivid as if they were mine.

542
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,307
I was very confused and flustered.

543
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,225
So what?

544
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,937
Did you grab my hand
so I could recall an unforgettable memory?

545
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,189
So that I could reminisce and be happy?

546
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,316
At least you got to cry last night.

547
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,444
Did that not help you

548
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,155
feel better?

549
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,574
I guess so.

550
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,577
I guess

551
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,455
I found another use for you.

552
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,376
I could grab your hand and touch you.

553
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,169
I could embrace you if I miss her.

554
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,297
I could hug you in my sleep
and not have to wait for her in my dreams.

555
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,676
After all, you are offering

556
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,845
to substitute for her.

557
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,229
Feel free to re-enact another memory.

558
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,273
This time,

559
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,192
I will not decline.

560
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,069
Yesterday…

561
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,699
I was trying to comfort you.

562
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,953
You seemed so sad.

563
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,166
And today,

564
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,211
I wanted to see…

565
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,132
if you had room for me in your heart.

566
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,429
It seems you do not, so I will stop.

567
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,365
Did something bad happen at the palace?

568
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,285
No.

569
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,164
Maidservant Kim, give me your hand.

570
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,082
-My hand?
-Yes.

571
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,000
Here.

572
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,597
You are dear to me as well.

573
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,057
Yes. Likewise.

574
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,022
It should have felt different like now.

575
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,360
But it was just too similar.

576
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:23,819
What do you mean?

577
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,696
Nothing.

578
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,534
What did you say to her to make her cry?

579
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,037
-Is she crying?
-No, but she was teary-eyed.

580
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,539
What did you say this time?

581
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:38,542
I do not know.
I just babbled out of shock.

582
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,877
Goodness.

583
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,213
I wish I could spank you
like I did in the past.

584
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,672
Goodness.

585
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,466
In any case,

586
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:49,178
at least you are arguing now
and not ignoring each other.

587
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,350
Anyway, if you keep mistreating her,
you will end up

588
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,352
-like a dog on a wild goose chase.
-A dog?

589
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,855
Did you just call me a dog?

590
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,357
Goodness, did I hurt your pride?

591
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,985
When she is upset because you chose her
like choosing a chicken over a pheasant?

592
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,239
You are unbelievable.

593
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,806
Could it be because of this?

594
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,411
I did not mean to imply

595
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,706
that I settled for you over a pheasant.

596
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,168
I only wanted you to shut up

597
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,587
because you made it seem like
that was my intention.

598
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:08,716
Anyway,

599
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,885
do not act like a chicken.

600
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,471
And I will not act like a dog.

601
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,688
What was that?

602
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,858
What did he say? Did you reconcile?

603
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,901
I am not sure.

604
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,320
He said I am a chicken and he is a dog.

605
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,119
Wait.

606
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,413
Was he trying to reconcile
or pick another fight?

607
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,540
Unbelievable.

608
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,919
Master Lee found several of these

609
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,338
at the bottoms of dried-up wells.

610
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,340
This is heinous sorcery.

611
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,052
Someone purposefully dried up the wells
out of resentment.

612
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,887
The shamans at Gaema Village

613
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,640
create and sell such things.

614
00:41:58,807 --> 00:41:59,892
It looks like a bird.

615
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,644
The drought is ongoing.

616
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,355
The lack of drinking water
will only worry everyone.

617
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:10,027
It bothers me
that this was found in several wells.

618
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,906
Dang-gu, go to the merchants' association

619
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:16,825
and find out if there are
more dried-up wells in the capital.

620
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:17,910
Yes, my lord.

621
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,329
Where is Master Lee?

622
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,582
He went to see Jang Uk
to tell him about this issue.

623
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:28,754
Then I will go and cook
Master Lee's favorite food,

624
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,173
spicy beef soup with plenty of bracken.

625
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,258
-No.
-No.

626
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,096
He is probably at Jang Uk's place.

627
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,849
Maidservant Kim will surely cook
something for him.

628
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,102
So do not bother
to cook anything. All right?

629
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,897
That means Maidservant Kim

630
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,400
will cater

631
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,402
to him.

632
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,821
They used to be very close

633
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,448
when he stayed at Uk's house, right?

634
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,078
He even briefly stopped
drinking chaste herb tea

635
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,623
just because of her.

636
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,084
Is that so?

637
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:10,087
Does that mean he had feelings for her?

638
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,840
I am quick with these things, you know?

639
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,884
He wore the scarf

640
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:20,514
that she had gifted to him
even when it was too hot.

641
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,350
He kept it on despite the heat?

642
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,269
That is true love.

643
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,437
Exactly.

644
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,401
Look.

645
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,945
It was just a fleeting emotion
that he felt

646
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,489
during his long lifetime.

647
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,574
All right, Jin?

648
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,492
It is true love.

649
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,704
It was the first time
he ever had feelings for a woman.

650
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,414
It sure is true love.

651
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,874
Stop that, you brat.

652
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,917
True love?

653
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,841
I was going to make

654
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,303
spicy beef soup anyway.

655
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,555
So instead of Master Lee,

656
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,769
how about you two come and finish it all?

657
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,771
You too.

658
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,526
-What?
-You little…

659
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,154
Hey!

660
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,582
Who is it this time?

661
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,136
Jang Uk, it has been a long time.

662
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,889
It is nice to see you again, Master Lee.

663
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:48,977
Are these the stone towers you raised
every time you killed a soul shifter?

664
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,689
It is almost too many to count.

665
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,232
Why do you feign ignorance?

666
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,817
You urged the Crown Prince

667
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,194
to reward me every single time.

668
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,365
Were you hurt
that I met with him but not you?

669
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,534
I did not pine for you that much.

670
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,371
But it sure is nice to see you again.

671
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,625
Is that Mu-deok's stone tower?

672
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,877
You should have been more meticulous.

673
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,963
It looks lousier than the others.

674
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,381
I did not raise it.

675
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,383
Someone had destroyed it

676
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,677
and tried to rebuild it.

677
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,262
Who? Park Jin?

678
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,389
No, it was a girl named Jin Bu-yeon.

679
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,642
Jin Bu-yeon? She destroyed it?

680
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,564
Do you know her?

681
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,024
Yes.

682
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,861
I saved her life

683
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,530
and took care of her.

684
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,583
Do not stay by Jang Uk's side anymore.

685
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,210
Mother, I am already married to him.

686
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,379
I will not return home.

687
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,593
Why did he choose you?

688
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,929
Are the rumors
about how he desires Jinyowon true?

689
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,640
That is not true.
It was because he needed me.

690
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,145
The ice stone draws wraiths to him,

691
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,105
so he cannot sleep well.

692
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,984
I can cast them away with my power.

693
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:25,282
Are you saying
you have regained your power?

694
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,618
I have.

695
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,454
The physician who took care of me
was right.

696
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,999
I am slowly regaining my memories
and divine powers.

697
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,091
Why are you not asking me any questions
when I took care of Bu-yeon?

698
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,222
She already told me
about how she was ill, lost her memory,

699
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,598
and was locked up.

700
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:54,102
But I had no idea that you were
the great physician who treated her.

701
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:58,565
I only agreed to keep it a secret
because her mother asked me to.

702
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,735
Then did you just sit and watch
as Bu-yeon was trapped in that room

703
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,696
with the tracking thread sewn into her?

704
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,907
There must have been
a reason for all that.

705
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,410
You have taken what Jin Ho-gyeong

706
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,871
has tried so hard to hide.

707
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,289
You have done so completely.

708
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,054
Let us go back home.

709
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,431
I promise to let you do whatever you want.

710
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,058
I will neither lock you up

711
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,686
nor force you to get married.

712
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:37,563
In that case,

713
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,524
there is no reason for you
to stay here and let him use you.

714
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,528
I promised

715
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,822
to stay by his side.

716
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,700
You are

717
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,494
in love with him.

718
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,294
Poor thing.

719
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,380
It is extremely painful
to long for someone

720
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,173
who will never love you back.

721
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:08,677
End it here, Bu-yeon.

722
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:10,804
I do not want

723
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,140
to stop here.

724
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,978
In any case, I married him
because I wanted to.

725
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,522
Is that right?

726
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,863
In that case, fine.

727
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,533
I would like you to bring him over.

728
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:36,413
-What?
-You must do that if he is your husband.

729
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,457
He should apologize for his wrongdoings

730
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,959
and show his desire to get along with me.

731
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,420
I will let him do that,

732
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,380
so bring him over.

733
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:50,177
He is not the type
who would do such a thing.

734
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,054
He should at least do that much

735
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,680
if he wants me
to approve of your marriage.

736
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,810
I am being generous,

737
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,522
so make sure you bring him along with you.

738
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,080
Jang Uk would not come, would he?

739
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,706
I heard he does not come home either.

740
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,542
It is natural for a man
to visit his in-laws.

741
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,171
But I do not know
if he will try to apologize and reconcile.

742
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,383
Young Master Park

743
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,761
would have happily done so
if he had the chance.

744
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:43,480
I suspect that this is a copy
of the fire bird in Jinyowon.

745
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:44,981
The fire bird?

746
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,859
The bird that was born in a volcano?

747
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,152
That is right.

748
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,029
The biggest reason

749
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:55,033
why Seo Gyeong and Jin Seol-ran built
Jinyowon was to lock up that bird.

750
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,703
Why are you telling me this?

751
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,664
Go there and check if that bird is safe.

752
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,000
Only the members of the Jin family
can open that door.

753
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,836
And you are married to Jin Bu-yeon.

754
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:07,421
She was kicked out of there.

755
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,049
Do not try to involve me in their affairs.

756
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,394
How would you summon another ice stone?

757
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,063
I was told it was possible
by drying out this world.

758
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,155
There is no need to force them together,

759
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,616
for they are already walking
the same path of fate.

760
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,163
Goodness.

761
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,290
Uk…

762
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:47,753
He stays

763
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,131
in the very last guest room
in Jeongjingak.

764
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,675
I wonder if he is there right now.

765
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,969
Shall I come with you?

766
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,432
No, thank you.
I have to speak with him in private.

767
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,496
Just do as you practiced.

768
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,214
Hold on.

769
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:33,632
Do not open this.

770
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,801
Just listen.

771
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,511
I have a favor to ask of you.

772
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,393
My mother wants us to visit her.

773
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:49,481
She wants you to apologize
and reconcile with her.

774
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,567
You should at least do that much
if you need me by your side.

775
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,364
I know I was just rejected
after trying to win your heart.

776
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:00,116
So you should know
this really hurts my pride.

777
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,869
I will count to three.

778
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,955
Open the door if you agree to it.

779
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,331
If not, do not open it.

780
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,375
And I will leave.

781
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,381
One.

782
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:17,551
Two.

783
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,720
Darn it.

784
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,818
I could not stop you midway
because you gave me no time.

785
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,571
And I had to open the door

786
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,072
to avoid any misunderstandings.

787
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,325
I was told he would be here.

788
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,745
His room is
on the other end of this hallway.

789
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:49,040
I had to muster up the courage
to say all that.

790
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,752
But I guess I will have to say it again.

791
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,047
I am sorry.

792
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,466
He is away

793
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,011
at the moment.

794
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,429
I see.

795
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:07,475
So how was it? Did I sound desperate?

796
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,940
You did not sound desperate.

797
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,359
Rather, it sounded like a threat.

798
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,277
Is that so?

799
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,990
Then I should sound more obsequious.

800
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:25,285
Why must you do that when you are
inviting him to your mother's house?

801
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,328
You are married, after all.

802
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:31,124
We agreed to let our foolishness slide.

803
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,375
So please understand.

804
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,586
If you ask me to answer that,

805
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,422
I would feel miserable.

806
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,862
This is from Maidservant Kim.

807
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,280
She said it was your favorite.

808
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,376
You do not even bother to thank me.

809
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,628
How miserable I feel.

810
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,507
You do not thank people, do you?

811
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,550
I bet you do not apologize
or ask for favors either.

812
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,969
What is it this time?

813
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,305
You always have an ulterior motive
when you say something unpredictable.

814
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:29,641
Look.

815
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,644
If you are free today,

816
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,770
would you like

817
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,856
to go to Jinyowon with me?

818
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,068
Did Master Lee tell you
to go to Jinyowon with me?

819
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,695
What?

820
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,655
I met the physician who treated you.

821
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,781
He was Master Lee.

822
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,032
Do you know him?

823
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:46,950
Yes.

824
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,995
He told me to go to Jinyowon with you.

825
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,079
He said that?

826
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,500
Did my mother talk to him?

827
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,586
Does your mother want me
to come to Jinyowon as well?

828
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,504
Yes.

829
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:01,798
Can you do that?

830
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,762
No, I do not want to get involved.

831
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,015
Jang Uk.

832
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,518
If I acted a bit more obsequiously,

833
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,312
would you come with me?

834
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,982
I already said no to Master Lee.

835
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,485
So there is no need for that.

836
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,365
Fine.

837
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,285
I was just trying to stay by your side.

838
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,288
Forget it.

839
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,040
I will go now.

840
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,318
You should at least do that much
if you need me by your side.

841
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,114
I know I was just rejected
after trying to win your heart.

842
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,367
So you should know
this really hurts my pride.

843
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:32,931
Hold on.

844
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,643
Why is she upset
that I declined to go to Jinyowon?

845
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,895
If anything, Master Lee should have been.

846
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,121
Where is Bu-yeon? Is she home?

847
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,499
She just came and went to Jinyowon.

848
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,335
-By herself?
-She said you declined to go with her.

849
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:04,671
I offered to go with her,

850
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,381
but she declined.

851
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:08,091
Why would you go there?

852
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,968
She must be so embarrassed and upset.

853
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,719
Her mother came all the way here.

854
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,848
She offered to forgive everything
and invited you two over.

855
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,725
But I heard you refused immediately.

856
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,104
-What?
-I sent her off with many gifts.

857
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:24,524
But she may never return.

858
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,234
Lady Jin said she could do

859
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,403
whatever she wanted
if she took the marriage back.

860
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,447
Unbelievable.

861
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,706
How dare you come here alone to see me?

862
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,667
You have the wrong owner
of the eye mask that I gave to you.

863
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,377
So I am here to tell you the truth.

864
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,754
But in return, please grant my wish too.

865
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:50,717
You know I could easily kill you
for coming here.

866
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,010
But you have a request?

867
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,639
-Let me hear it.
-Before Master Jin U-tak brought me here,

868
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:58,892
he had put a blood parasite in my body.

869
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,894
A blood parasite?

870
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:04,981
So that was how you had
our family's energy.

871
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,066
It has settled in the core of my energy.

872
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:09,861
Please tell me how to get it out.

873
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,655
How is that possible
when you do not know any spells?

874
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,657
But if that is the case,

875
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,160
there is no way to take it out.

876
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,579
I beg that you actively find a way.

877
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,624
As the leader of Jinyowon,
you could do anything.

878
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:23,666
And in return,

879
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,377
I will reveal the identity

880
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,546
of the real Jin Bu-yeon.

881
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,382
That is not needed.

882
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,551
I have already found my daughter.

883
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,469
That is not true.

884
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,555
The eye mask clearly
belongs to someone else.

885
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:38,932
I do not want to hear it.

886
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,060
Lady Jin.

887
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,436
Young Lady Bu-yeon is here.

888
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,021
-Right now?
-That is great.

889
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,690
I will prove that she is not the one.

890
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,488
Keep her in the annex.

891
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,448
Yes, my lady.

892
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,752
These gifts are from the Jang family.

893
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,559
So she came alone.

894
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,651
I am here, Mother.

895
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,779
I am here as well.

896
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,088
Thank you so much for inviting us over.

897
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,008
I apologize for my previous acts

898
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,718
of impertinence.

899
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,803
I hope we get along.

900
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,146
Mother.

901
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:09,522
We are here together.

902
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,904
My grandfather told me
I would find Master Lee here

903
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,781
and bring him to Sejukwon.

904
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,700
Is he back?

905
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:23,077
He never came by.

906
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,580
I heard he went to see Young Master Jang.

907
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,497
Well,

908
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,752
our young master and Young Lady Bu-yeon

909
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,545
are visiting her mother right now.

910
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:33,963
I see.

911
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,423
Is that so?

912
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,843
I will take good care of Master Lee
if he ever comes here.

913
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,179
No, my lady.
We were told to escort Master Lee

914
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:43,097
to save Lord Park Jin.

915
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,932
Is he ill?

916
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,768
It is critical.

917
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,103
The spicy beef soup
he made absent-mindedly is tasty.

918
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,939
His spicy beef soup is tasty?

919
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,492
This is

920
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,619
tasty.

921
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:12,627
My lord.

922
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:14,712
Are you all right?

923
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,758
I feel knots in my stomach.

924
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,762
I think I have indigestion.

925
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,806
You should go to Sejukwon.

926
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,265
It is not that bad.

927
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,643
But, Maidservant Kim,

928
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,854
should you not be tending

929
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,440
to Master Lee?

930
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,444
Please.

931
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,740
How could I tend to him
when you are feeling ill?

932
01:01:42,824 --> 01:01:45,368
I am sure he will be fine without me.

933
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,285
Is that so?

934
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,830
Where else does it hurt?

935
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,666
My head is pounding as well.

936
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,376
-Is that so?
-Yes.

937
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,335
Let me see.

938
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:56,421
Goodness, I think you are running a fever.

939
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:59,006
-Right.
-Shall I bring you a cold, wet towel?

940
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,678
You must be busy.

941
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,223
Are you sure you can stay here?

942
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,475
How could I leave when you are sick?

943
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,810
I will stay right here.

944
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,354
Thank you.

945
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:16,023
-Gosh, my stomach.
-Goodness.

946
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,359
-Does your stomach hurt?
-Gosh.

947
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,485
Goodness.

948
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:24,574
Do not do anything foolish.

949
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:31,414
I brought in this ruffian
who was causing a scene at the entrance

950
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:33,458
and demanding to speak with you.

951
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:34,417
What is it?

952
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,294
Please save our madam.

953
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,088
She is going to die because of you.

954
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,515
So-i went to see Lady Jin at Jinyowon?

955
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,769
She left this afternoon
and still has not returned.

956
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:53,686
Gosh.

957
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:57,440
She told me to relay this message to you

958
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:59,358
if she was in danger.

959
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,778
"Lady Jin's real daughter…

960
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,614
was the blind girl from Sari Village."

961
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,365
Tell him that.

962
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:10,161
If I die in Jinyowon,

963
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:13,414
tell him to blackmail her
with my body and that secret.

964
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,416
Tell him that he must find a way to live…

965
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,462
at all costs.

966
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,470
The blind girl from Sari Village.

967
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,431
Is that really what she said?

968
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,311
Mu-deok…

969
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:36,771
was Jin Ho-gyeong's daughter?

970
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,525
I do not know who she is…

971
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,403
but please save our madam.

972
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,866
How long has it been
since she entered Jinyowon?

973
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,147
The Queen told me to trust
and use you if necessary.

974
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:23,818
So I would like to entrust you
with something important.

975
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:26,362
I will do my best, whatever it may be.

976
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:39,250
These earthenwares are made
with soil from the southern volcano

977
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:41,502
and are in the shape
of the bird that was born there.

978
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,379
The bird born from a volcano?

979
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:44,964
Do you mean the fire bird?

980
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:53,598
A boat carrying dozens of these
earthenware boxes must enter the capital.

981
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:56,642
But it is not easy to bring them
without Songrim noticing.

982
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,606
Use your family connections
to bring them in safe and sound.

983
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,234
That will be a cakewalk.

984
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:06,360
You can count on me.

985
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,159
Uncle, are you asleep?

986
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,869
I came to make an urgent report.

987
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,581
Uncle.

988
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:21,334
My lord, please come out.

989
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:24,337
My lord.

990
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,505
My lord!

991
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,593
-What is it?
-Someone is outside.

992
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:31,510
What?

993
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,470
Gosh.

994
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,348
Goodness.

995
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,482
There is quite a lot.

996
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,192
What could it be about?

997
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,027
Wait.

998
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,238
What about me?

999
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,783
What would they think if they saw me here

1000
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,660
in the middle of the night?

1001
01:05:57,203 --> 01:06:01,123
What do I do?

1002
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:03,584
What do I do?

1003
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,255
I am coming in.

1004
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,549
What? What is it?

1005
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,302
Why not?

1006
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,978
My lord, we will go back for today.

1007
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,356
Go.

1008
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:30,111
What do I do?

1009
01:06:31,904 --> 01:06:33,239
They must have caught on.

1010
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,700
Perhaps we should have just greeted them.

1011
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:38,577
I am so embarrassed. What should I do?

1012
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,373
Is this funny to you?

1013
01:06:42,957 --> 01:06:44,041
It is just that you are pretty.

1014
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:48,004
Your shyness reminds me
of an adolescent girl.

1015
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,300
Thanks to you,

1016
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:58,431
I also feel like an adolescent boy
who was caught dating.

1017
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,560
They say being together
makes you feel younger.

1018
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,770
That is nice to hear.

1019
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,356
Let us

1020
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:11,527
stay together forever.

1021
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,919
I, Park Jin of Songrim,

1022
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,881
ask you, Kim Yeon of Wol Fortress,

1023
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:37,261
to be my lawfully wedded wife.

1024
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:43,559
I,

1025
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,270
Kim Yeon of Wol Fortress,

1026
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:49,940
accept the proposal

1027
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,902
of Park Jin of Songrim.

1028
01:07:57,948 --> 01:08:00,117
My lord! Congratulations!

1029
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,869
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1030
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,413
I guess they did not leave.

1031
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:06,540
I guess you did not leave yet.

1032
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:10,044
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1033
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,129
The day has finally come!

1034
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:14,507
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

1035
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,035
Thank you for welcoming us with open arms

1036
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,703
despite not being happy with us.

1037
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,872
Do not mention it.
I invited you after all.

1038
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,333
-All right, then.
-Then…

1039
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,211
please show us to our room.

1040
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:57,633
You want to spend the night here?

1041
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:00,636
This is our first time visiting
after our marriage,

1042
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,346
so we must fulfill our duties.

1043
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:05,224
Maidservant Kim will give me an earful
if we just leave.

1044
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:06,851
That is true.

1045
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,228
It is only right for you
to spend the night.

1046
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,567
But I have not prepared a room
for you to stay in.

1047
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,111
We are just fulfilling our duties,
so it does not matter.

1048
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:20,447
We will even be happy to stay
in her dreary former room.

1049
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,824
So we will spend the night there.

1050
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:24,326
No. How could I do that to you?

1051
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,288
I will quickly prepare a room.

1052
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,373
Will you do that?

1053
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,667
But then again,
I am sure you can find a room

1054
01:09:32,626 --> 01:09:33,919
in this spacious abode.

1055
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:01,864
I am grateful that you came.

1056
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:05,743
But we do not need to spend the night.

1057
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,287
Yes, we do.

1058
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:10,581
That is why I came.

1059
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:13,709
You truly want
to spend the night together?

1060
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,171
I only said I wanted
to spend the night here.

1061
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,506
How could you interpret it like that?

1062
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:21,592
How could I not?

1063
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,177
You said we had our duties.

1064
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,971
We have alcohol and a newlyweds' bed.

1065
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:29,058
Of course I would think that
you wanted to spend the night with me.

1066
01:10:29,141 --> 01:10:31,060
Sorry to disappoint you,

1067
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,937
but I have something to do here.

1068
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,231
Master Lee asked me for a favor.

1069
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,027
About coming here with me?

1070
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,196
Yes.

1071
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,740
Earlier today, we had a misunderstanding.

1072
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,159
Yet I did everything you asked for.

1073
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,371
Now, we must do what I need to do.

1074
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:51,872
And what is that?

1075
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,000
When it gets darker,

1076
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,002
I need you to open Jinyowon for me.

1077
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,798
What is it that you seek from Jinyowon?

1078
01:11:00,881 --> 01:11:02,967
If it is an artifact for the lake's rite,

1079
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:05,427
you could formally request it
from Lady Jin.

1080
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,804
What I seek

1081
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,932
is something even she cannot take out.

1082
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:13,519
Jinyowon will crumble
if it is taken from there.

1083
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,145
Are you perhaps

1084
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,023
after the fire bird?

1085
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:20,985
Correct.

1086
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,155
And I can only get it
if I take over Jinyowon.

1087
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,866
That rite that Cheonbugwan
had been preparing for

1088
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,161
was not to call for rain.

1089
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,457
Are you after the ice stone again?

1090
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,504
Did we not agree
to obtain great powers together?

1091
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,923
-That agreement ended three years ago.
-You are wrong.

1092
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:47,011
You could have killed me
and ended everything, yet I was spared.

1093
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,304
That meant

1094
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:53,809
that you continued to support me,
thus our agreement never ended.

1095
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:54,852
In that case…

1096
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,398
let me end it now.

1097
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:03,986
You should stop as well, Gwanju.

1098
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,946
If you wish to stop me,

1099
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:08,866
you should go to Jang Uk
and reveal everything to him.

1100
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:12,870
"I used and killed Naksu
so I could beat you."

1101
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:16,332
And I, Jin Mu, did that solely for you,
Your Royal Highness.

1102
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,129
If you cannot tell him the truth,

1103
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,174
you cannot end this.

1104
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,323
I had no idea

1105
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,993
that you had saved
and kept your real daughter

1106
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,748
by your side all this time.

1107
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,585
Who else knows about my daughter?

1108
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:04,838
Answer me.

1109
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:07,925
Jin Mu?

1110
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:09,676
People of Songrim?

1111
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,143
If you are curious,
you should go ask them yourself.

1112
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:23,607
Ask them if they know that your daughter,
the one saved from Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

1113
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,152
is actually Naksu.

1114
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:29,446
Ask them yourself.

1115
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:43,627
Hey.

1116
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,921
You can open Jinyowon's door, right?

1117
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:47,297
Of course.

1118
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:51,218
That was the first thing
my mother asked me to do when I woke up.

1119
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,345
By the way,

1120
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,556
what will you do there?

1121
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,601
I just need to check if the object
Master Lee mentioned is still there.

1122
01:14:00,185 --> 01:14:02,604
I am not dragging you into theft,
so do not worry.

1123
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,167
There were people walking by.

1124
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,670
I am not trying to do anything to you.
Do not worry.

1125
01:14:26,753 --> 01:14:28,505
We are guests here.

1126
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,841
We can tell them
that we were taking a walk.

1127
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:31,758
I see.

1128
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:33,719
You are right.

1129
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,390
It has become a habit for me to hide.

1130
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,896
Were you not allowed to even walk
around this garden in the past?

1131
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:45,647
No.

1132
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:48,859
I felt so suffocated

1133
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:51,153
when I was locked up.

1134
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:55,782
So I imagined myself sitting alone
on top of a tall tree.

1135
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,076
I knew no one

1136
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,579
and I was powerless and alone.

1137
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,625
I had hoped
someone would come to rescue me.

1138
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,253
And then you came.

1139
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:12,841
What…

1140
01:15:14,968 --> 01:15:16,220
was that about?

1141
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:20,849
That was my story.

1142
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,604
It was a thought that I had
during my time in that room.

1143
01:15:26,730 --> 01:15:28,815
I do not have
that stone with me right now.

1144
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:07,896
I must be going crazy…

1145
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:11,942
because of you.

1146
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:07,623
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1147
01:17:08,123 --> 01:17:10,042
Someone just entered.

1148
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:12,044
So-i, do you recognize me?

1149
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,963
Has your husband still not come home
because of that peacock?

1150
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:17,257
Sleeping separately?
That means it is over.

1151
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,760
No, I am also going to stay here.

1152
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,346
I plan to find my own room.

1153
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,474
I hope that makes it easier
for you to find me.

1154
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:29,186
All my pain and regrets derive from this.

1155
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:34,858
The blood parasite given to So-i
is now inside Seo Yul.
