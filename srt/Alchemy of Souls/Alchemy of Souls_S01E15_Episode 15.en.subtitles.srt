1
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,722
Master. It is me, Yeom.

2
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,933
You have been meditating
for 100 days as of yesterday.

3
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,310
It is time that you go outside.

4
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,108
Master.

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,948
Master.

6
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,745
Master…

7
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,789
Master.

8
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,875
Master!

9
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,794
Master…

10
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,588
Master!

11
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:37,555
-Oh, dear. Poor boy.
-Poor thing.

12
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,099
-Goodness gracious.
-Unbelievable.

13
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,811
-He must have frozen to death.
-It seems like it.

14
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,647
-I feel so sorry for him.
-Poor child.

15
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,940
-Oh, gosh.
-My goodness.

16
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,691
What is going on? What is it?

17
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,944
Oh, dear! The homeless boy has died.

18
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,613
He was just a young boy.
I feel so bad for him.

19
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,741
My goodness, that poor thing.

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,099
Master, as you have always wished,

21
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,353
I will give you a quiet farewell.

22
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,988
Goodness, I feel so bad for him.

23
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,740
He seems like an orphan.

24
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,325
Let us hold a funeral for him.

25
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,577
-Yes.
-Let us do that.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,703
Should we cremate him

27
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,955
and sprinkle the ashes
by Lake Gyeongcheondaeho?

28
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,415
-Oh, my goodness!
-My gosh!

29
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,958
Child…

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,001
Are you all right?

31
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,505
-What in the world…
-How…

32
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,633
-Where is he going?
-Where are you going?

33
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,351
Stop!

34
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,780
Child.

35
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,199
Did you just tell me to stop?

36
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,453
How foolish of you.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,623
I cannot believe that
you have already burned my body.

38
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,169
What are you talking about?

39
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,591
Had I been a little late,
you would have burned my cane too.

40
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,260
You fool!

41
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,139
You fool!

42
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,434
You fool!

43
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,520
You fool.

44
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,946
Master?

45
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,490
I only temporarily
shifted my soul out of my body

46
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,367
to test if I had reached Hwansu

47
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,827
after my 100 days of meditating.

48
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:09,207
But I noticed that my body was burning,
so I quickly entered another body.

49
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,501
But it is too late.

50
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,840
Are you saying
you are in this child's body?

51
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,134
Is it really you, Master?

52
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,552
That is right.

53
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,639
I am Lee Cheol, your master.

54
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,057
My goodness…

55
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,560
Master.

56
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,813
Master.

57
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,951
I am a soul shifter.

58
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,296
Your Majesty.

59
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,633
Did you not summon me today
to find the soul shifter?

60
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,510
I will do just that.

61
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,387
I can

62
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,389
recognize soul shifters.

63
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,884
Is there anyone else
who has seen your face?

64
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,347
This is an umbrella.

65
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,933
You can use this as a cane.

66
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,687
No.

67
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,024
No one else in the capital knows
that I am not blind.

68
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,236
People will think of this
as a fight between thugs.

69
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,747
You should have stopped searching for me.

70
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,586
So-i.

71
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,424
So-i, is that you?

72
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,051
I am Kim from Sari Village.

73
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,553
You have the wrong person.

74
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,980
We rarely ever talked to each other.
He barely knows me.

75
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,107
That man

76
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,150
must be taken care of.

77
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,872
There was no need to kill him.

78
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,500
Once he left for Sari Village,
we would have never met again.

79
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,668
But you did meet.

80
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,671
Sari Village?

81
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,883
Is that where you used to stay?

82
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,179
I lived there to hide.

83
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,392
I lived there for a while
to hide from those thugs.

84
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,689
Is there anyone else from Sari Village
who might recognize you?

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,734
I always kept a distance
so that no one would easily recognize me.

86
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,487
I was a thief there too, you see.

87
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,239
-What is that?
-Money.

88
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,492
It would seem peculiar
if no one took his money after he died.

89
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,162
You can keep it.

90
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,262
I did not want to harm anyone
from Sari Village.

91
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,526
Mu-deok is in the capital.

92
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,987
If I ever run into her,
will I have to kill her too?

93
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,201
Is Broker Kim from Sari Village here?

94
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,786
Yes, he just arrived.

95
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,914
He is in the last room
on the second floor.

96
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:49,987
Young Lady Jin?

97
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,707
What brings you to a place like this?

98
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,252
It is none of your business.
You did not see me here.

99
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,837
Young Lady Jin, by any chance…

100
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,508
Do you gamble?

101
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,468
What? Gamble?

102
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:16,097
What do you take me for?
Do I seem that vulgar to you?

103
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,723
No, of course not.

104
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,519
But you lied and told me
the jade was not broken when it was.

105
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,523
Given you are capable of lying
without feeling the least bit of guilt,

106
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,192
I thought you would have
a knack for gambling.

107
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,240
I came to buy tickets from a scalper.

108
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,326
The tickets to a magic show were sold out.

109
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,744
That is why I am here.

110
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,788
ADMISSION TICKET
SEOCHUN MAGICIANS

111
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,500
-You got two tickets.
-I am going with my mother.

112
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,335
Do not tell anyone you saw me here.

113
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,796
I do not wish to cause
any misunderstandings.

114
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,172
I cannot guarantee that.

115
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,800
I am not as good of a liar
as you are, you see.

116
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,428
So if someone asks,
I am not sure if I can lie.

117
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,640
But I will try my best for your sake.

118
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,147
Why did I have to run into her here?

119
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,995
What is the leader of Songrim doing here?

120
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:28,294
I hope he is not here
to get tickets to the magic show.

121
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,257
If he goes, I will not be able to go
with Young Master Park.

122
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,508
You must be the one

123
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,177
who killed him.

124
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,222
It was not me.

125
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,516
Why did you kill him?

126
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,975
It really was not me.

127
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,019
He was already dead when I came here.

128
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,526
He was killed not too long ago.

129
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,361
It was done in a single stroke.

130
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,947
Whoever did this is a skilled swordsman.

131
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,075
I swear it was not me.

132
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,869
I do not even have a sword.

133
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,809
I think they were killed
by the same person.

134
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,395
Who are these men?

135
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:14,442
They were a group of thugs
who recently entered the capital.

136
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,527
Did they come with Broker Kim

137
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,573
who came from Sari Village?

138
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,949
No.

139
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:26,579
But I remember these thugs
picking a fight with him a few days ago.

140
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,960
They wanted to know the whereabouts
of a female swindler from Sari Village.

141
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,628
A swindler from Sari Village?

142
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,505
Could that be Mu-deok?

143
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,759
Where is she?

144
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,141
She was right behind me.

145
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,978
She ran away.

146
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,823
What is going on?

147
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,409
What were all those bodies?

148
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,831
They wanted to know the whereabouts
of a female swindler from Sari Village.

149
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,167
Could that really be me?

150
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,338
What kind of life has Mu-deok led?

151
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,549
Did you meet with So-i?

152
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,801
I wonder what she did this time.

153
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,678
Do not get involved with her.

154
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,890
So-i…

155
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,101
Who is So-i?

156
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,148
I did not see the girl
who came to see you.

157
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,944
But she quarreled with the guards
and even slapped one of them.

158
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,946
So I am sure the guards
would remember her face.

159
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:46,033
Madam, neither of those guards
came to work today.

160
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,160
-They both did not come?
-No.

161
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,746
How strange. They never miss work.

162
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,255
We are sorry.
How we acted was no way to treat a mage.

163
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,383
But is this really necessary?

164
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,884
"Mage"?

165
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,386
You even lied that you were a mage?

166
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,097
I will soon become one.

167
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,685
One who is far more prestigious
than the likes of you.

168
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,482
How dare you talk down to me
when you are nothing but a fake?

169
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,985
I will continue to talk down to you

170
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,780
while you speak to me with respect.
That is how things will be.

171
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,247
Go after him.

172
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,748
That is your job.

173
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,092
Is there a girl named Mu-deok
from Sari Village at Chwiseonru?

174
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:48,512
Yes, I know her. Was she the person
you were looking for that night?

175
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,641
I had to ask her for a favor
and return something to her.

176
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,768
Mu-deok is not at Chwiseonru.

177
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,022
She works as a maid for the Jang family,
the family of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju.

178
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,065
She is working as a maid?

179
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,319
I guess she really can see now.

180
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,280
She must have fooled you too.

181
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,032
We brought her to Chwiseonru
thinking she was blind,

182
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,534
but we were shocked
when she opened her eyes and ran.

183
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,121
But she is not a swindler like I am.

184
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,749
How is she able to see?

185
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,254
Please do not kill me.

186
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,381
I am sorry.

187
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,176
You know my face,
so I cannot let you live.

188
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,595
Please…

189
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,289
If she was always able to see,
that means she might recognize me.

190
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,585
She works as a maid for the Jang family?

191
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,922
I should pay her a visit.

192
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,301
Mu-deok committed murder?

193
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,055
Several men died at the ferry inn,

194
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,808
and Mu-deok was there.

195
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,645
But Mu-deok is not strong enough
to kill someone.

196
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,605
Especially not enough to kill several men.

197
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,899
It was done by a skilled swordsman.

198
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,901
If it was not her,

199
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,612
she likely received help from a mage.

200
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,281
Do not tell me

201
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,951
that you are suspecting Young Master Jang.

202
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,328
I am not.

203
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,873
Uk is currently at the palace
with Master Lee.

204
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,377
Thank goodness.

205
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,879
It could not have been Mu-deok.

206
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,215
She has no reason to harm anyone.

207
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,466
Maidservant Kim.

208
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,928
How much do you know about Mu-deok?

209
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,806
Do you know

210
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:01,020
what kind of life she led
before she started working here?

211
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:03,939
What?

212
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,733
The man who died

213
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,444
was someone I had met
to ask about Mu-deok's past.

214
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,114
A group of thugs
who seemed to be looking for her

215
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,616
was also killed.

216
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,247
It was obvious that
she was bound to get suspected,

217
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,875
but she ran away
instead of proving her innocence.

218
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,501
One thing is for sure.

219
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:29,214
Mu-deok is hiding something

220
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,718
that must not be revealed.

221
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,272
The guards live over there.

222
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,191
But would it not be faster

223
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,444
to just draw a sketch of her
and find her yourself?

224
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,112
I do not know what she looks like.

225
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,032
-I met her when I was blind.
-I thought you were never blind.

226
00:17:56,283 --> 00:18:00,329
One day, you say you were blind.
The next day, you say you were not.

227
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,458
I do not know your reasons
but you live such a complicated life.

228
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,005
So you do not know what she looks like,
but she knows you?

229
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,175
Then would it not be dangerous
to look for her?

230
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,969
What if she killed the broker
and those thugs?

231
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,554
She might try to harm you too.

232
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,725
It is more dangerous to be suspected
by the leader of Songrim.

233
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,231
It will put you in trouble too
since you paid the broker.

234
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,565
What do you mean?

235
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,735
I do not know what you are talking about.

236
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,570
Good.

237
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,740
Just keep acting like
you do not know anything.

238
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,326
Someone is dead!

239
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,014
Guard Lee and Guard Jang are both dead.

240
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,568
What Hwansu entails is truly impressive.

241
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,864
I thought all soul shifters were monsters.

242
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,575
But in your case,
you gained youth and eternal life.

243
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,162
It is no wonder that

244
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,873
everyone wanted the ice stone
for the alchemy of souls.

245
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,418
Everyone coveted it,
which led to endless fights.

246
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,295
And that is why it was banned.

247
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,754
All right, Master Lee.

248
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,591
You say you can recognize soul shifters.

249
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,092
Take a look around.

250
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,512
Are there any soul shifters
in this palace?

251
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,196
I cannot tell just by looking at them.

252
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,448
If they do not show their blue marks

253
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,450
or run wild and get petrified,

254
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,619
they look no different
from ordinary humans.

255
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,331
Then how do you recognize them?

256
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,209
The fear of getting caught.

257
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,463
The horror of getting petrified.

258
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,469
I must bring that out of them.

259
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,847
So you recognize them by instilling fear?

260
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,724
I apologize if I disappointed you.

261
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,351
Instead,

262
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,812
I will give you a gift, Your Majesty.

263
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,940
A gift? What have you brought?

264
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,359
A dog.

265
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,319
A dog?

266
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,072
He is a very clever and gentle dog.

267
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,366
He should be in front
of the royal palace by now.

268
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,493
May I bring him inside?

269
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,703
You brought him as a gift, so of course.

270
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,664
Bring him in.

271
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,457
Uk.

272
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,834
I want you to go and bring the dog.

273
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,340
If you successfully bring him in,
I shall give you a reward.

274
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,081
Should I just leave
and run away with Mu-deok?

275
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,710
If I do that, everyone will find out.

276
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,172
And right now, I am not strong enough
to protect my master.

277
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,221
I wonder what Master Lee plans to do.

278
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,209
Assistant Gwanju, sir.

279
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,628
What is it?

280
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:26,678
Fluffy is the gift that
Master Lee brought for His Majesty?

281
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,474
Master Lee told me that
the dog will follow you inside.

282
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,642
But still, be careful.

283
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,730
Is it that dangerous
to take this dog into the palace?

284
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,482
What is the big deal?

285
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,984
It is Gwigu.

286
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,320
He is bringing Gwigu into the palace.

287
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,947
But Gwigu is a wily beast.

288
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,700
How could he bring
a wily beast into the palace?

289
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,206
Master Seo Gyeong,
who was my master long ago,

290
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,042
used Gwigu to find evil relics
that were created with sorcery

291
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,878
using the power of the ice stone.

292
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,671
Yes, I have heard of it.

293
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,716
However, I was told that it became useless

294
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,718
after Gwigu's pottery broke.

295
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,761
That is why

296
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:12,849
I moved the spirit of Gwigu
from the pottery into a dead dog.

297
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,686
The dog that will soon arrive

298
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,980
is Gwigu.

299
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,943
Gwigu?

300
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,573
What should we do?

301
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,952
How many of us are in the palace?

302
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,703
There are more than ten.

303
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,664
Did you report this to Cheonbugwan?

304
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,625
I sent someone there,
so they will be here soon.

305
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:08,822
We arranged today's meeting to make peace
between Songrim and the royal family.

306
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:12,826
The Crown Prince was kind enough
to visit you and invite you over himself.

307
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,452
But you wish to bring this wily beast

308
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,705
into the place
without His Majesty's permission?

309
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,790
He gave me permission to bring in the dog.

310
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,667
And right now, Gwigu cannot go wild

311
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,461
and cause danger
since it lives inside the body of a dog.

312
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,673
So it cannot harm a soul shifter
even if it sees one?

313
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,260
Instead, it will let you know by barking.

314
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,596
Bark.

315
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,806
Bark!

316
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,695
Oh, my goodness!

317
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,992
It is a soul shifter.

318
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,954
As expected, there are
more soul shifters within the palace.

319
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,587
What was that sound?

320
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,549
Does this mean there is a soul shifter
inside my palace?

321
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,385
It seems so.

322
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,597
Then why are you just standing there?

323
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,433
Get out there and catch the soul shifter.

324
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,394
Like I told you earlier,
I brought the dog as a gift.

325
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,356
I will leave it here with you.

326
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,650
You can use it to find
or catch the soul shifters

327
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,360
inside the palace, Your Majesty.

328
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,987
Take it away. We do not need it.

329
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,199
How dare you bring a wily beast
inside the palace!

330
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,909
His Majesty already suffers from anxiety.

331
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,870
Are you trying to harm him
with that wily beast of yours?

332
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,876
Mother, we were the ones
who invited Master Lee to the palace.

333
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,670
Stay out of this.

334
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:51,132
The mages of Cheonbugwan
are in charge of protecting the palace.

335
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,468
If there is anything made with sorcery
inside the palace,

336
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,387
they will be the ones to get rid of it.

337
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,014
I do not wish for a wily beast
living inside a dead dog

338
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,891
and the people of Songrim to interfere.

339
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,311
It is merely an attempt to humiliate us.

340
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,232
You must stop them, Your Majesty.

341
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,679
The son of Cheonbugwan's Gwanju
should be protecting the royal family,

342
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,723
but you brought in a wily beast instead.

343
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,685
It is Master Lee's gift for the King.

344
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,312
Please let us in.

345
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,731
I was told to safely bring him inside.

346
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,362
Is that so?

347
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,364
Then try your best to get inside.

348
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,825
Kill the wily beast
that has trespassed the palace.

349
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,289
If you successfully bring him in,
I shall give you a reward.

350
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,625
Damn it.
Is this why he picked me to do this?

351
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,697
Your Majesty, it is I, Jin Mu.

352
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,909
I shall get rid of
these insolent men from Songrim.

353
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,454
His Majesty has invited us here
and we are still talking.

354
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,581
Jin Mu, this is not
your place to interfere.

355
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,958
How dare you bring in that dog
without permission!

356
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,668
What kind of crazy act is this?

357
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,961
Silence.

358
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,688
Guards! What are you doing? Stop that man!

359
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,403
Father.

360
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,071
You must stop both of them.

361
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,407
If this leads to a fight,
it will end our relationship with Songrim.

362
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,950
We must fight.

363
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,953
Songrim has brought
a wily beast into the royal palace.

364
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,621
It is Cheonbugwan's job to protect us.

365
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,207
-Father!
-Your Majesty!

366
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,963
I order all of you…

367
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,091
to stop.

368
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,653
Stop!

369
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,586
Master Lee.

370
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,464
I invited you over for a friendly meeting.
Did you have to shock me like this?

371
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,674
I am sorry if I startled you.

372
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:24,012
Your Majesty, if the ice stone
gets revealed to the world,

373
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,556
a greater conflict will arise.

374
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,224
The ice stone?

375
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,976
Is it because of the soul shifters?

376
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,644
People have occasionally used

377
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,731
the remaining Soul Ejectors
to shift souls after the Great Chaos.

378
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,402
Someone seems to be
making Soul Ejectors again.

379
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,699
The ice stone has come out into the world.

380
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,915
So what are you saying?

381
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:54,167
Where is it? In whose hands?

382
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,711
Probably in the hands of those

383
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:00,298
who sent Naksu here and turned
a Songrim mage into a soul shifter.

384
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,550
I was told that Master Seo Gyeong

385
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,928
destroyed all the ice stones 200 years ago
after the Great Chaos.

386
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:05,929
However,

387
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,933
I guess not all were destroyed
and instead left in Songrim.

388
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,561
It is not easy to quell human desires.

389
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,687
However,

390
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,732
the return of the ice stone

391
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,069
also implies the return
of a great man like Master Seo Gyeong.

392
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,325
Master Seo Gyeong was born
with the energy of the King's Star.

393
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,036
However, he did not become the king.

394
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,122
Are you saying there could be

395
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,376
another person born with the energy
of the King's Star?

396
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,633
Even if he exists,
the light he emits will be faint.

397
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:47,929
And the energy of the seven stars
surrounding him will not show yet.

398
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,224
A power strong enough
to defy the laws of nature

399
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:55,186
and bring chaos to the world
has returned once again.

400
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,355
Thus, someone strong enough
to stop it should also appear.

401
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,315
That way,

402
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,653
the world will be able
to maintain balance.

403
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,414
What I am trying to say is that
there is no need to feel so anxious.

404
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,460
I hope this helps you calm your anxiety.

405
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,093
Thank you for your words of comfort.

406
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,513
Then I should leave now.

407
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,558
As you refused to accept my gift,

408
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,352
I will take Gwigu back with me.

409
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,064
-Your Majesty.
-Do as you please.

410
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,544
No, wait. Stop.

411
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,213
Are we leaving?

412
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,840
I saw everything that I needed to see.

413
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,012
Does this mean there is a soul shifter
inside my palace?

414
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,139
Take it away. We do not need it.

415
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,808
How dare you bring a wily beast
inside the palace!

416
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,937
They revealed themselves
after I instilled fear.

417
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,317
You must have been startled.

418
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,985
Are you all right?

419
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,862
How did you get hurt?

420
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,033
The dog did not get hurt.
But thanks to you, I did.

421
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,827
Did you get hurt?

422
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,997
I cannot believe you got hurt
fighting those goons.

423
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,874
He still has a long way to go, right?

424
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,045
Wait. I see blood. Are you hurt?

425
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,047
That is my blood.

426
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,423
He did not get hurt at all…

427
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,176
-Wait, blood…
-You are bleeding.

428
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,762
Thank goodness.

429
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,477
Does it hurt?

430
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,438
I guess it does.

431
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,400
It hurts. My gosh.

432
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,120
That Gwigu belongs to Master Lee.

433
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,540
How much does he know about Mu-deok?

434
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,501
And what will Uk do

435
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,378
if he finds out about Naksu?

436
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,096
Are you all right?

437
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,724
You are hurt all over.

438
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,559
I am fine.

439
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,353
Did you find the soul shifters?
What about the ice stone?

440
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,981
You have no idea.

441
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,026
My soul almost shifted
because of the chaos.

442
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:51,112
So you caused a scene
but failed to find anyone?

443
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:54,615
You should have at least
let the dog bite someone.

444
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,325
Uk.

445
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,578
Finding a soul shifter in the royal palace

446
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,997
is different from finding one
in Songrim or Cheonbugwan.

447
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,708
If things get out of hand,

448
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,294
it will turn into a fight
between Songrim and the royal family.

449
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,381
Let us go.

450
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,799
You should get treated.

451
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,509
Master Lee.

452
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,057
Please wait here for a bit.

453
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,226
The Crown Prince has asked me
to escort you to his palace.

454
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,104
-The Crown Prince?
-It will rain soon.

455
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,565
He wants you to stay until the rain stops.

456
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:30,902
Let us go then.

457
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,497
Uk, you need to take him back first.

458
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,082
Take him to Songrim.

459
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,417
Come here.

460
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,961
Come on.

461
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:04,811
You should have told me
before the people of Songrim arrived!

462
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,062
I thought it was just

463
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,523
going to be a simple meeting.

464
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,066
If the Queen is put in danger,

465
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,527
you will also get petrified
just like Eunuch Kim.

466
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,320
You useless imbecile!

467
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,543
Someone born with the energy
of the King's Star

468
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,920
who will follow the footsteps
of Master Seo Gyeong?

469
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,842
If it is revealed that King's Star
was created by sorcery,

470
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,719
it will spell the end of Songrim.

471
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,977
I sent back Gwigu to Songrim.

472
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,105
I apologize for startling you.

473
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,440
After a soul shifter was found in Songrim,

474
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,901
I figured there could be one
in the palace as well.

475
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,156
Last time, a soul shifter even tried
to enter the royal palace.

476
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,033
I heard the person who created

477
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,869
and killed the soul shifter was Naksu.

478
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,374
Naksu?

479
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,087
The female assassin
who killed many skilled fighters.

480
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,590
Heads fell to the ground
wherever she went,

481
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,550
which is why she was called Naksu.

482
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,220
There are rumors that
she shifted souls and is still alive.

483
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,058
Naksu, a soul shifter?

484
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,395
What an interesting rumor.

485
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,266
I hope Mu-deok gets caught
before Young Master Jang returns.

486
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,395
Oh, my goodness!

487
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,192
Mu-deok…

488
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,862
Why are you shaking?

489
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,823
Do you really believe
that I killed someone?

490
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,827
Come inside.

491
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,709
Why did you come here?

492
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,003
To pack your things and run?

493
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,130
I came to ask you for a favor.

494
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,925
The leader of Songrim asked me
to bring you in if I ever saw you.

495
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,094
Mu-deok.

496
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,470
It was not you, was it?

497
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,015
-It was not me.
-Then why did you run away?

498
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,101
The situation made me do so.

499
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,770
Mu-deok.

500
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,605
Do you have

501
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,400
some big secret you are hiding?

502
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,240
Does Young Master Jang

503
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,034
also know about your secret?

504
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,627
Mu-deok, I want you to run away.

505
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,296
I will give you enough money.

506
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,964
Run away and never come back.

507
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,173
I cannot do that.

508
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,719
I cannot leave Young Master Jang.

509
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,053
Why not?

510
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,433
Young Master Jang will only fall
under suspicion if you stay by his side.

511
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,851
If you are worried about him,

512
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,103
you must help me.

513
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,106
You refuse to talk to Songrim's leader
or run away.

514
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,025
What do you plan to do?

515
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,528
I must find the real assassin.

516
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:48,367
That assassin is going around
killing everyone that knows them.

517
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,458
Is this where Cheonbugwan's Gwanju lives?

518
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,169
It must be a very prestigious family.

519
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:03,424
Does someone from the Jang family
also know you?

520
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,347
Wait over there by the corner.
I will bring that person to you.

521
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,318
I am going to ask someone to testify

522
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,988
that I was not in the room
when those people were killed at the inn.

523
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,657
Who are you going to ask?

524
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,618
Young Lady Jin from Jinyowon.

525
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,204
I ran into her at the inn.

526
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,374
That catty young lady will not
agree to see you.

527
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,834
Maidservant Kim.

528
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,213
I want you to take me to Jinyowon.

529
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,424
Jinyowon?

530
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:13,452
I am sorry.
Could you pick up the cane for me?

531
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:20,876
Thank you.

532
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,296
Can you tell me where I am right now?

533
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:29,009
This is the house of Master Jang,
the Gwanju of Cheonbugwan.

534
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,971
I see.

535
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:34,098
Thank you.

536
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,612
Mu-deok.

537
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,738
Let us go.

538
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,498
I guess Mu-deok really can see now.

539
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,084
But she did not recognize me.

540
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,545
I wonder if that is a good thing.

541
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,425
Why are you alone?

542
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,137
I was mistaken.
It turns out I did not know her at all.

543
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,974
It is all over now.
Let us return to Cheonbugwan.

544
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,696
Can I try it?

545
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,655
-No.
-No.

546
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,866
Come on. Stop it.

547
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,868
I am getting all wet.

548
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,578
It is that umbrella.

549
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,121
This is an umbrella.

550
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,957
You can use this as a cane.

551
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,505
Stop it. My mom will scold me.

552
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,506
Stop it already!

553
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,425
-No way.
-Hey, kid.

554
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,721
Would you like
to switch umbrellas with me?

555
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,896
I heard Naksu shifted her soul

556
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:07,733
into the body of
a tall, well-built young man.

557
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:11,320
She could have shifted her soul
into the body of a short, petite woman.

558
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:18,035
If she entered such a weak body,
there would be no need to discard her.

559
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,039
No, I am telling you.

560
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,792
Naksu in Blue was clearly a man.

561
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,002
"Naksu in Blue."

562
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:30,464
-I have also heard of that nickname.
-He covered himself with a blue cloth.

563
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,635
It became such a trend
that everyone was wearing blue cloth.

564
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,096
People wore blue cloths
because they thought

565
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,224
Naksu in Blue would protect them
from the alchemy of souls.

566
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,727
Naksu may have been an assassin,

567
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,148
but she never hurt ordinary people
and was very strong.

568
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,657
People can be very foolish.

569
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,325
They are not foolish.

570
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,452
They are frightened.

571
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,791
Naksu's body was burned,
and they all know that

572
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:09,461
it was done by those
with power and authority.

573
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,715
Calling them fools

574
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,843
when they are actually scared
is negligence.

575
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,731
I gathered this meeting
hoping to think of a solution,

576
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:32,026
but you are arrogant enough
to just sit there and criticize me.

577
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,991
I understand that
you two wish to disparage each other,

578
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:42,244
but I wish for all of us
to get along amicably.

579
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,414
Master Lee is also here with us.

580
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,665
Let us drink our tea.

581
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,045
Your Royal Highness.

582
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,380
What is it?

583
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,553
Young Lady Heo wishes to come inside.

584
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,638
Let her in.

585
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,439
What brings you here?

586
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,983
I heard someone was injured
after getting into a fight.

587
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,194
I came to take a look.

588
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,615
There is only one person who got hurt.

589
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,576
-Take him out and treat his wound.
-I am all right.

590
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,161
It will not take long.

591
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,454
Please come with me.

592
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,511
It seems like Uk will get engaged again.

593
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,637
How many times is this?

594
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,722
-What do you mean?
-Did you not know?

595
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,016
You really know nothing, do you?

596
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,102
Rumor has already spread in Sejukwon.

597
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,897
You three are the top potential candidates
to become Heo Yeom's grandson-in-law.

598
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,149
Uk is the third on his list.

599
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,068
But I guess to her, he is the first.

600
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,987
Heo Yeom wishes to marry her off
within this year.

601
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,782
There will soon be talks of engagement.
I promise you.

602
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,792
The cut is not too deep.
This pill can help stop the bleeding.

603
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,711
Then you could have just
given it to me earlier.

604
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,630
I heard you were hurt.

605
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:21,093
I wanted to see for myself
so I could feel at ease.

606
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,888
Well…

607
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,893
You already got hurt from the many duels,
so I was concerned.

608
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,271
I am fine.

609
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,231
All right.

610
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:44,533
Oh, right. Maidservant Kim
gave this to me as a gift.

611
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,244
I have not yet been able to thank you.

612
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,330
It looks exactly the same.

613
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,628
What do you mean?

614
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,966
It is exactly the same
as the one I have seen for 20 years.

615
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,635
Is it a valuable item?

616
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,808
It looks new.

617
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,894
So it probably is not ours.

618
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,521
They made it look so similar.

619
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:16,690
Goodness.

620
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,318
The Crown Prince might be right.

621
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,613
Uk really might get engaged soon.

622
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,656
But to Master Heo,
he is the third in line.

623
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,328
Then do you plan to marry her
since you are the first in line?

624
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:33,415
If you get married,
you will have to return to Seoho Fortress.

625
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,002
Yul, do not get married.
I will feel lonely without you.

626
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,923
I can recognize soul shifters.

627
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,059
I must take them to Seoho Fortress
as soon as possible.

628
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,185
Who?

629
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:54,937
Me?

630
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,444
I take that back.

631
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:07,741
I feel very much at ease
after having seen how you reacted today.

632
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,952
I am relieved to hear that.

633
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,913
What is that you wish
to ask me for in private?

634
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,668
I know you took Naksu's sword,

635
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,753
but would it be possible
to give that to me?

636
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,640
I did watch the magic show last year.

637
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,475
I even saw elephants.

638
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,187
But I should act like it is my first time
when I go with Young Master Park, right?

639
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,815
So you got those tickets
for you and Young Master Park.

640
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,067
You startled me. What are you doing here?

641
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,695
I came to ask you for a favor.

642
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:45,904
A favor?

643
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,323
Do not bother.

644
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,493
I have no intentions of helping you.

645
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,203
I am being framed for murder.

646
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,080
What?

647
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,416
Can you please tell the leader of Songrim

648
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,544
that you saw me earlier at the inn?

649
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,924
You want me to go to Songrim
and tell him that I had set foot

650
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,759
at a place like that?

651
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,304
I would be mad to do that.

652
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,807
You are my only hope.

653
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,351
I beg of you to help.

654
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,606
No.

655
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,608
I told Young Master Park
that I had an extra ticket.

656
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,568
I do not want to reveal
I bought them from a scalper.

657
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,279
Your embarrassment will only be temporary,

658
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,364
but I could really get killed for this.

659
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,409
If my mother finds out, she will kill me.

660
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:35,245
There is no way
she would kill her own daughter!

661
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,539
Why are you yelling?
You came to ask for a favor.

662
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,587
Then I guess I have no choice
but to tell your mother what happened

663
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,714
and ask her to help me instead.

664
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,424
You are going to ask my mother?

665
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:50,385
There she is.

666
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,807
You did not need to bring gifts
to apologize for the past.

667
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,771
The more I thought about it,
the more apologetic I felt.

668
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,733
I will go and ask her myself.

669
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,734
Wait.

670
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,904
I will think about it. Come with me first.

671
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,790
I will be right back. Stay here.

672
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,833
If you do not come, I will yell.

673
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,418
-I will be back.
-Cho-yeon.

674
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,337
Yes, Mother.

675
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:26,963
Wait here.

676
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,663
She is a young girl.

677
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,165
I wonder who she is.

678
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:33,238
Is it because of the incense stick?

679
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,535
What a nice vase.

680
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:43,540
If you put flowers in the vase,
it helps them emit a stronger scent.

681
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,710
-Really?
-Yes.

682
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:50,005
I have been wanting to change
the vase in my daughter's room.

683
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:51,965
Thank you.

684
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,722
Mother, are you going to put the vase
in Bu-yeon's room?

685
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,724
It helps the flowers emit
a stronger scent.

686
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:04,478
Your sister cannot see, so she should
at least enjoy the scent of the flowers.

687
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,106
How dare you touch that!

688
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,025
What are you doing in my daughter's room?

689
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,323
She came with me.

690
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,866
She must have gotten lost.

691
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,702
Mu-deok, what were you doing here?

692
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,164
I am sorry.

693
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,126
Please help me, just this once.

694
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,046
Please leave.

695
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,965
You are not allowed in here.

696
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,758
All right. Let us leave.

697
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,180
I promise I will go.

698
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,725
Cho-yeon.

699
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,980
Tell the servants
to clean Bu-yeon's room again.

700
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,524
Yes, Mother.

701
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,261
So-i.

702
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,055
This man will be your father.

703
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,141
My father?

704
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,477
A father is willing to take in
a fake daughter?

705
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,484
I am not the father of Jin Bu-yeon.

706
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:21,031
Jin Bu-yeon's biological father
is someone else.

707
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,379
To be acknowledged
as the daughter of the Jin family,

708
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,340
you must open the door to Jinyowon.

709
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,843
And to do that, the blood
of the Jin family needs to run inside you.

710
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,057
What is that?

711
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,477
A worm that sucked the blood
of a female member of the Jin family.

712
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,376
That is the blood of Cho-yeon,

713
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:16,920
my beloved daughter.

714
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,966
What do you plan to do with that?

715
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,467
Give me your hand.

716
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,221
I said, give me your hand.

717
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,851
You now have the blood of the Jin family
running inside you.

718
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:16,354
If I do not use sorcery to keep it alive,

719
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:19,315
that worm will start eating you
from the inside.

720
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,235
If you try to run from me,

721
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,363
that worm will eat you alive.

722
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,123
That room belonged to her daughter
who died ten years ago.

723
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,876
She apparently drowned and died,

724
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:41,171
but Lady Jin still thinks
she might come back.

725
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,965
She is a pitiful woman,

726
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,593
so forgive her for slapping you.

727
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,766
By any chance, was that daughter blind?

728
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,977
Yes, she was.

729
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,481
The owner of this body
used to be blind as well.

730
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,609
Could that be why
I suddenly felt something earlier?

731
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,213
Master Lee wanted to talk
to the Crown Prince in private.

732
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:24,839
I see.

733
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,972
The leader has asked us
to escort you to Songrim.

734
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,558
Just me? Why?

735
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,643
Come with us.

736
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:48,738
Am I getting locked in here again?

737
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,074
-What is going on?
-It is--

738
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,118
We were told to stay silent.

739
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,120
Wait here until he comes.

740
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,091
Mu-deok was found near the bodies,
so I get why she was taken away.

741
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,677
But why Young Master Jang?
He was at the palace.

742
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:14,597
What is the leader of Songrim thinking?

743
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,682
I do not know either.

744
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,352
Yul.

745
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:21,563
Mu-deok would never kill anyone.

746
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:23,273
Right?

747
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,528
May I take a look at the bodies?

748
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,293
It was done by a skilled swordsman.

749
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,545
It could not have been Mu-deok.

750
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,756
But she is the assassin, Naksu.

751
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,468
She could have killed those men.

752
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,559
I have a good reason for doing this,

753
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,060
so just go on your way.

754
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,484
-They are those thugs.
-Do you know them?

755
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,030
I got into a fight with them
some time ago.

756
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,829
Can I take their bodies now
and hold a funeral for them?

757
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,505
What brings the owner of Chwiseonru here?

758
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,089
Did someone die?

759
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,634
Our guards got killed.

760
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,315
Young Master Park.

761
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,317
Maidservant Kim told me what happened.

762
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,612
Young Lady Jin.

763
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,240
Please help Mu-deok.

764
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,875
I went to the inn
to buy tickets from scalpers.

765
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,587
And I saw Mu-deok there.

766
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,715
But of course,

767
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:16,594
it was my first time
going to such a place.

768
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,263
I know.

769
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,850
We talked for a bit,
and right after Mu-deok went inside,

770
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,894
I saw you coming in, my lord.

771
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:30,275
And of course,
I never thought I would meet you there.

772
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,111
I know.

773
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,991
Judging by the circumstances,

774
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:43,121
there is no way Mu-deok had enough time
to kill all those men.

775
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:47,375
A girl recently came
to Chwiseonru and looked for Mu-deok,

776
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,918
pretending to be a mage.

777
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:50,503
The owner of Chwiseonru thinks

778
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:54,549
it might have been So-i,
the girl that the broker warned her about.

779
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,010
I once saw a girl
arguing with those thugs.

780
00:59:58,344 --> 00:59:59,596
The dead broker,

781
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,972
thugs, and guards.

782
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,100
They all had something to do
with that girl, So-i.

783
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,019
That swindler, So-i, seems suspicious.

784
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:09,147
In any case, it means Mu-deok is innocent.

785
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:11,733
All right.

786
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:17,322
I also did not think that
Mu-deok would have committed murder.

787
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:21,534
I knew it. You knew that Mu-deok would
never do such a thing, right?

788
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:25,163
Then can you release Uk and Mu-deok now?

789
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,498
The reason I locked both of them up

790
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,335
was to ask them about something else.

791
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,879
I will take care of it from here.

792
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,088
You may all leave.

793
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:35,340
All right.

794
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,526
My lord.

795
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,905
What is this?
At least tell me what is going on.

796
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,158
Mu-deok committed murder.

797
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,287
What--

798
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:09,457
She killed those who knew about her past.

799
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,673
Tell me what it is that you and Mu-deok
are hiding from me.

800
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,301
If your statement
does not match Mu-deok's,

801
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,221
you will not be able
to leave this Secret Room.

802
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,807
And Mu-deok will die.

803
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,663
My lord, hear me out--

804
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:50,081
This is not about the murders.

805
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,001
Uk has told me your secret.

806
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,546
He told me everything.

807
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:04,053
If you also tell me the truth,
I shall spare your life.

808
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,347
However,

809
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:09,517
if anything that you say
differs from what he said,

810
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:12,895
you will die.

811
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,698
If he found out she was a soul shifter,

812
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,742
he would not waste time like this.

813
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,411
He is trying to test us
by interrogating us separately.

814
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,581
We have to say the same thing.

815
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:36,627
What would Uk have said
to the same question?

816
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:40,548
A secret that ensures
that we say the same thing.

817
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:45,219
A secret that is private
but will not get me killed if revealed.

818
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,766
I will tell you the truth.

819
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,225
I will tell you my secret.

820
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,359
What happened?

821
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,321
Both Mu-deok and Uk

822
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,323
can be set free.

823
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:08,868
What did they say?
Did they say the same thing?

824
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,082
They both did say the same thing.

825
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,448
-You got out.
-So did you.

826
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:50,910
-I am relieved that you are all right.
-Yes, me too.

827
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,829
Thank goodness we said the same thing.

828
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,873
What did you say?

829
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:57,667
The fact that we both got out…

830
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,045
means you said
the same thing as what I said.

831
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,470
You separately locked them up
to find out what they were hiding.

832
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,472
I guess you got something out of them.

833
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,390
Tell me.

834
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,851
What was the secret they were hiding?

835
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:17,186
The two of them…

836
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,732
told me a secret
that completely shut me up.

837
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,196
They both showed me the same thing.

838
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,491
I will tell you the truth.

839
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:33,035
I tried not to let it show.

840
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,080
This is what I kept inside.

841
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,224
You see, I…

842
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,102
I actually…

843
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,694
I like Mu-deok a lot.

844
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:12,366
I like Young Master Jang very much.

845
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,208
I figured it would ensure
that we said the same thing.

846
01:05:23,044 --> 01:05:25,421
It was not crucial enough
to get me killed.

847
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:29,258
Right. Songrim's Book of Regulations
does not state anything about

848
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,719
punishing young men and women
for falling in love.

849
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:35,723
Exactly.

850
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:39,852
They would not kill a maid
for loving her owner to death.

851
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:45,232
You said that?
You told him that you loved me to death?

852
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,110
Well…

853
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:52,031
I just exaggerated
because I had to convince him.

854
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:56,827
I had no choice but to say it.

855
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,707
You had no choice but to admit
that you loved me to death.

856
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,627
Gosh, I feel so bad.

857
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,713
I was not as passionate
when I expressed my feelings.

858
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,548
I guess I should try harder.

859
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:10,800
Forget it.

860
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:16,597
Do not put everything on the line
for something as fickle as love.

861
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,850
If something like this ever happens again,

862
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,895
and you find yourself
in a life or death situation,

863
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,231
give up on love…

864
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:27,733
and choose your life.

865
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,737
Do that if you do not wish to die.

866
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,198
That is an order from your master.

867
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,371
Master.

868
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:42,623
What if I do not mind dying?

869
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,835
Then can I hold onto it
and keep loving you?

870
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:50,423
I told you that
I am willing to risk it all

871
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,175
and that we are in this together.

872
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,178
I will keep going no matter what.

873
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:01,183
So you should do the same
and stick to your confession.

874
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,311
Keep loving me to death.

875
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:47,730
If Uk falls in love
with a woman he should not,

876
01:07:47,813 --> 01:07:49,231
what would you do?

877
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,277
If I am to stay in love with you,
I need to be certain you are mine.

878
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,237
How dare you disgrace Jinyowon?

879
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,031
-This is too salty!
-They are perfect for each other.

880
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,407
Why call off the wedding?

881
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,242
I am looking for Shaman Choi.

882
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:03,162
If Shaman Choi was hunted by
the mages of Cheonbugwan,

883
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:06,082
are you seeking her because
she bears a grudge against your father?

884
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:08,876
If he comes, let me know immediately.

885
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:10,544
Even though it is dead, it is still Gwigu.

886
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,505
You are feigning ignorance, right?

887
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,758
It must be tough for you.

888
01:08:15,841 --> 01:08:18,177
If you must draw
and point that sword at someone,

889
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,554
point it at me before at anyone else.

890
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:27,770
