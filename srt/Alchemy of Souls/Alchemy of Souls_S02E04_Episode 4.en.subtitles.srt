ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

2
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:50,383
You and I…

3
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,385
have liked each other for a long time.

4
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,928
What?

5
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,350
I remember when we exchanged
this yin-and-yang jade.

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,520
You remember what?

7
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,564
Last time, you made up
a nonexistent witness.

8
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,317
Are you making up memories now?

9
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,988
"They are bird's eggs."

10
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,699
"I will choose first."

11
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,287
"I pick red. You can have the blue one."

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,124
I will choose first.

13
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,959
I pick red. You can have the blue one.

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,173
See?

15
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,966
I am not lying this time.

16
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,807
How did you know that?

17
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,477
It came to me as soon as I held this jade.

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,478
Why you?

19
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,105
Maybe…

20
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,901
because I am a priestess
with great divine powers.

21
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,950
There is no way that memory is mine.

22
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,077
It probably belongs
to the owner of this blue jade.

23
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,498
This yin-and-yang jade

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,042
is from Jinyowon, is it not?

25
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,004
I must have seen it there
when I was young.

26
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,466
I got these flashbacks when I saw it,
so I thought they were my memories.

27
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,344
But it turns out they were the owner's.

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,098
Her memory remains…

29
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,518
inside that jade?

30
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,858
I guess I really am a powerful priestess.

31
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,860
I can see memories that remain in objects.

32
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,075
I was hoping you would be happy
that I started getting my powers back,

33
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,412
but you came running thinking it was her.

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,998
You must be disappointed.

35
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,249
Yes.

36
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,127
I am greatly disappointed.

37
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,548
I will put this back where I found it.

38
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,904
It collapsed again.

39
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,407
Why did you raise
that stone tower in the mountain?

40
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:24,078
Were you not mourning her death?
Were you praying she would come back?

41
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,664
You really knocked it down well.

42
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,938
Do not try to fix
what you have already broken.

43
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,232
I really did not touch it.
It collapsed on its own.

44
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,149
Is that so?

45
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,612
So you were not using your powers
to merely disappoint me?

46
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,490
I am telling the truth.

47
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,535
I found this jade by chance,

48
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,956
and when I first had a flashback,
I thought it was my memory.

49
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,627
If you had come
before I even realized anything,

50
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,380
I would have been happy.

51
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,926
Good to know that I am not the only one
who is disappointed.

52
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,804
How could you think that memory was yours?

53
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,764
Because you have what was hers?

54
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,893
Did you get
any other flashbacks like this?

55
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:29,811
No.

56
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,021
That was all I saw.

57
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,068
Taking a peek at someone else's memory
is not exactly enjoyable, you see.

58
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,030
Take it.

59
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,244
Why? You said you felt elated
when you thought it was yours.

60
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,246
Tell me if you see anything else.

61
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,416
Like you said,
we liked each other for a long time.

62
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,585
I am dying to know how she felt

63
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,214
right before she died.

64
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,674
I cannot see anything else.

65
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,635
Let go. You are hurting me.

66
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,429
Keep the jade.

67
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,806
You will see more as you regain powers.

68
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,559
Are you putting me
in between you and that dead girl?

69
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,811
You did that yourself
by calling me with that.

70
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,319
Thanks to this,
I have found another use for you.

71
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,280
I buried questions in that stone tower,

72
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,240
thinking I would never
hear answers to them.

73
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,493
I might be able to hear them through you.

74
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,370
I called you hoping you would not come.

75
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,290
You should not have come.

76
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,838
So this is why no one believed it

77
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,050
when they heard about our marriage.

78
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,304
I was excited about nothing.

79
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,181
You got what you wanted by marrying me.

80
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,016
You escaped from Jinyowon,

81
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,018
found a place to stay, and gained freedom.

82
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,520
You are right.

83
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,484
I feel more at ease now that I have
nothing to look forward to.

84
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,361
I guess this stone tower
was your real wife.

85
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,405
I will make sure

86
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,365
to build it back to how it was.

87
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,700
Do as you wish.

88
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,726
That jerk.

89
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,230
So this stone tower is his lawful wife,
while I am his second wife?

90
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,649
He should have told me.

91
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,653
Then I would not
have gotten jealous of this stone tower.

92
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,703
This is all Uk's fault.

93
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:56,874
That horrible, mean jerk.

94
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,638
I should have known
that he was a rotten jerk

95
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,973
the first time I met him.

96
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,309
No, wait.

97
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,437
He would be "a rotten husband."

98
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,877
Gosh, I am hungry.

99
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:52,096
What was that? A wolf?

100
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,308
I hope there are no tigers
on this mountain.

101
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,788
Fine! Just come and eat me alive!

102
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,126
If a tiger eats me alive,

103
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,296
then maybe he will build
a stone tower for me.

104
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,624
I was expecting a tiger,

105
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,169
but bugs came instead.

106
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,428
Did I summon them?

107
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,801
Young Lady Bu-yeon!

108
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:39,138
-My lady!
-My lady!

109
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,390
-My lady!
-Where are you?

110
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,644
-Young Lady Bu-yeon!
-Please answer if you are there!

111
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,853
-My lady!
-Here!

112
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,230
-My lady, where are you?
-I am right here!

113
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,107
My lady, is that you?

114
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,401
Oh, dear.

115
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,870
We were worried about you, my lady.

116
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,497
Let us go home now.

117
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,040
Come on down.

118
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,169
-Slowly. Be careful.
-Thank you.

119
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,130
It gets chilly here at night.

120
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,176
Here you go.

121
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,639
My goodness. Let us walk back down.

122
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,182
-Thank you.
-Let us go.

123
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,935
Did something happen, my lady?

124
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,566
Prepare a hot bath for her
as soon as we get home.

125
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,118
I took care of the powder incident
like you told me to, Your Royal Highness.

126
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,204
Report to me if you hear any rumors
about the Queen getting involved

127
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,164
with sorcery again.

128
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,332
Of course.

129
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,459
But, Your Royal Highness,

130
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,837
why did you bring that to the palace?

131
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,923
I could not leave it to die
when it kept looking at me like that.

132
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,842
I was wary that the shaman
who suggested it would curse me

133
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,552
so I brought it home just in case.

134
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,678
A shaman?

135
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,763
Yes, some shaman.

136
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,933
She told me to raise this turtle
instead of having kids.

137
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,977
Who does she think she is?

138
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,146
How dare she say that
to Your Royal Highness!

139
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,480
She likely did not know.

140
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,316
She thought I was a eunuch.

141
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,901
-She must be ignorant.
-Then

142
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,362
I shall raise the turtle,
Your Royal Highness.

143
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,073
No, it is too late.

144
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,993
It already knows that I am its owner.
It only listens to me.

145
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,037
-It does?
-Yes. Watch.

146
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,747
All right, Turtle.

147
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,707
Stick your neck out.

148
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,209
Did you see that?

149
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,129
I see.

150
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,465
She said it had good energy.

151
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,844
It is very clever.
Next time, I should make him flip over.

152
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,222
But, Your Royal Highness,
turtles die if they do that.

153
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,183
-Really?
-Yes.

154
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:53,439
Turtle, do not ever flip on your back.
That is an order.

155
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,318
It is not flipping over.

156
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,403
That is one handsome turtle.

157
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,123
They call me Naksu, for wherever I go,
heads fall to the ground.

158
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,627
I will shift my soul
into a new body and return.

159
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,509
Help!

160
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,762
Help!

161
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,681
-Help!
-Look!

162
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,266
-Swim this way!
-Over here!

163
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,934
-Keep swimming!
-Come on!

164
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,311
Naksu is here!

165
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,481
Naksu is here!

166
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,316
Naksu became a grotesque

167
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,694
and killed everyone
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho!

168
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,237
She said she would shift souls and return!

169
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,489
Naksu is here! Run away!

170
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,117
Hurry up and run! Save yourselves!

171
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,410
Naksu is here!

172
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,369
Run away!

173
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,620
Escape!

174
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,872
Save yourselves!

175
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,082
-Run!
-Naksu is here!

176
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,542
-Naksu is back!
-It is Naksu!

177
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,044
-Naksu is back!
-Hurry! Run!

178
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,514
Yul, is that you?

179
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,644
What brings you here?

180
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,687
I came last night.

181
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,732
Chwiseonru is nice,
but Jeongjingak feels more like home.

182
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,613
What about you?
Why are you here and not at your house?

183
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,615
I also like it better here.

184
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,283
Should you not prefer it elsewhere?

185
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,410
You have someone waiting for you at home.

186
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,120
You must have met her already.

187
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,000
Maidservant Kim insists that
we have a wedding ceremony.

188
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,253
I am keeping myself
out of trouble until then.

189
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,341
So it is something to congratulate, right?

190
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:27,301
Truly?

191
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,140
How do you feel? Do you feel better?

192
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,059
You were severely ill before you left.

193
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,103
You still do not look well.

194
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,772
I am still tired from the journey.

195
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441
That is even stranger.

196
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,235
It has been days already.
That is not like you.

197
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,701
The air feels cold here in Jeongjingak
since it has been empty for too long.

198
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,829
It is hot outside,
but it is chilly in here.

199
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,582
It is probably because of me.

200
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,461
The ice stone attracts wraiths,
so the air around me always feels cold.

201
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,548
I see.

202
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,427
Then it must

203
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,472
always be cold for you.

204
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,439
Yul.

205
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,150
Do not pity me with that face of yours.

206
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,361
Hearing you comfort me

207
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,947
makes me want to fall into your arms
for a big hug.

208
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,872
I can give you a hug.

209
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,834
Come on.

210
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,628
What is with you?
What happened during the past three years?

211
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,257
-Were you lonely?
-Yes, I was.

212
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,592
-Let me hug my friend.
-What is wrong with you?

213
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,636
-Let me give you a hug.
-No, just stop.

214
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,762
What is going on?

215
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,931
What are you guys doing?

216
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,726
Are you leaving me out
because you both slept here last night?

217
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,853
Then I might just move in here too.

218
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,313
Dang-gu, Yul is being strange.

219
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,065
He used to be pure and naive.

220
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,776
-But look at him. He has become sly.
-Has he?

221
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,779
Yul was always as pure as the driven snow.

222
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,947
Has he become depraved?

223
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,199
Has he changed?

224
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,327
Have I changed?

225
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,372
They say you die
if you change all of a sudden.

226
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,671
It is good that I had a chance
to see you before that happened.

227
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,423
I am glad I returned.

228
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,301
Yes, but you will soon regret
having come back.

229
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,845
My uncle invited us
over to his place for breakfast.

230
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,474
-Tell him I went back.
-You did not see me here.

231
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,851
If you guys do not go,

232
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,644
I will have to finish
all three portions alone.

233
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,398
We are friends, right?

234
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,110
-Help me.
-What shall we do?

235
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,987
-Let us go.
-All right. Come on.

236
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,865
Right, let us go eat.

237
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,910
All right, I hope you enjoyed your meal.

238
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,078
Here is the dessert.

239
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,290
We managed to finish a whole meal,
so a rice cake will be easy.

240
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,084
At least this is it.

241
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,543
Normal rice cakes are boring,

242
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,670
so I came up with a name for this dessert.

243
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,423
These are called
"Leave-it-to-luck Rice Cakes."

244
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:15,886
Two of the three are filled with honey,
and one is filled with fish sauce.

245
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,346
Sounds fun, does it not?

246
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,388
It took me

247
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,099
two days…

248
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,018
and one night to come up with this.

249
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,229
Why did you even think of making this?

250
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,024
Eating this rice cake will tell you
how your day will go.

251
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,902
Whoever picks the fish sauce rice cake
will have a lousy day,

252
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:32,903
so watch out.

253
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,613
Go on and pick one each.

254
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,741
Fish sauce gives out a strong smell.

255
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,870
I inserted energy as I made the rice cakes
to prevent that from happening.

256
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,415
You will not be able to smell
the fish sauce.

257
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,842
You used your precious energy
to make rice cakes?

258
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,385
You must be bored.

259
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,469
Yes, I am.

260
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,180
You can tell how bored I am
by these rice cakes.

261
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,432
Go on and pick one.

262
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,643
I struggle with making
these kinds of decisions.

263
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,979
Then I'll go first.

264
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,830
-It has honey.
-I was going to pick that one.

265
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,001
I do not want to be the last one.

266
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,928
-It has honey.
-Why did you have to do this?

267
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,930
You just turned my day into a lousy one.

268
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,015
No, Uk.

269
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,475
Why eat it? You know it has fish sauce.

270
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,852
You can have a bite of mine.

271
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,978
You guys.

272
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,899
Are you not going to check
what is inside this rice cake?

273
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:55,277
You already told us that
one was filled with fish sauce.

274
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,946
Are you sure, though?

275
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,240
Yes, Uncle. I believe you.

276
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,785
I do not wish
to risk my chances just to check.

277
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:07,122
Based on the rules, this one is filled
with fish sauce without a doubt.

278
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,627
If we doubt the rules,
nothing will ever be predictable.

279
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,099
-Is it honey?
-It has fish sauce, right?

280
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,145
What was the purpose of this joke?

281
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,774
Life is unpredictable,
but you choose your own destiny.

282
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,526
No matter how sweet or bitter it may be,

283
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,571
you must taste it yourself and swallow it.

284
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,158
I forgot the rice punch.

285
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,868
Wait here.

286
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,003
-What was it?
-Based on his logic,

287
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,049
neither of you will believe
what I tell you.

288
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,594
I am the only one who knows what I chose.

289
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,555
It was fish sauce, was it not?

290
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,518
Here you all are.

291
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,603
What is it?

292
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,065
What brings you here?

293
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:18,026
A ridiculous rumor spread overnight,
but it cannot be taken lightly.

294
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,361
What ridiculous rumor?

295
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,824
People were massacred on a boat
crossing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho,

296
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,993
and they say it was Naksu's doing.

297
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,039
Naksu?

298
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,709
How is that possible? She is dead.

299
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,086
They say her soul turned into a grotesque
and showed up at the lake

300
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,922
and claimed that
she would shift souls and return.

301
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,550
The capital is in an uproar
because of what happened.

302
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,061
Everyone, here are charms
that will protect you from Naksu's ghost!

303
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,023
These charms will protect you
from Naksu's murderous spirit!

304
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,151
-Gather around!
-This charm fends off soul shifters.

305
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,485
Naksu will come for your body.

306
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,528
Protect yourself with this.

307
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,030
Sure, take one.

308
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,211
Protect yourself and your family

309
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,254
-from Naksu!
-Please give me one.

310
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,131
-Here.
-Protect yourself with this charm.

311
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:22,215
Here you go.

312
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,348
I should not be selling this,
but here is one just for you.

313
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,351
Mother.

314
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:34,936
You look fine.

315
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,651
I checked all the boats, but none of them
had suffered a mass murder recently.

316
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,697
That means someone is lying
about Naksu's return.

317
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,116
Ghost stories about Naksu
have always been around.

318
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,204
But what is this story
about her returning as a soul shifter?

319
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,500
Soon, it will be the third anniversary
of Naksu's death.

320
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,795
They believe she will shift souls
and return that day.

321
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,712
I see.

322
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,256
So that is why this rumor spread.

323
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,802
Uk must feel perturbed.

324
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,721
It really is

325
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,015
a lousy day for him today.

326
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,851
I need to know who started the rumor.

327
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,854
People at Gaema Village
spread the rumor now and then

328
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,398
to make money selling charms.
Do not waste your time.

329
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,526
But it all started from that unknown boat.

330
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:28,448
Can you find out who it was
that swam out of the lake?

331
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,617
Of course.

332
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,415
Rumors about Naksu spread in an instant.

333
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,835
She causes trouble even after she is dead.

334
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,964
The young ladies of the capital
are busy searching for charms

335
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,715
to protect their bodies from Naksu.

336
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,595
Everyone is so afraid of Naksu,
but do they even know what she looks like?

337
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,098
I, for one, do not.

338
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,516
Do they?

339
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,602
Some say she was taller
and bigger than most men.

340
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,480
Some say she keeps herself hidden
because she is ugly.

341
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,398
On the other hand,

342
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,609
some say she is unbelievably beautiful.

343
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,527
Really?

344
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,779
Back when she was alive,
she was a shadow assassin.

345
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,739
Then she hid in a servant girl's body.

346
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,327
I guess no one knows
what she will look like this time.

347
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:15,829
That is right.

348
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,894
People must be very frightened of Naksu.

349
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,479
Was she that scary?

350
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,273
Are you here to buy a charm?

351
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,862
I was just curious
since everyone is buying these.

352
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,615
If that charm really does
protect you from Naksu,

353
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,450
then you will need one for sure.

354
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,369
She will probably be
the most upset with you

355
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,121
since you stole her lover.

356
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,166
Though perhaps you could not.

357
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,670
You knew Naksu?

358
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,799
The girl I knew was a small girl
who worked as a servant.

359
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:12,260
She was feisty and unlucky.

360
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,513
I placed an order for 30 charms.
I also want a pack of incense sticks.

361
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,432
-Sure.
-I will light them on the day she died.

362
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,976
Were you close with her?

363
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,020
Goodness, no.

364
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,315
I would never say that.
I have a business to run.

365
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,569
How about a drink?

366
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,076
Madam, the Crown Prince is here.

367
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,662
The Crown Prince?
It has been quite a while.

368
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,498
He asked for the cinnamon and ginger wine,
which is what he used to drink.

369
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:46,127
Young Lady, I need to go and serve
a very important customer.

370
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,004
Wait for me in the corner room.

371
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,090
Do we have
any cinnamon and ginger wine left?

372
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:52,842
The Crown Prince?

373
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,312
She bought so many.
These are really expensive.

374
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,272
Shaman.

375
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,776
Turtle Shaman.

376
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:11,319
So it is you.

377
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,074
You are that eunuch.

378
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,034
We meet again.

379
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,038
Are you also here to sell charms?

380
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,083
I see you are making money
selling such paltry items.

381
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,168
The owner here bought these.

382
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,255
You sold everything?
You must have made some money.

383
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,882
You can use that money to buy that turtle.

384
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,885
Did you not buy it that day?

385
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,512
You just left it there?

386
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,055
What is so bad about that?

387
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,349
Why would I buy something so useless?

388
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,561
I told you it had good energy.
It was cute too.

389
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:45,770
Cute, my foot.

390
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,108
Do you even know
what kind of pets I already own?

391
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,319
I own a peacock and a white horse.

392
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,987
They are more impressive
than mere turtles.

393
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,447
I see.

394
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,577
A turtle may not be that impressive

395
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,705
if he has something else in his heart.

396
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,959
I guess I cannot resent him

397
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,004
for abandoning me.

398
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,382
What?

399
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,176
Did someone abandon you?

400
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,472
My husband left and is not returning home.

401
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,473
Your husband?

402
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
Why?

403
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,689
I see.

404
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,692
Your husband must have
a peacock of his own.

405
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,406
I apologize for making you buy the turtle

406
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,950
when you already have something you like.

407
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,162
It may be dead,
but I should check if it is still there.

408
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,539
It is no longer there.

409
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,333
I took it home.

410
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,876
You said it had good energy.

411
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,129
I took it home
and found that it was clever and cute.

412
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,840
It still is nothing
compared to my peacock.

413
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,384
But it has its own charm.

414
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,720
So you should also

415
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:02,847
keep your chin up.

416
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,308
I was right.

417
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,645
You really are a good person.

418
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,775
Whatever.

419
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,029
How is the turtle? Is it doing well?

420
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,533
Do you miss it? Would you like to see it?

421
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,660
If so, I could bring the turtle here.

422
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,453
Can you really?

423
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,789
I am assuming you came here
with the Crown Prince.

424
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,874
Are you allowed to do that?

425
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,584
Oh, the Crown Prince…

426
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,506
His Royal Highness will not mind it.

427
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:40,093
He seems like a kind man.

428
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:45,140
I will leave the turtle here for a bit,
so drop by and take a look.

429
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,307
I will.

430
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,685
I should be off now.

431
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,937
You should also get going, Eunuch.

432
00:28:58,945 --> 00:28:59,863
Your Royal Highness.

433
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,115
Do you feel better?

434
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,867
They found cinnamon and ginger wine.

435
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,993
Let us go in.

436
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:06,953
Forget it.

437
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,498
I feel better after a short chat.
Let us return to the palace.

438
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,461
If we go back now, Jang Uk will be there.

439
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:17,839
His Majesty summoned him
to discuss the Naksu rumor.

440
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,048
Jang Uk?

441
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,301
Why are you telling me that now? Move.

442
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,471
Well, you wanted to come for a drink.

443
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,723
Your Royal Highness!
Are you on your way to see Jang Uk?

444
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:27,724
Your Royal Highness!

445
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,817
They say Naksu the grotesque appeared
at Lake Gyeongcheondaeho.

446
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,944
The boats that need to cross
are stuck there,

447
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,697
and it has been
causing transportation problems.

448
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,283
Jang Uk, I want you
to get rid of the grotesque

449
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,993
and set the people's minds at ease.

450
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,579
If I get involved to get rid of something
that does not even exist,

451
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,624
it will only cause people to think
that it really does exist.

452
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:59,088
I also do not believe the rumors,
but things are getting out of hand.

453
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,800
Let them talk.
It will die away sooner or later.

454
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,845
But, Your Majesty,

455
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,847
if Jang Uk does not take action,

456
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,601
I am afraid it might cause people
to become even more anxious.

457
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,144
How so?

458
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,063
The soul shifter that appeared this time

459
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,067
is different from the soul shifters
that he previously got rid of.

460
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,486
She is Naksu.

461
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,409
Jang Uk, you and Naksu
were betrothed to each other.

462
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,412
Everyone in Daeho Fortress
knows that fact.

463
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:33,957
Your Majesty,

464
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,835
that is what concerns me.

465
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,462
I am afraid that people might think

466
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,507
that he is refusing to get involved not
because it does not exist

467
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,300
but because he still cares for her.

468
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,221
During the past three years,
Jang Uk used the power of the ice stone

469
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,765
to get rid of soul shifters
with the Unanimous Assembly's permission.

470
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,976
People were afraid
of the power he possessed,

471
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,353
but they believed he would
protect them from sorcery.

472
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,440
But they might start doubting that
because of this rumor about Naksu.

473
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,151
That is what worries me.

474
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,029
Jin Mu has a point.

475
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,284
Jang Uk, I want you to do your best
to get rid of Naksu the grotesque

476
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,452
to subdue any unnecessary concerns.

477
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,209
Yes, Your Majesty.

478
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,378
If you are so worried,

479
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,881
I will catch her myself.

480
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,551
I give you my word.

481
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,928
I will take my leave.

482
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,220
How can he get rid of something
that does not exist?

483
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,513
Exactly.

484
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:16,059
Naksu does not exist,
so he cannot get rid of her.

485
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:20,647
However, Jang Uk will forever
be haunted by her.

486
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,525
People believe Naksu will shift souls
and return to Jang Uk.

487
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:29,072
Every soul shifter that appears before him
will be considered to be Naksu.

488
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,824
And if that soul shifter kills anyone,

489
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:36,287
the blame will not only be placed on Naksu
but on Jang Uk as well.

490
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:41,501
Jang Uk will constantly chase after Naksu
although she does not exist,

491
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,336
and it will never end.

492
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:47,131
People's fear, doubts, and concerns
will keep him trapped

493
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,008
in a vicious cycle.

494
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,182
You are going to bind Jang Uk
by using Naksu against him.

495
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,434
I am doing this for you,
Your Royal Highness.

496
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,728
The first thing I will do

497
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,898
is to bring Jinyowon to the royal palace.

498
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
Jinyowon?

499
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,696
I cannot let Jang Uk marry Jin Bu-yeon,
the heir to Jinyowon.

500
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:14,033
Naksu will help us separate the two.

501
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:24,794
I found the man who saw Naksu on that boat
and swam back to land.

502
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:25,920
Who was it?

503
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,424
It was a man named Byeong-gu.
He did odd jobs on the boat.

504
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,592
I think he spread the rumor

505
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,595
after he was paid by shamans
who make money selling charms.

506
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,266
He swam out of Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
in the middle of the night.

507
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,977
That is what helped spread the rumor.

508
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,648
He could not have risked his life
just to help spread a false rumor.

509
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,942
They say he gambles every chance he gets.

510
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,611
I will search the gambling houses
in the capital.

511
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,631
Leave Daeho Fortress for now.

512
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,553
Do not come back
until the sixth of next month.

513
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,430
Is that when Naksu died?

514
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,973
Is she really

515
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,142
going to shift souls and return that day?

516
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,358
If she really does come back,

517
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,693
I would like to meet her.

518
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,572
I have a lot of questions I need to ask.

519
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,832
I think I have heard enough
about their relationship.

520
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,375
You can stop.

521
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,587
This is where they first met each other.

522
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,297
He proposed to her here as well.

523
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,967
I know what happened between the two.

524
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,053
I have heard enough. Just stop.

525
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,680
One time when she was drunk,

526
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,558
Young Master Jang came
and carried her home himself.

527
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,104
She always took these honey biscuits home

528
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:09,107
because she knew how much he liked them.

529
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,172
Here. Let us drink.

530
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,224
Once again, I was summoned to the palace
by His Majesty the King

531
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,809
and my cousin, the Queen.

532
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,353
Yesterday, I drank tea with Gwanju Jin Mu.

533
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:50,690
Then you will not be returning
to Seoho Fortress?

534
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:55,444
Jeongjingak was established by Master Seo,
a member of the Seo family.

535
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,696
But since it is in ruins,

536
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,489
I plan to restore it
as a member of the Seo family.

537
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,866
Jeongjingak?

538
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,325
You are incredible.

539
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,786
That is my plan.

540
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,122
I still need to talk to the Queen.

541
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,710
Where is the owner?

542
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,253
I am here to treat my guests.

543
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:16,090
She is with Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

544
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,842
Jin Bu-yeon?

545
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,266
This is where he met and proposed to her?

546
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,851
I should not have heard any of that.

547
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,900
Marry me.

548
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:38,821
What was that?

549
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,206
It was her memory.

550
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,793
Her memories really do keep
coming back to me.

551
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,215
My lady.

552
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,883
Someone wishes to see you.

553
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,968
He says you are both acquainted.

554
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,020
Yul.

555
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,231
Hey, long time no see.

556
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,193
Uncle Yun-o,

557
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,820
are you not heading back
to Seoho Fortress early tomorrow?

558
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,781
I have decided to stay
in the capital for a bit.

559
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,366
Yul, come sit down.

560
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,117
I only came to say goodbye.

561
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,245
I said sit.

562
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,705
You are in for something fun.

563
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,416
You know Jin Bu-yeon,
the girl I almost married, right?

564
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,085
I heard she was here,
so I called her over.

565
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,586
He says she is a little dull,

566
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,422
but he had decided to marry her
because she was pretty.

567
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,550
We were curious about her,
so he called her over to show her to us.

568
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,262
If a woman shows up to meet
the man she was previously betrothed to,

569
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,264
that would really mean she is daft.

570
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,643
You all seem to have
misunderstood my uncle.

571
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,230
He was extremely excited

572
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,732
to become the son-in-law
of the great Jin family.

573
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,694
But the wedding got canceled
on the day of the ceremony.

574
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,656
You have no idea how disappointed he was
that the marriage fell through.

575
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,285
But you asked if he could show her to you?

576
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,081
Think about how upset and sad
he will feel if he sees her right now.

577
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,003
Uncle,

578
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,631
allow me to apologize
on behalf of my friends

579
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,384
for putting you in an awkward spot.

580
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,699
Did you call for me?

581
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,034
Yes, I did.

582
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:51,329
The night is late. Let us leave.

583
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,042
The evening only just started.

584
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,377
Did you call for me to walk me home?

585
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,295
Yes.

586
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,257
Will you not get lost tonight?

587
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,815
I apologize.

588
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,818
I was a bit worked up earlier.

589
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,487
I lost my way again.

590
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,364
You lost your way a long time ago.

591
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,241
But I stayed quiet to help you cool down.

592
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,788
By any chance,

593
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,374
are you not feeling well?

594
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,087
Like I said, I can see energy.

595
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,299
Why is there something strange
inside your body?

596
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,178
With that in your body, things could get--

597
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,262
Please just ignore it.

598
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,100
Please.

599
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,227
Leaving your illness untreated
is a foolish thing to do.

600
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,648
We promised

601
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,900
to be two foolish friends.

602
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,489
Please let my foolishness slide
as a friend.

603
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,759
Would you like some?
I packed them because they were delicious.

604
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,431
Eating something sweet
will make you feel better.

605
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,019
Uk loves honey biscuits.

606
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,271
I know.

607
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,315
That is why I packed them.

608
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,655
What kind of snacks do you like?

609
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,534
I like pine pollen tea snacks.

610
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:54,910
Really?

611
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:57,371
You have expensive tastes.

612
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,055
I once had

613
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,809
a similar conversation with someone.

614
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,147
Did that person ever treat you
to pine pollen tea snacks?

615
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,399
Come to think of it…

616
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,860
she never did.

617
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,915
What are you doing here?

618
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,669
The King gave you orders.
You should be by the lake.

619
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,715
That could not have come from there.

620
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:54,053
Still, the people are scared.
Not a single boat has sailed recently.

621
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,972
Move. You are in my space.

622
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,349
I am going to bed.

623
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,976
Right…

624
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,314
Are you going to sleep here?

625
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,526
-No way.
-I am not here to sleep.

626
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,361
What is wrong?

627
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,696
Are you so excited
that you cannot even sleep?

628
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,323
Because they say Naksu is coming back?

629
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,327
What are you staring at?

630
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,497
You built a stone tower
and waited for her.

631
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,168
That no longer exists. It collapsed.

632
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,253
Uk.

633
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,632
Did you change your mind
because of what I said?

634
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,591
Of course not.

635
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,219
Jin Bu-yeon smashed it down.

636
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,432
Actions really do speak louder than words.

637
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,269
She promised to protect you,
and she is doing it well.

638
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,272
That is what she said
when she first came to see us.

639
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,899
She said she would protect you.

640
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:55,197
Get out of here.
Go home and protect your wife.

641
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,450
I was making dumplings in the kitchen,

642
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,161
and all the ladies there were concerned

643
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,000
that your bride will be the first person
that Naksu goes after when she appears.

644
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,295
They say ghosts also get jealous.

645
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,257
Is that what they were after?

646
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:17,970
What?

647
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,182
My lord, I will eat all of your dumplings.

648
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,476
So let me sleep here tonight.

649
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,978
I have another favor to ask.

650
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:27,855
Sure.

651
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,943
Uk, I will go and steam some dumplings.

652
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,778
Let us take our time talking.

653
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,904
Goodness.

654
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,198
Fifty or a hundred?

655
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,992
First, I will bring 50.

656
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,214
Your Majesty,

657
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,676
I would like to hold a banquet
outside the palace walls.

658
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,679
I thought you did not wish to meet anyone
while you were in that body.

659
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:02,973
What banquet?

660
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:08,520
I heard young ladies are scared
to leave their homes because of Naksu.

661
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,817
It is ridiculous that the entire capital
is afraid of Naksu.

662
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,655
So you wish to alleviate the situation
by holding a banquet?

663
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:22,242
I plan to hold it
on the day Naksu supposedly returns.

664
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:28,082
It will be held outdoors with young ladies
who believe Naksu is after them,

665
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,043
and we will enjoy a beautiful

666
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,962
and extravagant banquet together.

667
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,884
The Queen has invited
Young Lady Jin Bu-yeon

668
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,344
to her banquet.

669
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,262
The Queen's banquet?

670
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,889
She has not held one in years.

671
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,562
I was invited?

672
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,147
Yes, my lady.

673
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,777
Every time I went to the Queen's banquet
with Madam Do-hwa,

674
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,656
it always felt great
to watch everyone fix their eyes

675
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,658
on the person I helped doll up.

676
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,119
I will get to feel that once again.

677
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,539
We do not have much time.

678
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,667
It is time to get busy.

679
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,505
We need to find the right outfit first.

680
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,591
We must get Dressmaker Cho's outfits
before anyone else does.

681
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,885
Mr. Lee!

682
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,101
Fetch the next one.

683
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,894
Very nice.

684
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,521
That one is beautiful too.

685
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:33,564
No.

686
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,899
That will not do!

687
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,234
Did Dressmaker Cho truly make that?

688
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,653
Yes, very nice.

689
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,494
Is it too much?

690
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,456
It is out of fashion.

691
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:57,921
It is too racy.

692
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,592
You look pretty in everything.

693
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,344
How are we going to choose
out of all these outfits?

694
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,014
My goodness, this is just the beginning.

695
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,725
You should at least try on 30 outfits
before choosing.

696
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,435
What? 30?

697
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,688
Help her try this one.

698
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,898
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

699
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:28,952
Hey.

700
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:29,870
Mr. Lee.

701
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:32,706
I want you to visit Dressmaker Oh now.

702
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,708
-Again?
-Just go.

703
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:38,128
I am sure she feels uneasy
because of that crazy rumor.

704
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:41,465
If we exhaust her with this,
her mind will be at peace for a bit.

705
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,926
All right. I will be right back.

706
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,304
By the way,
Young Master Jang came home earlier.

707
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,305
He is in his study.

708
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,223
Really?

709
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,849
He came home?

710
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,025
I am all changed.

711
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:02,194
How do I…

712
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,949
You look busy.

713
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:12,079
Your outfit is extravagant for someone
who is awfully confident about her looks.

714
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,790
Do not be mistaken.

715
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:17,543
I was not trying to look good for you.

716
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:19,503
Yes, I know.
The Queen invited you to a banquet.

717
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,173
You may not have dressed for me,
but may I see?

718
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,762
You look pretty.

719
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,479
I mean, the outfit does.

720
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,525
Give me your hand.

721
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,193
Why?

722
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,988
You hurt your hand
while taking it out on the stone tower.

723
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,366
Your nails have grown.

724
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:50,826
Ask Maidservant Kim to trim them for you.

725
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,619
I am not a child.

726
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,329
Why would I ask her
to trim my nails for me?

727
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,415
Do as I say. You are precious.

728
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,294
I mean, your nails are.

729
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,006
Why are you suddenly mentioning my nails?

730
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,258
All right, then.

731
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,926
I will leave you to it.

732
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:18,312
Wait.

733
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:22,899
By any chance…

734
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,491
When you go to the banquet,

735
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,910
sit where everyone can see you.

736
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,955
I want everyone there to see you that day.

737
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,540
No one will be interested in me.

738
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:42,210
They will be busy talking about your wife
who might return to life that day.

739
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,755
That is why you should show everyone

740
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,256
that you are my wife now.

741
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,639
Then…

742
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,353
can I wear the ornament
with your family crest?

743
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,814
-Sure.
-Can I also…

744
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:07,027
tell everyone that we get along well?

745
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,948
-Of course.
-I will also…

746
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,994
boast to everyone

747
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,456
that you lit up a dark path for me…

748
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,210
late at night.

749
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,214
Sure, go ahead.

750
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,449
You seem very happy tonight.

751
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,869
Did you like the outfits?

752
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,538
I saw some bugs.

753
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,501
That is why I am happy.

754
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,604
Here is what Young Master Jang asked for.

755
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,149
Will it be safe?

756
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,817
Do not worry.

757
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,572
Will you also be attending
the banquet tonight?

758
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,823
Yes.

759
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:37,951
You look very pretty in that outfit.

760
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,830
This is what I always wear.

761
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,249
I will be wearing something else
for the banquet.

762
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:49,337
Are you saying you will look
even more beautiful than you do now?

763
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,006
Do not be ridiculous.

764
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,340
There is no need for that.

765
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,051
If you look even prettier than you do now,

766
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:59,181
imagine how intimidated
the young ladies will feel tonight.

767
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,475
Do you think so?

768
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,728
Then I guess I should tone it down.

769
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,104
Yes, you should.

770
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,147
Go easy on them.

771
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,440
All right.

772
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,319
It has been a while
since you last attended a grand event.

773
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,737
I hope you dress up nicely.

774
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,991
I like it when a man dresses
at his finest.

775
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,284
All right.

776
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,913
I will show you how dashing I can become.

777
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:39,971
Young Master Park.

778
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:47,979
Maidservant Kim.

779
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,439
Are you attending the event?

780
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:52,317
Yes, I will be attending
with Young Lady Bu-yeon.

781
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,445
If you happen to see Cho-yeon there…

782
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,033
could you give these to her for me?

783
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,454
These diamonds are called
"The Dragon's Tears."

784
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,832
I heard they were purchased by Songrim
not too long ago.

785
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,835
-How did you get your hands on--
-I bought them.

786
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,464
But if Young Lady Jin wears these,

787
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,300
everyone will know that they are from you.

788
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,136
I am not sure
if she will accept this gift.

789
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,721
If she refuses to accept them,

790
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,349
it would mean she turned me down.

791
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:26,726
Forget it.

792
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,522
It will be unbearable for me
if she rejects me once and for all.

793
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,819
Then are you never going to
make a move on Young Lady Jin?

794
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,365
Do you think she will accept?

795
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:44,619
-Or will she refuse?
-We will know once we give them to her.

796
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,622
I guess you are right.

797
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:50,000
You never know what is in the rice cake
until you bite into it.

798
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:03,388
Uncle,

799
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:07,183
I am hoping for honey,
but I am afraid it might be fish sauce.

800
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,854
But I will bravely bite into it

801
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,480
and swallow my destiny.

802
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,110
Please give these to her.

803
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,453
The Queen's banquet is about to start.

804
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,581
Is Jin Bu-yeon there?

805
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,959
Everyone who was invited is in attendance,
so she is probably there.

806
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:34,669
What about Jang Uk?

807
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,923
He is sailing Lake Gyeongcheondaeho
due to the King's orders.

808
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,346
What if a soul shifter appears
and kills Jin Bu-yeon?

809
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,682
What will people think
of that soul shifter?

810
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:51,478
They will naturally believe
that the soul shifter is Naksu.

811
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,981
If Jin Bu-yeon gets attacked,
it will become Naksu's doing.

812
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,902
Then everything will become
Jang Uk's responsibility.

813
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:04,491
Naksu will help us separate the two.

814
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,703
Your Royal Highness,
would you like to attend the banquet?

815
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,331
It will soon be time
to choose the crown princess.

816
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:14,626
It will most likely be
one of the ladies at the banquet.

817
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,586
You should pick the woman you like.

818
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,755
No.

819
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,133
I do not have the final say anyway.

820
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,302
I am afraid of what I might do

821
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,179
if I fall for someone I cannot have.

822
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,732
I do not wish to have
someone from Songrim enter Jinyowon.

823
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,025
What brings you here?

824
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,489
I am not here on behalf of Songrim.

825
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,408
It is for a young lad
who is like a son to me

826
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,786
and your daughter.

827
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,247
If you are talking about Bu-yeon,

828
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,250
tell Jang Uk to bring her back
right this instant.

829
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,252
Before that, let us talk about Naksu.

830
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:00,922
We must get rid of her first.

831
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,341
Naksu? She is dead.

832
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,885
Do not tell me you also believe
that ridiculous rumor.

833
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:09,597
That ridiculous rumor
could end up killing your daughter.

834
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,851
We need Jinyowon's help.

835
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,072
I am Jin Cho-yeon,

836
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,449
the second daughter of the Jin family.

837
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:30,869
You must be

838
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:33,788
Jin Ho-gyeong and Jin U-tak's daughter.

839
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,299
I am Heo Yun-ok
of the Heo family from Wol Fortress.

840
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,843
She is the granddaughter
of Master Heo Yeom.

841
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:49,971
Greetings are not needed between us.

842
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:52,640
We meet quite often
because you are my physician.

843
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,496
I am Jin Bu-yeon,
the eldest daughter of the Jin family.

844
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,165
She is betrothed to Young Master Jang Uk.

845
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,000
I thought they were married.

846
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,545
We are preparing
for a grand wedding ceremony.

847
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,380
We ask for your blessing.

848
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,258
That means she still belongs to Jinyowon.

849
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,302
I invited one person from each family.

850
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,221
But there are two people
from the Jin family.

851
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:33,515
Send the second daughter,
Jin Cho-yeon, away.

852
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,396
Your Highness,

853
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,359
Jin Cho-yeon is the true heir of Jinyowon.

854
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:46,569
If one of us must leave,

855
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,656
it should be me, not my younger sister.

856
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:54,911
Forget it.

857
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,705
You both came, so just enjoy the banquet.

858
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:02,168
Thank you for allowing me to attend
such a beautiful banquet.

859
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:23,356
It feels nice to be
outside the palace walls.

860
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,816
All right, everyone.

861
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,609
Let us enjoy the banquet.

862
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,999
Beautiful, are they not?

863
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:49,466
There we go!

864
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,884
Let us play again.

865
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,260
Come on, get a grip.

866
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,221
Let us play again. Deal the cards.

867
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,182
-Damn it.
-Give us the cards.

868
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,392
What is that punk doing here?

869
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,103
I told him to stay away until tonight.

870
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,396
Gosh.

871
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,690
I guess his addiction called him in early.

872
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,817
He came to play since he had money.

873
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,943
That lunatic.

874
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,823
All right. Let me see.

875
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,201
I won! I won the money!

876
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,495
Who here is Byeong-gu?

877
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,292
Byeong-gu?

878
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,213
Hey, leave if you are not here to gamble.

879
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,797
-All right?
-Get out of my way.

880
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:33,468
What are you doing?

881
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:55,573
-Be quiet and leave.
-I am sorry.

882
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,619
I told you not to come back.

883
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,413
-You lunatic, why did you not wait?
-I am sorry.

884
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,172
It was you.

885
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,038
You must feel upset.

886
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,166
You were introduced as his betrothed,
not his wife.

887
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,336
It is all right.
He shows me more than enough affection.

888
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,800
Did you not take my advice to heart?

889
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,218
Of course, I did.

890
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:00,471
Thanks to you,
there were some difficulties between us,

891
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,599
but we have become a lot closer since.

892
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,516
Thank you.

893
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:17,363
Everyone, Young Master Jang

894
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:21,242
has sent fireworks
to celebrate the Queen's banquet.

895
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,623
We will get to see fireworks?

896
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,999
I have never seen them before.

897
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,376
He sent them because his betrothed,
Young Lady Bu-yeon,

898
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,087
asked him if he could lighten up

899
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,756
the night sky for her.

900
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,967
-Oh, my goodness.
-I am jealous.

901
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:38,926
-Lucky her.
-She is lucky.

902
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:44,182
Soon, fireworks will bloom
in the night sky like flowers.

903
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,391
I hope you look forward to it.

904
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,897
Let us go outside.

905
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,066
-Shall we watch it from outside?
-Sure.

906
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,787
You should go to the back garden.

907
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,432
You came here yourself?

908
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:30,561
To lighten up the night sky?

909
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:32,689
Yes.

910
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,566
Did you boast around?

911
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:37,443
Yes.

912
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,072
Now everyone here truly believes
that we are married.

913
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,281
Good.

914
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,118
Then Naksu will show up here soon.

915
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:47,161
Naksu?

916
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,873
This event was arranged to summon Naksu.

917
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,084
Why?

918
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,423
So that my wife would get killed by Naksu.

919
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,134
Bu-yeon.

920
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,052
I am sorry,

921
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,763
but you will have to die now.

922
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,364
Look at that!

923
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:28,870
That is beautiful.

924
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:45,762
If a soul shifter

925
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,638
kills Jin Bu-yeon in front of everyone,

926
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,349
people will naturally think it was Naksu,

927
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:52,477
and the blame will go to Jang Uk.

928
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,063
Jang Uk and Jinyowon will become enemies,

929
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:59,609
and Jinyowon will fall into our hands.

930
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:57,375
Bu-yeon!

931
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,087
Bu-yeon.

932
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,048
Bu-yeon.

933
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:05,591
That was Naksu.

934
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:10,596
Naksu murdered Jang Uk's wife,
Jin Bu-yeon.

935
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:17,895
Bu-yeon.

936
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,774
Bu-yeon…

937
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,298
Young Lady Bu-yeon is safe.

938
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:06,611
How are you alive?

939
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,072
You were dead.

940
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,783
The person that died just now was not me.

941
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:15,578
It was a white mouse called Gwiseo,
a relic from Jinyowon.

942
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,871
"Gwiseo"?

943
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,041
A mouse that eats the clippings

944
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:23,252
of someone who trims their nails at night
can take the appearance of that person.

945
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,380
The mouse that ate
Young Lady Bu-yeon's nail clippings

946
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,717
was the one that got stabbed.

947
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:30,801
She is right.

948
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,388
What you saw earlier
was Gwiseo from Jinyowon.

949
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,937
How did that get here?

950
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,275
Your mother sent it here
to protect her eldest daughter.

951
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,004
It looks like everything went well.

952
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,506
Now, Uk just needs to go

953
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:12,009
and get rid of the soul shifter.

954
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,391
The soul shifter that attacked me

955
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:21,227
is currently being chased
by Young Master Jang.

956
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,274
If I do not get rid of Naksu myself,

957
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,361
people will constantly
spread rumors about her.

958
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,781
I want her to rest in peace.

959
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:34,699
So…

960
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,078
help me out.

961
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,290
Once he gets rid of
Naksu the soul shifter,

962
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:44,917
she will forever

963
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:47,962
be gone from our lives.

964
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,353
She is not moving.

965
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,147
I think she is dead.

966
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,065
-She looks dead.
-Goodness.

967
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,933
Today, I got rid of Naksu,
the soul shifter that appeared

968
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,518
at the Queen's banquet.

969
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,730
Was it really Naksu?

970
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,901
She was after Jang Uk's betrothed,
so it must have been her.

971
01:07:52,485 --> 01:07:54,695
Now Naksu is gone

972
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:56,697
for good.

973
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,078
I hope this puts you at ease…

974
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,414
and gives you peace.

975
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,230
I made the rumor
with the shamans at Gaema Village

976
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,565
so that we could make some money
selling charms.

977
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:37,446
All I did was make up a rumor.
Arrest me if you wish.

978
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:45,329
You kept sending me medicine, right?

979
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,792
You must know what is inside my body.

980
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,546
You will be fine

981
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:55,756
as long as you take the medicine.

982
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,383
I…

983
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,345
did not take the medicine you sent.

984
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:05,141
You did not take it?

985
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:09,145
Without that medicine,
you must be in severe pain.

986
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:10,688
Tell me.

987
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:12,731
What is inside my body?

988
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,861
I would at least like to know…

989
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,030
before I die.

990
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:30,040
I heard Naksu died.

991
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:32,251
-Yes, that is right.
-Tell me in detail.

992
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,169
Yeom.

993
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,587
I am here.

994
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,923
-Yeom!
-Master Lee!

995
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:40,176
Master Lee!

996
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:43,762
Master Lee!

997
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:45,556
Master Lee.

998
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:51,812
Master Lee,

999
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,731
where have you been?

1000
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,232
It has been three years.

1001
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:58,110
Yeom, you have aged even more
in those three years.

1002
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,490
Where did you stay?

1003
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:04,700
You were not at Danhyanggok.

1004
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:07,161
I spent time treating a patient.

1005
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,204
A patient?

1006
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:09,872
Lady Jin's daughter.

1007
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,499
I heard she recently married Jang Uk.

1008
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,417
What?

1009
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:17,046
You treated Jin Bu-yeon?

1010
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:17,963
Yes.

1011
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,425
I saved her life, woke her up,

1012
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:23,636
and erased what was unnecessary.

1013
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,150
You did not visit

1014
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:41,028
the cliff where she met her demise,
did you?

1015
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:42,947
See for yourself

1016
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:44,740
and then mourn for her.

1017
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,345
I want her to rest in peace.

1018
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,807
It may not have been Naksu,

1019
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:12,726
but more wraiths tend to swarm around him

1020
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,354
on days when he uses
the power of the ice stone.

1021
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,575
You are the first person

1022
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:31,412
who tried to save me.

1023
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,998
I almost died thanks to you.

1024
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,834
My crazy master.

1025
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:39,628
My pupil.

1026
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,047
I, Jang Uk, your pupil,

1027
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,967
will serve and protect my master,
Mu-deok, with all my heart.

1028
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:51,265
I am the egg
that is at the top of the tree.

1029
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,393
You are the only one
who can take care of me.

1030
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:56,270
Fine.

1031
01:11:56,854 --> 01:12:00,065
I will take you to the top of that tree.

1032
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,445
I also missed you.

1033
01:12:05,195 --> 01:12:06,488
That is my reply.

1034
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:09,616
Jang Uk.

1035
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,578
I like you a lot.

1036
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,335
Jang Uk.

1037
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,371
Jang Uk.

1038
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:57,706
Are you all right?

1039
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:10,803
I could not cry.

1040
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,181
It felt like…

1041
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,519
I was really abandoning you there.

1042
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:28,524
ALCHEMY OF SOULS
PART 2

1043
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,526
There is no need to force them together…

1044
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:36,323
You have taken what Jin Ho-gyeong
has tried so hard to hide.

1045
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:37,449
You should stop as well, Gwanju.

1046
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,201
If you wish to stop me,

1047
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:42,120
you should go to Jang Uk
and reveal everything to him.

1048
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,414
I returned to settle things one last time.

1049
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,041
You look like you are about to cry.

1050
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:49,419
Tear out the heart and break it to pieces…

1051
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,382
I shall always stay by your side
at this distance.

1052
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:55,926
That is my promise.

1053
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:02,975
