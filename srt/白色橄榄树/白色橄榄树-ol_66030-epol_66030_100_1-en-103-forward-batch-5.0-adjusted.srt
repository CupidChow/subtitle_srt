Counting today,

8
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,030
I've been here in Uglai City

9
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,590
for three months now.

10
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,400
In the past three months,

11
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,560
I gradually felt

12
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,680
the unique temperament of this city.

13
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,840
It's ancient,

14
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,950
mysterious,

15
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,790
pure,

Such a city

18
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:16,940
fascinates me.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,590
I want to be part of it.

No.

Chatting with you in Chinese is

42
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,290
the most relaxing part of my day.

43
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,360
But you came earlier than usual.

44

Hello, everyone.

110

I'm Song Ran.

There have just been multiple explosions

in Uglai City, where I'm at right now.

113
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,680
Currently, we can clearly see

114
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,430
the cars burning on the street

115

116
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,750
A primary school is at the far end of the street.

117

Luckily, the school holiday started two days ago.

118
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,990
But at the moment,

119

I haven't seen any military officers

120

Do you hear the siren?

this is the basic professional quality of a reporter.

It's not praise-worthy.

Keep it up.

147
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,270
Ms. Shen.

148
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,550
Don't be so modest.

149
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,400
Isn't that worthy of praise?

150
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,230
How many people can be like Song Ran?

151
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,910
Really?

152
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,230
If it were you,

153
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,960
wouldn't you be able to do it?

154
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,270
If you can't,

155
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,140
you can consider changing your job.

156
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,360
Was...

157
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,090
Was Ms. Shen being serious?

158
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,000
Of course.

159
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,870
When have you seen

160
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,080
Ms. Shen pretend to be modest?

161
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,840
If she says it's a basic quality,

162
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,090
then it is one.

163
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,150
There's nothing to be proud of.

164
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,480
You're just bragging.

165

I cannot comment on Ms. Shen,

166
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,550

167
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,470
you have that basic quality.

168
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,710
Don't move. Stay down.

169
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,620
Don't move.

170
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,000
What are you doing here?

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,110
You got accomplices?

172

You two go over there and check

173
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,200
to see if there are any suspicious situations.

174
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,460

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,000
Stop!

181
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,070
Don't move!

182
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,910
Zan!

183
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,510
It's okay.

184
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,270
Don't move.

185
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,620
Help me.

186
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,510
Help.

187
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,360
Help me.

188
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,890
You're Chinese?

189
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,740
Yes.

190
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,630
A reporter?

191
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,550
Yes.

192
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,390
Did I

193
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,390
step on a mine?

194
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,150
Yes.

195
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,750
Right on target, too.

196
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,610
But it's unlucky today.

197
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,150
It met me.

198
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,110
Are you joking with me?

199
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,190
I'm not joking.

200
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,690
Don't worry.

201
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,680
I won't let it blow you up.

202
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,120
Really?

203
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm right next to you.

204
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,200
Does lying to you benefit me?

205
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,920
Balance your weight on your right foot.

206
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,150
Hang in there.

207
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,040
If you move again,

208
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,910
I'll become a martyr.

209
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,630
Does this...

210
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,480
Does this mean there are eight minutes left?

211
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
You must have watched a lot of movies.

212
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,220
Then what is this?

213
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,120
I can stop and explain to you for three minutes.

214
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,360
Do you need it?

215
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,000
No.

216
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,150
No need.

217
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,510
Look at me.

218
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,120
Don't look at it.

219
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,830
Okay.

220
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:04,910
♫Stepping on my heart alone♫

221
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,870
Captain.

222
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:14,740
♫You're triggering a bomb unknown♫

223
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,120
The captured insurgent has confessed.

224
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
There are a total of five landmines buried in this area,

225
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,270
intended to destroy our reinforcement trucks.

226
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,270
One mother mine

227
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,910
and four secondary mines connected in series.

228
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:26,330
♫The sun of life reflects♫

229
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,030
Each mine contains approximately 400 grams of explosives

230
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,630
Zan!

231
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:34,920
♫Stay where you are, don't move♫

232
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,750
You lied to me.

233
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,040
♫Exploding into pieces♫

234
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,270
I can't believe I was fooled.

235
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:54,800
♫We flow, we're falling slow♫

236
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:05,860
♫We flow, we're falling slow♫

237
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
You're a good person.

238
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,030
Run while you can.

239
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,720
I don't want to drag you with me.

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,750
Don't be afraid.

241
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,740
I won't leave you.

242
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,270
How fast can you run?

243
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,320
Huh?

244
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,670
In five seconds,

245
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,160
how far can you run?

246
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,120
I can buy you five seconds

247
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,320
so that your foot

248
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
won't detonate the mines right away.

249
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,150
So, in five seconds,

250
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,450
how far can you run?

251
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,280
I don't know.

252
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,710
Ten meters?

253
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Twenty meters?

254
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
I don't know.

255
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,590
I've never run like this.

256
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,190
Try it today.

257
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,200
Okay.

258
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,750
Ready.

259
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:21,400
Three.

260
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,880
Two.

261
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,510
One.

262
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:31,609
Run!

263
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,540
Zan!

264
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,400
You'll feel a little dizzy.

265
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,200
It's okay.

266
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,350
There's no rush.

267
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,920
Stand up slowly.

268
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,200
Zan!

269
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,750
Take your time.

270
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,420
Are you okay?

271
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:47,870
I'm fine.

272
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,110
Are you okay too?

273
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,640
Do you want to check?

274
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,270
What's wrong with you?

275
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,470
You're a volunteer.

276
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,110
Why did you step forward so quickly?

277
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,350
We soldiers should do this first.

278
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,700
Don't rush forward

279
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,590
without my order in the future.

280
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,550
Do you hear me?

281
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,200
Got it.

282
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,790
Hey!

283
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,030
Don't get close.

284
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,160
Morgan.

285
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,440
Stay away from there.

286
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,280
You're a reporter from China?

287
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,090
Are you also Chinese?

288
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,720
I'm from Eastern Country.

289
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,640
But my race is Chinese.

290
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,200
Then he is...

291
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,440
He is our demining volunteer,

292
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,160
Zan.

293
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:35,050
Zan.

294
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,400
Oh,

295
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,310
I'm a Chinese reporter.

296
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,680
My name is Song Ran.

297
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,700
I visited China when I was young.

298
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I loved that place.

299
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,510
Thank you for saving me.

300
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,850
Can I take a photo of you?

301
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,070
Sure.

302
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,440
Three.

303
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,270
Two.

304
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,440
One.

305
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,240
Let me see.

306
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,350
Is Gamma that way?

307
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,090
You're going to Gamma?

308
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,440
Yes.

309
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,720
I'm taking the flight back home today.

310
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:35,750
What time is your flight?

311
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,270
Three in the afternoon.

312
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,310
Three in the afternoon?

313
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,880
But now all transportation has come to a halt.

314
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,050
You won't make it in time.

315
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
What should I do?

316
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,720
Why don't you

317
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,830
wait till we round up these goons?

318
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,720
The traffic will resume after that.

319
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,510
But...

320
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,160
Jiang Lin.

321
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,770
Stop teasing her.

322
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,960
Did you bring your passport?

323
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:05,920
Yes.

324
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,750
The industrial park in the western suburbs has an evacuation site.

325
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,750
A group of Chinese are evacuating today.

326
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,330
I'll send you there later.

327
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,590
Okay.

328
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,480
Have a safe trip.

329
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,110
Aren't you guys coming too?

330
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,640
We're taking that car.

331
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,830
These familiar sounds again.

332
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,310
How nice.

333
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,480
What date is it already?

334
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,880
It's the end of June.

335
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,350
You already got your graduation certificate,

336
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,680
but you haven't found a job yet?

337
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,440
Isn't the company your Aunt Chen recommended

338
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,510
quite good?

339
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,920
It's only 2,500 yuan a month.

340
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,960
I won't do it.

341
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,920
You're too arrogant.

342
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,450
Your sister went to a prestigious university.

343
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,880
But she's not as delicate as you.

344
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,160
You share the same father.

345
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,920
Why don't you learn from her?

346
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,440
Maybe it's because

347
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,680
we have different mothers.

348
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,720
Hey, you...

349
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,830
Hey, Ran.

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,790
You're back.

351
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:30,680
Aunt Yang.

352
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,240
Ran.

353
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,070
My mom is abusing me again.

354
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,770
Song Yang, come here!

355
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,930
Look at you.

356
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,750
Don't expose your family shame.

357
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,470
You made a fool of yourself in front of Ran again.

358
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,080
You're the nonsensical one here.

359
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,030
Ran is not an outsider.

360
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,030
It doesn't matter.

361
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,510
Am I right, Ran?

362
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,060
Ran.

363
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,360
Sit down and take a rest.

364
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,670
The meal will be ready soon.

365
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,640
I'll get you some water.

366
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,070
After my parents divorced,

367
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,270
Aunt Yang married my dad.

368
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:59,440
Although she's my stepmother,

369
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,760
she's always nice to me.

370
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,640
She doesn't scold or beat me.

371
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,550
But there's always

372
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,190
-Thank you.
-an invisible distance between us.

373
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,960
Find a job and move out soon.

374
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,120
Where will I live if I move out?

375
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,200
Ran's mom left her a house.

376
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,590
My mom didn't.

377
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,280
Mom!

378
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,400
Come on.

379
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,920
How old are you?

380
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,110
-Stop acting cute.
-Mom.

381
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,070
Ran, you're back.

382
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:31,860
Dad.

383
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,270
Is this considered a work injury?

384
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,160
Shouldn't the TV station compensate us?

385
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,750
It's just a minor injury.

386
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Compensate for what?

387
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,310
Compensate for the emotional damage.

388
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,000
Emotional damage

389
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,240
is much more serious

390
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,310
than physical injury.

391
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,590
Dad.

392
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,640
All right.

393
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,830
Let's not talk about this.

394
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,270
But

395
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,790
I watched the video of your live broadcast

396
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,050
in Eastern Country.

397
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,970
Not bad.

398
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,240
You're brave.

399
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,470
You're indeed my daughter.

400
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,480
Keep up the good work.

401
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,060
Did your mom say anything?

402
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,590
She said

403
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,040
not to go to Eastern Country anymore.

404
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,240
What else?

405
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,880
Nothing else.

406
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,750
She just doesn't want to admit it.

407
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
I can educate my daughter well too.

408
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,520
You did a great job on the report.

409
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,750
It was practically perfect!

410
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,600
Your mom is stingy.

411
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,440
She doesn't know how to praise anyone.

412
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,440
Song,

413
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,070
your daughter wants to eat your signature ribs.

414
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,110
The oil is hot.

415
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,240
Come here.

416
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,680
Ran, take a seat.

417
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,080
I'll talk to you later.

418
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,610
Just praise Song Ran.

419
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,000
Why do you keep mentioning her?

420
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,650
Is her comment that important?

421
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,440
I was just saying.

422
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,040
Song Yang has grown up.

423
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:57,790
Dad.

424
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,400
I've got to go back to the TV station.

425
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,290
I have to go.

426
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,440
All of a sudden?

427
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,680
The meal will be ready soon.

428
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,510
Eat before you go.

429
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,590
Next time.

430
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,450
Aunt Yang,

431
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:08,920
Song Yang,

432
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,750
I'm leaving.

433
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,750
Ran.

434
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,460
See?

435
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,760
It's all your fault.

436
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,610
Why are you blaming me?

437
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,440
Song Ran said

438
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,160
she's busy with work.

439
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,110
My life

440
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,920
is back to normal.

441
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,130
But I don't want everything in Eastern Country

442
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,790
to leave me like this.

443
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,510
Since no one wants to...

444
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,000
I do.

445
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,790
I want to talk about

446
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,150
the life of ordinary people in Eastern Country.

447
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,900
I have 837 hours worth of

448
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,790
video data,

449
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,270
including

450
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,440
269 hours of interviews,

451
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,370
over 4000 photos,

452
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,230
and 70,000 words worth of materials.

453
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,970
I tried my best to hold on to something.

454
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,180
Because there were

455
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,880
so many people and things

456
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,530
in Eastern Country that I can't forget.

457
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,030
Especially that mine,

458
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,110
that explosion,

459
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,920
and...

460
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,400
Him.

461
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,090
Zan?

462
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,850
He is our demining volunteer,

463
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,750
Zan.

464
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:20,390
Zan.

465
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,470
Is this "Zan"

466
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,000
him?

[Eastern Country, Evaluation Point]

469
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,930
Let us in.

470
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,510
Let us in!

471
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,750
This is my passport.

472
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,440
Don't push.

473
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,030
Back off!

474
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,830
Don't push!

475
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,200
Back off!

476
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,720
Don't rush in if you don't have a passport.

477
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:05,160
Go there with your passport.

478
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,050
Then, wait for the bus. It'll take you to the airport.

What are they squeezing for?

Maybe they're worried that they can't leave

485
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,510
and will be left here.

486
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,350
Why are they worrying about that?

487
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,030

Hello.

I'm the renovator of the unit above your unit.

Their house is leaking.

542
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,960
The property management should have called you,

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,710
depends solely

704
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,960
on the volunteers' decision.

705
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,800
That's all I wanted

706
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,230
to ask you today.

707
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,630
Thank you so much.

708
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,840
You're welcome.

709
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:27,960
It's raining.

710
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,360
No wonder I'm in a bad mood.

711
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,480
You didn't bring an umbrella, did you?

712
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,400
I'll get someone to give you one.

713
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,760
No need.

714
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,150
It's already very kind of you

715
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,510
to accept my interview.

716
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,110
Thank you.

717
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,190
I'm so stupid.

718
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,240
How could such a coincidence

719
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,250
happen in this vast world?

720
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,360
I may never see him again.

721
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,280
Even if I do,

722
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,360
can I still recognize those eyes?

723
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,190
Reporter Song.
