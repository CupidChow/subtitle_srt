and you're recovering nicely.

105
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,440
Make sure to apply

106
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
the medicine on time every day,

107
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,660
get plenty of rest,

108
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,480
and avoid straining your eyes.

109
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,580
In about one or two weeks,

110
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,310
you should be fully recovered.

111

There won't be any aftereffects, right?

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,810
From a medical perspective,

113
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,530
nothing is ever 100% certain.

114
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,080
But so far,

115

The most important thing

121
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
is for the patient to follow

Start with a three-point adjustment

134

and see how they react.

135

Why aren't the test results out yet?

It's been a long time.

142
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,510
Should we ask Dr. He

143
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,840
to help speed things up?

144
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,420
They're out already.

145
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,480
We'll talk at home.

146
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,150
The scan shows

147
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,680
large shadows on the lungs.

148
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,950
The pathology report is out too.

149
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,270
The doctor said it's mid-stage lung cancer.

150
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,530
Lung cancer is different from other cancers.

151
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,970
It spreads and worsens extremely fast,

152
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,320
and the chances of a full recovery aren't very high.

153
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,840
But the specifics

154
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,070
depend on the individual's condition

155
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,600
and response to treatment.

156
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,720
You got this report

157
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,100
on June 7.

158
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,790
At that time,

159
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,600
I hadn't had my eye surgery yet.

160
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,240
Why are you only telling me now?

161
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,730
Because you wanted me to have surgery first?

162
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,970
How can you not see what's more important?

163
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,630
You're seriously ill.

164
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,830
You should've gotten treatment first!

165
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,750
How could you delay it for so long?

166
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,070
Don't put it like that.

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,860
You're the one who can't see what's more important.

168
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,070
Your eyes could fully recover,

169
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,270
so of course, we had to treat them first.

170
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,330
As for me, whether I

171
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,260
get treated or not doesn't make much of a difference.

172
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,720
Besides,

173
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,840
it wasn't just about getting your eyes treated first.

174
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,360

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,920
Compare it with the previous one.

350
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,000
Open the earlier version

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,640
for me.

352
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,850
See? It's much better now.

353
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,460
It is.

354
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
The section just now.

355
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:37,270
Pull it down.

356
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,000
Pull it down.

357
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,440
Can you see what the problem is?

358
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,640
You forgot to take your medicine again.

359
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,770
How can you get better if you don't take your meds?

360
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,030
Hurting like hell at night

361
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,070
and gritting your teeth to get through the day.

362
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,790
Is there really no one else at your company?

363
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,590
Would it fall apart without you?

364
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,910
It's been so long.

365
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
You should've handed over

366
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,070
your work by now.

367
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,490
From now on, unless it's something big,

368
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,020
just report over the phone.

369
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,100
Please, just let

370
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,240
my mom rest.

371
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:09,480
You'd need a few days' rest to recover from a cold or fever,

372
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,930
let alone her condition!

373
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,910
W-We're really sorry.

374
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,030
We rely on Ms. Ran too much.

375
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,870
We should be able to make decisions by ourselves.

376
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,270
We're sorry.

377
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,240
We're sorry.

378
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,160
We're sorry.

379
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,840
Enough.

380
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,350
My daughter has been looking after me.

381
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,210
She hasn't slept much these days.

382
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,070
People get irritable when they're tired.

383
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,890
Please forgive her.

384
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,560
It's okay.

385
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,860
After I'm gone,

386
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,250
if she ever needs help

387
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,010
and you happen to be around,

388
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,520
please, give her a hand.

389
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,000
Then all the guidance I've given you will be worth it.

390
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Sure.

391
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,460
Of course. Rest assured.

392
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,030
Alright.

393
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
You can go now.

394
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,420
Okay, Ms. Ran.

395
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,640
Have a good rest.

396
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
Goodbye, Ms. Ran.

397
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,010
Why are you crying?

398
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,150
So weak,

399
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
not like me at all.

400
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,650
I'm not crying.

401
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,450
Since you were hospitalized,

402
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,210
I haven't cried once.

403
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,850
Those young people are under great pressure at work.

404
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,850
They're afraid of making mistakes.

405
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,570
At least they're being responsible.

406
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,860
It's not easy for them.

407
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,270
I want to help them.

408
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:04,350
Why did you take it out on them?

409
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:15,980
Mom,

410
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:19,980
aren't you in pain?

411
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,390
I am in pain.

412
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,510
It's because I'm in so much pain

413
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,570
that I need to work.

414
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,350
At my age,

415
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,510
I'm not young anymore,

416
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,050
but I still have ambitions and goals.

417
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,070
My career

418
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,410
has taken up all my time,

419
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,090
but in the end, I've achieved something.

420
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
I find that comforting,

421
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,340
and I'm proud of it.

422
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,550
If I can pass down some experience

423
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,050
to those young people,

424
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,340
I'm more than willing to do so.

425
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,510
Mom.

426
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,140
You really…

427
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,170
don't want to see Dad one more time?

428
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,060
You still hate him?

429
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,110
Yes.

430
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,740
Do you still love him?

431
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,120
Not anymore.

432
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I stopped loving him a long time ago.

433
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,510
Some people say

434
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,210
if you don't love, you won't hate.

435
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,500
That hate means there's still love.

436
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,410
That's just pretentious nonsense.

437
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,870
Hate is hate.

438
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,590
It's not love.

439
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,930
I hate Song Zhicheng

440
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,210
from the bottom of my heart.

441
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
I hate him not because of any emotional entanglement.

442
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,050
Love and affection mean nothing.

443
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,210
I hate him for trampling on my dignity.

444
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,320
I've been successful and strong all my life,

445
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,960
yet he humiliated me.

446
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,790
If one day I die,

447
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,830
don't let him

448
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,310
attend my funeral.

449
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,050
You know what kind of person I am.

450
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,510
I know.

451
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,170
Ran.

452
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,780
You only live once,

453
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,400
so go all out

454
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,790
for what you want.

455
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,530
Don't waste your life.

456
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,620
The value of life

457
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,760
is never measured

458
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,710
by its length.

459
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,530
Once you understand this,

460
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,830
whatever you want to pursue,

461
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,350
be it ideals or values,

462
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,110
or even just

463
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,380
a simple wish,

464
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,620
go after it bravely

465
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,960
and spare no effort.

466
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,070
No matter how old you are,

467
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,240
don't let other people's expectations trap you.

468
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,740
Like last time,

469
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,030
your award photo

470
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,300
caused such an uproar.

471
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Don't care about what others think.

472
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,050
Don't let them influence you.

473
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,920
As long as you believe

474
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,130
it's worth it,

475
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,030
and it's the right thing to do,

476
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
then go for it.

477
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,890
Don't be afraid.

478
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,920
Mom will always stand by you.

479
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,640
In this world or beyond,

480
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,360
I'll always be on your side.

481
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,320
You know about…

482
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,680
that matter?

483
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,110
I wasn't aware of it at the time.

484
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,910
I was feeling unwell those days

485
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,460
and stayed in bed for several days.

486
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,380
It was probably because of

487
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,380
this damn cancer.

488
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,100
I only saw the news

489
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,760
when I got better.

490
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,040
Ran.

491
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,340
I'm sorry.

492
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,030
When you needed help

493
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,090
the most,

494
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,180
I wasn't there for you.

495
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,270
Mom.

496
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,550
I didn't understand you enough.

497
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:16,860
I was too willful.

498
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,830
I'm sorry.

499
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,880
I'm so sorry.

500
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,660
It's not your fault.

501
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,430
We both have strong personalities

502
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,010
and never want to appear weak.

503
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,240
We argue whenever we're together.

504
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,680
If anyone's to blame,

505
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,890
blame me for not

506
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,640
insisting on taking you with me back then.

507
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,980
We lost

508
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,840
so much time together.

509
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,880
That's the only thing…

510
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,450
I regret in my life.

511
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,790
Ran.

512
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,200
Do you hate me?

513
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Do you blame me?

514
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,280
Before today,

515
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,770
I hated you,

516
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,940
and I blamed you.

517
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,030
But just now, when I heard you say

518
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,930
you regret it,

519
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,270
I stopped blaming

520
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,460
and hating you.

521

539
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,030
