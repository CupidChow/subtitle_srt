[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental]

4
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,430
You weren't yourself

5
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,759
when you asked for help.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,590
If it weren't

7
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,789
for the girl you love,

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
you wouldn't have done that.

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,050
How's it going between you and Dr. Pei?

10
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,970
We're not like you.

11
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,660
You two love each other.

12
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,400
And I dare say

13
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,840
Song fell in love with you first.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,570
As for Dr. Pei and me,

15
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,990
one moment we're close, the next we're estranged.

16
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,870
It's unstable.

17
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,430
Good for Dr. Pei.

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,329
She let you, a playboy,

19
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,120
know the feeling of not getting what you want.

20
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,380
Zan.

21
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,930
You've become a bad guy since you returned to China.

22
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,310
You can enjoy your sweet relationship.

23
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,310
But how can you...

24
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,140
be gloating?

25
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,550
Alright.

26
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,490
I'm hanging up.

27
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,320
Okay.

28
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,170
Why are you still here?

29
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,430
Aren't you supposed to go to the hospital this morning

30
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,760
to remove the bandages?

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,770
What's the rush?

32
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,870
Are you worried

33
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,030
that I can't carry a sniper rifle anymore?

34
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,840
Yes.

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,590
I don't want to owe you

36
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,520
another favor that I can't return.

37
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,290
If you don't want to owe me a favor,

38
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,800
don't risk your life to rush forward again.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,050
I shouldn't have let you out of the confinement room.

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,620
Zan just called me.

41
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,490
How is he?

42
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,080
He's good.

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,300
Do you know about him and Song?

44
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,310
What?

45
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,690
I don't know.

46
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,450
I seldom contact them.

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,519
He and Song are together.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,829
I could tell

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,640
they are happy together.

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,310
I'm not surprised.

51
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,220
When we were at the bar,

52
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,630
I could clearly see from their eyes

53
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,180
that they were interested in each other.

54
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,120
Oh.

55
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,730
I'm sure you were focused on Dr. Pei that day.

56
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,010
You couldn't see that.

57
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,400
Why don't you contact them?

58
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,700
Weren't you close to Song?

59
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,080
I read the article you wrote for her.

60
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
I was so touched that I almost cried.

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,000
Really?

62
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,040
Next time when you're in trouble,

63
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,300
I'll write a better one

64
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,200
to make you cry.

65
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,310
You only have the guts to jinx me.

66
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,640
You are very considerate towards others.

67
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,310
I know the reason even if you don't tell me.

68
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,070
You don't want to disrupt their lives,

69
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,730
so you no longer contact them.

70
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,390
Am I right?

71
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,530
Childish.

72
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,620
They've helped us a lot.

73
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,240
I don't want people and things here

74
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,980
to bother them again.

75
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,510
Dragging one person down is enough.

76
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,750
Should I feel proud

77
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,270
or consider myself unlucky

78
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,850
after hearing what you said?

79
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,210
Excuse me.

80
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,230
Yes?

81
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,670
Is Dr. Pei here?

82
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,750
There's a patient who needs her help.

83
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,750
She's coming.

84
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,180
I'll handle it.

85
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,360
And I also need to perform some examinations.

86
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,960
Okay.

87
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,540
I'm counting on you

88
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,810
to heal my eyes.

89
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,630
They're the eyes of a sniper.

90
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,670
I don't think you're worried you can't shoot anymore.

91
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,330
You're worried you can't pursue beautiful girls anymore, right?

92
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,480
If this beautiful girl is you,

93
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,460
I'll be so scared.

94
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,070
If you hadn't hurt your eyes

95
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,120
while saving me,

96
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,980
I'd never serve you.

97
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,960
I just wanted to see

98
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,620
how far you'd gone.

99
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,750
You...

100
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,070
There's one stitch left.

101
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,159
What do you think?

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,730
Do you want revenge?

103
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,300
Of course.

104
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,330
What?

105
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,290
Stop...

106
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,940
Stop joking.

107
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,770
I'm not.

108
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,570
You need to use disinfectant first.

109
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,410
Don't do this.

110
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,560
It's okay.

111
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,950
Dr. Pei!

112
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,430
Don't...

113
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,210
Dr. Pei.

114
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,700
We've got a child injured in an explosion.

115
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,140
It looks really severe.

116
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Zan.

117
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,440
It's me.

118
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,960
Ben.

119
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,380
What's wrong?

120
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,560
What happened?

121
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,670
I miss you and Song. Does that count?

122
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,830
Yes.

123
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,600
Of course.

124
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,450
Don't brush me off.

125
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,540
That's all you want to say?

126
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,960
I've signed up

127
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,210
for Xi Country's annual EOD qualification exam.

128
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,660
After I pass the exam

129
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,250
and get the qualification,

130
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,650
I can come to you

131
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,410
as a demining volunteer again.

132
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm not brushing you off, am I?

133
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,720
I'll let you slide.

134
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,740
But we're in no hurry.

135
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,780
Get ready for the exam.

136
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,630
Bye.

137
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,290
No hurry.

138
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,080
No hurry.

139
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,270
Ms. Fu,

140
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,530
did you ask to see me...

141
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,240
Sorry,

142
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:10,770
Jiang Yu.

143
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,390
I could only ask Ms. Fu for help.

144
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,270
I couldn't reach you.

145
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,550
It's okay.

146
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,530
It's not the first time you've lied to me.

147
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,050
I just don't know why you came to me again.

148
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,010
What else do we have to talk about?

149
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,120
I came to say goodbye.

150
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,530
I want you to know I'm leaving.

151
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,910
Say goodbye?

152
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,850
Are you going back to Eastern Country?

153
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm going back to Xi Country first.

154
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,090
After that,

155
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,840
I'll probably go to Eastern Country.

156
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,790
The situation in Eastern Country

157
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,640
has been bad again recently.

158
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,050
I have many friends

159
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,480
and acquaintances there.

160
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,360
I want to go there and offer my help.

161
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,000
Jiang Yu.

162
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,810
Ms. Fu told me

163
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,740
you've been doing well recently

164
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,940
and have kept up with schoolwork.

165
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,520
After hearing that,

166
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,080
I felt relieved.

167
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,740
You are not lagging behind in schoolwork

168
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,500
because of my mistake.

169
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,290
I know

170
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,630
it's really hard

171
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,400
to make you

172
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,100
accept me again.

173
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,620
Today, besides saying goodbye,

174
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,510
I also want you to know

175
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,830
that I won't stop trying

176
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,800
to fix our relationship.

177
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,880
No need.

178
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,320
Whether I do well or not

179
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,510
is my own business.

180
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,290
I won't become good or bad because of you.

181
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,750
You don't have to come here and say goodbye.

182
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,670
I don't want to know

183
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,200
if you're going back to Eastern Country,

184
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:09,750
whether it'll be dangerous,

185
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,870
and whether you'll be risking your life!

186
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,130
Anyway, you all have your great reasons.

187
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,630
I don't understand them,

188
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,690
and I don't want to.

189
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,700
Just go far away

190
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,100
and leave me alone for the rest of my life!

191

192
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,080

I forgot to send it to you last time.

♫Like two lonely islands♫

199
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,850

♫Drifting far apart♫

201

when you were little.

202

I think we are fated.

203
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,800
Nonsense.

204
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,000

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,900
♫Feeling like far from home♫

209
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,590

♫My way back to life♫

221
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,130
Jiang Yu.

222
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,670
When everything is over,

223
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,100
if you agree,

224
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll come back

225
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,430
and be your brother.

226
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,760
Mr. Li,

227
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,220
you're going on leave.

228
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:40,960
Are you

229
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,290
going to be a volunteer?

230
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,070
I'm not sure yet.

231
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,870
Then...

232
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,980
are you going to Eastern Country?

233
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,000
D-Does Mr. Luo

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,080
know about this?

235
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,020
How long will you be gone?

236
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,220
Did...

237
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,950
did Mr. Luo agree?

238
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,510
Was he mad?

239
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,290
Will we be in trouble again?

240
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,960
Mr. Luo...

241
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,000
He...

242
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,880
he has no other way to express his emotions.

243
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,350
He either pulls a long face and throws a tantrum

244
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,580
or keeps silent.

245
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,480
I...

246
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't mean to criticize him...

247
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,660
Zhang Jian.

248
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,760
The drawing...

249
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,550
I...

250
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,550
I'll...

251
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,500
I'll finish the pasting soon.

252
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:36,980
This...

253
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,610
No need.

254
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,810
The drawing is useless.

255
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,920
Throw it away.

256
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:46,600
Give it to me.

257
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,200
Then...

258
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm leaving.

259
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,020
I'm fine.

260
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
When I said the drawing was useless,

261
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,829
I was trying to tell him not to think too much.

262
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,720
You got me, right?

263
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,160
Yes.

264
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,349
Then...

265
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,200
why did Zhang Jian become more scared?

266
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,280
Because to him,

267
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,300
it sounded like you were saying

268
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
that he was useless

269
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,880
and could be thrown away.

270
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,140
Is it my problem

271
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,670
or his?

272
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,530
Just now, he said

273
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,070
you're irritable

274
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,120
and don't talk to others.

275
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,580
Were you angry about that?

276
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,870
Why would I?

277
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,560
He was telling the truth.

278
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,410
If Zhang Jian heard this,

279
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,730
he might still be afraid of you,

280
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,580
but not as much as now.

281
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,850
You should let them know more about you

282
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:08,730
and let them know

283
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,440
you also have a cute side

284
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,810
besides your scary side.

285
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,140
You're in no position to teach me that.

286
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,310
You are the one who's best at concealing his emotions

287
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,170
and keeps everything to himself.

288
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,410
You're right.

289
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Let's make improvements together.

290
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,180
Didn't you want to talk to me?

291
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,840
Go ahead.

292
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,880
It's about Jiang Yu.

293
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,690
I want you

294
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,210
to look after him for me.

295
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,530
He probably

296
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,760
hates me the most now.

297
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,750
It will be a long time

298
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,680
before he wants to talk to me again.

299
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,480
You haven't passed the exam, have you?

300
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,850
Isn't it too early

301
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,650
to assign me that job?

302
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,740
Didn't you say

303
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,480
I shouldn't go

304
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,160
if I'm not confident?

305
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
Why didn't you listen to me on other things?

306
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,800
By the way,

307
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,190
if anything happens to Song Ran,

308
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,270
just let me know.

309
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,920
I'll

310
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,010
take care of her myself.

311
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,400
I know her.

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,440
Why does it sound like

313
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,490
I want to steal your girlfriend?

314
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,350
I didn't mean that.

315
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,610
Don't get me wrong.

316
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,230
She won't like you.

317
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,990
Being in a relationship is such a troublesome thing.

318
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,850
Do you think everyone wants that?

319
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,000
Stay safe.

320
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,510
I will.

321
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,310
Ran.

322
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,640
After I leave Dicheng this time,

323
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,330
I might be going to Xi Country.

324
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,340
For what?

325
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,330
I need to

326
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,610
take an exam every year

327
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,600
to renew my EOD certificate.

328
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,490
I want to go back and have a try.

329
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,710
You can definitely do it.

330
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,570
After renewing your certificate,

331
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,630
do you want to go back to Eastern Country

332
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,360
and continue to be a volunteer?

333
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,760
I just want to try.

334
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,760
I'm not sure if I can.

335
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,820
Why did I ask him that?

336
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,320
I put him under pressure for no reason.

337
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,270
It's okay.

338
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,830
Anyway,

339
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm not ready yet.

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,440
I was just asking.

341
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,830
Zan.

342
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,400
Take your time.

343
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,610
There's no rush.

344
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,210
Okay, Ran.

345
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,170
Neither of us needs to rush.

346
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,610
This time,

347
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,810
shall I walk you to your room first,

348
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,970
or you'll walk me to my room first?

349
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,840
I'll walk you to your room first, and you leave your luggage there.

350
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,480
Then, you walk me to my room,

351
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,190
and I'll walk you back.

352
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,350
We can

353
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,640
keep doing this

354
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,840
until dawn.

355
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

356
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,370
Where are you going?

357
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,010
Why don't we ask for a refund for the rooms?

358
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,880
I don't think the hotel will charge us

359
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,480
if we just walk in the corridor for a whole night.

360
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,320
[Mom]

361
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,560
Mom.

362
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,690
Were you sleeping?

363
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,860
No.

364
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,720
Where are you?

365
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,790
Ping County.

366
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,830
Didn't I tell you

367
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,950
I'm still doing my research?

368
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,490
When will your secret research end?

369
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,030
Are you never going to

370
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,880
let me see

371
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,280
your mysterious friend?

372
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,270
Bring him to me tomorrow noon.

373
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,560
Turns out

374
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,960
she knew it long ago

375
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,050
but kept playing dumb.

376
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,360
I was the real dumb one.

377
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,240
You're so nervous.

378
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,680
Are you worried

379
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
your mom won't be satisfied with me?

380
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,100
That won't be a surprise.

381
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,010
She's not even satisfied with me.

382
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,570
They say

383
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,030
it takes time for a mother-in-law

384
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,440
to like her son-in-law.

385
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,550
None of the rules in the world

386
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,450
applies to my mom.

387
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,520
Fine.

388
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,080
If your mom really disagrees,

389
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,900
I'll elope with you.

390
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,460
Will you elope with me?

391
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,230
Aren't we

392
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,160
already eloping?

393
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,830
Stop laughing.

394
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,660
My mom is very smart.

395
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,940
She's a control freak

396
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,380
and also tough.

397
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,830
Otherwise, she couldn't have become a leader

398
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,940
in a big group like Dihua.

399
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,440
You won't be able to laugh when you see her.

400
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,970
How did your mom join

401
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,590
Dihua Group?

402
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,040
She used to work in Liangcheng.

403
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,300
When she and my dad were going through a divorce in 1998,

404
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:27,960
Dihua Group happened to start open recruitment.

405
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,040
So, she went through the divorce procedures

406
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,740
while preparing for the recruitment exam.

407
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,740
Unexpectedly,

408
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,800
she passed the exam.

409
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,220
My mom has her own pride.

410
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,560
Her whole family was against

411
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,310
her marriage to my dad,

412
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,720
but she married him anyway.

413
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,920
Later,

414
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,840
no matter how she quarreled with my dad,

415
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,070
she didn't say a word about it

416
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,310
to her family or friends.

417
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,430
At that time,

418
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,200
she probably thought

419
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,960
no matter how hard it was,

420
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,710
she'd endure it for the rest of her life.

421
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,680
Then, one day,

422
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,680
Aunt Yang...

423
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,340
Who are you?

424
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,110
Came with a child.

425
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,840
This is Song Zhicheng's child.

426
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,240
I didn't know

427
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
she'd come to you.

428
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,810
It wasn't my idea.

429
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,000
She's braver than you.

430
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,200
You're such a coward.

431
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,130
You can't take Ran away.

432
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,200
If you take her away,

433
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,880
I'll become a laughingstock when I return to my hometown.

434
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,080
If Ran lives with you,

435
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,110
she will be ruined.

436
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,990
Ran Yuwei,

437
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,650
don't think you're the only capable person in the world.

438
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,140
I'm sure Ran will be successful

439
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,410
if she lives with me.

440
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,690
Given what you're like,

441
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,960
can you raise a successful child?

442
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,510
Anyway, I'm not letting you take my daughter away.

443
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,310
If you don't agree, just file a lawsuit.

444
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,170
I'm not afraid of being laughed at

445
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,660
or waiting for a long time.

446
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,320
Let's see who's more patient.

447
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,710
Dad.

448
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,920
Mom.

449
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,020
♫She is a white island♫

450
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,110

You're not like her.

483
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,070
Ran.

484
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,350
Your mom

485
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,840
didn't choose to take you away.

486
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,640
Do you blame her?

487
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,350
I don't know.

488
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,010
Maybe I was too young back then.

489
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,880
When I grew up,

490
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,250
I didn't feel anything special.

491
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,250
Anyway,

492
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,920
I've turned out great.

493
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,090
No matter who you grew up with,

494
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,480
you'd be outstanding.

495
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,840
I used to...

496
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,390
blame her

497
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,000
for not

498
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,700
trying harder for me.

499
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
She perseveres in everything else.

500
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,150
Why couldn't she do that for me?

501
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,900
Was I that unworthy?

502
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,320
She just left me at someone else's home.

503
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,880
I was like an outsider,

504
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,880
feeling awkward as I watched the three of them live together as a family.

505
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,430
I feel awkward easily.

506
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,880
I'm afraid of awkwardness the most.

507
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,680
You know that.

508
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,720
My dear Ran,

509
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
you can blame her.

510
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:29,910
It's okay.

511
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,320
But I think

512
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,760
your mom

513
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,950
must have started to regret it long ago.

514
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,150
Because she didn't get to watch

515
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,090
her outstanding daughter grow up.

516
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,870
Zan.

517
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,750
I really don't blame her anymore.

518
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,750
If she had taken me away,

519
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,970
I probably wouldn't have met you.

520
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,650
If so, no matter how great I turned out, I wouldn't be happy.

521
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,100
I think it was worth living the past 20 years or so

522
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,890
in awkwardness in exchange for

523
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,400
the moment I stepped on the mine.

524
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,950
Maybe it was

525
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,620
a blessing in disguise.

526
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,960
I've never heard

527
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,600
someone

528
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,030
call stepping on a mine

529
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,760
a blessing in disguise before.

530
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,530
Don't worry.

531
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,130
No matter if you lived with your dad or mom,

532
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,750
you'd meet me.

533
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,510
Because I'm an old horse that knows the way.

534
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,040
I'd always find you.

535
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,389
Okay.

536
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,360
Old horse.

537
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,360
Mom.

538
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
This is Li Zan.

539
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,070
This is my mom.

540
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,480
Nice to meet you, Ms. Ran.

541
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,409
Nice to meet you.

542
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:42,810
Have a seat.

543
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,550
I didn't know what you liked,

544
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,280
so I ordered some specialties.

545
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,280
I'm not picky about food.

546
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,410
You're indeed good-looking.

547
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,160
Mom.

548
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,190
How can you comment on his appearance

549
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,960
right after you met him?

550
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,250
Besides,

551
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,010
am I that shallow?

552
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,170
Song Ran didn't tell me you came to Dicheng.

553
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,030
Otherwise, I'd have invited you to dinner long ago.

554
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,050
It's not Ran's fault.

555
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,850
I was thoughtless.

556
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,170
I should have visited you earlier.

557
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,780
Zan is usually very busy.

558
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,410
Every time he comes,

559
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,400
he can only stay for about a day.

560
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,180
Every time?

561
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,800
What was your major?

562
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,260
Engineering blasting.

563
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,290
That's a rare major.

564
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,050
Isn't it dangerous?

565
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,480
No.

566
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,820
With accurate calculations in advance,

567
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,950
the error at the time of a blast is small

568
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,230
and neglectable.

569
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,760
I saw you in Song Ran's interview.

570
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,780
You often volunteer, too?

571
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:21,810
Yes.

572
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,360
I volunteer when I have time.

573
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,330
Those poor and run-down areas

574
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,300
are dangerous.

575
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,800
Why do you think everything is dangerous?

576
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,330
I think

577
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,980
you're now in real danger

578
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,750
as you're obsessed with him.

579
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,150
I...

580
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,710
Ms. Ran, is there anything you don't eat?

581
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,960
Let me get you some soup.

582
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
I don't like it.

583
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
Song Ran likes it.

584
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,190
Okay.

585
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:20,280
Isn't my daughter weird?

586
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,480
She likes

587
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,960
to eat off-cuts like this.

588
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,230
Here.

589
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,530
Thank you.

590
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,360
Where are you from?

591
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,030
My ancestors were from Jiangcheng,

592
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,860
but I was born in Xi Country

593
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,890
and went to university there.

594
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,950
After my father retired, he came back to China and settled down.

595
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:55,270
I also plan to come back and keep him company.

596
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,030
What did your father do before he retired?

597
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,840
He was an architecture major, too.

598
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,970
What about your mom?

599
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,130
My mom was an elementary school teacher.

600
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,230
She passed away when I was five.

601
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,190
After all these years,

602
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,810
you dad never remarried?

603
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,700
Mom.

604
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,720
What?

605
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,400
No, he didn't.

606
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,760
My dad

607
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,290
has always been alone.

608
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,290
I told him many times

609
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,010
that I didn't mind him finding a partner,

610
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,210
but he didn't want to.

611
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,110
He said

612
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,280
my mom was very petty,

613
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,860
and she'd mind.

614
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,340
If he found a new partner,

615
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,310
my mom wouldn't talk to him

616
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,930
when they were reunited in heaven.

617
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,030
Zan's dad is infatuated.

618
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,500
He only loves Zan's mother.

619
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,240
He's very handsome.

620
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,420
You can tell by looking at Zan.

621
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,940
Many women pursued Zan's dad,

622
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,710
but he said he only loves Zan's mom.

623
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,630
That's rare.

624
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,820
Eat up.

625
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,510
Mom.

626
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,580
What do you think?

627
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,490
I don't quite agree.

628
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,150
That means

629
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,130
you kind of agree.

630
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,340
You are still young.

631
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:52,560
Let's observe him for a few more years.

632
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,730
But your dad definitely won't agree.

633
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,550
Why not?

634
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,000
Why not?

635
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,760
He spent much effort

636
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,690
raising you to be a great reporter.

637
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,530
He must want you to marry a rich and powerful man.

638
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,990
Is that what you want, too?

639
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,720
I hope you can find someone who truly loves you

640
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,440
and won't betray you.

641
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,740
You can get much hurt,

642
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,980
but you can't have your heart broken.

643
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,440
When you come to Dicheng in the future, stay at our place

644
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,640
instead of the hotel.

645
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,980
Thank you, Ms. Ran.

646
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,960
You're welcome.

647
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,670
We have guest rooms. It's convenient.

648
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,840
Why did she look at me?

649
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,600
I wasn't trying to say anything.

650
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,790
What's with this?

651
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:23,280
Why did you come to me with your laptop?

652
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
You were thinking

653
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,900
if your mom caught us,

654
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,620
you could tell her we were reviewing our schoolwork, right?

655
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,620
What schoolwork?

656
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,220
Elopement?

657
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,510
Okay.

658
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,610
Let's review the elopement.

659
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:47,130
I'm here for something serious.
