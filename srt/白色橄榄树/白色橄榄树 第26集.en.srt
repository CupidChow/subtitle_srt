[Episode 26]

3
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,650
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,789
Give it to me.

5
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,010
Mom.

6
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,630
After the treatment,

7
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,620
let's go stay in our hometown for a whil.e

8
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,190
Winter is coming.

9
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
The haze in Dicheng is too severe.

10
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,820
Even one who's not sick would get lung diseases.

11
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,470
Now that I'm back home,

12
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,630
I have to start working.

13
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,870
How can I leave?

14
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,840
Besides, the winter in our hometown

15
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,090
is cold and humid.

16
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
Even if we don't get lung disease,

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
we'd get rheumatism.

18
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,160
I knew it.

19
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,290
Just wasting my breath here.

20
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,540
Did you have a fight with Li Zan?

21
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,790
No.

22
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,210
Just because he's going to Eastern Country?

23
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,620
How did you know?

24
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
I asked him.

25
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,000
He answered me honestly.

26
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,460
He even told you...

27
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,190
Yet he didn't tell me.

28
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,510
Did you ask him?

29
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,040
I didn't want to pressure him.

30
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,950
That's probably why

31
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,390
he didn't tell you.

32
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,170
I don't think there's a need

33
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,650
to be so stubborn with Li Zan.

34
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,870
Don't you know him?

35
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,600
When you knew him,

36
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,480
he was a volunteer.

37
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,200
Switch around your perspectives:

38
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,370
if you have to go for an interview,

39
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,190
what if he doesn't let you go?

40
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,409
That's different.

41
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,909
What he does is too dangerous.

42
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,659
Dangerous?

43
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,290
You stepped on a bomb and encountered an explosion.

44
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,030
Aren't those dangerous?

45
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,970
I'm your mother.

46
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,030
How many times have I told you not to go?

47
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,360
Have you listened to me?

48
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,370
He's a man.

49
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,870
If he doesn't go

50
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,610
just because you don't agree,

51
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,980
then what's the use of having a man like him?

52
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,280
Men can love women,

53
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,190
but they can't always

54
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,390
listen to women.

55
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,520
Women are the same.

56
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,840
We don't depend on anyone.

57
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,390
Listen to your heart.

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,130
When you're in sync,

59
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,870
you are the best couple.

60
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,820
If you don't get along, break up as soon as possible.

61
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:34,150
Don't hurt each other.

62
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,780
I know.

63
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,450
Then why are you making a fuss?

64
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,180
Mom.

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,630
Sometimes...

66
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,780
I hate myself too.

67
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,600
Why?

68
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,770
Maybe you're right.

69
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,520
I was not strong enough

70
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,670
that I got sick.

71
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,240
I'm not talking about my eyes

72
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,760
but mental illness.

73
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,810
If I weren't sick,

74
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,480
maybe I wouldn't have

75
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,280
kicked up such a fuss with Li Zan.

76
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,640
Ran.

77
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,480
What I said was wrong.

78
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,950
Don't be too harsh on yourself.

79
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,180
Zan...

80
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,780
How are you now?

81
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,460
Do you hate me a lot?

82
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,630
[Shen Bei]

83
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,490
Hello, Shen Bei.

84
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,020
Hello, Song Ran.

85
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,390
How have you been?

86
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,870
Not bad.

87
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,620
I've been busy lately.

88
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,180
What about you?

89
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,380
How is your mother?

90
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,970
Has she recovered?

91
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,840
Mom and I are fine.

92
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,800
Thank you.

93
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,880
It's good that you've recovered.

94
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,550
Shen Bei,

95
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,360
have you seen Sasin, Ben

96
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,880
and the others lately?

97
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,570
You want to ask about Li Zan, right?

98
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,080
Don't be shy.

99
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,320
Is it hard to contact him recently?

100
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,190
Don't blame him.

101
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,190
Since Zoro died,

102
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,090
everyone's been like that.

103
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,790
Everyone has been giving their all

104
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,050
working day and night.

105
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,660
Zoro's dead?

106
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,430
How could that...

107
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:11,740
When did it happen?

108
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,240
You... You didn't know?

109
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,290
Li Zan didn't tell you?

110
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,280
Benjamin called me saying...

111
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,200
that the situation in Eastern Country is very bad.

112
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,920
Zan...

113
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,570
Why didn't you tell me?

114
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,440
Why do you always

115
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,660
not tell me things?

116
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,290
At that time,

117
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,980
I said something like that...

118
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,620
You won't forgive me anymore, will you?

119
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,910
Okay, you guys go ahead with the meeting.

120
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,410
Yes. Okay.

121
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:09,980
Send the meeting minutes

122
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,990
to me as soon as you can.

123
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,370
I will have a look.

124
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,750
Okay.

125
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,630
All right.

126
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,600
Check your phone.

127
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,750
Mom.

128
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,170
I'm going to Eastern Country too.

129
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
To see Li Zan?

130
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,910
No.

131
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,300
I don't plan to tell him.

132
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,090
I only found out yesterday that

133
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,210
the boy who was saved by Li Zan

134
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,000
in the photo "Carry"...

135
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,620
died.

136
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,630
He was killed by a landmine.

137
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,790
Now I understand

138
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,630
why Li Zan insisted on

139
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,090
going to Eastern Country.

140
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,480
This has

141
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,270
nothing to do with

142
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,240
bloodline, country,

143
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,870
or responsibility.

144
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,080
It's an instinct.

145
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,660
An instinct that stems from kindness.

146
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,630
This instinct

147
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,100
makes it impossible for me to stay at home

148
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,270
and do nothing.

149
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,360
Because fate

150
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,580
has connected me with

151
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,370
the land and people there.

152
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,410
This kind of connection

153
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,780
can't be cut off and ignored

154
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,310
just like that.

155
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,260
Mom...

156
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,400
Do you understand?

157
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,780
Yes.

158
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,010
It means

159
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
you must go.

160
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,660
It's useless for me to oppose.

161
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,730
Mom...

162
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,110
I only have one request.

163
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,560
Go there after a month.

164
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,960
First, you need to calm yourself down.

165
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,030
To prove that this is not an

166
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,230
impulsive decision.

167
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,690
Second,

168
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,360
give yourself a month to adjust your state.

169
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,630
After all, too many things happened recently.

170
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,910
You need to rest and adjust.

171
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,400
Since you're going to such a dangerous place,

172
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
you need to be in the best condition.

173
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,760
Mom.

174
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,010
Now I know

175
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,930
why you have

176
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,460
such a successful career.

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,690
Okay.

178
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,570
I'll listen to you.

179
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,660
Stop flattering me.

180
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,700
Even if you put it nicely,

181
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,000
you still left home

182
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,080
when I was sick.

183
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,800
When you were working just now,

184
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,790
I didn't see you saying you were sick.

185
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,000
Right.

186
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,910
When you leave,

187
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,550
I can do whatever I want.

188
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,120
No one will control me anymore.

189
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,910
I can–

190
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:41,830
No way.

191
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,690
After I leave,

192
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,410
you need to cooperate with the treatment.

193
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,630
I'll call your secretary

194
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,090
to check up on everything.

195
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,230
Look at you.

196
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,670
Zan.

197
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,570
Clear!

198
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Your method

199
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,590
can not only reduce casualties,

200
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,270
but also not implicate the residents around.

201
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,730
You really helped us a lot.

202
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,120
But that wouldn't be possible

203
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,000
without someone as good as you.

204
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,000
He's not the only good one around here.

205
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,240
He just doesn't give others

206
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,570
a chance to show others.

207
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,090
What? Are you not convinced?

208
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,850
In the next competition,

209
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,200
win me.

210
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I'll let you do it.

211
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,310
That competition

212
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,710
is not fair to start with.

213
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,850
It's all about brute force.

214
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,140
What's fair then?

215
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,680
Write news articles?

216
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:58,750
You...

217
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,960
How is my hair?

218
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,920
Captain, the scene is all cleaned.

219
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,300
Good.

220
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,210
We've been here

221
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,010
about three times now, right?

222
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,400
Those bastards are like moles.

223
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,079
When you hit them, they run.

224
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,089
When you leave,

225
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,849
they will sneak their way back.

226
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,080
Well, it's great now,

227
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,250
it's completely gone.

228
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,280
There are many abandoned buildings

229
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,720
that are occupied by these riots

230
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,520
around Uglai.

231
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,680
Don't worry.

232
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,200
We have Zan.

233
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:51,850
Captain.

234
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,290
What are you looking at?

235
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,910
Go do your job.

236
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,830
Yes, captain!

237
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:16,940
Ben.

238
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,280
I'll take a look over there.

239
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,020
♫Don't know where this road♫

240
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,210
♫Takes me to♫

241
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,960
♫Don't know where to restart♫

242
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,820
♫Feeling a fool♫

243
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,820
♫I'm staring out the night♫

244
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,570
♫Bury deep my pain♫

245

♫To the place feeling good♫

♫Don't cost a thing♫

♫This is not what I want♫

248
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,540
♫I'm not running from♫

256

Chinese?

257

♫Should have known you'd♫

258
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,740
Yes.

259
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,830
♫Bring me this way♫

260
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,950
You're a good person.

261
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:46,800
♫Saying goodbye to the place where I call home♫

262
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
You should go now.

263
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,090
I don't want you to die here with me.

264
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,550
Try it today.

265
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,550
Okay.

266
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,420
Zan, what are you doing?

267
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,850
He's looking at the scenery.

268
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,160
Yes.

269
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Do you want to come up and have a look?

270
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,310
I'm not as romantic as you.

271
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:38,930
We're going back.

272
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,350
Come down.

273
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,510
Tell me the truth.

274
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,110
What were you looking at?

275
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,580
I've been on this road before.

276
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,130
It looks familiar.

277
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,960
What for?

278
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,070
I saved a girl.

279
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Song told me

280
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,030
she met Zan

281
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,540
around here.

282
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,240
So the girl Zan mentioned

283
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,810
should be Song, right?

284
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,050
Who else could it be?

285
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,940
Zan is a nostalgic person.

286
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,690
Just like me.

287
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,550
Do you have to brag

288
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,000
any chance you get?

289
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,750
Am I bragging?

290
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,790
If I'm not a nostalgic person,

291
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,590
I wouldn't be somewhere this...

292
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,960
Fine.

293
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,510
If I'm not a nostalgic person,

294
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,030
I wouldn't be somewhere

295
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,340
this beautiful and charming.

296
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,670
All right, let's be serious.

297
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
What happened between Zan and Song?

298
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,920
Since the first day Zan came back,

299
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,030
you stopped me from mentioning Song

300
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,960
in front of him.

301
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,720
You're still young. You don't understand.

302
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
Pack up. Let's go back.

303
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,000
This old man...

304
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,130
I'll get off here.

305
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,970
I'm going to visit a friend.

306
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,850
I'll go with you.

307
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,830
Sasin.

308
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,830
You drive.

309
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,660
Why would you go?

310
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,890
To get my eyes checked.

311
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,640
Cut the crap and drive.

312
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,330
Your eyes

313
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,950
recovered two months ago.

314
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,980
Unless you have a third eye?

315
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,440
Are you a doctor?

316
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,370
What do you know?

317
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,440
It's because there's a doctor there

318
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,640
who knows everything

319
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,690
that your eyes won't recover.

320
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,880
It seems Sasin

321
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,970
has a problem

322
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,320
with you chasing girls?

323
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
He's young. He doesn't understand.

324
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,070
Besides,

325
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,400
I really like Dr. Pei.

326
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,120
I'm serious about this.

327
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,430
Sasin treats you

328
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,510
is like a brother.

329
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,930
He wants to protect you

330
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,680
and doesn't want to share you with others.

331
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,050
I think he really treats you as his family.

332
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,570
He relies on you.

333
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,680
Really?

334
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,440
I don't understand.

335
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,970
When I was in the orphanage,

336
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,550
those so-called siblings

337
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,320
didn't have such feelings.

338
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,400
No wonder he always goes against me

339
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,730
and likes to control me.

340
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,070
Am I the captain

341
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,310
or is he the captain?

342
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,200
I’m not used to it.

343
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,350
It's rare.

344
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,310
It's good

345
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,530
to have another family.

346
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,630
It's too troublesome.

347
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:08,000
Give the medicine for Bed 3.

348
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,400
Dr. Pei.

349
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,680
Why are you in the hospital?

350
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,960
Did anyone get hurt?

351
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,540
Benjamin, you're injured again?

352
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,550
Can't you hope me well?

353
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,070
Why do you always want me to get hurt?

354
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,350
I...

355
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,770
What are you here for then?

356
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,400
I'm busy now.

357
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,160
I'm here to see a patient.

358
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,930
Yes.

359
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,890
Zan asked me to come with him to see a patient.

360
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,000
Which patient?

361
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,700
Which department?

362
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,330
A wounded soldier from Eastern Country

363
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:24,810
who's warded on the third floor.

364
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,790
Oh. I know.

365
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,510
The nurse said

366
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,830
there's a very handsome volunteer

367
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,270
who visits him very often.

368
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,350
So it's you.

369
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,070
I'll go ahead first then.

370
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,670
I'll leave you to it, Dr. Pei.

371
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,590
Go ahead.

372
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,880
Goodbye, Dr. Pei.

373
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,790
Benjamin?

374
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,330
You're going to?

375
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,550
Are you really here to see the patient with Instructor Li?

376
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,420
Yes.

377
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,100
Who do you think I'm here to see?

378
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,130
Zan!

379
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,430
Are you really going with me?

380
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,970
That's not suitable for me.

381
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,530
I'll see you off here.

382
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,210
A woman as independent

383
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,700
and confident like Dr. Pei

384
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,660
wouldn't like men to be around her every day.

385
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,210
It's no fun, no difficulty.

386
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,490
You need to give her a sense of defeat sometimes.

387
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,030
So you came here

388
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,860
to give her a sense of defeat?

389
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,870
Of course not.

390
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,400
I'm going to the bar next to the hospital

391
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,750
and wait for her to get off work.

392
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,550
After work, Dr. Pei would always

393
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,370
go relax at the bar.

394
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
We'll "meet by chance" tonight.

395
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,760
It's great to see you, Instructor Li.

396
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,720
How's his condition?

397
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,350
His leg injury is recovering quite well.

398
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,270
With a bit more time in the hospital,

399
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,350
he will be fine.

400
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,270
Still the same:

401
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,350
not talking to anyone,

402
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,240
mostly quiet.

403
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,310
But he experienced nightmares every day.

404
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,070
And sometimes, sudden outbursts.

405
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,440
And just moments ago he...

406
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,920
I'll check on him.

407
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,160
Sure.

408
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,600
It's me.

409
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,680
What is that?

410
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,620
I have a gift for you.

411
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,250
♫When the moonlight♫

412
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,310
♫Glows on you♫

413
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,140
♫A soft glowing ring♫

414
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,220
I could only find this here.

415
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:12,570
♫You're dancing in the grace♫

416
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,120
But I heard it.

417
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,430
The sound quality is not bad.

418
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,360
♫Moonlight, touch your face♫

419
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,270
This song...

420
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,970
♫Weave their dreams away♫

421
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,970
♫Let the stars fall in space♫

422
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:21,950
is very nice.

423
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,730
Whenever I have nightmares

424
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,710
or can't sleep,

425
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,720
♫As you're moving close to me♫

426
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920
I'll listen to it.

00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,720
♫My heart will never believe♫

428
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
It's useful.

429
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,640
You can try

430
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,200
♫Cause you're so beautiful♫

431

435
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,670
♫Over in the sky, tonight♫

436
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,110
I know it's hard.

437
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,620
But you have to hang in there.

438
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,970
You'll get better.

439
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,840
♫When the moonlight♫

440
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,790

♫The song of snowing the white♫

445
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,010

459
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,270
Zan.

460
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,300
You're back.

461
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,010
Do you have time now?

462
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,720
Help me with the bomb disposal practice.

463
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,330
Sure.

464
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,240
This question...

465
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,790
Sasin.

466
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,890
So you're here.

467
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,820
When will the captain be back?

468
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,070
How would I know?

469
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,880
He won't check in with me.

470
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,070
But... But I have something to tell him.

471
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,929
What's going on?

472
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,580
You come out here.

473
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,230
Wait for me.

474
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,110
We have a new bomb disposal expert

475
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,989
looking to report to the captain.

476
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,840
He's waiting outside his tent.

477
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,670
Why do we need a new one?

478
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:36,330
We have Zan.

479
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:38,940
Captain said Instructor Li recommended him.

480
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,280
Instructor Li?

481
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,440
Let him stay for now.

482
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,699
I'll find the captain later.

483
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,480
Okay.

484
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,280
Zan.

485
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,770
Why?

486
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,330
Haven't you always been

487
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,550
instructing and training our Special Forces members?

488
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,000
We have already built rapport.

489
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,400
Accidents won't happen.

490
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,910
The bomb disposer from before

491
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,760
was not familiar with the situation

492
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,570
and ran in the opposite direction,

493
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,780
which was why he was shot

494
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,840
by those bastards.

495
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,980
So I don't want another newbie

496
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,230
to die for nothing.

497
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,840
Why did you recommend Ben

498
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,740
to recruit new employees?

499
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,630
I only got a level three certificate this time.

500
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,760
I'm only qualified to demine,

501
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
not bomb disposal.

502
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,340
I was held up by the final bomb disposal exam.

503
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,910
I had something to do.

504
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,170
Shall we continue?

505
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,120
For this line...

506
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,750
They need help!

507
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,470
Eric, go help him.

508
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,510
Be careful.

509
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,190
Okay.

510
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,400
You've gone too far.

511
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,670
You're even watching me at the door.

512
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,670
Sasin?

513
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:56,990
What's wrong?

514
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,700
Why are you in a trance?

515
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,360
Ben.

516
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,150
Tell me honestly.

517
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,610
Did something happen to Zan?

518
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,570
Why did you say something so strange?

519
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,290
The new bomb disposer is here today.

520
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:27,080
Zan said he recommended him to you.

521
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,220
Why didn't you tell me?

522
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,030
Why should I?

523
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,440
I'm the captain.

524
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,590
Don't play dumb.

525
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,630
You think there's something wrong,

526
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,290
that's why you kept it from me.

527
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,120
I just recalled,

528
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,490
and Zan is indeed different

529
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,890
this time.

530
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,630
When someone made a mistake demining,

531
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,560
he wasn't the first one to go there–

532
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,340
in fact, he never went.

533
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,760
This is not like him.

534
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,880
Not at all.

535
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,840
Also.

536
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,420
Don't you think

537
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,080
he rarely smiles now too?

538
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,200
I thought it was because of Song.

539
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,250
But it's definitely not that simple.

540
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,730
What do you know?

541
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,870
Tell me.

542
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,280
I know nothing

543
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,550
just like you.

544
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:41,960
It's true.

545
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,840
But I do think

546
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,320
that Zan is

547
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,850
different from before too.

548
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,350
But after the explosion of 9/26,

549
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,050
no one has been the same as before.

550
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,700
Zan has a mind of his own

551
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,760
and is stubborn.

552
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,740
Let him handle it himself.

553
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,530
If he needs us,

554
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,560
he will say it.

555
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,030
Just like what happened with Song.

556
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,630
He took the initiative to talk about it, right?

557
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,510
You're so young.

558
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,370
Why do you act like an old man.

559
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,390
You're such a busybody.

560
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,770
Go back to sleep.

561
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,470
Zan!

562
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:13,110
♫Heartache♫

563
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,430
♫Like a knife in my chest♫

564
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,590
I can't handle it.

565
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,460
♫Silent tears♫

566
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,640
I can't hold it out alone.

567
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:24,380
♫Falling down from my eyes♫

568
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,070
Do you know

569
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,130
what you're doing?

570
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,760
If you have to go,

571
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,980
♫Lost in the waves♫

572
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:27,360
don't delay it

573
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,150
You're not one to go back on your words.

574
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,670
♫Can't find my way back♫

575
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:31,480
I won't be the person

576
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,840
holding you back either.

577
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,590
♫Like two lonely islands♫

578
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,000
Do me a favor.

579
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,000
Don't contact me anymore.

580
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,170
♫Drifting far apart♫

581
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,360
♫Feeling like a castaway♫

582
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,120
♫Stranded here alone♫

583
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,620
♫No place feels like home♫

584
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,260
♫Feeling like far from home♫

585
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,930
♫You don't belong to me♫

586
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,510
♫I know, not anymore♫

587
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,050
♫In this darkness♫

588
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,500
♫Search for a light♫

589
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,380
♫Hoping some day♫

590
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,180
♫I'll find my way back to life♫

591
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:36,360
♫Find my way back to life♫

592
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,420
Jiang Lin.

593
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,500
You trust that I will recover, right?

594
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,400
I have to recover.
