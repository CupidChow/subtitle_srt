4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,150
Today,

5
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,009
I finally understand what domestic harmony means.

6
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,560
Instructor Li,

7
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,670
hurry up and get Ms. Song out of here.

8
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,020
If you stay any longer,

9
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,110
I'm going to be very angry.

10
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,310
Okay.

11
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,510
I'll take Ran for a meal first.

12
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,960
If you still have things to do later,

13
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,360
I'll bring Ran back.

14
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,490
No need.

15
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,170
I don't want to be a bad guy.

16
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,430
Song Ran, let's get in touch tomorrow.

17
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,910
Okay.

18
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,150
Shen Bei,

19
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,680
help me tell Jose

20
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,800
to put my luggage and bag

21
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,870
in the hotel.

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,450
I'm staying at the same hotel as last time.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,840
Okay, got it.

24
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,480
Let's go.

25
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,900
Are you tired?

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,670
Why didn't you come earlier?

27
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,390
I was worried my girlfriend would get jealous.

28
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,920
I'm not that petty.

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,870
Besides,

30
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,290
Shen Bei doesn't like you anymore.

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,260
It doesn't matter.

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,520
As long as you like me.

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,120
Before I came to Eastern Country,

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
I went to Li Zan.

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,940
I asked him why he chose you

36
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,440
and how you outshine me.

37
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,030
He said...

38
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,840
-a landmine stepped on by accident.
-A landmine stepped on by accident,

39
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,190
an old elevator,

40
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,720
an apple,

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
a comb,

42
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,250
and a dance together in the moonlight.

43
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,490
It seems all these are the reason,

44
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,680
yet it seems none of them is.

45
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,400
I can't really explain why.

46
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,280
Maybe it's a matter of fate

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,450
or a feeling of heart-pounding excitement.

48
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,290
What do you want to eat?

49
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,230
Barbecue.

50
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
Just as I guessed.

51
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,240
Let's go.

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,829
Here.

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,240
Wait a second.

54
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,490
Let's celebrate first.

55
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,560
Celebrate what?

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,600
Celebrate that I've figured out your secret.

57
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,560
♫When the moonlight♫

58
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,620

59

♫A soft glowing ring♫

64

♫Moonlight, touch your face♫

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,870

66
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,409
fall in love with me?

67

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,830
Since that landmine?

70

That comb?

71
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,030
♫As you're moving close to me♫

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,660

♫My heart will never believe♫

74
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,870

♫Cause you're so beautiful♫

76

♫This love will never change♫

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,200
You must be thirsty.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,530
I'm going to buy you a bottle of water.

79
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,260
♫Halo on your side♫

80
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,290

♫You are so beautiful♫

82
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,159
Hurry back!

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,140
♫Like angel from the stars♫

84
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:47,940
♫Over in the sky, tonight♫

85
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,680
You came to the north too?

86
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:51,950
A journalist

87
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,630
indeed goes wherever is dangerous

88
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,920
or where death occurs.

89
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,600
Madam,

90
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,930
if you want it,

91
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,280
I can give it to you.

92
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,830
We're also journalists.

93
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,270
Where does your patronizing tone come from?

94
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,600
Catching a hot spot

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,640
and become famous, isn't that what we're all after?

96
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,620
It seems that we're different,

97
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,310
not only in courage,

98
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,390
but also in consciousness.

99
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,040
I know you.

100
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,070
The Chinese journalist

101
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,750
who won a prize with Candy, right?

102
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,240
You're the one who benefited most

103
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,870
from the country's disaster.

104
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,870
Who are you to criticize me?

105
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,100
You are called a vulture on the web, aren't you?

106
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,159
We're the same.

107
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,430
Please don't include me in your category.

108
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,070
I'm different from you.

109
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,280
You, a journalist, who profits from the suffering of others,

110
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,750
have tarnished the reputation of our entire profession.

111
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,090
You are the true vulture.

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,590
Let me tell you,

113
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,100
I've won the Boshi Prize,

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
something you'll never achieve,

115
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,400
no matter how much suffering you witness.

116
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,430
Is there any problem?

117
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,390
She's my girlfriend.

118
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,800
Even in this country,

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,110
I won't allow anyone to bully her.

120
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,000
So you'd better be a gentleman,

121
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,710
and don't get yourself into trouble.

122
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,330
Don't be angry.

123
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,210
You shouldn't be angry.

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,000
Zan,

125
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,940
you acted... like a ruffian just now.

126
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,549
I really don't know if you're praising me

127
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,539
or mocking me.

128
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,390
Sir, we are ready to order.

129
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,030
We don't have anything you want.

130
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,980
Get out of here!

131
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,210
You rude people!

132
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,890
Get out!

133
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:44,900
What?

134
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Are you crazy?

135
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,120
Damn it!

136
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,170
What a nutcase!

137
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,100
Shit!

138
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,970
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,580
Only for you.

140
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,380
You're so welcome.

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,680
Zan.

142
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,960
Are we really not going to pay?

143
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,440
You don't want to pay for your meal?

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
I think you're the ruffian here.

145
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,070
I'm not.

146
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm worried if we pay,

147
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,080
the boss might be unhappy.

148
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,130
Then we can secretly put the money

149
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,600
under the plate.

150
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,800
Smart guy.

151
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,840
Come on,

152
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,020
eat.

153
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,180
You know those journalists?

154
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
I met them in Uglai,

155
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,630
when we

156
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,470
bumped into each other in the stairwell.

157
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,070
You treated me harshly that time.

158
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
This thing is dangerous.

159
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,340
It's not something you should play with.

160
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,470
So he gave you the knife.

161
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,540
He insisted on giving it to me.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,850
I didn't...

163
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,090
Anyway, you threw it away in the end.

164
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,790
I should have treated him

165
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,200
more harshly just now.

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,540
As long as you don't treat me harshly.

167
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,480
That day...

168
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,630
I treated you harshly?

169
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,900
Okay, I'll be more careful next time.

170
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,620
I won't treat you harshly anymore.

171
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,390
Okay.

172
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,040
I have a demining mission early tomorrow morning.

173
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,640
Do you want to come and watch?

174
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,480
Sure.

175
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,080
I'll go help at the orphanage in the morning.

176
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,630
I'll go to you in the afternoon.

177
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,820
Send me the address.

178
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,550
Sasin?

179
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,320
That's Sasin.

180
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,960
Where's Zan?

181
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,890
Why are you running around?

182
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,970
Straying into a minefield is extremely dangerous.

183
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,300
I'm not running around.

184
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,900
I'm outside the warning line, right?

185
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,120
Besides,

186
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,080
even if I accidentally step on a landmine,

187
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,600
my boyfriend would come to save me.

188
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,320
Correct.

189
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,160
How did you know I'm here?

190
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,260
You came out for me?

191
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm not that capable.

192
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,250
The demining work is already over.

193
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,760
They're cleaning up now.

194
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,760
I came out to get some fresh air.

195
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,120
Zan.

196
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,820
You must be very tired.

197
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,720
A little.

198
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,320
The demining work requires intense concentration.

199
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,980
Maybe I've been tense for too long.

200
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,410
It's okay.

201
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm out here resting, right?

202
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,300
Come and sit.

203
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,290
Zan,

204
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,290
do you want to lie down and rest for a while?

205
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,380
This is fine.

206
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,430
How's it going at the orphanage?

207
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,670
It's going very well.

208
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,670
Almost done.

209
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
I really admire Shen Bei.

210
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,330
Rebuilding an orphanage in Eastern Country

211
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,810
shows she's perseverant

212
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,530
and very dedicated.

213
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,510
She's indeed changed a lot.

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,320
Last night, Shen Bei told me

215
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,630
if the present version of her

216
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,480
were to compete with me,

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,540
you might not choose me.

218
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,150
She was wrong.

219
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,910
I would still choose you.

220
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,170
Aren't you going to ask me why?

221
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,810
Any reason is fine,

222
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,720
as long as that's the answer.

223
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,760
Hey!

224
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,510
There's a dungeon here!

225
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,130
Let's go take a look.

226
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,840
What's going on?

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
We found a dungeon here.

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,780
But it seems all of them escaped.

229
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,470
Sasin is cleaning it up with the others right now.

230
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,310
Dungeon?

231
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,660
I want to go in and take some photos.

232
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,730
Be careful.

233
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,960
Sasin.

234
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,080
Zan.

235
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,120
Song.

236
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,940
Why did you come down here?

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,800
What's wrong?

238
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,270
This family

239
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,410
was taken here by insurgents.

240
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,600
The guards

241
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,160
knew we were on a demining mission nearby,

242
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,420
so they ran away first.

243
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,810
They activated the bomb before leaving.

244
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,900
But now it's too late to call

245
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,100
bomb disposers here.

246
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,560
I was just about to go find you

247
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,820
and see if there's anything you could do.

248
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,349
Zan.

249
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,750
I know you're scared,

250
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,600
but please calm down

251
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,940
for the sake of your children.

252
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,190
Try to soothe them,

253
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,070
and don't let them cry

254
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,720
or make big moves.

255
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,710
That would be a great help.

256
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:00,680
Okay.

257
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,350
We will remove those awful things

258
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,320
bounded on your bodies.

259
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,550
Defeating these bastards' plan

260
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,240
is the best way to fight back.

261
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,420
Sorry, sir.

262
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,680
What do you need us to do?

263
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,410
We will try our best.

264
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,030
You don't need to apologize.

265
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,680
You're all being brave enough.

266
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,400
The bomb's setup

267
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,310
makes me unable

268
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,640
to save any of them first.

269
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,080
But fortunately, there's only one detonator.

270
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,890
Once the detonator is removed,

271
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,510
they can be saved.

272
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,510
But it's still not safe here.

273
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:51,110
Sasin.

274
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,400
You get them out of the dungeon first.

275
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,640
Ran,

276
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,280
wait for me outside.

277
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,560
Trust me. It won't take long.

278
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,310
Zan,

279
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,240
I'll go get you a protective suit.

280
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,170
No need for that.

281
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,640
There's not enough time.

282
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,000
You get them out of the dungeon first.

283
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,060
Your presence here will distract me.

284
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,960
Zan.

285
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,810
I'll wait for you outside.

286
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,230
Trust me, Ran.

287
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,740
They are too noisy around.

288
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,110
I let them out.

289
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,150
That's more secure.

290
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:53,910
Song.

291
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,680
Let's go.

292
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,440
You go first.

293
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,000
Sir,

294
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,780
are you okay?

295
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,310
Please, save us!

296
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,500
Trust me, please.

297
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:31,920
We'll... save you.

298
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,880
Please... trust me.

299
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,600
Trust me.

300
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,960
What happened, sir?

301
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,930
Are you okay?

302
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,330
Sir,

303
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,090
please help us!

304
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,540
Let me help you.

305
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,960
Help us! Help us!

306
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,640
Trust me, please.

307
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,860
I can help you.

308
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,000
Trust me, please.

309
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,610
Let me save you.

310
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,270
Zan,

311
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:27,690
what's wrong?

312
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,770
Is the bomb too complicated?

313
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,720
Sorry.

314
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,270
Zan,

315
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,660
-you did your best.
-Get lost!

316
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,580
Let me save them.

317
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,050
Let me save them.

318
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,390
Sasin,

319
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,710
go.

320
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:14,110
You alone can't get the two of us out.

321
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,120
You! You almost got us killed!

322
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:02,260
You almost killed us!

323
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,720
Zan,

324
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,700
everything will be alright.

325
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,080
Everything will be alright.

326
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,010
Zan.

327
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,110
Zan.

328
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,510
Sir, are you okay?

329
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,510
Please.

330
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,930
Please.

331
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,510
Please.

332
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,380
Please save us.

333
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,160
Zan.

334
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,000
Zan.

335
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,740
♫A fire burning deep inside♫

336
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,430

♫You set me on fire♫

Zan.

382

♫Superhuman going straight to my brain♫

♫This is our revolution, yeah♫

395
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,660
Ran.

396
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,680
Now I want to tell you

397
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,000
what's been weighing on my mind.

398
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,250
Do you still want to hear it?

399
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,290
Yes.

400
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,070
On September 26,

401
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,630
the woman I originally wanted

402
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,350
to save

403
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,290
was actually

404
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,660
a suicidal insurgent.

405
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,530
This is a trait of someone who has practiced

406
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,390
pulling triggers for a long time.

407
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,750
I saw the walls of the nearby room were thick,

408
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,790
and it could minimize the explosion damage,

409
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:16,240
so I wanted to push her into that room.

410
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,640
But when I rushed towards her,

411
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,740
Jiang Lin knocked me down

412
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,650
and held her, rolling to the other side.

413
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,920
Then,

414
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,240
the bomb went off.

415
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,030
Just when I thought

416
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,350
Jiang Lin sacrificed himself

417
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,310
in order to save me,

418
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,550
the door of the room

419
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,470
I had planned to push the insurgent into

420
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,820
was blasted open.

421
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,280
Someone was...

422
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,240
in that room?

423
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,830
A family of four

424
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,730
was huddling together,

425
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:25,230
just like the family we saw today.

426
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,110
The shock and fear in their eyes

427
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,950
were just like those of the family today.

428
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,200
They just

429
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,790
stared at me,

430
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,140
like they knew

431
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,760
it was me

432
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,540
who almost got them killed.

433
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,200
And I

434
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,310
was the executioner.

435
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,110
It was my incompetence,

436
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,270
recklessness,

437
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,870
and self-righteousness

438
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,530
that ultimately cost

439
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,030
Jiang Lin's life,

440
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,880
so that that family didn't die.

441
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,750
Just like when I pressed the shutter

442
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,340
to take the photo of Candy,

443
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,200
I thought I was capturing the children's smiling faces,

444
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,640
but actually,

445
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,000
I was capturing

446
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,370
the last moment of their lives.

447
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,020
And I...

448
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,480
was the photographer who just stood there

449
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,880
and did nothing.

450
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,470
You're not like that.

451
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,720
Neither are you.

452
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,730
In situations like that,

453
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,310
what we could do was limited.

454
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,720
You know this better than anyone.

455
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,470
Blaming ourselves

456
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,790
or hating ourselves like enemies

457
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,000
is another kind of harm caused by war.

458
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,110
That is what I learned

459
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,000
from Candy.

460
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,470
Zan,

461
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,760
if we don't focus

462
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,270
on what we can do and what we

463
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,310
can change in a disaster,

464
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,490
who would have the perseverance to carry on?

465
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,790
I'm sorry, Ran.

466
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,480
I've let this barrier

467
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,550
exist between us for too long.

468
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm sorry, Ran.

469
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,790
Zan.

470
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,510
Zan!

471
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,830
That family is waiting to thank you.

472
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,830
They won't leave.

473
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,110
Okay.

474
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,590
Ran, let's go over there.

475
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,510
Zan.

476
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,440
Bu.

477
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:46,960
Zan.

478
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,490
We've arrived?

479
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,510
Zan.

480
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,890
Sleep in the hotel where I stay tonight, okay?

481
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,550
The hotel is more comfortable than the campsite.

482
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,790
I want you to get a good night's sleep.

483
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,400
Okay.

484
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,850
I'm so sleepy.

485
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,800
Ran.

486
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,030
We should never break up.

487
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,190
We won't.

488
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,670
What happened last time doesn't count.

489
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,360
We've never been apart.

490
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,930
No matter what happens,

491
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
whether we get moody,

492
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,320
or have a quarrel,

493
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:51,370
or give each other the silent treatment,

494
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,710
we can't break up.

495
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,630
We won't.

496
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,330
We'll never be apart again.

497
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,190
You...

498
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,000
Why can't you just

499
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,360
stay in your own tent?

500
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,680
Why did you come out?

501
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,080
I came to check on Zan.

502
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,080
It was too dangerous during the day.

503
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
I'm a bit worried,

504
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,510
so I came to see

505
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,710
if he's okay.

506
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,150
Zan has Song

507
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,690
to take care of him.

508
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,490
It's not your concern.

509
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,260
But how are you?

510
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,840
You encountered an unexpected situation today.

511
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,130
Are you okay?

512
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,180
Of course I'm...

513
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,810
I should have gone with you.

514
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:38,850
Forget it.

515
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,680
You didn't see what Zan was like today.

516
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,180
It was terrifying.

517
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,610
If you were there,

518
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:48,020
with your temper,

519
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,500
I'm afraid you two might fight first.

520
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,960
Is that so?

521
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,560
If we were to fight,

522
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,020
who would you help?

523
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,390
You.

524
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,810
You wish.

525
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,960
Your leg is injured.

526
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,490
Can't you behave yourself?

527
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,020
Be serious.

528
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,370
I have something to ask you.

529
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:37,850
Go ahead.

530
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,840
When Rina...

531
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,400
just passed away,

532
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,820
was my behavior also terrifying?

533
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,640
Not really.

534
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,950
You didn't scare others.

535
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
You scared me.

536
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,270
But it was okay.

537
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:15,450
So was it terrifying or not?

538
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,570
Of course.

539
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,790
I don't know how terrifying Zan's behavior was today,

540
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,590
but your behavior was no less terrifying than his.

541
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,810
If I hadn't tried

542
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,360
my best to keep an eye on you,

543
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,890
who knows what trouble you might have caused.

544
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,960
You're ungrateful,

545
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,890
and you even act like you want to eat me every day.

546
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,560
It's hard to be a good person.

547
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
I'm sorry.

548
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,410
What did you say?

549
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,980
I didn't say anything.

550
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,310
Did I say anything?

551
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:06,800
I'm going to bed.

552
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,480
Stop right there!

553
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,320
What did you just say?

554
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,050
Say it again!

555
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,020
I'm talking to you!

556
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,420
Who is making noise this late?

557
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,320
Captain!

558
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,400
What? Are you that delicate?

559
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,970
You can't even handle a little noise?

560
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,570
How are you going to manage on the battlefield?

561
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,150
W-What do you mean?

562
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,280
I don't understand.

563
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,440
Go back to sleep,

564
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:35,110
and don't come out again!

565
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:35,980
Yes, sir!

566
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,730
Jiang Yu did well in the midterm exam.

567
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,510
He took all the postcards you sent

568
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,840
to the school this time.

569
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,300
I think he'll compromise soon.

570
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:22,910
Thank you, Ms. Fu.

571
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,260
I hope when I return to China,

572
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,690
he'll have forgiven me.

573
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,190
No need to wait until you come back.

574
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,970
He's already stopped blaming you.

575
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,920
The essay topic for the midterm exam was

576
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,920
My Family.

577
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,880
I guess

578
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,140
he wrote about you.
