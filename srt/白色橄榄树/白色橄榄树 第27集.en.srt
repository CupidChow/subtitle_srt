00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,770
What happened?

177
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,610
Is she seriously injured?

178
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,470
What happened?

179
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,750
A patient

180
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,790
got agitated

181
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,540
and accidentally hurt her.

182
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,120
As for how serious it is,

183
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,180
you can ask Dr. Pei yourself

184
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,010
when she wakes up tomorrow.

185
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,820
Judging from your tone,

186
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,870
it's not serious.

187
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,120
What happened to your hand?

188
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,450
Got hurt saving Dr. Pei?

189
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,260
Just a minor wound.

190
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,980
No big deal.

191
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,150
Why didn't you wear protective gloves today?

192
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,350
You always wear them.

193
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,070
If you had, you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

194
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,870
I lost them

195
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
a while ago

196
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,950
and haven't had time to buy new ones.

197
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,790
Since you can't see Dr. Pei,

198
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,400
shouldn't you head back to camp?

199
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:23,080
You sound just like

200
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,230
that brat, Sasin.

201
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,200
So, you're not here

202
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,910
waiting for Dr. Pei today.

203
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,540
You're here drinking

204
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,420
because Sasin pissed you off.

205
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,630
Half right.

206
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,800
Sasin did piss me off,

207
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,280
so I came here to wait for Dr. Pei,

208
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,010
hoping love could wash it all away.

209
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,380
But

210
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,600
you ruined my plan.

211
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,960
So,

212
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,670
you have to drink with me.

213
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,510
You're being ungrateful.

214
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,109
But I'm still curious—

215
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,000
why does Sasin

216
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,990
always manage

217
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,920
to get under your skin?

218
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,740
He's not that capable.

219
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:29,960
He always acts like

220
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,420
he's at odds with himself.

221
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,560
We spent the whole day clearing mines.

222
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
Just as we were wrapping up,

223
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,110
we heard there was another minefield in the south of the city,

224
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,840
and he insisted on going alone.

225
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,620
I just put him in confinement.

226
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,640
Again?

227
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,830
Again?

228
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,970
Do I lock him up that often?

229
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,370
Since I got to Eastern Country,

230
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,350
you've done it at least ten times.

231
00:17:59,010 --> 00:17:59,640
So he's messed up

232
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,840
that many times, huh?

233
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,960
That's an interesting way

234
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,000
to look at it.

235
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,030
To be honest,

236
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,070
I have no idea

237
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,270
how to comfort Sasin.

238
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,610
I can just handle it the rough way.

239
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,480
Actually,

240
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,960
I think

241
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,620
your "confinement" approach

242
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,000
suits Sasin well.

243
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,590
Because the kind of pain

244
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,590
he's dealing with

245
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,640
can't be eased

246
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,550
by words.

247
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,050
Only time

248
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,070
can slowly heal those wounds.

249
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
As his friend,

250
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,610
the best you can do is protect him;

251
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,740
make sure he doesn't take on more wounds

252
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,460
before the old ones have even healed.

253
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,680
Ben,

254
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,200
Sasin is really lucky to have a captain

255
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,720
like you.

256
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,130
Zan.

257
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,790
You really are

258
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,410
an amazing friend.

259
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,410
I'm going to the hospital to check on Dr. Pei.

260
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,870
She's still unconscious,

261
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,130
but seeing her will put my mind at ease.

262
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,030
When I come back,

263
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,880
I'll take you back to camp with me.

264
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,510
No need.

265
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,670
I want to walk back alone.

266
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
One more, please.

267
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,030
Here.

268
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,720
Don't come any closer!

269
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,550
Stay back!

270
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,070
Kill me.

271
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,830
Kill… me.

272
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,360
It's okay.

273
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,550
Sorry to break your glass.

274
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,310
Here's the money.

275
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,460
So that's post-traumatic stress disorder?

276
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,190
Was Zan like that before too?

277
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,590
He was so proud,

278
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,790
so determined,

279
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,160
and so gentle.

280
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,370
Had he really become like that?

281
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,110
How sad must he have felt?

282
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,590
How did he get through it?

283
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:50,720
And me…

284
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,180
What have I done?

285
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,520
Go back and rest.

286
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,970
The lockdown is lifted.

287
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,510
Give me the key.

288
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,570
Yes, sir.

289
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,440
So quiet.

290
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,880
That boy isn't waiting behind the door

291
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,070
to ambush me, is he?

292
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,930
He actually fell asleep.

293
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:57,720
Looks like confinement doesn't work on him anymore.

294
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,390
Still just a kid.

295
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,990
He misses his mom.

296
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,200
You want to disobey my order

297
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,240
and act alone?

298
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,610
Lock him up.

299
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,440
Yes, sir.

300
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,160
Lock him up!

301
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:02,880
If you keep this up,

302
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,570
I'll…

303
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,070
Don't take your anger out on others.

304
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,310
Besides locking me up,

305
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,510
do you have any other way to deal with me?

306
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,160
You'll let me out

307
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,490
sooner or later anyway.

308
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,530
No wonder you were so cooperative this time.

309
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,030
Rina gave that to me.

310
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,060
You can't just take it back.

311
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,350
Fine.

312
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,150
If you won't give it to me,

313
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,270
then we'll trade.

314
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,830
Look at you, grinning in your sleep.

315
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,350
When you wake up tomorrow,

316
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,750
you're going to be so mad.

317
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,110
Serves you right, you little ingrate.

318
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,910
I'll teach you a lesson for Rina.

319
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,410
Hey, Mr. Driver.

320
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,280
Miss, were you okay yesterday?

321
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,510
I was fine.

322
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,330
Today, I need to go to the Uglai Hotel.

323
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,980
That's pretty far,

324
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,670
and we have to pass through a—

325
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,480
rat-a-tat-tat—

326
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,410
dangerous area.

327
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,920
Are you scared?

328
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,290
No.

329
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,550
I'll protect you.

330
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,290
Okay.

331
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,010
Let's go.

332
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,810
Let's go.

333
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,670
Ladies and gentlemen,

334
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,320
dear journalists,

335
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,920
welcome to today's press conference.

336
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,480
Madam,

337
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,920
there's such chaos in Eastern Country.

338
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,520
Everyone needs protection.

339
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,750
If you want it,

340
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,940
I can give it to you.

341
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,460
Thank you.

342
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,420
But I don't need it.

343
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,350
Confident, miss.

344
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,880
We've repeatedly refused the demands from the rebel forces for Ark's release

345
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,240
and intensified our efforts to strike against the remaining rebels.

346
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,750
Their arrogance

347
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,960
has now been quelled.

348
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,430
The situation in our country has stabilized.

349
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,650
How dare they say that?

350
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,320
Of course.

351
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,590
We'll do it.

352
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,920
Just brag,

353
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,590
saying how safe your country is

354
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,450
and how cruel those guys are.

355
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,880
As long as you're willing

356
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,770
to pay enough for our articles.

357
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,890
That's basically what's happened.

358
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,680
If you have any questions…

359
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,510
Am I wrong, miss?

360
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,350
I don't care about this.

361
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,300
Then why are you here?

362
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,560
What do you care about?

363
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,960
I only care about

364
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,440
when the people here

365
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,640
will stop suffering.

366
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,480
Now, Eastern Country has ample supplies,

367
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,160
enough for the people's production and daily activities,

368
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,030
thanks in part to international

369
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,440
assistance and support.

370
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,960
If you want it,

371
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,110
I can give it to you.

372
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,180
Thank you.

373
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,070
But I don't need it.

374
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,200
There are many horrible things in this country, miss.

375
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,000
It'll give you courage.

376
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,770
When did he

377
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,340
put this knife in my bag?

378
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,830
Is Zan's cut serious?

379
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:34,060
♫Stepping on my heart alone♫

380
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:43,890
♫You're triggering a bomb unknown♫

381
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:55,470
♫The sound goes wild where your light has flown♫

382
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,640
When did you get here?

383
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:04,070
♫Just stay where you are, don't go♫

384
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,750
Three days ago.

385
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,940
How long are you staying?

386
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,730
Not sure yet.

387
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,190
♫Explode into the pieces♫

388
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,320
Why do I feel like crying?

389
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,400
♫We flow from our souls♫

390
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,750
♫Explode into the pieces♫

391
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,250
Good thing the lights are off.

392
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,150
He probably didn't notice.

393
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:44,500
♫We flow, we're falling slow♫

394
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:55,490
♫We flow, we're falling slow♫

395
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,350
This is dangerous

396
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,250
and not suitable for girls.

397
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,810
Aren't you leaving?

398
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,760
I am.

399
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,300
So I really was overthinking it.

400
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,160
That glove wasn't Zan's.

401
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,659
Instructor Li.

402
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,490
Zan?

403
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,430
Zan hasn't left.

404
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,430
Is he following me?

405
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,840
Are you sick?

406
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,030
No.

407
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,970
I'm here to see...

408
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,110
to see a friend.

409
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,650
He just happens to be coming

410
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,980
to the hospital too.

411
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,320
I'm reading into

412
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,390
things again.

413
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,000
Dr. Pei.

414
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,320
Come in.

415
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,610
Song… Song Ran?

416
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,760
You...

417
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,760
When did you come to Eastern Country?

418
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,220
How did you know I was here?

419
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,120
I arrived three days ago.

420
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,440
Yesterday, when I came to find you,

421
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,720
I happened to see what happened.

422
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,840
I figured you'd be awake today,

423
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,170
so I came to check on you.

424
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,680
Sit down.

425
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,090
You caught me

426
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,360
in a total mess.

427
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,770
How's your injury?

428
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,860
Is it serious?

429
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:05,740
I'm fine.

430
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,040
It'll probably leave a scar for a while,

431
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,520
but I can cover it with this.

432
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,980
This color really suits you.

433
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,370
Doesn't it?

434
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,220
I just didn't expect

435
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,190
even the hospital to be this dangerous.

436
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,760
Didn't you see Li Zan?

437
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,950
It was too chaotic yesterday.

438
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,480
But today,

439
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,880
I saw him at the government's

440
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,940
press conference.

441
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,840
You came to Eastern Country,

442
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
and Li Zan didn't know?

443
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,860
You two aren't…

444
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,000
together?

445
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,970
I didn't tell him.

446
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,030
It's…

447
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,960
complicated.

448
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,510
Well,

449
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,210
you don't need to worry about me anymore.

450
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,810
I still

451
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,240
admire Li Zan,

452
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:27,170
and I still think he's very handsome,

453
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,830
but I don't think his personality really suits me.

454
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,850
But I should warn you—

455
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,740
a lot of the nurses here

456
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,190
have had their eyes on Li Zan.

457
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,080
I just want to give you this as a thank-you gift.

458
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,040
Especially the nurse in charge of

459
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,320
that soldier from yesterday.

460
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,070
Here you are.

461
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:45,880
Every time Li Zan comes by,

462
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,140
she goes to talk to him.

463
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,460
You didn't see her yesterday.

464
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,310
Even in that situation,

465
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,540
she was still standing beside Li Zan.

466
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,280
The admiration in her eyes

467
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,320
completely replaced any fear.

468
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,130
I'll take it.

469
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,620
Don't mention it anymore.

470
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:10,630
Alright.

471
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,710
But honestly,

472
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,960
I really do think

473
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,000
you and Li Zan are meant for each other.

474
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,130
Why?

475
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,150
Why?

476
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,660
Because you're just like him.

477
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,280
You both bottle everything up

478
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,810
like two closed books.

479
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,900
You're a book!

480
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,650
What are you looking at?

481
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,090
Xiaonan,

482
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,730
do you feel lonely in Eastern Country?

483
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:01,570
With my personality, how could I ever feel lonely?

484
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,680
Did you tell

485
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,700
Sasin and Benjamin you were coming?

486
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,190
They're on a mission in Uglai right now.

487
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,150
Their camp is still in the same place.

488
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:13,220
You can go see them.

489
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,500
They'd be

490
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,070
so happy to see you.

491
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:17,990
But it seems

492
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,500
they have some kind of training today.

493
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,610
If you want to see them,

494
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,740
you can go tomorrow.

495
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,250
I'll go see them tomorrow.

496
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,400
It's been so long.

497
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,960
I really miss them.

498
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,710
How do you know so much

499
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,860
about what they're up to?

500
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,870
Well,

501
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,960
someone told me, of course.

502
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,590
So the one who's perfect for you…

503
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
is Sasin?

504
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:09,710
Sa...

505
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:10,920
No…

506
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,400
You've learned to mess with me!

507
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,510
You and Benjamin

508
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,730
are perfect for each other.

509
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You two are alike.

510
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,020
Cherish him.

511
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,150
Seeing these siblings

512
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,810
reminded me of Sia and Zoro all over again.
