[Episode 17]

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,620
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
Your comfort is too perfunctory.

5
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,560
It's true.

6
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,400
If you truly desire something,

7
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,760
then one day,

8
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,480
you'll get it.

9
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,320
Who said that?

10
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,520
You?

11
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,540
I experienced it myself.

12
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,190
Everything that I truly desired

13
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
came true.

14
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,250
What are they?

15
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,980
What could make you

16
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,440
truly desire them?

17
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,430
Is Ran at home?

18
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,330
I'm home.

19
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,080
Granny Wang.

20
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,840
Ran.

21
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,450
Please come in.

22
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,050
Help Granny with something.

23
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,930
What's wrong, Granny?

24
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,760
I'm getting old.

25
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,670
My eyes don't work well anymore.

26
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,070
I can't get the thread in.

27
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,810
Look at your eyesight.

28
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,490
You're almost like this old lady.

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,190
Let me do it.

30
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,610
Granny.

31
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,740
So you have a guest.

32
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,470
Your boyfriend?

33
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,190
No wonder

34
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,520
you can't thread a needle now.

35
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,350
No, Granny.

36
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,920
-It's not like that.
-What do you mean no?

37
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,690
See, it's so late now.

38
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,230
You two aren't watching the TV,

39
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,180
nor playing games.

40
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,980
What else could it be other than dating?

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,450
Staring at each other?

42
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,870
It's done, Granny.

43
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,600
Okay.

44
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,650
Thank you.

45
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,880
Thank you, young man.

46
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,250
You're welcome.

47
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,430
Dating is a good thing.

48
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,780
Don't be shy about it.

49
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,510
Alright.

50
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,530
I'll leave you alone.

51
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,390
I'm leaving.

52
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,130
Grandma, I'll go with you.

53
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,350
I have to leave too.

54
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,550
If there's something wrong,

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,590
can I call you?

56
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,070
Of course.

57
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,790
Here, Granny.

58
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,120
Are you really leaving?

59
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,380
Are you two really not in a relationship?

60
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,300
We're really leaving.

61
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,220
Luo Zhan.

62
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,310
I'm going for a follow-up appointment today.

63
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,830
You...

64
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,850
I'll go with you.

65
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,630
You don't need to accompany me.

66
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,760
Just wait for me outside of the clinic.

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,640
I have something to tell you.

68
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,560
How did it go?

69
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,450
You haven't been here for a long time.

70
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,750
What did the doctor say?

71
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,630
Still fine.

72
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,360
Still fine?

73
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:58,900
Why didn't you ask me

74
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,290
the reason I suddenly changed my mind

75
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,390
to see a doctor?

76
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,670
I won't ask.

77
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,920
I know why.

78
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,360
It's because of Reporter Song.

79
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,370
Reporter Song came to see me before.

80
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,600
She came to see you?

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,380
Because of Jiang Yu's matter?

82
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:27,910
Yes.

83
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,790
What did you two talk about?

84
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,700
I'm not allowed to know?

85
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,600
Luo Zhan.

86
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,380
Do you think Reporter Song

87
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,570
is nice?

88
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,270
She is,

89
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,390
but not as nice as you.

90
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,040
Don't be too happy.

91
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,630
When Reporter Song came to me,

92
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,390
I told her

93
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,040
human judgment

94
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,560
is impossible to separate from personal emotions.

95
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
So my judgment of you

96
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,510
is not necessarily objective.

97
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,920
It's emotions at play.

98
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,440
Even a person as rational as me

99
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,270
can't avoid it.

100
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,710
Okay.

101
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,600
Then I think

102
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,300
you won't refuse

103
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,760
my request to go back to work, right?

104
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,830
We signed a contract.

105
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,670
How could I refuse you?

106
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,000
But I have one more request.

107
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:11,500
Sure

108
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,610
Even 100 is fine.

109
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,700
I still want to be a volunteer,

110
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,560
so I need to regain my physical fitness.

111
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,400
I want to have training time every day.

112
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:30,840
Sure, as long as you want.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,600
Thank you.

114
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,539
Let's go.

115
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,270
Let's head to the office now.

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,760
You start working today.

117
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,090
It's me.

118
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,120
I know.

119
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,640
It suddenly occurred to me

120
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,530
that I haven't officially thanked you for "Candy".

121
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,770
Let me treat you to dinner.

122
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,320
Sure.

123
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,790
Let's do it today.

124
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,370
Today's weather is nice.

125
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,500
It's a good day.

126
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay.

127
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,540
What do you want to eat?

128
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,750
Hotpot?

129
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,580
Cantonese cuisine?

130
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,240
I want to eat the food you make.

131
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,010
This can't baffle me.

132
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,960
See you tonight then.

133
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,870
By the way,

134
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,630
I suddenly remembered that

135
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,180
we can't be at my house tonight.

136
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,690
Then come to my house.

137
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,680
Okay. See you tonight.

138
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,200
See you tonight.

139
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,070
Sister, you look happy today.

140
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,800
I am.

141
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,410
It must be your boyfriend who cheered you up.

142
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,220
I told you.

143
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,900
Girls are easy to cheer up.

144
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,270
Take a seat.

145
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,350
I'll go wash the vegetables.

146
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,640
I'll help.

147
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,870
Let's do it together.

148
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,820
Help me peel the garlic.

149
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,490
Okay.

150
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,930
Do you have a pot at home?

151
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,330
I do.

152
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,760
On top of that thing.

153
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,590
I see it.

154
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,600
Let me do it.

155
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,740
Sorry.

156
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm sorry.

Here.

178
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,700
Let me tell you something.

179
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,420
I resigned today.

180
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,700
Although the previous matter has been settled,

181
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,600
based on my current state,

182
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,250
[BDI-21, Moderate Depression]

183
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,670
it's irresponsible to keep being a journalist.

184
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,790
I want to resign.

185
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,440
Is that

186
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,570
a well-considered decision?

187
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,870
Yes.

188
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,170
I think the most important thing for me now

189
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,380
is to improve my mental health

190
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,830
and think about what to do next.

191
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,720
Is your mood okay?

192
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,800
Naturally, I'm a bit upset.

193
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,720
After all, I've been there for so long.

194
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
Nonetheless,

195
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,320
at this juncture,

196
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,270
I can finally relax.

197
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,010
Have you decided what to do in the future?

198
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,140
Not yet.

199
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,440
I don't think I'm suitable for journalism.

200
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,319
Maybe I have to change my job.

201
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,960
Then I'll go

202
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,750
be a museum curator.

203
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,960
If you like it,

204
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,599
being a curator is great too.

205
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,510
But I think

206
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,310
you did a good job as a journalist.

207
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:30,970

are all done well.

211

I just don't want you

to have too much burden

213

214

It's better to take it easy.

Didn't you say you wanted to write a book?

I think that suits you.

347
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,400
is like looking for something.

348
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,490
The harder you try, the more you can't find it.

349
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:20,020
If you stop looking for him,

350
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,580
he might appear one day.

351
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,010
You don't need to rush.

352
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,880
Dad, why are you out?

353
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,860
Are you afraid I can't recognize the way home?

354
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,580
I came out for a walk.

355
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,150
It's just a coincidence.

356
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,260
Uncle Li.

357
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,730
No need. I don't understand anyway.

358
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,450
I'll just do as you say.

359
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,220
Miss Song.

360
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,940
Just call me Ran.

361
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,110
"Ran" in "rising steadily"?

362
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:50,600
Yes.

363
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,440
A nice name.

364
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,350
Thank you, Uncle Li.

365
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Looks like Ran has found the person she's looking for.

366
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,100
Let's go home.

367
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,080
I've paid.

368
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,340
Thank you, sir.

369
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,290
What do you mean?

370
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,740
Your father came to my house

371
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,470
a long time ago to fix the pipes.

372
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:22,060
At that time,

373
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,950
I was calling everywhere trying to find you.

374
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,030
So you've liked me

375
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,950
since a long time ago.

376
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,000
Ran,

377
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,440
next time when you can't find him, come to me.

378
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,150
I'll help you find him.

379
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,820
Okay.

380
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,650
The next time you can't find me,

381
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,480
stay where you are.

382
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,460
I'll come to you.

383
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,830
Okay.

384
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,590
Zan, take care of Ran.

385
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,880
I'll cook for you two.

386
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,000
Uncle Li,

387
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,290
let me cook for you.

388
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,110
You...

389
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,750
I'm good at cooking too.

390
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
You can ask Li Zan.

391
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,160
You can do it next time.

392
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,110
It's your first time here at our house.

393
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,570
Try our Li family's specialty dishes first.

394
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,160
Okay.

395
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,030
You resemble your dad a lot.

396
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,240
Even the atmosphere at home feels the same.

397
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,550
Let me show you around.

398
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,460
Zan,

399
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,230
can I go check out your room?

400
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:02,860
Let's go.

401
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,190
All these books from school,

402
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,310
you actually kept them?

403
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,560
My dad brings them along

404
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,960
wherever he goes.

405
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,230
He never thought they were heavy.

406
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,510
Your dad treats you so well.

407
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,800
Yeah.

408
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,680
I'll treat you well too.

409
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,480
I didn't know you could eat so much.

410
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,400
I'm afraid I can't afford it in the future.

411
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,370
This fish tastes good.

412
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,150
I thought you told me not to eat?

413
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,790
My bad, alright?

414
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,640
Ran,

415
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,160
thank you.

416
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,440
Last time,

417
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,480
when Zan just came back from the Eastern Country,

418
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,030
although he kept smiling,

419
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,880
I know his condition was bad.

420
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,960
He had something on his mind.

421
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,240
He only stayed for one night and left.

422
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,060
He hurried back to Liangcheng,

423
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,770
saying he had something to do.

424
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,640
But I know

425
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,610
he's afraid that I'll find out

426
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,700
and didn't want me to know.

427
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,330
Because, first of all,

428
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,830
I know his personality.

429
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,740
Second, I knew I couldn't help him.

430
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
So I didn't stop him.

431
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,960
That day, I saw his silhouette from behind and was terrified.

432
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:19,150
I thought he might have been ruined.

433
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,870
Then, I prayed

434
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,200
that God

435
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,300
will let him meet someone who can reach his heart.

436
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,080
This time I see him,

437
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,880
he is also smiling all the time.

438
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,550
But I can tell

439
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,330
that he's genuine very happy.

440
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,630
It's happiness.

441
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,190
I think it's happiness.

442
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,680
So,

443
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:57,980
thank you.

444
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,070
Uncle Li.

445
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,070
Ran.

446
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,110
as a father,

447
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,170
I would always be selfish for my child.

448
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,640
So I have a request to you.

449
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,160
Please

450
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,370
continue to make Zan happy.

451
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,000
Is that okay?

452
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
I feel assured

453
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,600
only if you promise me.

454
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,050
I'll do my best to be good to Zan.

455
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,139
Please do so.

456
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,139
Uncle Li asked me if I am free tomorrow,

457
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,719
and if I stay one more day?

458
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,590
You agreed?

459
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,699
Well, I don't have to work now.

460
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,590
It's nice to stay here

461
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,520
for another day.

462
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,110
You're done showering?

463
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,630
I ate more during dinner than lunch.

464
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,650
What did you say?

465
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,720
Do you want to take a shower?

466
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,630
I...

467
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,080
I didn't bring my pajamas.

468
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,600
You can wear my shirt first.

469
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,880
Okay.

470
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,170
Get into bed soon.

471
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,300
Don't catch a cold.

472
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,470
You can't look at this.

473
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,400
Let me see.

474
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,770
Don't look.

475
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,820
Your mum is so beautiful.

476
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,360
She died of illness.

477
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,730
Except for photos,

478
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,960
I can't recall exactly how she looks

479
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,070
from memory.

480
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,530
Uncle Li

481
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,230
is handsome too.

482
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,280
Then why didn't your dad

483
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,440
start a new relationship after that?

484
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,960
He said when I was young,

485
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,760
he was afraid of finding a stepmother who would treat me badly.

486
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,930
Then he said he got used to being alone.

487
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,960
Actually, his job involves interacting with many people,

488
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,970
so finding another one isn't difficult.

489
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,440
I also know that

490
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,710
there's someone who still likes him.

491
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,800
But he just doesn't want

492
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,980
to build a new family.

493
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,260
I think Uncle Li

494
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,770
wants to leave everything to you

495
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,360
and doesn't want to share it with another family.

496
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,400
This hairstyle is cool.

497
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,340
That's all for today.

498
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,210
Your hair has dried too.

499
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,460
Let's go to sleep.

500
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,980
I'm going back to the study.

501
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,120
Here.

502
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,220
Sleep tight.

503
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,190
Good night.

504
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,630
Good night.

505
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,550
Close your eyes.

506
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,610
I'll go now.

507
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,720
I ranked fifth in class on the monthly exam.

508
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,570
I'm not trying to be chatty,

509
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,380
it’s just that Ms. Fu asked me to let you know.

510
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,800
Still so stubborn.

511
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,440
Thank Ms. Fu for me.

512
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,030
I'm in my hometown in Jiangcheng.

513
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,890
I'll pass you a gift when I'm back.

514
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,230
It will surprise you.

515
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,440
I'm the one who took the exam.

516
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,200
Why do I need to thank Ms. Fu?

517
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,300

518
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,750
Sleep early.

519
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,070
So naggy.

520
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,240
What's wrong?

521
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,610
I can't fall sleep.

522
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,110
Weren't you sleepy just now?

523
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,190
Why can't you fall asleep?

524
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,920
I was sleepy when you were here.

525
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,480
But after you left,

526
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:24,510
you took away my sleepiness too.

527
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,300
Now,

528
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,600
I'm here to get my sleepiness back.

529
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,920
You want to wake Dad up?

530
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,630
Alright.
