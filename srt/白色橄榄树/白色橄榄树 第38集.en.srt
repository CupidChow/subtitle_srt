4
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,479
Zan, it's okay.

5
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:52,710
Zan.

6
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,950
-What’s wrong with you?
-Ran, run!

7
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,150
Why did you hit my son?

8
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,710
Apologize to my son!

9
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:58,680
Sorry.

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,229
Apologize!

11
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,230
I will kill her!

12
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,510
Go now!

13
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,370
It's all right, Zan.

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,120
Ran.

15
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,000
Run, Ran!

16
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,150
Ran!

17
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:14,860
Zan.

18
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,090
How dare you hit my mother!

19
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,329
Run!

20
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,350
Be careful!

21
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,230
Move aside, please make way.

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,560
Zan!

23
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,630
Zan!

24
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,000
Zan!

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm here.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,400
Run!

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,910
Zan.

28
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,280
Ran!

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,190
I'm here.

30
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:52,870
Ran!

31
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,430
He hit a child! He hit a child!

32
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,490
People like him have no social morals.

33
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:56,960
Stay back!

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,910
Sorry.

35
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,150
Sorry.

36
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,250
Sorry.

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,480
Stay back!

38
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,030
Stay back!

39
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,360
Stay back!

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,910
Zan.

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,470
Stay back!

42
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,000
Zan.

43
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,120
Stay back!

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,190
Sorry.

45
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,240
We're in China.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,360
We're safe now.

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,910
Zan.

48
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,070
I'm Ran, Zan.

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,130
Look at me.

50
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,710
Christ!

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,270
You hit my son and now you want to run?

52
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,280
It's not that easy.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm calling the police.

54
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,630
-Sorry.
-Don’t catch her!

55
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,000
He's sick.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,120
Sorry.

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
No!

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,780
He really didn't mean to do it.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,030
Don't catch her!

60
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,150
He's sick.

61
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,190
Don't catch her!

62
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,090
I knew there must be something wrong with him.

63
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,050
He's crazy.

64
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,410
Please.

65
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,680
Please, let Ran go.

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
This man looks very strange.

67
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,880
He's sick.

68
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,000
That's why he acts like this.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
Sick? What kind of sickness?

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,710
Is he crazy?

71
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
Sorry.

72
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,450
If he's crazy, he should be locked up at home.

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,310
Sorry.

74
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,750
What if he comes out and hurts someone?

75
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,210
Who would be responsible?

76
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,680
Let it go, ma'am.

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,590
Yeah. Forget it.

78
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,830
Well, he didn't do it on purpose.

79
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,030
Disperse, everyone!

80
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,810
Let's just disperse.

81
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

82
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,110
Let's go.

83
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,770
Zan.

84
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,080
Zan, it's okay now.

85
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,590
Zan.

86
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,680
Zan.

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,530
Don't be afraid.

88
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,310
We'll be home soon.

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,890
Don't be afraid.

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,530
Don't be afraid.

91
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,430
I'm here.

92
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,750
Zan.

93
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,590
Have some water.

94
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:10,640
Here.

95
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,980
I'm sorry, Ran.

96
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't say that.

97
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,460
Ran.

98
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,159
I've caused you trouble again.

99
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,540
I...

100
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,050
Don't say that.

101
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,400
Aren't you afraid of making me angry?

102
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,900
Don't say sorry to me.

103
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,060
Zan.

104
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,400
Zan.

105
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,870
Zan.

106
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,640
I... I'm not angry with you.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,750
I know.

108
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,460
Zan.

109
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,310
Please stop apologizing to me.

110
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,620
You're not a burden to me.

111
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,660
You've done nothing wrong.

112
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,900
You don't have to apologize to me.

113
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,630
No.

114
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,480
It's my fault.

115
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,159
I've been

116
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,070
lying to you all along.

117
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
Zan.

118
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,440
I used a paper cup the other day

119
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,560
because I couldn't remember

120
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,740
it was mine.

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,050
Every time I ask you to close the curtains,

122
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,280
it's not because I feel hot,

123
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,020
but because I'm afraid the bright sunlight

124
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,690
will remind me of the Eastern Country.

125
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,310
I haven't gained any weight

126
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:22,250
because I throw up

127
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,160
every time I eat.

128
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,950
Ran.

129
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,050
I've always wanted you to think I was okay,

130
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,610
even if I wasn't normal, I was still okay.

131
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,360
Because I thought

132
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,120
I would never hurt you anyway.

133
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,680
But today,

134
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,000
not only did I

135
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,830
almost hurt you,

136
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,270
I also embarrassed you so much.

137
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:08,950
Zan.

138
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,690
Ran.

139
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm not

140
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,870
the one you like anymore.

141
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,560
Please take me to the hospital.

142
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,919
Every word you say

143
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,060
feels like a needle stabbing me.

144
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,980
It makes me feel

145
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,950
that I've done such a poor job.

146
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,270
I'm so slow-witted.

147
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,840
I haven't taken good care of you.

148
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,930
I can't believe I haven't taken good care of you

149
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,410
and I've let you bear all this alone.

150
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,050
You've come back

151
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,020
but you still need to bear all this alone.

152
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,350
No, Ran.

153
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,830
Ran.

154
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,990
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,880
It's not like that, Ran.

156
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,700
Ran, don't blame yourself.

157
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,340
I won't...

158
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,670
I won't blame myself either, okay?

159
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,120
Zan.

160
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,170
I swore

161
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,410
that I would never leave you alone.

162
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,030
I will always be by your side.

163
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,380
If you go to the hospital,

164
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,330
I'll go with you.

165
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,730
I'll stay with you.

166
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,940
I'll stay there for the rest of my life and never leave.

167
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,620
You can't drive me away.

168
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,060
No one can separate us.

169
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,860
No one can separate us.

170
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,710
What are you talking about, Ran?

171
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,510
No one

172
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,850
wants to spend their whole life in a hospital if they're not sick.

173
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,030
I won't go.

174
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,750
You won't go either.

175
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,750
Actually, I...

176
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,610
I don't want to go to the hospital.

177
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,670
I'll listen to you, Ran.

178
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,130
No matter how hard it is,

179
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,380
we'll slowly get through this together.

180
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,290
Okay?

181
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,930
Don't cry, Ran.

182
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,080
Then let's

183
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,480
make dinner, shall we?

184
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,680
I'm a bit hungry.

185
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,940
Okay.

186
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,250
Okay.

187
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,520
Will you throw up after eating?

188
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,460
I'll eat less.

189
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,080
I think I won't.

190
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,890
It's fine.

191
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,680
I'll take it slow.

192
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,490
I'll gradually eat more.

193
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,090
Is that okay?

194
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,450
I'll listen to you.

195
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,760
I'll listen to you.

196
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,630
Let's take it slow.

197
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,810
I won't feed you so much anymore.

198
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,700
Let's just take it slow.

199
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,410
Okay.

200
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:32,970
Ran,

201
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,880
I always thought if I endured the suffering alone,

202
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,330
gritting my teeth and bearing it,

203
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,210
I could always get through it.

204
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,640
As long as I could be with you,

205
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,080
any punishment seemed insignificant.

206
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,650
But today I realized

207
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,670
I was wrong.

208
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,120
Being with me

209
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,450
will drag you down with me,

210
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,340
until

211
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,970
we fall into hell.

212
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,050
Benjamin is dead,

213
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,360
right?

214
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,180
You never told me,

215
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,960
but I know.

216
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,630
He's dead,

217
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,100
just like Jiang Lin.

218
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,020
He died trying to save me.

219
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,430
Don't scare me.

220
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,640
-If anything happens to you because of me...
-Zan.

221
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,950
I'd rather go back to that dungeon,

222
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,570
-and go back to hell.
-Zan!

223
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,480
Zan!

224
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,000
I'd rather face it alone.

225
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,060
Hello, is Mr. Luo inside?

226
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,030
He's in the office.

227
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,390
I've already been through this once

228
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,840
and almost lost you.

229
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,750
I really haven't seen him.

230
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,510
There's no way you don't know that.

231
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,480
I can't go through it a second time.

232
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,980
Given Zan's current situation,

233
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,380
he can't go far on his own.

234
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,620
He must be seeking help from someone.

235
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,670
So...

236
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,870
You're the person Zan trusts most in Liangcheng.

237
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,790
How could you not know that?

238
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,860
Please forgive me.

239
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,440
You're right.

240
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,980
He must be seeking help from someone.

241
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,040
But that person...

242
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,690
I know it's difficult...

243
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,160
It's not me.

244
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,460
But

245
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,480
I left anyway.

246
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,190
Uncle Li.

247
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,470
Has Zan gone back?

248
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,010
Ran, Zan hasn't come back.

249
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,670
What's wrong?

250
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,840
Did you two have a fight?

251
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,000
No.

252
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,180
Then he might have gone for a walk.

253
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,700
It's okay. I'll wait a bit longer.

254
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,030
I'll hang up now, Uncle Li.

255
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:44,600
Okay.

256
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,690
Back to the Eastern Country as a volunteer again.

257
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,670
I met Ms. Song.

258
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,770
Do you need a comb?

259
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,240
♫We're at the farewell station again♫

260
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,680
I teased Ms. Song a bit during demining.

261
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,420
That's all.

262
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,880
That's all?

263
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,810
♫I wait with you but don't want the train to come♫

264
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,620
Then will it explode?

265
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,580
Ms. Song is different

266
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,740
♫I can't find you♫

267
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,200
♫You don't belong to me anymore♫

268
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,750
from her appearance.

269
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,620
♫We look at each other from afar♫

270
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:10,340
♫Far away from each other♫

271

♫Now, on other ends of the earth♫

272
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,590
Ms. Song blushes easily.

273
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,860
♫How many places do you want to go?♫

274
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,170
You're trying to sneak an attack?

275
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,050
Ms. Song is quite adorable.

276
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,220
♫When the flight and distance♫

277
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,890
Ms. Song.

278

I saw a white olive tree today

281

♫We lost contact long ago♫

282
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,380
with Ms. Song.

283
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,130
-I wish for world peace.
-I wish for world peace.

284
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:46,050

Zan is gone.

318
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,460
I can't find him.

319
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,240
What should I do?

320
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,720
Ran.

321
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,180
Without Li Zan,

322
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,910
would you be able to go on living?

323
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,270
I'd live

324
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,560
as if I were dead.

325
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,470
Are you going to say I'm useless again?

326
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,200
Yes.

327
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,890
But I...

328
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,140
I envy you.

329
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,090
I always thought

330
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
that in this life,

331
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,410
I could have a love worth risking everything for.

332
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,310
If it weren't for having you in the end,

333
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,160
my reckless pursuit

334
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,240
would have been a complete joke.

335
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,570
Ran.

336
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,110
You've finally found your own love.

337
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,600
It's bitter

338
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,550
and

339
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,940
it might break your heart,

340
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,240
but as long as you don't regret it,

341
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,880
I'll let you go for it.

342
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,950
Even if it's like a moth to a flame,

343
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,460
I'll still let you go for it.

344
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,160
Mom.

345
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,450
You...

346
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,000
I can relate to that.

347
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,880
Who do you think

348
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,350
you got all these good qualities

349
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,480
and bad habits from?

350
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,790
Go to Jiangcheng.

351
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,720
What?

352
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,720
Go find Li Zan's father.

353
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,490
But I've asked Uncle Li.

354
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,490
He doesn't know where Zan is either.

355
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,310
And about Zan's illness,

356
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,210
we only told him a little bit.

357
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,960
You only inherited

358
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,560
half of my intelligence.

359
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,990
Ran.

360
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,250
At a time like this,

361
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,250
those who would do anything unconditionally

362
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,380
are only parents.

363
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,850
Those who can be fully trusted by children

364
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,090
are also only parents.

365
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,300
Mom.

366
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,520
Mom.

367
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,680
Mom.

368
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,280
Thank you.

369
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,860
Uncle Li.

370
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,880
I've lost Zan.

371
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,210
You said

372
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,780
if I ever lost him again,

373
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,570
I should tell you,

374
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,640
and you would help me find him.

375
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,710
Do you still keep your word?

376
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,090
Zan insisted on coming here.

377
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,440
Otherwise,

378
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,300
I might never see him again.

379
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,340
[Jiangcheng Psychiatric Rehabilitation Center]

380
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,210
I won't leave Zan here alone.

381
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,300
Sometimes life is just like that.

382
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,580
As long as you're still alive,

383
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,020
and want to keep living,

384
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,310
no matter how hard it gets,

385
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
whether you accept it or not,

386
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,860
you just have to endure it.

387
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,200
It's the same for everyone.

388
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,610
Do you blame him?

389
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,170
There are some things in this world

390
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,050
that someone has to do, right?

391
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,560
Since he did it,

392
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,390
and he doesn't regret it,

393
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,160
I won't blame him.

394
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,320
But if you ask me

395
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,010
if I'm willing to accept it,

396
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,790
how could I be?

397
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,250
However,

398
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,380
compared to those children who lost their lives,

399
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,130
I should be content.

400
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,720
Sorry.

401
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,730
We've

402
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,340
caused you trouble.

403
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,610
Don't be silly.

404
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,590
From now on, Zan

405
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,720
will really need to rely on you completely.

406
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,210
Today,

407
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,870
I saw Ms. Song again.

408
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,900
She said

409
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,450
she wanted to give me a red string.

410
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,070
Her wrists are so slender.

411
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,460
She finally came to the bar.

412
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
At the airport,

413
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,020
I ran into Ms. Song.

414
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:58,000
♫She is a white island♫

415
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,040
She looked pretty good.

♫The colorful wind rushes past♫

417

♫Autumn reflects in the water♫

421
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,720
She came to my place to cook today.

422
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,880
Do you have a pot at home?

423
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,670
It's up there.

424
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,750
♫He is a blue sailboat♫

425
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,460

I confessed to her.

429
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,610
I was a little nervous.

430
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,570
♫His sails dancing in the wind♫
