00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,310
Zhang Tao's bulletproof vest.

178
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,540
Put it on

179
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,020
during your stay in Happo.

180
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,990
Wear it in the city too?

181
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,140
Of course.

182
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,160
See? Everyone's wearing it.

183
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,960
If you go out for interviews,

184
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,220
you have to wear it too.

185
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,990
Happo's different from other places.

186
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,130
It's not that serious, actually.

187
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,710
Look at us.

188
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,760
We're still alive and kicking.

189
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,440
Song Ran,

190
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,160
The picture of "Carry"

191
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,760
that's going viral online is your work, right?

192
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,350
It's awesome!

193
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,810
I love it!

194
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,350
Thanks.

195
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,840
I still have a long way to go.

196
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,310
I was just lucky to snap "Carry"

197
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,570
and have it recognized

198
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,930
by everyone.

199
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,070
Once I can capture a successful

200
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,680
news photo like "Carry,"

201
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,330
I will be content with returning home.

202
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,750
I'm not here for...

203
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,640
Going back home to milk the fame and the benefits

204
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,750
from "Carry"?

205
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,720
That's being smart.

206
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,350
Mike.

207
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If that's what you call "smart,"

208
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,200
then what about you? Spend your whole life

209
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,990
in the world's most dangerous battlefields.

210
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,480
Would you call that "foolish"?

211
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,720
I might not be smart,

212
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,880
but I believe that by sharing the situation here

213
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
with the world,

214
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,110
I might help more people.

215
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,030
Wow.

216
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,930
With good eloquence,

217
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,210
you can be a good show host.

218
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,590
Come on!

219
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,820
This way!

220
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,160
Charge forward!

221
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,640
Happo is now

222
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,550
the main base for the armed rebels.

223
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,030
Those malevolent bastards

224
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,290
are totally losing it.

225
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,510
They're now frequently

226
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,640
attacking the civilians in Happo City

227
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,450
by either bombing or shooting.

228
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,130
I need to take this call.

229
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,750
Okay.

230
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,640
Life is getting harder and harder

231
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,770
for the people here.

232
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,400
We really don't have that much money.

233
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,750
It's not possible.

234
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,880
If you don't buy it, there are plenty of people who'd really like to buy it.

235
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,550
You have 150,000 dollars.

236
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,990
So three of you can go.

237
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,310
Why don't you take two of the older kids out first?

238
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,310
When you have the money,

239
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,310
you can return for your wife

240
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,280
and younger son.

241
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,310
Save one at a time.

242
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,110
The ordinary people in Happo

243
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,720
live in fear every day.

244
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,750
They want to escape from Happo

245
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,920
and fly to the neighboring countries for refuge,

246
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,110
but given the limited flights,

247
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,480
tickets are hard to come by.

248
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,160
Hurry up.

249
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,850
That dude's probably selling

250
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,250
flight tickets to neighboring countries.

251
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,240
See? You're desperate to stay

252
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,640
while other people are desperate to leave.

253
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,440
That's pretty ironic, right?

254
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,640
He's right.

255
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,070
Take the older kids and leave first.

256
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,550
When you get more money, come back for me and the younger boys.

257
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,270
I can't leave you behind.

258
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,960
Family

259
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,350
sticks together no matter what.

260
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
How much money do you have on you?

261
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,310
Can you lend it to me?

262
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,070
How...

263
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,920
How much do you need?

264
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,440
Lend me whatever you can.

265
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,730
Don't worry. You have my word.

266
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,750
I'll repay you once I return to China.

267
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,240
Come on. How many people are you supposed to repay with kindness?

268
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,830
Be realistic, alright?

269
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,330
Plus you're a woman.

270
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,810
I'm borrowing this personally.

271
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
And I promise to pay you back.

272
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,110
I can write an IOU,

273
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,810
send my photos with my ID,

274
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,800
my address in China,

275
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,080
and my family's contact information.

276
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,830
I won't be a deadbeat.

277
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,400
Please.

278
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,680
Thank you.

279
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,960
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

280
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,640
Thank you.

281
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,160
We women just do

282
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,560
what we can to help.

283
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,850
You gave it all to them?

284
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,400
Mike ordered this for you.

285
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,460
He said it was hot outside.

286
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,060
This would help cool you off.

287
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,630
What's up?

288
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,270
The stingy old Mike

289
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,000
treated your friend to a drink!

290
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,960
How rare!

291
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:29,920
Thanks, Mike.

292
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,350
Here, yours.

293
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,590
Then once again, let's welcome Song Ran to join us.

294
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,200
Cheers!

295
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,270
Cheers!

296
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,720
Cheers.

297
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,630
No need to return the money.

298
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,090
♫And say, Te Amo♫

299
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,960
You're a volunteer too?

300
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,530
Yeah.

301
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,880
I'm a medical volunteer.

302
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,190
How long have you been here?

303
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,200
♫Still we don't know love♫

304
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,530
It's been one week. What about you?

305
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:57,160
♫But I feel strong when I'm with you♫

306
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,020
What are Zan and the others

307
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
doing right now?

308
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:04,670
♫Just say, Te Amo♫

309
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,710
♫Still we don't know how♫

310
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,590
♫But I feel loved♫

311

♫When I'm with you♫

312
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,190
Could it be Jiang Lin, Zan, and their team?

313
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,400
Instructor Li,

314
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,870
The EOD is ready.

315
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,010
Let me help you.

316
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,450
Hold your fire!

317
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,590
There's a child in the vehicle.

318
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,740
Everyone, stop!

319
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,920
You can't kill me!

320
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,930
What should we do, Captain?

321
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,170
Should we fire?

322
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,400
Captain?

323
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,980
You motherfucker!

324
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,750
Captain, what should we do?

325
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,270
Do we fire?

326
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,180
This guy will make all of you remember me!

327
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,270
You can't kill me!

328
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,030
You motherfuckers!

329
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,420
Sorry, Captain Jiang.

330
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,570
Seeing that guy's evil smirk,

331
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,880
I couldn't hold back my desire

332
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,280
to kill him immediately.

333
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,410
Move!

334
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,050
Be careful.

335
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,910
Captain Jiang,

336
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:29,170
don't pull a long face.

337
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:31,590
I have confidence in my shooting skills.

338
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,180
You are a good shooter,

339
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,900
but not a trustworthy teammate for me.

340
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,110
Open the door.

341
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,990
Don't be afraid, kid.

342
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,200
You're safe now.

343
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,600
Everyone, stop!

344
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,590
EOD!

345
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,920
EOD!

346
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,270
Captain Jiang, I'm in the field.

347
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,120
Go!

348
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,850
Benjamin,

349
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,140
what are you doing now?

350
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,110
Hey, kid.

351
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,640
Remember me?

352
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,110
Don't be afraid.

353
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:44,690
I'll back you up.

354
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:52,960
Stay back.

355
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,590
Ben,

356
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,510
take one team

357
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,640
and go find the rest!

358
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,160
Go!

359
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,110
Yes, sir! You three, follow me!

360
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,380
Captain,

361
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,640
let me do it.

362
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,580
No.

363
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,550
The shooting's still going on.

364
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,400
It's way too dangerous.

365
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,830
I'll ask others for backup.

366
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,690
They're not even in bomb suits yet.

367
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,730
We're out of time.

368
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,030
And I took a peek.

369
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,210
That bomb is very complicated,

370
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,370
way beyond what others can deal with.

371
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:53,950
Jiang Lin,

372
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,940
I will take responsibility for my own life.

373
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,970
And I believe

374
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,240
you've got my back.

375
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:03,920
right?

376
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:13,440
Captain! Mission complete.

377
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,590
The enemy has been annihilated.

378
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,880
Jiang Lin,

379
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,690
we're running out of time.

380
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,990
Moris, Carl!

381
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,200
Quickly set up the blast barriers

382
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,290
next to the child.

383
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,110
Everyone, stay alert

384
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,310
and ensure the safety of Instructor Li.

385
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,290
Wow.

386
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,550
The flowers are beautiful.

387
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,800
You like it?

388
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,440
Yeah.

389
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,890
Me too.

390
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:29,530
You will be fine.

391
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,170
Trust me.

392
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,940
-Captain Jiang.
-Captain Jiang.

393
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,800
Reporter Song.

394
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,000
You...

395
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,210
Captain Jiang,

396
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,920
can I go in to film it?

397
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,510
Reporter Song,

398
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,000
don't get any closer.

399
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,960
Stay safe.

400
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,620
How complicated the wiring is.

401
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,050
There's not enough time.

402
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,410
A double detonation system again.

403
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,050
Jiang Lin.

404
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,960
This bomb can't be defused in a short time.

405
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,200
Can't be defused?

406
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:00,450
What do you mean?

407
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,990
Didn't you just say you could nail it?

408
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,920
You knew it couldn't be removed.

409
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,680
Zan,

410
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,330
you beguiled me into putting you in a deadly situation.

411
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,570
It's not that serious.

412
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,600
I've got an idea.

413
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,260
I'll press the reed

414
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,200
to relieve the pressure between the boy and the seat.

415
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,730
Let's get the kid out first.

416
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:29,570
You guys get ready to help him.

417
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,550
What about you?

418
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,720
I'll figure out a way.

419
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
What way?

420
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,110
Like the explosion in Uglai?

421
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,040
Don't be afraid.

422
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,000
Zan!

423
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,510
Can you sing?

424
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,160
Yes.

425
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,720
Really?

426
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:10,489
♫In the land of Matuman♫

427
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,500
♫Here's the place where heroes stand♫

428
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,560
♫Through the ages♫

429
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:23,090
♫You sang your life♫

430
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:28,040
♫We sing our song to the sky♫

431
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,160
Take the child away.

432
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,170
We still have time.

433
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,110
I have a plan.

434
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,880
You must nail it.

435
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,070
-Reporter Song.
-34.

436
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:21,670
Come with me.

437
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,320
33.

438
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,630
32.

439
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,750
31.

440
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,110
30.

441
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,130
29.

442
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,880
28.

443
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,750
27.

444
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,700
26.

445
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:30,810
25.

446
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:31,750
24.

447
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,710
23.

448
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,480
22.

449
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,630
21.

450
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,840
20.

451
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,590
19.

452
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,560
18.

453
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,460
Captain!

454
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,850
16.

455
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,990
A group of rioters

456
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,870
just showed up.

457
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,710
We've exchanged fire already.

458
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,710
12.

459
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,280
11.

460
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,000
Must keep them away.

461
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,280
Protect Instructor Li and the child.

462
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,840
Reporter Song.

463
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,150
Seven.

464
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,920
Stay calm.

465
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,440
Six.

466
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,360
There are rioters out there.

467
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,880
It's too dangerous.

468
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,360
Four.

469
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,360
Three.

470
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,510
Two

471
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,860
Zan!

472
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,580
Zan!

473
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,550
Zan!

474
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,610
Zan.

475
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,150
Are you alright?

476
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,880
Are you okay?

477
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,460
How do you feel?

478
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,940
I'm fine.

479
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,230
Luckily, the wire was long enough.

480
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,920
I'm okay.

481
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,360
Zan...

482
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,190
You guys go wrap it up.

483
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,440
I'll take a rest.

484
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,760
OK.

485
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
Have a good rest.

486
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,280
You outran me

487
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,730
in five seconds.

488
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm fine.

489
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,280
Are you injured?

490
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:00,870
Nope.

491
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,560
I've just been

492
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,930
running on empty without enough sleep

493
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,230
lately.

494
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:19,750
Here.

495
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,550
Thank you.

496
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,410
You must've been too busy to eat and drink, right?

497
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,320
Just now,

498
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,920
I thought you were going to die.

499
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:07,880
Really?

500
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,590
Then my camera

501
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,210
would catch a historic moment.

502
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,760
Sorry,

503
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,270
I made you miss that chance.

504
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,990
For that boy,

505
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,270
you defused a bomb that you knew was probably a lost cause.

506
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,530
Just like what you did

507
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,880
in that truck mounted with a bomb

508
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,080
when we were in Uglai.

509
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,010
I had never

510
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,540
seen such a selfless person.

511
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,160
No.

512
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,890
That was responsibility.

513
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,680
I think most people would do the same

514
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,280
in that situation.

515
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,280
I always believe

516
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,390
everyone's got a bit of kindness

517
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,800
deep down inside.

518
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,540
When that moment comes,

519
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,600
people will show their kindness.

520
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,380
You're a reporter.

521
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,250
You must have seen

522
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,420
lots of similar cases in your life.

523
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,920
Yeah.

524
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,010
As journalists,

525
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,210
we get to see

526
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,910
many ordinary people

527
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,110
become heroes.

528
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,920
But there are also

529
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,400
moments of malice.
