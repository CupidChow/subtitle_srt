What's so funny?

5
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,759
Don't news anchors always have a serious face?

6
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,430
I think

7
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,540
the kids will definitely lose their appetite after watching this.

8
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,920
Unfortunately,

9
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,990
I'm afraid my dream of being a journalist is over.

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,730
Stop talking nonsense.

11
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,130

Dr. Liang.

66
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,610
How is

67
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,040
Zan doing?

68
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,630
He...

69
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,800
It's all my fault.

70
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,360
I should have insisted.

71
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,830
I shouldn't have agreed to let him go to the Eastern Country.

72
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,800
Is it very serious?

73
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,789
Dr. Liang.

74
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:35,080
Let's talk outside.

75
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,950
Don't disturb Zan's sleep.

76
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:39,650
Okay.

77
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,590
Dr. Liang,

78
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,900
how serious is the situation?

79
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,720
Can you be more specific?

80
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,360
If you're asking for my professional opinion as a doctor,

81
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,200
I'd recommend

82
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,030
sending him to a psychiatric hospital.

83
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,670
What?

84
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,870
How can you say such a thing?

85
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,820
Mr. Luo.

86
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,390
Calm down first...

87
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,000
Calm down.

88
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,560
I'm going to check on Li Zan.

89
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,090
I'm not needed here anymore.

90
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,150
Dr. Liang.

91
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,730
Is it really that serious?

92
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,720
Of all the patients I've encountered with this condition,

93
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,490
Li Zan is now the most serious.

94
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,550
It's nothing like

95
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,150
what happened before.

96
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,850
Eventually, he will

97
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,520
either kill someone

98
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
or commit suicide.

99
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:31,610
But since Zan and I returned from the Eastern Country,

100
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
he has been very cooperative.

101
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
And he has never

102
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,690
done anything out of line.

103
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,140
That's probably because

104
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,440
you can calm him down,

105
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,700
and he hasn't encountered any triggers.

106
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,490
For patients like Li Zan,

107
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,270
once they encounter a trigger,

108
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,080
the world in front of them

109
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,340
will immediately become a battlefield.

110
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,400
It's beyond what we ordinary people can imagine.

111
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,400
In such an environment,

112
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,360
the people around him,

113
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,240
even you,

114
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,030
could be harmed.

115
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,070
I've seen it.

116
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,920
Can he be cured if we send him to the hospital?

117
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,970
Sending him to the hospital

118
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,870
can use medication and control

119
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,470
to suppress his mental state

120
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,540
and reduce his cognitive activities,

121
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,150
so he won't harm himself

122
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,440
or others.

123
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,550
So,

124
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,490
sending him to the hospital

125
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,040
is just to lock him up,

126
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,250
for life?

127
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,490
I will never send Zan to the hospital.

128
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,880
I'll always be there for him.

129
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,320
I won't let him hurt anyone.

130
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,070
As a doctor,

131
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,390
I can only warn you that

132
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,740
it is highly unlikely that Li Zan will return to

133
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,670
his normal life.

134
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,340
You should be mentally prepared.

135
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,910
But as a friend,

136
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,910
I hope you can create a miracle.

137
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,560
I'll do whatever I can

138
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,280
to help him.

139
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,490
I'm responsible for

140
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
what happened to him.

141
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,550
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,480
Thank you.

143
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,030
Dr. Liang.

144
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,260
Sorry, I...

145
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,660
The door slammed so loud.

146
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,630
Did I wake you up?

147
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Please, sit down.

148
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,080
Mr. Luo.

149
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,130
What did you say?

151
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,910
I'm sorry.

152
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,170
I'm making it difficult

153
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,610
for you to explain in the company, right?

154
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,920
What are you talking about?

155
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,860
How could this be your fault?

156
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,520
If anyone's to blame, it's those bastards from the Eastern Country.

157
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,550
I should blame myself for not stopping you.

158
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,930
Or that Dr. Liang.

159
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,360
Did you yell at Dr. Liang?

160
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,420
If you scared the doctor away,

161
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,590
who would treat me in the future?

162
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,370
I knew Dr. Liang was exaggerating.

163
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,060
Zan.

164
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,160
You can still joke with me.

165
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,600
You'll get better soon.

166
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,210
You'll get better.

167
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,000
You'll be fine.

168
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,240
You'll be fine.

169
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,820
You'll be fine.

170
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,440
Zan.

171
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,020
Song Ran.

172
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,320
Li Zan was just joking with me.

173
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,440
He said if I scared the doctor away,

174
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,310
no one would treat him.

175
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,610
He's good at joking, right?

176
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,930
He's even funnier than before.

177
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,270
Mr. Luo,

178
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,520
why is your shirt wet?

179
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,240
I was just

180
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,190
about to drink some water.

181
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,920
I poured a cup

182
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,490
and he came over and hugged me.

183
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,500
It wasn't my fault that

184
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,670
the water spilled on him.

185
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,950
Why did you use a paper cup

186
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,550
instead of your own?

187
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:23,660
Mr. Luo,

188
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,310
what would you like to drink?

189
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,510
That's my cup.

190
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,339
No need.

191
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,310
I'm heading back to the company.

192
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,570
I won't bother you two.

193
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,020
Oh, by the way,

194
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
I visited Mr. Li in Jiangcheng before.

195
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,940
But I didn't tell him much.

196
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,970
I was thinking when Li Zan gets better,

197
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,250
I'll bring him to see Li Zan.

198
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,800
Song Ran,

199
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,200
whenever you think it's appropriate,

200
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,530
feel free to contact me.

201
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,920
Okay.

202
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,830
Li Zan.

203
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,500
You'll be fine.

204
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,390
Why don't you go rest for a while?

205
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,400
I'll wake you up when the food is ready.

206
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,520
I can't sleep.

207
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,480
Afraid of dreaming?

208
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,230
You want to watch me cook?

209
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,080
Is that okay?

210
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,270
Of course.

211
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,680
But

212
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,330
can you see clearly from that far away?

213
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,280
What's wrong?

214
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,350
It's ugly.

215
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,050
Zan.

216
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,790
Zan.

217
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,960
Look.

218
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,200
Here.

219
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,870
Is it ugly?

220
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,100
No.

221
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,070
Your hand

222
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,500
is not ugly either.

223
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,880
Zan and Ran

224
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,620
are the same,

225
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:47,530
right?

226
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,600
Ran is better.

227
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,550
Zan,

228
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,770
you haven't kissed me for a long time.

229
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,790
Kiss me again,

230
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,400
okay?

231
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,230
Here comes the fish soup!

232
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,770
Here.

233
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,400
Let me do it.

234
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,200
Ran.

235
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,620
Could you please draw the curtains?

236
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,310
I'm feeling a bit hot.

237
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,990
Okay.

238
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,640
Here.

239
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,660
Try the fish soup.

240
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,120
See if it's better than the one we had in the mountains last time.

241
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,920
Okay.

242
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,210
Let me taste it.

243
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,650
It's delicious.

244
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,910
It's as good as the first time you made it.

245
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,270
Here.

246
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,000
Eat more.

247
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,250
I know you have a bad appetite.

248
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,030
But you must eat them all.

249
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,810
Otherwise, I'll be angry.

250
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,340
Unless

251
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,210
you don't care if I'm angry.

252
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,100
I do care.

253
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,750
But

254
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,700
who said I lost my appetite?

255
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,190
I...

256
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,240
I guessed.

257
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,370
You look

258
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,570
very cute right now,

259
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,750
just as cute as the first time

260
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,180
I met you.

261
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,440
Really?

262
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,360
Did you think I was cute

263
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,790
the first time you met me?

264
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
You should go now.

265
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,090
I don't want you to die here with me.

266

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,750
I don't want to lie to you and say

351
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,750
things will definitely get better.

352
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,830
Dr. Liang said

353
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,290
we should be mentally prepared

354
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,320
that we might never be able to return

355
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,400
to a normal life.

356
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,780
But I don't believe that.

357
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,510
And I don't care.

358
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,690
Even if we can't return to a normal life,

359
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,880
then so be it.

360
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,070
I'll put away everything

361
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,160
you don't like.

362
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,870
Let's just

363
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,610
live our lives

364
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,000
slowly like this,

365
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,740
okay?

366
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,820
As long as we're together, that's all that matters.

367
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,900
As long as we're together,

368
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,909
we'll be happy.

369
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,830
Normal or not,

370
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,179
we'll be happy.

371
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,380
Zan,

372
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,360
you must stay with me.

373
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,389
Let's just

374
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,920
live our lives

375
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,840
slowly like this.

376
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,100
Let's grow old together,

377
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,590
okay?

378
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:38,890
Okay.

379
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,320
Is he

380
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,720
getting any better?

381
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,240
He's much better than before.

382
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,180
That's good.

383
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,190
He can try using this medicine.

384
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,520
Here, it's time to take your medicine.

385
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,440
Zan.

386
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,330
Ran.

387
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,060
It's getting dark.

388
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,960
There are fewer people downstairs now.

389
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,760
Let's go downstairs for a walk.

390
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,510
Okay.

391
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,920
Dr. Liang.

392
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,790
Zan has many external injuries to be rechecked today.

393
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:44,310
I'll take him to the hospital.

394
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,340
You don't need to come to our home.

395
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,390
Just wait for us at the hospital.

396
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,010
There are too many people.

397
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,020
Let's take the stairs.

398
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,550
Okay?

399
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,940
Will you get tired?

400
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,010
I won't.

401
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,100
Let's go.

402
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,050
You're holding me up like this.

403
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,540
It's like I'm really old.

404
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,710
I'm in my seventies.

405
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,960
It would be nice for us to be like this

406
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,510
when we're older.

407
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,190
Even when we're old, I'll still be stronger than you.

408
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,050
I should be the one holding you up.

409
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,110
Okay.

410
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,270
Then you need to eat more.

411
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,970
Get better quickly.

412
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:48,550
So you can hold me up.

413
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,390
Okay.

414
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,810
[Orthopedics Dept]

415
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,810
You've been eating a lot lately,

416
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,240
but why haven't you gained any weight?

417
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,000
Don't worry about it.

418
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:44,750
I'll eat an extra bowl of rice tonight.

419
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,670
And you should drink an extra bowl of bone broth too.

420
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,930
The doctor said your bone density is low.

421
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,900
You need to supplement calcium.

422
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,450
Okay.

423
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,000
Song Ran.

424
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,260
Just give me a second.

425
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,450
Thank you, Dr. Liang.

426
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,670
Song Ran.

427
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,480
I sincerely hope to see your miracle.

428
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:14,570
Zan.

429
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,690
Are you blind?

430
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,990
Can you even walk?

431
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,200
Your eyes are just for show, right?

432
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:20,950
Zan.

433
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,840
It's okay, Zan.

434
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,800
Take the umbrella.

435
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,110
Zan.

436
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:29,730
Zan.

437
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,630
Are you okay?

438
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,990
Are you crazy?

439
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,660
Zan, it's okay, Zan.

440
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:42,980
-Ran, run!
-What’s wrong with you?

441
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,350
Why did you hit my son?
