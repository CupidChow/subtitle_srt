4
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,160
What's going on?

5
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,490
You came to see me and even brought your laptop along.

6
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,130
Are you thinking that

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
if we get caught,

8
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,290
you'll say we're revising?

9
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,870
Revising what?

10
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,760
Ways to elope?

11
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,920
Sure.

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
Let's revise the ways to elope.

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm here for serious matters.

14
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,020
I want to watch cartoons with you.

15
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,810
I've downloaded the video.

16
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,250
So this is the serious matter?

17
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,860
It's much more serious than revising.

18
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,880
Why aren't you watching the video

19
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,610
and keep looking at me instead?

20
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,030
I've seen it many times.

21
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,860
What?

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,470
You didn't tell me

23
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,200
you like to watch cartoons too?

24
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,240
I was just curious

25
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,310
about the cartoon you watched with Dr. Pei that day.

26
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,400
So entertaining

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
that you drank so much.

28
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,880
So I secretly watched it when I got back.

29
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,079
After watching it,

30
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,150
I actually find it fun.

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,290
So I watched it a few more times.

32
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,640
Every time I think of you,

33
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,240
I would watch it.

34
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,870
Zan,

35
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,240
will you always be this nice to me?

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,810
Will you betray me?

37
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Will you break up with me?

38
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,490
I won't.

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,050
If I break up with you,

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,680
shot me to death.

41
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,310
What era is it now?

42
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,640
Why would there be shooting.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,330
Stop talking nonsense.

44
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,280
Don't worry.

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,140
It won't happen.

46
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,980
Still, you shouldn't talk nonsense.

47
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,810
Touch wood.

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,780
Touch the head.

49
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,000
Quick, touch it.

50
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
What's wrong?

51
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,000
If one day,

52
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,160
we really do break up,

53
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,400
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

54
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,620
Auntie is coughing again.

55
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,170
Could it be that my mom noticed

56
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,170
because we were too loud just now?

57
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,020
I think Auntie

58
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,980
coughed several times today.

59
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,550
Yeah.

60
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,680
She caught a cold some time ago

61
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,340
and started coughing since.

62
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,710
She was clearly getting better though.

63
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,250
Let's bring her to see a doctor tomorrow.

64
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
If this goes on,

65
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
it may turn into bronchitis.

66
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,750
And I feel like

67
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,510
your mom didn't look well today.

68
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,970
She only looked better after putting on some makeup.

69
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,250
But my mom hates going to the hospital.

70
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm counting on you

71
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,410
to take her there.

72
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,830
Didn't you say the more times they meet,

73
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,250
the more mother-in-laws like their son-in-laws?

74
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,510
Who else can I count on?

75
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,790
Let's watch a while more.

76
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:30,890
Okay.

78
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,200
Alright. Stop following me.

79
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,330
As if I have some serious illness.

80
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,430
Li Zan, don't you need to do a checkup on your ears?

81
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,290
Let's split up.

82
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,430
Don't waste time.

83
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,159
Okay, Auntie.

84
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,450
Mom.

85
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,510
Text me when you're done.

86
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,600
We'll wait for you in the lobby on the first floor.

87
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,180
I'm so mad.

88
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,920
No matter how much I nag her,

89
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,810
she would never come to the hospital.

90
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,040
Why did she come with you immediately

91
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,700
when you said so this morning?

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,940
Is she my mom or your mom?

93
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,470
Ours.

94
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
That's right too.

95
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,660
Later,

96
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,140
you can wait for me here while having coffee.

97
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,870
There's no place to sit upstairs.

98
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,780
The checkup will be quick this time.

99

Dr. He.

102
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,370
What a coincidence.

103
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,900
It's not a coincidence.

104
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,430
I ran into Aunt Ran just now.

105
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,910
She told me you came with your boyfriend.

106
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,370
I was curious

107
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,840
so I came to see you.

108
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,900
He just went for a checkup on his ears.

109
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,070
His ears...

110
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,720
Previously,

111
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,670
he got injured in the Eastern Country.

112
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,070
But he's much better now.

113
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,330
Then I'm relieved.

114
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,400
What's wrong?

115
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,550
Dr. He,

116
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,910
do you know if Li Zan

117
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,440
has other health problems?

118
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,850
That's not the case.

119
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,910
Ran.

120
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,200
You're done?

121
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,820
I...

122
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,440
am taking a walk.

123
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,450
I'm not bored.

124
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,770
I just like to take a stroll.

125
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,360
Okay.

126
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,260
I'll let you get on with it.

127
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,130
I was thinking

128
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,480
he'd better not be fooling the Ran I know.

129
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:52,770
Now it seems like

130
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,670
he was probably visiting the ear doctor

131
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,270
and didn't want you to worry.

132
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,220
Am I

133
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,660
being busybody?

134
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,820
No.

135
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,910
You're not.

136
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,080
The person you describe is so much like him.

137
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,480
He's always like this.

138
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,050
He doesn't want me to worry

139
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,420
and shoulders everything by himself.

140
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,500
Just like when he came for the checkup today.

141
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,790
He's much better now,

142
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,720
but he still doesn't let me follow him.

143
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,730
It means he cares about you,

144
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
and you're happy.

145
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,280
I'm taking my leave.

146
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,580
If you need anything,

147
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,790
feel free to come to me.

148
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,720
Don't hesitate.

149
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,390
Don't you want to see him?

150
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,820
You're not waiting for him anymore?

151
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,870
We met last time.

152
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,820
He's handsome.

153
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
Seems like I can't avoid him now.

154
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,420
Zan.

155
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,030
Let me introduce.

156
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,690
This is Li Zan.

157
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,800
He's my boyfriend.

158
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,690
This is He Shanran.

159
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,750
He's a doctor in this hospital.

160
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,280
She's a friend of my mother.

161
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,240
Hello, Dr. He.

162
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,440
Hello.

163
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,460
I ran into Aunt Ran at my department.

164
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,040
She said Ran is here too,

165
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,690
so I came to say hello.

166
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,120
Dr. He.

167
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,740
Which department are you in?

168
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,720
Ophthalmology.

169
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,030
In the future, if Mr. Li

170
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,560
has any issues with your eyes,

171
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,820
feel free to come to me.

172
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,710
Don't be afraid of troubling me.

173
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,240
Only

174
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,040
my ears are not good.

175
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
My eyes are fine.

176
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,520
I...

177
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,330
Dr. He.

178
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,790
Thank you.

179
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,120
Ran must have

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,200
troubled you before.

181
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,280
Thank you for taking care of her.

182
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,080
You're welcome.

183
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,750
I'll get back to work.

184
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,720
Nice to meet you.

185
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,550
Me too.

186
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,710
My mom hasn't made a move for a long time.

187
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,280
Let's go check on her.

188
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,720
Ran.

189
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,480
I think we might have been tricked by her.

190
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,120
The departments of ophthalmology and respiratory medicine

191
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,980
are in two different directions.

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
And the ophthalmology department

193
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,240
is near the exit of the hospital.

194
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,790
Dr. He saw Auntie near the ophthalmology department.

195
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,790
I think

196
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,130
she might have left.

197
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,270
She just didn't want to embarrass me

198
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,380
so she agreed to come to the hospital.

199
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,820
Get going with your things.

200
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,390
Don't worry about me.

201
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,670
I'm going to work.

202
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,080
You're right.

203
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,670
Auntie

204
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,760
does have a strong personality.

205
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,150
I assumed too much.

206
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,070
It seems like

207
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,430
there really is someone Zan can't handle.

208
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,240
Anyway, Auntie

209
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,760
has great taste.

210
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,880
Dr. He is nice.

211
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,470
Isn't he the one

212
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,850
Auntie introduced to be your boyfriend?

213
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,870
How did you know?

214
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,610
The way he looked at you was different.

215
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,360
Plus, he was acting too nervous to see me

216
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,830
and kept using Aunt Ran as an excuse.

217
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,470
Isn't it obvious?

218
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,590
Your eyes

219
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,030
are too sharp.

220
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,680
It's a little scary.

221
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,200
Didn't you always say

222
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,390
my eyes are pretty?

223
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,020
Why are you saying they're scary now?

Did you go and see Li Zan off?

You can't be too immersed in a relationship.

319
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,020
First of all, you must focus on your career

320
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,480
and make yourself stronger.

321
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,590
Secondly, you need to learn to protect yourself.

322
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,590
You can’t just give your heart away

323
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,310
to everyone you meet.

324
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,430
Hold back a little

325
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,900
and leave yourself a way out.

326
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,200
Men won't leave you a way out when they decide to be mean.

327
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,010
Mom,

328
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,760
Li Zan is not that kind of person.

329
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,210
Not only is he nice to me,

330
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,540
he also cares about you.

331
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,200
When you stood us up

332
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,730
in the hospital yesterday,

333
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,840
not only did he not blame you,

334
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,320
he also kept reminding me

335
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,810
to tell you to see a doctor,

336
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,600
that it'll be bad if it turns into bronchitis.

337
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,550
You're in the honeymoon phase now.

338
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,550
Of course he would want to please me.

339
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,880
Don't think of people as being so simple.

340
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,920
When the time comes, you won't even find a place to cry.

341
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,070

I regret,

373

which is not raising you when you were young

374
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,000

00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,260
I don't believe you anymore.

515
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,600
Dr. He.

516
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,630
Can you hire a nurse

517
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,110
to accompany my mom

518
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,410
and supervise her at the same time?

519
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:17,970
Sure.

520
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,660
No problem.

521
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,790
You're going too far now.

522
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,550
I'm warning you.

523
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,490
Don't act like a spoiled child.

524
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,670
So unreasonable.

525
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,360
I can't stand it.

526
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,920
Wen.

527
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,830
Can you bring Auntie

528
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,130
to the respiratory department for a checkup?

529
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,850
Okay.

530
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,550
Dr. He,

531
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,000
do you also

532
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,920
think I'm being awkward

533
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,310
and unreasonable?

534
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,950
No.

535
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,880
This is the first time

536
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,550
I've acted spoiled towards her.

537
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,000
I don't even know

538
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,760
if my brain is really messed up,

539
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,770
I actually acted spoiled towards her.

540
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,340
She hates this the most.

541
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,640
I think

542
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,350
Auntie Ran

543
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,570
doesn't hate you acting spoiled at all.

544
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,160
You can't see clearly now,

545
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,680
but I saw that

546
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,280
she couldn't help but smile.

547
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,230
That expression

548
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,050
didn't look like dislike.

549
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Instead,

550
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,420
it seems like she likes it.

551
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,690
Really?

552
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,110
Yes.

553
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,240
I don't think I've mistaken it.

554
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,930
I think you should try to have

555
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,160
more normal mother-daughter interactions

556
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,440
in the future.

557
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,790
Mom.

558
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,440
Has your

559
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,230
medical report come out?

560
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:05,220
How could it be so quick?

561
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,470
There are still a few test results left.

562
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,120
Don't worry about me.

563
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
You're too naggy.

564
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,250
It's a scam call.

565
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,110
I'm hanging up.

566
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,969
Don't.

567
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,440
This number is obviously a scam call.

568
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,320
It's not.

569
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,850
Why did you simply hang up my calls?

570
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,030
Did it start with 0069?

571
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:30,969
It really does.

572
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,560
Do you know this number?

573
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,030
Of course I do.

574
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,360
Call it back.

575
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
It's Zan.

576
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,400
Here.

577
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:52,929
Don't eavesdrop.

578
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:53,980
Go away.

579
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,929
You’ve got guts now?

580
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,990
Ran.

581
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,440
I'm here.

582
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:16,040
I was too eager

583
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,960
and pressed the wrong button.

584
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,370
I have good news for you.

585
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,380
The Chronicles of Eastern Country

586
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,630
is going well.

587
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,670
Mr. Luo said

588
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,840
I wrote well.

589
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,360
He said I've found

590
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,670
my own inspiration.

591
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,540
Guess

592
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,780
what my inspiration is?

593
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,310
What is it?

594
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,510
Is it me?

595
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,200
You're so shameless.

596
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,570
Not only shameless,

597
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,690
but also self-indulgent.

598
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,320
How are you self-indulgent?

599
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,280
It's you.

600
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,670
Of course it's you.

601
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,680
You don't believe me?

602
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,360
Then come back

603
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,920
ask Mr. Luo yourself.

604
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,260
He can't wait

605
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,160
to see my source of inspiration.

606
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,370
Please.

607
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,340
Stay there.

608
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,000
Stay there.

609
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,560
I will blow up everyone here.

610
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,880
Zan.

611
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,590
Ran.

612
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,000
It seems that

613
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,190
the medicine I prescribed for you

614
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,000
are not working

615
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,760
in your case.

616
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,920
We may need to perform a minor surgery

617
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,850
to scrape the lesion from your eye.

618
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,480
But like I said before,

619
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,030
you don't have to worry.

620
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,490
It's just a minor surgery.

621
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,740
How long will it take to recover?

622
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,980
It can take effect in three to five days after the surgery.

623
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,380
If everything goes well,

624
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,070
you can recover

625
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,280
in two to three weeks.

626
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,230
Xiaoyi.

627
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,400
Go ahead.

628
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,550
Please call Zan.

629
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,410
I didn't hear you clearly.

630
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,780
Please say it again.

631
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,400
Xiaoyi.

632
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,440
Please...

633
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,650
What silly thing are you doing agaim?

634
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,710
Dr. He said

635
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,370
I still need a week to recover.

636
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,400
But Zan

637
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,950
will be back in two days.

638
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,140
I don't want him to worry about me,

639
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,330
nor be mad at me for not telling him.

640
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,020
So I want to find a way

641
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:11,940
to drag him on,

642
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,470
and make him come back a few days later.

643
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,710
But I still haven't

644
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,410
figured out a good excuse.

645
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,030
Ran.

646
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
Now that you're having issues with your eye,

647
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,320
it's the perfect time for Li Zan to come back

648
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,450
and take care of you.

649
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,260
But look at you.

650
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,480
You're thinking of ways to not let him come back.

651
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,010
Why do you need a boyfriend?

652
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:43,410
You don't show weakness when you need to.

653
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,850
When no one cares for you,

654
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,180
don't come crying to me.

655
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,260
I won't cry to you.

656
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,740
Didn't you say

657
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,600
you can't stand it

658
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,060
when I show my weakness?

659
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,080
That's towards me.

660
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,140
I wasn't talking about you showing it to your boyfriend.

661
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,190
Alright.

662
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,760
I need to rest.

663
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,040
Here.

664
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,710
Slowly.

665
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,420
I can't accompany you forever.

666
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:00,290
Li Zan didn't pass the certification assessment?

667
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,230
It's not that he didn't pass.

668
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,830
He didn't even take the exam.

669
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,510
What?

670
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,930
That's impossible.

671
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,880
If he didn't take the exam,

672
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,590
what was he practicing for

673
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,840
at your place every day?

674
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,190
I find it strange too.

675
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,660
So I went to check the CCTV.

676
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
See for yourself.

677
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,960
Anyway, your friend

678
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,820
definitely has something going on.
