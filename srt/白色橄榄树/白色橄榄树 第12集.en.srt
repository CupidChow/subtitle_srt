I know Shen Bei is avoiding me.

00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,730
After everything that happened in Happo,

6
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,640
everyone has something

7
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
they don't want to face.

8
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm no different.

Song Ran?

10
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,000
You're amazing.

11
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,840
We've all seen the videos and photos

12
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,800
you took.

13
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,910
They're absolutely shocking.

14
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,880
The director said

15
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,970
your footage

16
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,920
is the only evidence of the attack.

17
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,560
It has caused an uproar internationally.

18
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,870
Many countries have started sending aid to Eastern Country.

19

Every traveler from afar

20
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,160
can reach out, take something from the tree,

21
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,870
and then walk away without looking back,

22
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,150

You really might…

00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,190
I suddenly don't feel well.

27
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,710
Please help me ask the director for leave.

28

Are you okay?

34
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Are you okay?

35
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,430
Hello, are you Mr. Luo?

36
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,510
This is East Friendship Hospital.

37
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,950
You called to find a person

38
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,430
named Li Zan before.

39
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,800
A patient who had been transferred by the volunteer organization

40
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,130
had been in a coma.

41
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
He finally woke up today.

42
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,560
He said that his name was Li Zan.

43
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,020
The skull was damaged. The ribs were broken.

44
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,810
The liver was punctured. The calf was broken.

45
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,570
And many organs were damaged.

46
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,000
Not to mention the external injuries.

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,300
He was too close to the explosives.

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,070
If he hadn't been wearing protective clothing,

49
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,560
he wouldn't be alive.

Don't be afraid.

You'll recover.

56
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,060
And aren't you already

57
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,530
showing signs of improvement?

58
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,670
You can hear a little now,

59
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,160
right?

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,810
Take it slow.

61
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,650
It's okay.

62
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,080
Are you…

63
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,230
Are you wearing the hearing aid?

I am.

Full recovery

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,660
is very difficult,

67
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,560
and it'll take

68
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
a lot of time.

69
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,590
But there's no rush.

70
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,530
We'll adjust the plan based on your progress,

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,660
making sure each treatment

72
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,230
improves your hearing a little.

73
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:19,820
For now,

74
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,290
we'll use hearing aids

75
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,560
to help you manage everyday activities.

76
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,190
Whether you'll need them in the future

77
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,620
depends on how well the treatment works.

78
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,330
Right now, compared to the hearing loss,

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,680
tinnitus and dizziness are bothering me more.

80
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,950
How often do those symptoms appear, and how intense are they?

81
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,480
They happen

82
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
every hour.

83
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,760
The sound is deafening…

84
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,890
like an explosion that never stops.

85
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,190
During recovery,

86
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,390
tinnitus and dizziness

87
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,720
are expected.

88
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,190
Your body is still weak,

89
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,040
which will definitely affect the healing process.

90
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,720
So,

91
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,450
take it slow.

92
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720

Take the patient to the ward

95
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,560
and prepare for the first treatment tomorrow,

96
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,000
okay?

97
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,430
Okay.

98
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,430
Go with the nurse.

99
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,570
Thank you, doctor.

100
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,630
Please stay a moment.

101
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,090
I need to prescribe some medication for him.

102
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,390
Is something wrong,

103
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,870
doctor?

104
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,760
Tinnitus is common in recovery,

105
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,960
but from his description,

106
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,320
the severity he's experiencing

107
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,590
goes beyond

108
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,290
what I'd expect medically.

109
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,680
Are you suggesting…

110
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,030
a psychological issue?

111
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,890
Given the extent of his symptoms,

112
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,320
I suspect

113
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,470
it's not just the physical impact of the blast.

114
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,960
There might be

115
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,870
reasons you don't know about.

116
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,870
Anyway,

117
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,150
I recommend

118
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,750
a psychological evaluation

119
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,250
for the patient.

120
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,590
You're coughing so badly.

121
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,310
Did you forget to take your medicine?

122
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,530
Hurry up and take it.

123
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,130
There might be reasons you don't know about.

124
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,080
Director, you were looking for me?

125
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,380
These

126
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
are the photos we selected

127
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,060
from the photos you took.

128
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,840
Pick two.

129
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,730
Give them titles.

130
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,110
We need to submit them

131
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,190
to the Boshi International News Award committee soon.

132
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:06,970
Director,

133
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,790
you decide.

134
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,980
You decide the titles as well.

135
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,340
I…

136
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,320
An outsider sees things more clearly.

137
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,650
Your perspective might be more accurate.

138
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,550
Alright then,

139
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,210
I'll take the liberty of making the decision.

140

Hello, Song Yang.

155
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,090
There's a traffic jam. It might take a while.

156
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,600

[Yang Huilun]

I said there's a jam. Stop rushing me.

159
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,800
How much longer before you arrive?

160
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,630
How would I know?

Song Ran,

164
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,420
Eastern Country has been a hot topic lately.

165
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,270
How's "The Chronicles of Eastern Country"

166

coming along?

167
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,920
To be honest,

168
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,710
there's no progress.

169
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,390
I'm not at my best these days.

170

Then…

173
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,720
Then have you reviewed

174
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,840
the audio, videos,

Do you

feel guilty about that country?

I'm fine.

185
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,970
I stayed in Eastern Country for two months

186
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,040
and witnessed countless riots.

Don't think I don't know anything.

In the videos you shot in Eastern Country,

316
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,730
there's someone who keeps appearing—

321
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,630
All you think about is Li Zan.

322
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,460
I honestly don't know if you went to Eastern Country for work

323

327
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,110

Has fate run its course?

331
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,910
Since you've chosen to be a journalist,

332
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,330
then commit to it.

333
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,000
It's okay if you want to build your career

334
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,960
in the country.

335
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,720
Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment.

336
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,290
There are so many promising talents in this industry,

337
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,440
but in the end,

338
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,960
very few make it as renowned journalists.

339
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,620
I've seen that too many times.

340
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,790
You should strike while the iron is hot.

341

What are you thinking?

343
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,840
All this time, you haven't made any progress!

344
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,510
You've been sensitive and emotional

345
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,380
since you were a child.

346
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,920
I've always worried that

347
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,000
romantic relationships

348
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
would hold you back.

349
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,040
Great.

350
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,510
Just as I feared.

351
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
I'm telling you,

352
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,530
I absolutely won't allow you

353
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,130
to keep going down this road!

354
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,840
Whether I date or not, who I date,

355
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,310
whether I come to Dicheng,

356
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,350
and how I build my career—

357
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,880
those are all my decisions!

358
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,110
Can you just stay out of it?

359
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,280
You want me to stay out of it?

360
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,400
Fine.

361
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,550
Then who will look out for you?

362
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,930
Your dad's family is already a complete mess!

363
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,660
You're just an outsider there!

364
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,590
Do you want Li Zan to take care of you?

365
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,110
Fine.

366
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
Call him right now.

367
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,880
I'll leave you in his care this instant.

368
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,950
From now on,

369
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:51,880
whether you live or die, it'll be his responsibility.

370
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,080
I won't meddle again!

371
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,160
Why do you always have to

372
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,520
be so harsh?

373
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,310
Why do you

374
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,400
never care about

375
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,270
other people's feelings?

376
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,760
How am I…

377
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,710
I was too naive.

378
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,550
Open the door.

379
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:22,550
Go away!

380
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,830
I thought that leaving Liangcheng…

381
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,750
Please!

382
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,570
leaving the city

383
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:28,240
filled with memories of Zan and me,

384
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,880
would maybe

385
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,200
make me miss him less.

386
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,520
But after I left, I realized—

387
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,770
when Zan was far away in Eastern Country,

388
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,860
I couldn't stop missing him,

389
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,480
so what difference could the short distance between Liangcheng

390
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,880
and Dicheng really make?

391
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,110
Now I know—

392
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,970
I can't escape.

393
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,440
Even if I tried,

394
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,040
it wouldn't change a thing.

Will you tell your family about your condition?

You can't carry this alone.

407

You need support from those close to you.

They'd probably be disappointed in me.

A lot of patients

But even if

you don't want to tell your family,

417
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,960
you could talk to a friend.

418
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
It might help.

00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,760
I feel like I'm living in a dream.

422

425
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,700
If you didn't see them die with your own eyes,

426
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,250
you wouldn't understand.

00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,860
will he call me?

517
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,520
Or will he disappear again?

518
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:53,160
It's me.

519
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,490
So,

520
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,740
I didn't get the number wrong.

521
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,620
The plane is about to take off.

522
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,380
I'm turning off my phone now.

523
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,130
I'll call you later.

524
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,490
Okay.

[BDI-21: Moderate Depression, SAS: No Anxiety, SDS: Moderate Depression]

527
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,620
Wallowing in self-pity or complaining won't help.

528
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,350
If you're unhappy with the situation, change it.

529
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,070
You didn't like the boy I introduced to you.

530
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,330
Then go after the one you chose yourself.

531
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,510
Don't chicken out.

532
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,690
Okay.
