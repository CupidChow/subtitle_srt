4
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:53,500
Ran,

5
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,610
delete that comment.

6
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,970
And write a clarification statement.

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
This way…

8
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,750
I was just expressing my feelings.

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,990
I didn't make any conclusions.

10
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,410
The school shut me out.

11
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,090
The TV station wants me to apologize.

12
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,100
The victim's parents don't understand me.

13
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,320
I spent the whole day outside fighting them.

14
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,770
Do you know how I feel?

15
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,710
Do you even care

16
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,170
if I was wronged out there?

17
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,470
You're my family.

18
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,430
Why can't you support me?

19
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,590
Fighting?

20
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,680
Fighting who?

21
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,280
You young people who just

22
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
stepped into society

23
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,210
still cling to your student mindset,

24
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,490
always ready to fight.

25
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,710
Having ideals is good,

26
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,630
but you need to see reality too.

27
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,430
All you do is shout slogans.

28
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,080
You keep talking about

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,310
fairness and truth.

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
What do they really mean?

31
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
I doubt

32
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,970
you can answer that.

33
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,930
I've been writing and keeping records

34
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,150
since I was little

35
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,190
just because I like it.

36
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,560
I don't have any big dreams.

37
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,900
But you—

38
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,960
you keep filling my head with big ideas,

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,579
saying writing can change society,

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,130
and I have to stick to what I think is right.

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,260
You said that, didn't you?

42
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,190
Is all that

43
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,510
just a way to gain fame?

44
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,570
And once you have it,

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,190
you'll just sit back and reap

46
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,940
the benefits?

47
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,550
You…

48
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,560
Ran,

49
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,810
ever since you got sick,

50
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,770
you've become weirder

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,000
and more extreme in your views,

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,130
refusing to listen.

53
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,960
The doctor said in your condition,

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,190
you shouldn't work.

55
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,670
I was too careless.

56
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,510
You've been hiding it from the TV station for so long.

57
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,910
It's time to let them know

58
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,590
so you can take a proper break

59
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,990
and focus on recovering.

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,950

69
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,450
Sorry…

70
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,180
Song Ran.

71
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,540
Where are you?

72
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,610
Why are you calling?

73
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,240
I care about you.

74
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,360
Baixing Road Tunnel.

75
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,030
Aren't you cold

76
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,520
sitting here?

77
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,180
You must have been exhausted these past few days.

78
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,450
I figure you've been running around,

79
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,000
interviewing people,

80
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,610
and trying to uncover the truth.

81
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,050
I saw

82
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,980
a lot of people

83
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,480
supporting you in the comments.

84
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,670
They're just online strangers.

85
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,720
No one around me…

86
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,920
supports me.

87
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,750
Have you found Jiang Yu?

88
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,500
No.

89
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,510
Jiang Yu…

90
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,470
acts tough on the outside,

91
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,710
but deep down, he's sensitive and fragile.

92
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,320
When you saw him,

93
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,660
he appeared completely unreasonable.

94
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,580
But I could tell that

95
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,210
inside,

96
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,040
he was really hurting…

97
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,910
and scared.

98
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,790
Are you saying…

99
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,010
I hurt Jiang Yu?

100
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,300
That my comment hurt him?

101
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,130
That my comment was wrong?

102
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,140
No.

103
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,160
There was nothing wrong with your comment itself.

104
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,450
And I know your intention

105
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,760
was to protect Wang Han,

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,520
not to hurt Jiang Yu.

107
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,550
From your perspective,

108
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,310
Jiang Yu

109
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,960
does have a lot of issues.

110
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,480
But, Song Ran,

111
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,580
having the right intention

112
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,840
doesn't always lead to the right outcome.

113
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:02,940
Li Zan.

114
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,450
I trust my own eyes.

115
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,520
I saw what happened

116
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,610
outside the school that day.

117
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,230
I saw that video too.

118
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,720
I clearly saw how Jiang Yu

119
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,960
treated Wang Han.

120
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,030
You didn't see what Wang Han was like

121
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,330
when he came to me.

122
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,850
He was shaking the whole time.

123
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,290
Yet when he talked about Jiang Yu hitting him,

124
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,720
he sounded so sure.

125
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,390
Even so,

126
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,910
I never wrote anything

127
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,110
to take a clear stance.

128
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,810
I'm still waiting—

129
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,440
waiting to see Jiang Yu

130
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,820
and hear him explain what happened himself.

131
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,780
But now you're telling me not to believe Wang Han,

132
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,700
not to trust my own eyes,

133
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,270
but to trust your judgment instead.

134
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,320
You want me to believe that I was wrong

135
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,190
and I hurt Jiang Yu.

136
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,790
Song Ran,

137
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,680
I'm not trying to force you

138
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,850
to believe or disbelieve anyone or anything.

139
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,410
I just want to find the truth.

140
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,440
I want Jiang Yu to have a chance to speak for himself too.

141
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,360
But right now, that video

142
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,510
and your comment

143
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,360
have put Jiang Yu

144
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,820
in a vulnerable position.

145
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,000
Now, he doesn't even dare

146
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,660
to step forward and face this.

147
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,000
At the end of the day,

148
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,580
he's just

149
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,440
a teenager.

150
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,150
And that's my fault?

151
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,750
Isn't it all because

152
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,240
he hit someone first?

153
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,270
Li Zan.

154
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,960
Don't let Jiang Lin's death

155
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,160
cloud your judgment.

156
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,610
Don't view Jiang Yu through a distorted lens.

157
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,690
The pain caused by Jiang Lin's death…

158
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,450
shouldn't be something Wang Han has to carry.

159
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,090
I've always known…

160
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,480
this is the kind of girl you are.

161
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,290
What do you mean?

162
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,850
You seem soft,

163
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,890
but inside, you're strong.

164
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,420
I just never thought…

165
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
you'd see me this way.

Every time he was hit,

197
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,440
he wrote it down in detail.

00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,839
Mr. Luo.

201
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:12,760
[Hengsheng Construction]

202
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,619
You're the most rational person I know.

203
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,380
Can you tell me

204
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,829
whether Li Zan's judgment of Jiang Yu

205
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,560
has been influenced by his emotions?

206
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,950
I can't give you

207
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,859
an answer

208
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,450
because when it comes to Li Zan,

209
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,520
I'm influenced by emotions too.

210
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,450
If you think Li Zan is emotionally affected

211
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,010
when it comes to Jiang Yu,

212
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,370
then aren't you the same

213
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,370
when it comes to Wang Han?

214
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,310
You want to help him

215
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,840
and speak up for him.

216
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,700
Isn't that also an emotion?

217
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,550
And could that emotion

218
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,690
have been influenced by something else too?

219
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,380
Do you feel a sense of guilt too?

220
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,380
Then what am I supposed to do?

221
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,210
Keep searching for the truth.

222
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,780
Emotions aren't wrong.

223
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,000
They can even drive you to find the truth.

224
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
Wang Han,

225
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,240
I know you can see my messages.

226
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,280
I want to meet you again.

227
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,870
I have too many questions to ask you.

228
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,430
I'll be waiting for you on the bench in the neighborhood

229
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,880
until you come out.

230
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,820
Jiang Yu.

231
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,990
I found the ones

232
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,000
who bullied Wang Han.

233
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,550
Stop!

234
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,750
This jacket…

235
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,400
The baseball jacket Jiang Lin gave you…

236
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,370
isn't yours, is it?

237
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,000
I got it back for you.

238
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,180
I'll be waiting for you at the usual place.

239
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,950
I'm alone.

240
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,590
You said Jiang Yu kept bullying you,

241
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,410
and I did see you two arguing.

242
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,960
I don't know what really happened between you,

243
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,000
but as long as you promise me

244
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,820
that every word you told me is true…

245
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,160
then even if Jiang Yu is the younger brother of my late friend,

246
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,120
I'll still do whatever it takes to protect you,

247
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:26,260
speak up for you,

248
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,440
and make those who hurt you pay.

249
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,360
Can you promise me that?

250
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,820
I thought I was making amends.

251
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,410
But it turns out…

252
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,240
Sorry, Ms. Song.

253
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,750
I was really scared back then.

254
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,560
Jiang Yu and I used to be really close.

255
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,760
Stop!

256
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
He was the one

257
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,160
who saved me from

258
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,350
those bullies.

259
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:43,090
Don't run!

260
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,000
Stop!

261
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,980
-Don't run!
-We used to go to school

262
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,890
and go home together every day.

263
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,680
At that time,

264
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,800
I felt like as long as Jiang Yu was around,

265
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,400
I had nothing to be afraid of.

266
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,350
But one day, a few months ago,

267
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,630
he suddenly stopped talking to me.

268
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,310
I went to him,

269
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,380
but he kept pushing me away,

270
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,340
telling me to stop bothering him.

271
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,510
So I started following him in secret.

272
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,440
I wanted to know the truth.

273
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,030
Get lost!

274
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,000
I just wanted to know why.

275
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,150
Jiang Yu, why are you crying?

276
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,730
Let go of me!

277
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,970
So you came to me and said he was bullying you?

278
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,250
But what about that video?

279
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,940
I saw him hitting you.

280
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,190
I provoked him on purpose.

281
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,300
Where's my jacket?

282
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,740
They said if I didn't give them your jacket,

283
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,070
they'd beat me up again.

284
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,580
You gave my jacket to those punks?

285
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,710
That kid shouldn't have acted tough.

286
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,860
With this video, he will never be able

287
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,910
to clear his name.

288
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,310
Just do your job.

289
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,530
Do you know

290
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,270
why Wang Han listened to those punks

291
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,760
and stole your jacket?

292
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,230
Because he's weak.

293
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,940
No one was there to protect him.

294
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,070
Alone, he didn't dare to do anything.

295
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,790
He didn't dare to fight back,

296
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,000
so he just gave in.

297
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,380
That's not it.

298
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,830
I think it's because he felt…

299
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,570
you abandoned

300
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,150
and betrayed him.

301
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,090
He was very angry,

302
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,490
but he didn't know what to do,

303
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,050
so he made mistakes.

304
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,160
Just like how I felt Jiang Lin betrayed

305
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,050
and abandoned me.

306
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I'm no different

307
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,470
from Wang Han—just as weak.

308
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,490
There's nothing wrong with being weak.

309
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,020
Humans are fragile by nature.

310
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,120
But I'm not like Jiang Lin.

311
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,550
I got angry, and I lashed out.

312
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:37,890
He had every reason to blame and hate me.

313
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,910
But Jiang Lin…

314
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,400
Jiang Lin is dead!

315
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,390
How can I still blame him like this?

316
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,720
Am I a horrible person?

317
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,440
Am I awful?

318
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,830
You're not awful.

319
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,480
You're just hurting too much.

320
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,810
He'd forgive you.

321
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,310
He'd forgive us.

322
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,110
Jiang Yu…

323
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,440
Jiang Yu suddenly changed

324
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,010
because of his brother?

325
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,090
Why didn't he tell me?

326
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,190
I was his best friend.

327
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,040
Yeah,

328
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,210
why didn't he say anything?

329
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,570
Humans are such strange creatures.

330
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,620
Sometimes they do evil for no reason,

331
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:52,030
and sometimes they do good things

332
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,960
without any clear motive.

333
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,760
They insist on doing the hardest things,

334
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,540
yet when it comes to the simplest words,

335
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,740
they struggle to say them to the people closest to them.

336
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:25,930
Song Ran.

337
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,030
I have something to say…

338
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,100
I lied.

339
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,530
These past six months have been awful.

340
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,000
I haven't been doing well at all.

341
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,870
The smiles I gave you were fake.

342
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,940
When I said I was happy, that was a lie too.

343
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,270
All that talk about my family being great

344
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,310
and my job going smoothly—

345
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,350
none of it was real.

346
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,500
I was pretending!

347
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,680
Just like now,

348
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,850
look,

349
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,280
I can tell you I had a great day and I'm really happy.

350
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,430
But that's a lie.

351
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,960
I've told so many lies.

352
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,600
Today…

353
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,220
I feel like I could die from how sad I am.

354
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:34,240
Every day, I feel like I'm drowning in sadness.

355
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,230
I…

356
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,090
I lied to you too.

357
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,380
I told you…

358
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,270
I was doing fine,

359
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,740
that I felt at ease,

360
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,130
that bomb disposal was too dangerous

361
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,670
so I didn't want to be a volunteer anymore,

362
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,440
and that I didn't care anymore.

363
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,240
All lies.

364
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,260
♫She is a white island♫

365
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,290

00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,000
I'm a wreck now.

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:40,010
♫He is a blue sailboat♫

372

♫Sailing alone♫

373
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,630
♫Through the boundless night♫

♫Silently by her side♫

376
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,470
I'm sorry.

♫Heading toward her shore♫

378
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,280
I was too harsh yesterday.

379
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,610
I just wanted so badly to protect Jiang Yu.

380
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,810
♫The sky turns a deeper blue♫

381
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,100
I should've seen things from your perspective.

382
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,160
I should've supported you all along.

♫The brilliant night♫

384
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,480
I'm sorry, Song Ran.

385
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,010

No.

388
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,070
I'm the one who should be sorry.

389
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
I said things that were way too harsh.

390
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:18,620
♫A white island♫

391

♫I wish I could pick it♫

394
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,290
I failed to control my emotions

♫And give it to you♫

396
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,180
and was too stubborn to listen.

397
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,180
That's what led to all this.

398
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:32,720
But please, don't be angry.

399
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,150
Let's not fight, okay?

400
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,160

♫He is a blue sailboat♫

♫He once lost♫

♫The warmth of the harbor♫

I know you can't talk to anyone about it.

♫No more words are needed♫

415

♫Just quietly gazing♫

417
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,850
Because in this world,

418
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,820
there's no such thing as true empathy.

♫Heading toward her shore♫

420
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:32,730
Because when you say it out loud, it feels like—

421
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,510
why am I the only one this fragile?

♫Has never shone so bright♫

428

They can't see

430
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,160
the excruciating pain beneath that scar.

00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,680
that even when it looks healed,

00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,540
♫I wish I could pick it♫

436

it still causes me intolerable pain on rainy days.

♫And give it to you♫

438

with the same scar,

442
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,670
♫A blue sailboat♫

443
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,520
who feels that same pain night after night.

00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,980
Just like that white olive tree we saw that day.

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,410
People who've never seen it

♫The night has never been so dazzling♫

449
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,950
will never believe

00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,970
such a breathtaking sight ever existed in this world.

451
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,510
And they'll never understand

452
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,620
the gentleness in that fleeting moment.

453

♫And she will remember you and me♫

459
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,840
No need to change your shoes.

460
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,710
You…

461
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,730
live alone?

462
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,220
This was my grandparents' house.

463
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,280
They passed away.

464
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,050
Come in.

465
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,330
Sit on the sofa for a bit.

466
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,070
Warm yourself up.

467
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,500
Alright.

468
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:40,510
I'll go wash my face.

469
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,880
Did you wait long?

470
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,780
I couldn't get through to your phone.

471
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,070
I waited for a while.

472
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,880
My battery died.

473
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,040
What brought you here today?

474
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,430
I found the ones who bullied Wang Han.

475
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
I've turned them over to the police.

476
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,510
I wanted to let you know.

477
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,380
How did you find them?

478
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,410
Based on the times and locations

479
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,350
in Wang Han's notebook,

480
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,720
I checked those places one by one and found them.

481
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,590
You read his notes once that day

482
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,260
and remembered everything?

483
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,130
Not everything.

484
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,960
Just parts.

485
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,110
Maybe I got lucky.

486
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,990
Honestly, I've always believed in Jiang Yu.

487
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:05,780
It's not only because I don't think he's that kind of person,

488
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,840
but also because of that notebook.

489
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,820
It helped me a lot.

490
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,070
I remember

491
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,570
one note about him being beaten

492
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,770
on March 7th at 5 PM.

493
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,940
But at that time, Jiang Yu was at the police station

494
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,920
for causing trouble.

495
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,100
I picked him up with Mr. Fu.

496
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,330
So there's no way

497
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,760
Jiang Yu could have hit Wang Han then.

498
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,639
Why…

499
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,400
didn't you tell me?

500
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,880
I'm sorry.

501
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,110
By then, you had already posted your comment.

502
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,840
And with just that one contradiction,

503
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,810
I couldn't be sure.

504
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,310
Besides…

505
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,620
you were really mad back then.

506
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,070
So was I.

507
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,850
Even if I had told you,

508
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,110
you might not have believed me.

509
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,270
So I kept it to myself.

510
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,810
I didn't handle it well.

511
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,990
So,

512
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:32,280
I made you really mad, didn't I?

513
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,820
Yeah.

514
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,880
I'm usually pretty good

515
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,250
at keeping my emotions in check.

516
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
But with you…

517
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,050
it feels impossible.

518
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:32,860
You ear…

519
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,740
Is it okay?

520
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,030
Besides your ear,

521
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,550
do you feel unwell anywhere else?

522
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,860
I can still hear fine,

523
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:53,860
but I occasionally get tinnitus and muffled sounds.

524
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,580
Is it serious?

525
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,240
Not really.

526
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,670
It's just that

527
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,790
I probably can't handle explosives anymore.

528
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,910
What did the doctor say?

529
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,940
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

530
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,140
After being caught in a blast,

531
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,660
my body developed a natural aversion to it.

532
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,310
Does it…

533
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,160
have to do with Jiang Lin?

534
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,940
I think so.

535
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,120
But I didn't tell the doctor

536
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,110
anything about Jiang Lin.

537
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,340
Why not?

538
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,500
I feel like Jiang Lin's death…

539
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,620
might have something to do with me.

540
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,910
Maybe I caused his death.

541
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,600
But now, I don't remember anything.

542
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,250
Zan.

543
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,500
Do you want to remember?

544
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,190
I don't know.

545
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,990
The doctor told me

546
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,870
about a theory that

547
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,780
if you want to get better,

548
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,430
you have to stay away from the trigger.

549
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,430
Stay away?

550
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,350
Pain comes from wanting something but not getting it.

551
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,500
If you stop wanting, you can escape the pain.

552
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,950
But if you stop wanting,

553
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,690
then the pain disappears,

554
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,040
but so does the joy.

555
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,830
I also think that's nonsense.

556
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,420
The fact that you said that

557
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,480
means you already have your answer,

558
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,450
right?

559
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,370
You're just…

560
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,060
a bit scared,

561
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,220
right?

562
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,340
Very scared.

563
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,870
It's okay.

564
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,510
No matter what happens, good or bad,

565
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,000
I'll be here.

566
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,410
I'll face it with you.

567
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,330
I want…

568
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,730
I want to keep volunteering.

569
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,550
I want to work at Luo Zhan's company.

570
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,270
I want things to go back to how they used to be.

571
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:32,830
I really…

572
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
really want that.

573
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,250
Everything will be fine.

574
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,760
That reassurance sounded half-hearted.

575
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,330
I mean it.

576
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,170
If you truly, truly want something,

577
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,550
you can

578
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,000
definitely get it.

579
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,100
Says who?

580
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:37,050
You?

581
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,330
I speak from experience.

582
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:54,000
Everything I really, really wanted…

583
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,000
has come true.
