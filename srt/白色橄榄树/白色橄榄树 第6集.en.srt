00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,070
Good morning, Ms. Song.

5
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,759
Morning.

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,860
Reporter Song.

7
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,980
Instructor Li.

8
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,720
I heard you applied to go to Happo.

9
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,130
I want to do a follow-up report.

10
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,920
Is that okay?

11
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,870
You heard of that?

12
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,460
From who?

13
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,750
Not from you anyway.

14
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,000
So...

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,910
Can I follow you?

16
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,950
I've reported it to the captain.

17
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,740
Of course.

18
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,840
But

19
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,100
the entry test will start at 10 AM.

20
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,890
There are three hours to it.

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm afraid if I'm late,

22
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,740
I don't be able to meet you.

23
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,750
Are you going out?

24
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,910
I was going to look for someone.

25
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,780
But seems like there's no need for that now.

26
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,040
I was about to find you to tell you

27
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,290
about going to Happo.

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,470
But I'm afraid that if I don't pass the entry test,

29
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,030
I'd embarrass myself in front of you.

30
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,290
I was just hesitating.

31
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,079
Did you have breakfast?

32
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,360
Not yet.

33
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,080
Let me buy you breakfast.

34
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,150
No need.

35
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,570
I'm not hungry.

36
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,649
Theoretically,

37
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,680
there is about half an hour

38
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,750
between your body being hungry

39
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,450
till you feeling hungry.

40
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,750
Looks like my suggestion is quite foresighted.

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,330
Let's go.

42
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,580
You're quite good with your words.

43
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,710
If you find it uncomfortable,

44
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,350
we can go somewhere else.

45
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,000
It's okay.

46
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,390
I'm not pretty anyway.

47
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,520
There's nothing to look at.

48
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,130
The barbecue here smells so good.

49
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:31,570
Let's eat that.

50
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,080
Sure.

51
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,159
What would you like?

52
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,630
You order.

53
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,870
I'm not picky.

54
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,070
Anything is fine.

55
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,600
Excuse me.

56
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,370
Yes, sir.

57
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,040
Same as usual.

58
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:52,750
Okay.

59
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,720
Thank you.

60
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,980
Who says you're not pretty?

61
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,750
I know my place.

62
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,630
Welcome, sir.

63
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,480
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,070
At this rate,

65
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,180
you won't be able to start eating before I finish it.

66
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,570
Next time you see Zan,

67
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,490
send my regards.

68
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,250
Here.

69
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,040
No need.

70
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,190
I can do it myself.

71
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,070
Shen Bei

72
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,640
asked me to say hello to you for her.

73
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,750
Shen Bei?

74
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,170
Your girlfriend.

75
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,790
When I was communicating

76
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,110
with the station yesterday morning,

77
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,600
Shen Bei talked to me.

78
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,620
I said you weren't

79
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,120
in the military camp,

80
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,240
so she asked me to thank you for her.

81
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,390
Also,

82
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,260
I don't have a girlfriend.

83
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,000
Shen Bei

84
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,380
was introduced by my friend.

85
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,190
I couldn't refuse

86
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,410
so I met her once.

87
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,420
To put it simply,

88
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,240
I recommended you to

89
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,240
a client for a explosive demolition project

90
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm in charge of.

91
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,150
But they took a fancy to your resume.

92
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,570
He wanted me

93
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,429
to introduce his daughter to you.

94
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,530
His daughter

95
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,200
is a reporter.

96
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,990
That's why you asked me what I thought of reporters.

97
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,620
Here.

98
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,350
Thank you.

99
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,340
Your photo,

100
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,720
"Carry,"

101
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,640
was well shot.

102
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,870
You saw that too?

103
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,560
The whole world saw it.

104
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,110
You're exaggerating.

105
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,630
Did you

106
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,050
practice martial arts?

107
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,480
What?

108
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Martial arts?

109
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,390
You forgot?

110
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,920
Didn't you say

111
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,290
I can fight you too?

112
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,470
Of course.

113
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,830
I'll teach you now.

114
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,510
Are you ready?

115
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,580
Come on.

116
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,060
Attack me.

117
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,270
It's okay.

118
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
You can't hurt me.

119
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,250
I'm not capable of that.

you have to pull his balance forward.

No need.

I can practice by myself.

180

♫I'm so into you♫

183
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,200
It's unbelievable.

184
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,570
Instructor Li looks so slim,

185
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,080
with such thin arms.

186
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,620
Yet his physical fitness is surprisingly good.

187
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,600
Captain.

188
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,490
It seems

189
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,280
you have to protect me.

190
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,090
I saw you

191
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,050
the moment you came out from there.

192
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,150
Boring.

193
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,840
I can't even scare you.

194
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,200
Look how cooperative Reporter Song is.

195
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,530
She's frowning so hard.

196
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,500
You should appreciate

197
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,830
my cooperation.

198
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,870
When we get to Happo,

199
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,930
you have to allow me to do interviews.

200
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:15,830
Reporter Song.

201
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,150
You're getting better at bargaining.

202
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,480
I thought you'd only need Zan

203
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,740
to give you approvals.

204
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,280
We've selected the soldiers

205
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,840
to be transferred to Happo.

206
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,870
I'm the subunit leader.

207
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,130
I will bring 12 people.

208
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,850
Let's go.

209
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,460
Let me take you to someone.

210
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,400
There's someone you know in there.

211
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,630
Reporter Song.

212
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,370
Wait for us.

213
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,970
We'll have a brief meeting.

214
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,970
We'll be out soon.

215
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,580
Okay.

216
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,490
Attention!

217
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,530
Surprised?

218
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,550
Hello, everyone.

219
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,220
I'm your captain, Lin.

220
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,690
This is our bomb diffusing volunteer,

221
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,320
Li Zan,

222
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,120
who just passed the test.

223
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,870
He will help and instruct us

224
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,460
about work on bomb defusing.

225
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,720
From now on, I hope everybody

226
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,860
can obey his instructions.

227
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,220
Are we clear?

228
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,560
Yes, sir!

229
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,000
Zan.

230
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,540
Happo is different from Uglai.

231
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,030
I know.

232
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,090
Then why did you....

233
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,660
For the same reason as you.

234
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,240
The same as me?

235
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,270
Do volunteers get

236
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,720
extra pay for going to dangerous places

237
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,760
like I did when I was

238
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,000
a mercenary?

239
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,200
Just like you,

240
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,400
it's for a reason that's not money.

241
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,000
No wonder Reporter Song treats you differently.

242
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,650
Reporter Song.

243
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,150
Come with us to the dorm area.

244
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,780
Our plants are growing well.

245
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,310
Bring some fresh ones back.

246
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:34,900
Sure.

247
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,360
Thank you, then.

248
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,200
I can finally get to see

249
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,990
the legendary vegetation at the Chinese barracks today.

250
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,860
Let me see

251
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,370
why men who know how to grow vegetables

252
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,210
are so attractive to girls.

253
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,350
You not only have to see,

254
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,930
but also have to learn how to grow them.

255
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,170
You're no longer a mercenary.

256
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,350
This is your first mission

257
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,210
joining Eastern Country's army.

258
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,690
Oh no!

259
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,930
It ran away again.

260
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,640
Block it!

261
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,680
Watch it!

262
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:06,920
Quick!

263
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,070
This way!

264
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,640
Don't let it run away!

265
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,650
Are you okay?

266
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:20,680
Yes.

267
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,400
Nice catch.

268
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,520
How clumsy.

269
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,130
You can't even catch a chicken!

270
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,720
Okay.

271
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,690
Reporter Song.

272
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,820
You haven't aired the demining episode, have you?

273
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,420
Not yet.

274
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,490
It's this Saturday.

275
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,920
Okay.

276
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,510
We can take this chance

277
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,270
to promote the guys

278
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,510
in our team.

279
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,000
Maybe some Chinese girls

280
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
would fancy them.

281
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,170
They're gonna fix us a date.

282
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,960
If I help you with this,

283
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,830
what good is it to me?

284
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,450
How about this?

285
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,760
If you like someone in this team,

286
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,820
no matter who it is,

287
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
as long as you ask,

288
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,870
I'll make arrangements for you.

289
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,680
Ms. Song is on the hunt for a boyfriend!

290
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,640
Yeah! Really?

291
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,170
Reporter Song.

292
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,750
Why are you blushing?

293
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,340
Is there really someone you like?

294
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,710
It's okay.

295
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,360
Tell me.

296
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,790
I'm their boss.

297
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,080
They all listen to me.

298
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
I'll make the arrangements for you.

299
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,610
Captain Jiang.

300
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,260
Are you going to

301
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,500
give me the vegetables or not?

302
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh right.

303
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,680
Follow me.

304
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,650
Ms. Song.

305
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,290
What do you think of me?

306
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,800
I'm single, Ms. Song.

307
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,720
Look at me!

308
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,070
I'm the perfect boyfriend!

309
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,890
Reporter Song.

310
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,930
Throwing the bridal bouquet here?

311
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,920
Haven't you found that

312
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,310
Ms. Song's pretty cute?

313
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,990
I found out about that a long time ago.

314
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:58,920
She's so cute.

315
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,760
I can't help teasing her.

316
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,400
She blushes when she teases her.

317
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:01,890
Zan.

318
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,330
Do you know when Reporter Song is the cutest?

319
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,310
It's when you shock her

320
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,340
when she's filming seriously.

321
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,810
Just go, "Reporter Song"!

322
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,790
She's super cute the moment she gets shocked.

323
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,660
Just like a little rabbit.

324
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,960
Captain Jiang!

325
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,940
I want vegetables too!

326
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,410
Reporter Song.

327
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,260
Got the vegetable?

328
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,780
Where is Benjamin?

329
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,260
He's learning planting there.

330
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,560
Are you...

331
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,610
waiting for me?

332
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,970
It's getting dark.

333
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,570
Let me send you home.

334
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,520
Thank you.

335
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,370
It's not too safe in Uglai.

336
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,190
Don't go out too often.

337
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,680
But you'll still run around.

338
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,960
Right?

339
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
I'm a reporter.

340
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,170
I can't stay in the hotel all the time.

341
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,110
You're right.

342
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,020
What are you doing tomorrow?

343
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,240
I just want to see

344
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,290
if I can take more photos.

345
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,880
I have to

346
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,670
train the soldiers here for another day

347
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,830
tomorrow.

348
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,260
Tomorrow

349
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,430
may be my last day in Uglai.

350
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,870
Can I come with you tomorrow?

351
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,580
Sure.

352
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,240
Well...

353
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,380
9 AM.

354
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:09,960
Sure!

355
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,200
See you at the gate.

356
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,250
Hello? Sasin?

357
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,400
Song? That's great.

358
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,530
You're still up?

359
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,810
What's wrong?

360
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
Song, I'm here to say goodbye.

361
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,070
I'm going to Happo.

362
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,450
I'll leave overnight.

363
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Why so sudden?

364
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,160
The armed riots of Happo

365
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:53,090
attacked the hotel the day before.

366
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,750
A few reporters were injured.

367
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:57,010
So I was transferred to Happo urgently.

368
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,870
Oh, right.

369
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,580
I heard that one of the injured reporters

370
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,370
is from your TV station.

371
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,900
I think it's...

372
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,940
Zhang Tao.

373
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,200
Zhang Tao?

374
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,070
Tao?

375
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,100
I think so.

376
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,690
I'm hanging up.

377
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,860
Sasin.

378
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,150
Please be safe.

379
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,550
I wish you safety too.

380
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:25,200
Song. I will pray for you.

381
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,100
In this world,

382
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,590
many things

383
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,390
can't be changed easily.

384
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,160
We can only do more.

385
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,590
And a little bit more.

386
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,680
Hello? Director,

387
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,830
I'm Song Ran.

388
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,220
I have something

389
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,270
to ask you.

390
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,450
Go ahead.

391
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,370
I heard there's a reporter from our station

392
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,370
who got injured in Happo.

393
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,270
Zhang Tao.

394
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,860
He was hit by a stray bullet.

395
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,310
He's in the hospital.

396
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,760
I would like to request for approval to interview in Happo.

397
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,780
Tao is injured.

398
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,290
Someone has to report the news there.

399
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,600
So I want to go.

400
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,200
Okay, go ahead.

401
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,300
Thank you.

402
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,830
Director Liu.

403
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,830
Shen Bei.

404
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,110
Song Ran just called me.

405
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,440
She applied to interview at Happo.

406
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,240
I approved it.

407
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,860
Okay, Director.

408
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,620
I got it.

409
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,440
I have to go.

410
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,410
I'm about to board.

411
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,000
Shen Bei!

412
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,200
Song Ran's going to Happo?

413
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,270
Is Li Zan going too?

414
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,860
[International Rescue Organization Volunteer: Li Zan]

415
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,130
Li Zan?

416
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,550
Mr. Luo.

417
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,000
Is the boyfriend you want to introduce to me

418
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Li Zan?

419
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,200
Although it is powerful,

420
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,750
it's relatively stable.

421
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,960
My dad's taste is not bad this time.

422
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,050
Here!

423
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:59,970
I have something to do.

424
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,340
I have to go.

425
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,470
Dad.

426
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,870
I like Li Zan.

427
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,610
You have to help me.

428
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,050
My dad wants you to accept his invitation.

429
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,040
I'm sorry.

430
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,400
Today,

431
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,210
besides coming to thank your father and you for your kindness,

432
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:18,630
I'm also here to say goodbye.

433
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,290
I'm going to Eastern Country tomorrow.

434
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,160
I guess you're not interested in me.

435
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,790
Have a safe trip.

436
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,400
But I won't give up my feelings for you.

437
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

438
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,070
welcome aboard Eastern International Airline.

439
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,240
Eastern International Airline.

440
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,270
The capital of Eastern Country is our destination.

441

♫Feeling foolish♫

It's delicious.

Have a safe journey.

453
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,390

her vitality

465
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,480
is amazing.

466
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,350
Instructor Li is out?

467
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,640
Please tell him

468
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,960
when he's back that

469
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,420
Reporter Song has an urgent mission

470
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,620
and has gone to Happo.

471
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,130
Show your documents.

472
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,130
Get out of the car, please.

473
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,070
Stand over there.

474
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,770
Check the car!

475
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,650
From?

476
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,030
China.

477
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,640
Destination?

478
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,470
Happo.

479
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,680
Occupation?

480
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,400
Correspondent.

481
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,910
May I please take a look at the ID please?

482
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:04,720
Song... Song Rang?

483
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,110
Song Ran.

484
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,110
Song Ran.

485
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,720
The journalist who captured

486
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,320
the photo of "Carry," right?

487
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,240
Yes.

488
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,550
It's really you.

489
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,060
May I have a look at what have you shot?

490
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,130
Sure!

491
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,240
Sir, do you have a road map?

492
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,790
Yes. Please, it's over there.

493
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:35,650
Help yourself.

494
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:36,520
Thank you.

495
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,480
I'm running out of time.

496
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,390
Like this.

497
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,810
If I go by this road,

498
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,470
it might be faster.

499
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,380
Sorry.

500
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:15,830
I accidentally drew a circle on it.

501
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,920
It's okay.

502
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,110
These photos are fantastic.

503
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,840
Amazing photos.

504
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,960
Thank you.

505
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,150
Isn't our country great?

506
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,160
Yes.

507
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,040
See you, Miss.

508
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:36,750
Song Ran, your country is great too!

509
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,970
Good luck.

510
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,190
Thanks.

511
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,480
Ben.

512
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,080
Do your phones have signals?

513
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,920
No.

514
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:41,409
Are you trying to contact Reporter Song?

515
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,570
I hit the bullseye?

516
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,750
Mr. Li, it's confirmed. Here you are.

517
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,909
Thank you, sir.

518
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,960
Are you from Xi Country?

519
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,909
Your name looks like Chinese.

520
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,880
My father is Chinese.

521
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,250
No wonder.

522
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,670
A Chinese went by here just now.

523
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,240
A reporter with a strange name.

524
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,010
She's very famous now.

525
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,070
You should've have heard of her before.

526
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,480
Her name is Song,

527
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,580
and her given name is the past tense of "run."

528
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,260
Song Ran?

529
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,800
She accidentally left a mark

530
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,550
on the map when she was looking at it.

531
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,550
And she came over to me to apologize.

532
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,630
She's really a well-mannered girl.

533
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,360
A map?

534
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,370
May I have a look?

535
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,380
Sure.

536
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:25,970
Thank you.

537
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:33,500
Oh no.

538
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,430
What's wrong?

539
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,340
Haru?

540
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,250
Reporter Song is going to Haru?

541
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,020
That's dangerous.

542
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,470
I’ll contact Captain Jiang right away.

543
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:24,800
Is there anybody here?

544
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,030
Get out!

545
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,770
Look, someone's over there.

546
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,380
Let's take a look. Go!

547
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,610
She's trying to run away!

548
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,790
Go! Go! There!

549
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,960
Find her!

550
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:43,210
She's there!

551
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,670
Come on, guys! Move!

552
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,190
You go there! You go there!

553
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,630
Make sure every place's searched. You go there!

554
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,070
Follow me.

555
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,800
She's not far from here!

556
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:22,260
Yes.

557
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,480
Don't be afraid.

558
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,080
Any results yet?

559
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:15,950
No!

560
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,140
Come over here! The SWAT is here!

561
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,950
♫I got a feeling in my veins♫

We have to get rid of them before we leave.

Li Zan.

591
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,930
What's the situation over there?

592
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:22,470
Reporter Song and I are on No. 7 Highway.

593
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,580
What about you?

594
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,100
The battle is over.

595
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,460
We've wiped them out.

596
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,710
Let's meet up at the

597
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,110
garrison outside Happo.

598
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,110
I happen to be going to Happo for interviews too.

599
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:36,870
Okay.
