4
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,470
Who told you I was looking for them?

5
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,200
Mind your own business.

6
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,020
You're so ungrateful.

7
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:01,310
Is it still for that stupid star?

8
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,200
It's not a stupid star!

9
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:05,860
Fine.

10
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,400
I'll get it back for you.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Happy now?

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,710
What?

13
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,310
How...

14
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,690
How are you going to get it back for me?

15
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,870
I know that little boy.

16
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,190
I know where he lives.

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,890
I'll swallow my pride and get it back for you.

18
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,430
Why are you staring at me?

19
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,329
You don't believe me?

20
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,710
I don't want to see you with a sour face

21
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,770
every time we meet,

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,770
like I owe you a fortune.

23
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,310
Then...

24
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,430
Then I...

25
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,030
Then...

26
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,610
Then you still don't know me.

27
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,080
Seeing you angry, I...

28
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,150
I...

29
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,650
I feel happy.

30
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,870
You...

31
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,880
So I won't get it back for you.

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,320
That way leads to the bathroom.

33
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,010
Didn't you just go there?

34
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,210
Hey, lady,

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,380
this is your room key.

36
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,600
And a kiss for thanks.

37
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,100
What a rogue.

38
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,450
If Dr. Pei fancies you,

39
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,730
she must be blind.

40
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,880
Don't worry.

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,180
I have good eyesight.

42
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,870
Please, sit.

43
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,350
I've ordered a drink for you.

44
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,640
You're not planning

45
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,060
to get me drunk, are you?

46
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,470
Is your tolerance so low?

47
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,260
Do you get drunk so easily?

48
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,130
I'm very curious about

49
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,740
what you would do

50
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,200
after getting me drunk.

51
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,870
You wouldn't have already booked a room

52
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,270
in some hotel, would you?

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,510
Dr. Pei,

54
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,020
you...

55
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,630
What?

56
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,640
You don't understand?

57
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Then I'll be frank.

58
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm not some naive young girl,

59
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,040
nor am I the kind of woman

60
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,830
who would leave with you

61
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,680
after you

62
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,830
jingle your keys!

63
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,560
Dr. Pei,

64
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,120
I really don't understand…

65
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,070
You still don't understand,

66
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,560
do you?

67
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,720
Then let me sober you up!

68
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,970
Dr. Pei…

69
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,040
Brat,

70
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,670
what are you laughing at?

71
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,750
Sir,

72
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,650
that young lady told me you didn't finish the glass of wine just now.

73
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,290
She said she would let you have another one

74
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,460
as a way to thank you for returning the keys.

75
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,570
Being a good Samaritan is hard.

76
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,500
You don't still want that stupid star, do you?

77
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,640
Shut up.

78
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,909
That's not a stupid star.

79
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,260
Rina gave it to me.

80
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,620
What are you doing?

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,900
What am I doing?

82
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,900
After what happened to me tonight,

83
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,560
only the story of your stupid…

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,630
the story

85
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
of your cute

86
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,750
little star

87
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,159
can make it up to me.

88
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,000
You're crazy.

89
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,430
There's a custom in Eastern Country.

90
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,390
At the coming-of-age ceremony at 18,

91
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,720
mothers give their children a small gift.

92
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,610
This gift, carried with them,

93
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,230
is believed to bring safety.

94
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't believe in it,

95
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,690
but...

96
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,040
but if I didn't carry it with me,

97
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,530
Rina would keep nagging,

98
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,570
so I...

99
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,140
So I

100
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,250
really made a mistake.

101
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,200
Can I…

102
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,200
make a drink?

103
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,140
Okay.

104
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:57,740
Thank you.

105
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,480
I can't get you a new star.

106
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,810
Consider the stars here

107
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,960
as compensation for you.

108
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,270
There are no stars in it.

109
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,090
This special cocktail is called

110
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:43,890
"Starry Sky."

111
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,330
You're so sincere, aren't you?

112
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,080
You call this compensation?

113
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,750
Doesn't it count?

114
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,650
Does it count now?

115
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,630
What do you think?

116
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,690
Impressed by my magic?

117
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,170
Adding some glitter to a drink

118
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,430
is your magic?

119
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,130
Is this some kind of mercenary-exclusive magic?

120
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,080
It's my secret trick for dates.

121
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,410
How does a young boy like you know about it?

122
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,510
Your secret trick

123
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,800
is known to all freshmen

124
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,410
at the freshman ball.

125
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,110
I knew it.

126
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,030
Being a good Samaritan is hard.

127
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,280
The trick might not be great,

128
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,290
♫Butterflies♫

129
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,390

-What are you doing tomo…

142
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,240
No matter what you do tomorrow,

143
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,270
I just hope

144
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,150
you don't run into

145
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,210
a situation like that morning again.

146
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,750
Oh, right,

147
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,750
I asked around.

148
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,420
They don't sell that kind of red string in Eastern Country.

149
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,210
I'll have to buy it for you when I get back home.

150
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,320
No rush.

151
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,310
I want to puke.

152
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Let's keep drinking.

153
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,790
Li Zan,

154
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,720
thanks.

155
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,390
Li Zan?

156
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,080
Weren't you always calling me Zan before?

157
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,360
You've been in Eastern Country

158
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,650
for quite a while now, haven't you?

159
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,360
When are you planning to go back?

160
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,980
I'll be staying a bit longer.

161
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,150
One of our reporters got injured.

162
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,260
I applied to stay temporarily

163
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,780
to take over his work.

164
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,030
Temporarily?

165
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,780
How long is that?

166
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,470
How long do you hope it is?

167
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,510
I hope

168
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,630
as long as you're safe,

169
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
you can stay as long as possible.

170
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,410
Then…

171
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,960
Then I'll head back now.

172
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,840
Be careful

173
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,750
on your way back.

174
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,150
Okay.

175
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,550
I'm off.

176
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,510
Bye-bye.

177
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,640
Stay safe.

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,080
Got it.

179
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,440
Song Ran.

180
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,000
Ms. Shen?

181
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,200
What are you doing here?

182
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,870
I'm here for interviews, of course.

183
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,500
You should head back home.

184
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,570
Did you lose track of time?

185
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,450
Isn't it still a few days away?

186
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,050
I came early to get familiar with the environment

187
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,610
and also to check on our injured colleague

188
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,130
on behalf of the station.

189
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,290
Is something wrong with that?

190
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,080
No.

191
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,760
Of course not.

192
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,540
I'm just…

193
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:48,960
surprised.

194
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,950
In Happo, you need to prepare a lot of clothes.

195
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,010
Even though it's hot during the day,

196
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,670
you should still wear a jacket

197
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,500
because the air here is very dry.

198
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,270
If you dress lightly,

199
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,000
you'll get dehydrated easily.

200
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,619
And your pants—

201
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,180
make sure they're loose-fitting,

202
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
or by noon,

203
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,900
you won't be able to handle it.

204
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,170
I guess you already know it.

205
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,069
Li Zan

206
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,400
isn't my boyfriend.

207
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,030
But that doesn't mean

208
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,800
he won't be in the future.

209
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,590
In the past,

210
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,740
it was because there was a whole country between us

211
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
that we didn't know each other well.

212
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,400
You came here first

213
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,900
and got the upper hand,

214
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,090
but I'm here now.

215
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,530
It's common for the latecomer to take the lead.

216
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,290
I've never lost to anyone since I was a child.

217
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
This time…

218
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,130
there's no way I'll lose to you.

219
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,810
Ms. Shen.

220
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,590
You just got here and are already thinking about winning and losing.

221
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,920
Isn't that exhausting?

222
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,750
Get some rest.

223
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,490
We have work tomorrow.

224
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,240
Song Ran

225
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,510
has really changed.

226
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,380
Looks like this place does help people grow.

227
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,290
I should've come earlier.

228
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,860
Our mission today

229
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,530
is to clear a newly discovered minefield.

230
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,130
This minefield...

231
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,790
I won't lose.

232
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,680
I definitely won't.

233
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,930
Just wait and see.

234
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,170
Song.

235
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,680
Sasin.

236
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,110
I drank a bit too much last night.

237
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,720
Sorry.

238
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,240
I didn't walk you back.

239
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,260
It's fine.

240
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,100
Instructor Li sent me back.

241
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,490
Song.

242
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,040
I think he likes you.

243
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,240
Why do you say that?

244
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,690
Song,

245
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,650
I see you can always make him laugh,

246
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,000
and you get him to laugh nonstop.

247
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,130
You're not exactly a funny girl.

248
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,000
Sorry.

249
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,650
You're a good girl,

250
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,410
but you and the word "funny"

251
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,570
are as far apart

252
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,620
as Uglai and Happo.

253
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,230
Don't talk nonsense.

254
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,790
I can see

255
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,050
you're a bit different from usual today.

256
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,410
Did something interesting happen

257
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,200
after I left?

258
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,240
Didn't I just say?

259
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,480
I drank too much.

260
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,210
What interesting thing could have happened?

261
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,000
By the way,

262
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,550
what are you planning to do today?

263
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,400
I plan to visit the kids at the orphanage.

264
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,390
Since you're here,

265
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,790
come with me to pick up some things for them.

266
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,850
Okay.

267
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,640
Zan.

268
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,410
How was last night?

269
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,650
I saw Ms. Song when I left.

270
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,170
Seems like there's a story there.

271
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,490
Tell me.

272
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,290
Come on, tell me.

273
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,100
Don't you have anything better to do?

274
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,890
Well,

275
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,980
have you prepared the gift

276
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,650
for Jiang Yu?

277
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,080
Of course.

278
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,300
Let me tell you,

279
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,120
this time...

280
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,220
Never mind.

281
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,750
I'll just show you.

282
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,960
Give me some advice.

283
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,830
Look.

284
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,510
What do you think?

285
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,210
A Burdick jacket?

286
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,690
Nice.

287
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,410
And it's signed.

288
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,090
You like Burdick too?

289
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,110
You've got taste.

290
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,830
I wonder if Jiang Yu will like it.

291
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,610
He should like it, right?

292
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,150
Who wouldn't like Burdick?

293
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,570
But that kid is always a little weird.

294
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,270
If he doesn't like it,

295
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,000
he might even

296
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,440
dig up old grievances and settle them with me too.

297
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,000
He'll probably say I don't care about him,

298
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,400
that I'm brushing him off,

299
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,200
and that I'm not paying attention to what he wants.

300
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,880
Don't worry.

301
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,590
He'll like it.

302
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,100
How do you know?

303
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,750
You've never met him.

304
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,270
The gift itself isn't what matters.

305
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,610
What matters is that

306
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,340
you care enough to give him a gift.

307
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:49,720
Trust me.

308
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,660
He'll definitely like it.

309
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,290
Of all the people I know,

310
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,970
you're the best with words.

311
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,080
No wonder Ms. Song is...

312
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,100
Benjamin is coming.

313
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,000
If you don't want him

314
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,440
to take that jacket,

315
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,830
you better hide it now.

316
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,110
Benjamin.

317
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,960
You actually came back to sleep last night.

318
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
Looks like Dr. Pei isn't interested in you.

319
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,330
Not just uninterested.

320
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:20,960
But

321
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,030
it's only fueled my determination.

322
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,140
Trust me.

323
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,070
I'll win her over

324
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,790
in 10 days.

325
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,740
You're like a machine,

326
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,830
chasing a girl like it's a battle

327
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,030
and even setting a deadline to it.

328
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,910
Of course.

329
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,790
I cherish every second of my life.

330
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,310
Zan,

331
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,460
what time did you get back last night?

332
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,510
At a normal time.

333
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:56,230
I saw you chatting with Ms. Song last night.

334
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,030
If you had just kissed her,

335
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,370
she would've surrendered to you.

336
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,320
By evening, the two of them might've naturally

337
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,090
taken things to the next level.

338
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,870
My leg's numb.

339
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,240
Zan is polite,

340
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,300
but don't think you can mess with him.

341
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,030
If you were as bold and precise with Ms. Song,

342
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,830
you would've won her over by now.

343
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,070
Instructor Li,

344
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,700
a female reporter at the gate wants to see you.

345
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,400
Zan,

346
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,640
Ms. Song is braver than you.

347
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,010
I like that.

348
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,110
Hold this

349
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,350
for me.

350
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,050
What's in your hand?

351
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,590
Li Zan,

352
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,130
long time no see.

353
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,440
Hello,

354
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,260
Ms. Shen.

355
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,790
You don't look

356
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,110
surprised at all.

357
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,280
It is a bit surprising

358
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,880
to see you here.

359
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,430
You knew it was me.

360
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,400
You just saw my back.

361
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,780
Wouldn't you mistake me for Song Ran?

362
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,070
No.

363
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,550
You and she look different from behind.

364
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,030
You're so familiar with her now.

365
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,310
Ms. Shen,

366
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
welcome to Eastern Country.

367
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,890
Is there something

368
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,750
I can do for you?

369
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm just here to say hello.

370
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,440
Song Ran's work term in Eastern Country

371
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,110
is up.

372
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,140
She'll be heading back in a few days.

373
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,400
The station sent me to take over her work.

374
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,200
I'm afraid I'll need your guidance

375
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,040
in the future.

376
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,510
Zan.

377
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,660
The team's all set and ready.

378
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,640
We're waiting for you to start the training.

379
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,170
Alright.

380
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,680
Sorry.

381
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,510
I have to go,

382
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,160
Ms. Shen.

383
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,190
You're quite popular.

384
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,470
There are always girls coming to see you.

385
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,160
Who was that?

386
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,700
A colleague of Song Ran's.

387
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,970
Chinese female reporters are all pretty.

388
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,730
But I still prefer Ms. Song.

389
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
I choose Ms. Song.

390
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,720
[Happo, Orphanage]

391
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,530
Song,

392
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,440
I thought you were trying to look cool earlier,

393
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,790
but you're actually so good at riding a motorcycle.

394
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,520
Carrying me and all this stuff,

395
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,280
you still rode so steadily.

396
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,680
When I first came to Eastern Country,

397
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,010
I was nothing like this.

398
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,060
I practiced it on purpose.

399
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,370
I was worried about

400
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,440
being left behind again

401
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,500
or stepping on a landmine...

402
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,080
Stop.

403
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,910
Don't jinx it.

404
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:38,870
It's fine.

405
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,440
Zan will protect me.

406
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,510
What?

407
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,460
Nothing.

408
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,540
I'm a journalist.

409
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,920
I just want to interview you.

410
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,160
The interview will be watched by people all around the world,

411
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,960
and it could really benefit you.

412
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,830
Ms. Shen?

413
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,920
Oh, it's nice to see you.

414
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,270
Song and Sasin.

415
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:03,960
Hey, kids.

416
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,920
Come here, come.

417
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,110
Ms. Shen,

418
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,300
are you here for an interview?

419
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,750
Let me introduce you.

420
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,680
That's the local reporter, Sasin.

421
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,080
He's also my good friend.

422
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,000
Sasin,

423
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,230
she's a reporter from my station.

424
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,360
Her name is Shen Bei.

425
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,910
She's also my team leader.

426
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,390
Thank you.

427
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,200
You're smart.

428
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,160
I should have known

429
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,850
I'd be refused if I came empty-handed.

430
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,980
Look at this. It's so cute.

431
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,670
You misunderstood.

432
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:53,750
Hello,

433
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,160
Lea.

434
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,070
I apologize.

435
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,330
I didn't think it through just now.

436
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,240
Please accept this

437
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,030
as a token of my appreciation.

438
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,980
It might not be of much help.

439
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,330
But once the interview is broadcast,

440
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,680
you'll definitely receive

441
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,480
more attention and assistance.

442
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,460
Excuse me.

443
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
Everyone, follow me.

444
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,810
Follow me.

445
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,350
Follow me.

446
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,040
Song,

447
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,680
I don't like that colleague of yours.

448
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,720
You know me.

449
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,030
I'm leaving.

450
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,890
I'll leave the motorcycle to you.

451
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,270
Ms. Shen,

452
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,720
you don't understand the people here.

453
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,350
Whether or not they agree to an interview

454
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,160
completely depends on their mood.

455
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,360
It's not about money.

456
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,640
And in Eastern Country,

457
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,330
money isn't of much use.

458
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,440
There's a shortage of resources here.

459
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,510
Many things can't be bought with money.

460
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,970
The things we brought here

461
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,440
were all donated.

462
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,130
By being so direct,

463
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,250
you'd hurt their feelings.

464
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,560
They'd become more resistant.

465
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240
Wait for me.

466
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,110
I like it.

467
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,420
Good girl.

468
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,030
Hi, Lea.

469
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,480
That is my colleague.

470
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,310
She wants to do an interview and ask you some questions.

471
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,160
Okay. I trust you,

472
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,620
but she can't take photos.

473
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,720
Okay.

474
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,410
I just explained to the head of the orphanage.

475
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,680
She said you can go in,

476
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,440
but no cameras.

477
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:06,520
That's fine.

478
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,160
If there's anything you want to photograph,

479
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,070
you can tell me.

480
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,240
They're more familiar with me.

481
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,430
It should be okay if I take the photos.

482
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,470
Song Ran, are you showing off?

483
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,600
Are you showing off how well you fit in here,

484
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,880
or hinting that I shouldn't compete with you?

485
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,470
Are you suggesting that whether it's the interview in Eastern Country

486
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,160
or Li Zan,

487
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,080
I can't win against you?

488
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,150
When did I say I needed your help?

489
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,940
Do you think I can't

490
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,920
do this interview without you?

491
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,110
Enough, Ms. Shen.

492
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,310
You might see this place as a workplace

493
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,310
or a love battlefield.

494
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,550
That's your business.

495
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,510
But to me,

496
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,790
this is a war zone.

497
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,570
I don't want to compete with you here for Li Zan

498
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,580
or for interviews

499
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,930
because it's not appropriate.

500
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,140
If you want to compete,

501
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,320
fine,

502
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,430
back home,

503
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,850
I'll be ready anytime.

504
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,700
And you're not guaranteed to win.

505
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,460
I was provoked by her.

506
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,920
I lost my composure.

507
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,890
Does this mean I've admitted defeat?

508
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,330
Of course, it's not easy for the latecomer to take the lead,

509
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,660
but I'm the kind of person

510
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,520
who loves challenges.

Song Ran,

518
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,020
I'm going to the camp for an interview today.

519
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,030
I just talked to Shen Bei.

520
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,920
She said she's been very busy recently

521
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,889
and asked me to team up with you.

522
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,440
You want me to go with you?

523
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:30,800
Yes.

524
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,760
Alright.

525
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,610
Then let's meet at the camp entrance later.

526
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,830
Okay, see you later.

527
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,480
Rina.

528
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,800
Benjamin?

529
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,550
Thanks.

530
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,360
Rina,

531
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,310
how did you end up like this?

532
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,440
Coming to Happo with two kids by yourself

533
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,370
is so dangerous.

534
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,640
Did someone bully you again?

535
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,840
No.

536
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,190
I came willingly.

537
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,400
No one bullied me.

538
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,370
I'm a volunteer now.

539
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,860
How could anyone bully me?

540
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,600
Being a volunteer

541
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,400
doesn't mean you have to do such a dangerous thing.

542
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,000
It's not that dangerous.

543
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,840
It's just that some road signs were destroyed,

544
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,840
and I got a bit lost

545
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,350
and took a mountain path,

546
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,730
but I still made it to Happo in the end.

547
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,400
Didn't you say

548
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,400
there's nothing I can't do?

549
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,550
Rina.

550
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,150
Your head...

551
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,560
I'm fine.

552
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,690
It doesn't hurt.

553
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,480
Get in the car.

554
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,150
I'll take you to the hospital

555
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,150
to get it treated.

556
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:32,800
No need.

557
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,140
It's on the way.

558
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,420
Get it treated.

559
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,580
Otherwise…

560
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,560
Sasin would blame me again

561
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,600
when he sees it.

562
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,360
Do you see Sasin often?

563
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,540
How has he been lately?

564
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Has he gained weight or lost weight?

565
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,530
Don't worry.

566
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,560
He's fine.

567
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,320
Everything is fine.

568
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,360
Isn't he protected by the little star

569
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,150
you gave him?

570
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,030
The little star...

571
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:23,820
He's wearing it.

572
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,220
Does he wear it every day?

573
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,900
He always wears it.

574
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,990
[Happo Hospital]

575
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,990
The wound isn't deep.

576
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,510
Just make sure to keep it dry.

577
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,280
Oh, okay.

578
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,340
Thank you, Doctor.

579
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,570
Did you come alone?

580
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,930
Is there any family with you?

581
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,330
If so, they can go get the medicine for you.

582
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,550
No need.

583
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,900
I'll get it myself.

584
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:56,450
Then wait a moment. I'll give you the prescription.

585
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,440
Where has Benjamin

586
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,140
wandered off to?

587
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,380
Rina, right?

588
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,030
I'm heading to the pharmacy anyway.

589
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,130
I'll get your medicine for you.

590
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,990
Just wait here for me for a moment.

591
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,990
Hey, soldier.

592
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,040
I'm sorry.

593
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,400
Sasin came to find me the next morning

594
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,490
and explained what happened that night.

595
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,920
That boy really is meddlesome.

596
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,900
He didn't leave me the chance to clear up the misunderstanding.

597
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,570
I don't think you'd come to me to clear up the misunderstanding.

598
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,160
Otherwise,

599
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,720
you wouldn't have left Rina alone

600
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,120
in the examination room.

601
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,910
This is Rina's medicine.

602
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:14,440
Her wound has been treated.

603
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,570
I'll go call her out.

604
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,190
Dr. Pei.

605
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,800
Since the misunderstanding has been cleared up,

606
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,280
can I buy you a couple of drinks?

607
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,230
Are you here to be a soldier

608
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,910
or to drink?

609
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,260
Before meeting you,

610
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,910
I was here to be a soldier,

611
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,610
but after meeting you,

612
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,420
I think having a couple of drinks is fine too.

613
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,900
Today,

614
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,180
I should get off work early.

615
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,570
I may go to Dreaming Bar to unwind.

616
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,280
If someone's willing to pay for the drinks,

617
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,730
I wouldn't mind.

618
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,160
Sir, I'm looking for Instructor Li.

619
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,670
You and she look different from behind.

620
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,110
Here.

621
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,880
I think he likes you.

622
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,920
You can always make him laugh,

623
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,830
and you get him to laugh nonstop.

624
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,310
Song Ran.

625
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,810
Ms. Song.

626
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,360
Zan, you're here too.

627
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,400
Ms. Song.

628
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,450
Guess who I just ran into on the street?

629
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,880
Who?

630
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,590
Rina.

631
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,640
Rina?

632
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,700
What is she doing here?

633
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,590
She was taking two kids to the orphanage.

634
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,590
I think their names are

635
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,960
Sia and Zo...

636
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,000
Sia and Zoro?

637
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,060
From Uglai to Happo,

638
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,050
it was such a dangerous journey.

639
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,250
Rina's really tough.

640
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,250
Sasin takes after Rina in that regard.

641
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,590
Fei.

642
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,190
Rina

643
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,400
is Sasin's mother.

644
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,400
Those two kids

645
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,490
are the ones in the photo called "Carry."

646
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,510
I want to check on them

647
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:09,770
and find out why they've become orphans.

648
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,440
So...

649
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:13,920
Okay.

650
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,660
No problem.

651
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,240
Go ahead.

652
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,710
Today's interview isn't complicated.

653
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,570
I can handle it.

654
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,230
Go,

655
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,760
Ms. Song.

656
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,010
We'll take good care

657
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,170
of your colleague.

658
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,510
Thanks.

659
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,070
Be careful.

660
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,760
Thanks,

661
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,360
Benjamin.

662
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,020
Why have they become orphans?

663
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,290
It's just fate.
