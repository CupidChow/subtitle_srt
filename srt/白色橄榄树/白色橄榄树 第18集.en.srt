4
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Are you trying to wake Dad up?

5
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,860
All right.

6
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,130
You are already feeling sleepy.

7
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,079
Just go to sleep.

8
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,910
As soon as I close my eyes,

9
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,610
my sleepiness fades.

10
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,210
No, it won't.

11
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,510
I won't leave until you fall asleep.

♫The moon shines on you tonight♫

13
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,290
♫There are countless stars♫

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,520
♫Shyly, you close your eyes♫

♫Where are you going in this moonlight?♫

16

♫The evening breeze blows gently♫

What are you laughing at?

28

Zan.

29
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,580
I like you so much.

30
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,680
I like you so, so much.

♫And you're incomparable♫

35
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,140

Let me do it.

40
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,830
A girl’s strength is limited.

41
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,120
No, Uncle Li.

42
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,910
That granny said

43
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,730
I must plant it myself in order

44
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,130
for the wish to come true.

45
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,360
The wish I made

46
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,950
is very important to me.

47
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,680
Uncle Li,

48
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,760
do you believe what that old lady said?

49
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,350
Will my wish really come true?

50
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,409
Well, when it comes to all matters in this world,

51
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,540
as long as you believe in it, it's true.

52
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,520
It therefore exists

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,060
and will come true.

54
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,320
Zan said the same thing too.

55
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,160
I can't believe you slept in.

56
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,360
You got up so late.

57
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,810
Don't you feel ashamed?

58
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,160
He didn't sleep well last night.

59
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,430
So it doesn't count as sleeping in.

60
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,780
Why did you dig it open again?

61
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,570
-I made a mistake.
-Dad.

62
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,310
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

63
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,840
Do you have anything to eat?

64
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,380
There are glutinous rice balls from Aunt Liu on the table.

65
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,330
Aunt Liu?

66
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,080
Aunt Liu... seems quite nice.

67
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,830
She is really nice.

68
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,630
Dad.

69
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
I mean...

70
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,780
It's time you find yourself a partner.

71
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,070
What for find a companion when I have already lived half of my life?

72
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,120
I dreamed of your mother last night.

73
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,950
She got mad at me

74
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,310
and was crying over a small matter.

75
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,360
You're making things up again.

76
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,950
I'm not.

77
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,930
I know your mum's temperament very well.

78
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,930
She's narrow-minded and petty.

79
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,270
If I forget her

80
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,530
and find a new partner,

81
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,430
she will not spare me.

82
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,800
If I were her,

83
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,480
I would be angry too.

84
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,280
So much?

85
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,800
I shouldn't have accepted it if I had known earlier.

86
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
You should.

87
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,190
This is our custom.

88
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,980
When we bring our girlfriend back home to meet our parents,

89
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,860
they will give 1,000 yuan minimally.

90
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,520
If they like the girl, they will give 2,000 yuan.

91
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,000
It seems that my dad

92
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,210
really, really likes you.

93
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,570
Of course.

94
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,410
I'm so cute.

95
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,940
Why haven't I ever seen you this thick-skinned before?

96
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,809
I wonder if you are this thick-skinned

97
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,000
in front of your family.

98
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,160
When I left,

99
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,180
I didn’t tell Song Yang where I went.

100
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,320
She sent me many messages.

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,450
But I haven't figured out how to reply her.

102
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,530
Why don't you...

103
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
come hide at my place for a while?

104
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,940
You can also think about

105
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,630
how to reply to your sister.

106
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,120
How about this?

107
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,530
I'll play a game of imitation with you.

108
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,470
If you do everything right as I do,

109
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,650
I'll agree with your suggestion.

110
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,290
Okay.

111
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,330
Take out your phone.

112
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,150
Yours.

113
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,230
Like this.

114
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,720
Hold it tight.

115
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,350
Like this.

116
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,160
Release one finger.

And the last one.

I'll go to work first.

127
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,380
I bought you new slippers.

128
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,410
See if they fit.

129
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,390
Whose idea was it to have this team building?

130
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,080
Why didn't you ask me for my opinion before?

131
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,810
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

132
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,730
They said they have asked you previously.

133
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,750
You said you didn't care

134
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,030
and told them not to bother you.

135
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,230
How would I have known

136
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,390
that they would suggest some

137
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,870
real-life battlefield game?

with toy guns?

141

They said...

142
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,320
they found it quite interesting.

143
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,840

Mr. Luo,

I want to...

154
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,520
give it a try.

155
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:08,180
I've been in pretty good shape lately.

156
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,120
The doctor told me that

157
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,410
I can try to not wear the hearing aid.

158
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,200
Besides,

159
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,390
I want to continue to be a volunteer.

160

If I can't even stand the game,

161
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,760
I might not be able to do

162
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,790
what I want to do.

163

166

Of course I'll join.

167
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,200
You are so fierce.

168
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,870
Looks like I'm the only one who would dare

169

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,920
You've adjusted to the reduced dosage.

174
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,320
We can reduce it further.

175
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,910
But you still need to be careful.

176
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,510
Don't stress yourself out

177
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,770
over life's troubles.

178
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,440
Be careful to not let your condition relapse.

179
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,840
Okay.

180
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,720
I'll be careful.

181
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,030
Dr. Liang,

182
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,440
I have a question.

183
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,740
Can someone completely recover from

184
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,410
post-traumatic stress disorder?

185
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,440
How long will it take?

186
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,550
Post-traumatic stress disorder is more complicated.

187
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
If your friend is suffering from it,

188
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,030
you must show him enough patience and understanding.

189
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,960
The pain he's enduring

190
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
may be beyond your imagination.

191
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,390
I'm Song Ran.

192
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,800
Song Ran?

193
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,550
It's been a long time since we spoke.

194
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,360
Shen Bei?

195
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,550
What are you calling me for?

196
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,970
No.

197
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,490
I mean,

198
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,500
I called you several times but you didn't answer.

199
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,480
I thought you didn’t want to get in touch with me anymore.

200
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,330
Of course not.

201
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,200
I've just been busier these days,

202
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,950
so I didn't contact you.

203
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,660
I heard about your resignation

204
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,840
when I was sending materials to the station today.

205
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,770
You liked being a reporter so much.

206
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,340
I would love to know why.

207
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,910
Are you bored now that

208
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,180
you don't have a rival like me?

209
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,250
It's not boredom,

210
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,080
it's loneliness.

211
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,760
But that's not why I quit.

212
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,170
I just want a change of environment

213
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,150
and live a more carefree life.

214
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,470
I don't think that sounds like a bad idea.

215
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,160
As long as you are happy.

216
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
So that...

217
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,750
So that I don't fall into depression again,

218
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,440
right?

219
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,550
What about you?

220
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,660
Have you been well?

221
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,130
What are you busy with?

222
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,120
Have you met Sasin and the rest?

223
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,150
I've met them.

224
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,580
They...

225
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,270
Although they didn't say anything,

226
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,120
I know they all miss you.

227
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,099
Song Ran.

228
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,490
Have you ever thought of

229
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,760
coming back to Eastern Country?

230
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,810
Yes.

231
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,470
But now's not a good time.

232
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,350
Let's give it some time.

233
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,310
I might not be able to do it right now.

234
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,970
The pain he's enduring

235
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,180
may be beyond your imagination.

236
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,450
Give him some more time.

237
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,310
That's great.

238
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,400
I was just testing you.

239
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,460
I don't want you here this early.

240
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,310
Come back only when I'm more famous than you here.

241
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,680
Have you forgotten?

242
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,580
I only accept victory.

243
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,750
Come on.

244
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:09,150
Alright.

245
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,170
I'll go get busy.

246
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,200
Keep in touch.

247
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,750
Take care, Shen Bei.

248
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,330
Bye.

249
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,170
Bye bye.

250
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,590
♫In this desert♫

251
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:37,470

263
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,000
Zan.

264
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,530
I submitted a pitch for a documentary to Dicheng's

265
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,360
broadcasting station.

266
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,030
I really appreciate the style

267
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,510
of their documentaries.

268
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,850
That sounds great.

269
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,460
But...

270
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,020
I think there were also many others who submitted a pitch.

271
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,660
I might not be chosen.

272
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,310
It's okay.

273
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,390
I don't really want to go to Dicheng either.

274
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,390
How could that be?

275
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,590
Don't worry.

276
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,740
They will definitely choose you.

277
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,920
Why are you so sure?

278
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,480
This time, the drafts will be reviewed back-to-back.

279
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,680
They don't care about our past results.

280
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,680
Didn't you achieve your past successes

281
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,250
based on your own merit?

282
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,560
Trust me.

283
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,490
How could I not know

284
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,780
my own girlfriend?

285
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,220
When will you be done with your training?

286
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:55,970
How about this?

287
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,400
Let me carry you.

288
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,830
Carrying extra weight helps me train more efficiently.

289
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,750
Will I not be too heavy?

290
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,200
You think I don’t know

291
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,260
how much you weigh?

292
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:09,480
Come.

293
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,550
Okay.

294
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,140
Hurry up.

295
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,920
Be careful.

296
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,010
I am seated.

297
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,640
-Are you ready?
-Come on.

298
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:19,730
Here we go.

299
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,230
Come on!

300
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,830
Don't move.

301
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,450
Be careful.

302
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,600
Get off first.

303
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,440
No, I won't.

304
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,160
I'll sit tight then.

305
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,090
I won't move anymore.

306
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,960
I'll be good.

307
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,230
Are you sure?

308
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,320
Here we go.

309
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm in no hurry for you to finish now.

310
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,500
I think you can do another 200.

311
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,760
Alright.

312
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,240
Okay.

313
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,550
As for these 200,

314
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,070
I don't want to do push-ups anymore.

315
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,730
What do you want to do instead?

316
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,480
I want to do overhead presses.

317
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,590
How are you going to do it?

318
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,780
♫Don't know where this road♫

Be sure to eat timely.

338
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,430
Why are all of your clothes

339
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,880
different from mine?

340
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,930
Because you're a medic today.

341
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,930
Use these

342
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,220
to treat our soldiers.

343
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:05,930
Why?

344
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,750
Why?

345
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,150
Because I'm in charge of you.

346
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,440
Here.

347
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:38,820
[The Chronicles of Eastern Country]

348
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,350
Song Ran.

349
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,010
Mr. Luo.

350
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,950
Please have a seat.

351
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:47,400
Okay.

352
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,080
I ordered coffee for you.

353
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,300
It's the one you used to drink.

354
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,420
How thoughtful.

355
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,740
You still remember how I like my coffee?

356
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,380
I am no longer working now,

357
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,920
so my brain has some capacity to spare.

358
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,000
I was a bit surprised

359
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,260
by your resignation.

360
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,400
But when I think of our "Fleeting Century,"

361
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,440
it seems like

362
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,920
it wasn't too bad an idea.

363
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,880
By saying this,

364
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,270
does it make me

365
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,480
seem very realistic?

366
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,560
To be precise,

367
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:19,090
you're being practical,

368
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,910
and it sounds better too.

369
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:25,970
Mr. Luo,

370
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm really sorry.

371
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,710
Due to my personal reasons,

372
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,980
this book got delayed again and again.

373
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,350
You never give up,

374
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,060
not even once complaining.

375
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,250
Thank you so much.

376
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,880
Song Ran.

377
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,120
Judging by your tone, are you trying to...

378
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,080
terminate our collaboration?

379
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,690
How dare I?

380
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,750
No.

381
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,360
Mr. Luo,

382
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,240
don't worry.

383
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,230
That's good.

384
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:01,060
Actually, I have a new idea

385
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,660
I'd like your advice on.

386
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,550
Go ahead.

387
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,180
I've given much thought

388
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,770
to your suggestion of

389
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,100
going back to Eastern Country.

390
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,810
But it's not quite possible yet.

391
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,190
So,

392
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,040
I want to write this book in a different way

393
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,150
I want to use a love story as a hook,

394
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,240
so as to link up everything that I saw and heard in Eastern Country.

395
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:31,170
Sort of like a travel journal.

396
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,270
What do you think?

397
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,830
Love.

398
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,370
War.

399
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,760
There's a stark contrast between

400
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,910
cruelty and romance,

401
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,270
and it creates a huge impact.

402
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,260
I think it's possible.

403
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,140
And there's one more thing

404
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,750
that is very important.

405
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:00,160
What?

406
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,960
Your current self

407
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,900
must be very comfortable with

408
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,460
writing novels of such style,

409
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,300
where inspiration flows effortlessly, right?

410
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,990
Is it that obvious?

411
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,480
No.

412
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,680
Apart from seeing the word "love"

413
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,610
written all over your face the moment I walked in,

414
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,190
there were no other obvious signs.

415
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,670
Mr. Luo...

416
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,430
I'm just curious.

417
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,830
Who was able to

418
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,840
transform the gentle yet resilient Reporter Song

419
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,670
into the person she is today?

420
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,040
I really want to meet him.

421
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,000
Are you trying to hide him?

422
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,750
If you were a woman,

423
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,570
I might just do that.

424
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,050
Maybe he's tired from the team building event today.

425

[10 hours ago]

426
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,640
Whoa, there's one over there.

427
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,490

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,550

What's wrong?

468
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,400
I...

469
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,630
I had a nightmare.

470
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,690
Did I wake you up?

471
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,760
No.

472
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,020
I couldn't sleep,

473
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,280
so I came out to see you.

474
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,330
Are you trying make me sleepy?

475
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,470
What was your dream about?

476
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,680
It's still the same things.

477
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,210
Explosion.

478
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,640
People dying.

479
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:15,320
I often have nightmares like that too.

480
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,510
Then...

481
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,890
what do you do when you have nightmares?

482
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,080
Lie down quietly

483
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,690
and look at the ceiling.

484
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,590
Slowly,

485
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,190
the sun will rise.

486
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,070
But it's different now.

487
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,240
At least now

488
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,910
I have you by my side

489
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,490
to wait for the sunrise.

490
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,430
Ran,

491
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,550
I'll heat up some milk for you.

492
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,030
Perhaps you will feel better

493
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,430
after drinking it.

494
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:33,930
I want to eat the bunny-shaped custard buns too.

495
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,590
Okay.

496
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,780
Wait for me.

497
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,350
I'll prepare it for you.

498
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:42,790
No.

499
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,620
I'll go with you.

500
00:36:59,030 --> 00:36:59,560
It's hot.

501
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,320
This cup of milk will probably cost

502
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,260
600 east dollars in Eastern Country, right?

503
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,760
Shen Bei called me a few days ago.

504
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,190
That's it?

505
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,130
Is there anything else you want to ask?

506
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,230
I don't know...

507
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,880
if I should ask.

508
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,510
My girlfriend

509
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,820
is easily jealous.

510
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,020
I dare not ask carelessly.

511
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,960
Come on.

512
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,840
Shen Bei said

513
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,590
she is very busy in Eastern Country,

514
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,280
and that Sasin and the others

515
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,280
miss us very much.

516
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,370
Ran.

517
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,730
Do you want to go back to Eastern Country?

518
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:33,840
Yes.

519
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
But I dare not.

520
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:43,150
♫She is a white island♫

521
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,440
What about you?

522
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,950
♫The colorful wind rushes past♫

523
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,500
♫Lonely waves, starlit glow♫

524
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,130
♫Quietly leaning together♫

525
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,470
I do.

526
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,300
♫Autumn reflects in the water♫

527
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,920
But I can't.

528
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,900
♫He is a blue sailboat♫

529
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,330
One dares not,

530
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,280
one can't.

531
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,510
♫Sailing alone♫

532
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,510
♫Through the boundless night♫

533
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,510
Look how well we match.

534
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,720
♫His sails dancing in the wind♫

535
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,110
No wonder Yue Lao wanted to bind us together.

536
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,970
♫Silently by her side♫

537
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,070
♫Heading toward her shore♫

538
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,960
Then I hope Yue Lao's thread

539
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,220
can bind us even more tightly,

540
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,700
♫The sky turns a deeper blue♫

541
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,150
and more firmly.

542
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,720
♫The brilliant night♫

543
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,790
So firmly that even though I know

544
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:43,400
♫Has never shone so bright♫

545
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,810
Jiang Lin's death is my fault,

546
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,500
♫A white island♫

547
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,590
it will never snap.

548
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:51,790
♫Blooms in the vast sea♫

549
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,300
♫I wish I could pick it♫

550
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,030
♫And give it to you♫

551
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,210
Why are you here?

552
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,340
I  am preparing to go to the office.

553
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,630
Didn't I ask you to wait for me in the changing room yesterday?

554
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,760
Why did you leave?

555
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,610
You didn't answer my calls

556
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,070
nor reply to my messages.

557
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:39,630
You...

558
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:41,760
Mr. Luo.

559
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,180
I was...

560
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,000
too tired yesterday.

561
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,170
I fell asleep as soon as I came back.

562
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,710
I didn't mean it.

563
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,290
So why are you still going to the office today?

564
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,050
Why don't you visit Dr. Liang?

565
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,830
First you said you couldn't contact me,

566
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,630
then you blame me for appearing in front of you.

567
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,320
You are really quite difficult

568
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,710
to figure out as a boss.

569
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,050
The more at ease you are,

570
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,550
the more I think something's wrong.

571
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,130
I just don't want you

572
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,640
to be more anxious than I am.

573
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,030
I've asked Dr. Liang.

574
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,600
She said I was too impatient.

575
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:44,410
I shouldn't have attended the team building event yesterday.

576
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:45,830
Next time,

577
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,030
I will definitely take your advice.

578
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,030
Li Zan.

579
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,530
If you have something on your mind,

580
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,680
you should tell your family,

581
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,200
or your significant other,

582
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,550
or...

583
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,920
your friends.

584
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:20,360
In any case,

585
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,200
don't keep it to yourself

586
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,280
and bottle it up.

587
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,400
Don't return to work today.

588
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,000
Take a day off to rest at home.

589
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,650
Are you back?
