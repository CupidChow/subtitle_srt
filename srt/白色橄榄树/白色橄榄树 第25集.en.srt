It hasn't changed.

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,550

Why are you so distracted?

201
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,810
Have you seen it before?

202
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,440
Zan.

203
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,160
Do you know

204
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,230
every time I sneak a peek at you?

205
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,670
Every time?

206
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,320
You peek at me a lot?

207
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,430
Why do you like to

208
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,020
peek at me?

209
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,600
I don't know.

210
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
I know some of the times, I guess.

211
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,840
And what do you think about

212
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
in those moments?

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,670
Would you think I'm stupid?

214
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,360
I'd think

215
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,870
I can't let you find out

216
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,000
that I've found out.

217
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,500
What if you don't peek at me again?

218
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,550
How could I?

219
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,750
I want to look at you forever.

220
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,020
It's just...

221
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,640
I don't want to watch cartoons anymore.

222
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,080
Dance with me,

223
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,750
okay?

224
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,720
Dance?

225
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,280
There's no one else here.

226
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,870
No one will laugh at us.

to do all the things we did together

Ben.

252
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,950
Song Ran's mother is seriously ill.

253
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,890
I can't let her handle this alone.

254
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,310
I have to postpone

255
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,069
my visit to Eastern Country for a while.

256
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,069
I'm really sorry.

257
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,890
When Song Ran's mother gets better,

258
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,319
I'll go to Eastern Country immediately.

259
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,990
Take care.

260
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,370
What do you do

261
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,250
when you have a nightmare?

262
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,120
I just lie still

263
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,010
and look at the ceiling.

264
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,880
Slowly,

265
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,620
the sun will rise.

266
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,780
Zan.

267
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,380
I don't want to wake you up.

268
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,350
I'm going to the hospital first.

269
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
Taking care of his girlfriend and their families

270
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,140
is what a man should do.

271
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,760
Zan.

272
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,430
Don't be sorry.

273
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,850
Everything will be okay.

274
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,960
I'll wait for you in Eastern Country.

275
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,640
Take care.

277
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,790
Lately,

278
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
your mother and Li Zan

279
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,510
haven't gotten suspicious, have they?

280
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,880
How do you know

281
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,940
I didn't tell them?

282
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,310
You told them?

283
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,590
No.

284
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,050
The result is not out yet.

285
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,880
I don't want them

286
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,110
to worry with me.

287
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,120
I've made up my mind.

288
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,260
I'll arrange it.

289
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,980
Even if I'll go blind,

290
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,410

You don't have to comfort me.

I know what to do.

295

It's just by then,

296
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,930
I will definitely

297
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,170
need your help.

298
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,130

300
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,470
Good news.

301
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,800
There's a cure for

302
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,510
the bacteria you're infected with.

303
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,710
It's very effective.

304
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,600
You...

305
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,530
I don't have to go blind,

306
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,930
right?

307
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,500
Yes.

308
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:49,910
Song Ran.

309
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,410
Are you coming to Eastern Country?

310
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,250
What?

311
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,750
Me?

312
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,590
No, I'm not.

313
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,030
Why?

314
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,510
I saw

315
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,030
Li Zan's name

316
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,290
on the volunteer list.

317
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,970
So,

318
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:08,880
I thought

319
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,270
you would come with him.

320
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,820
Song Ran.

321
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,560
Why aren't you saying anything?

322
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,430
Did you two

323
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,080
have a fight?

324
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,060
What are you talking about?

325
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,730
We didn't.

326
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,780
It's just my mom is sick.

327
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,470
I have to stay in Dicheng to take care of her.

328
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,830
Your mother is sick?

329
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,790
Is it serious?

330
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,590
It's lung cancer.

331
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,090
But she's gotten much better.

332
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,170
The doctor said

333
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,850
it's quite hopeful.

334
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,330
That's a relief.

335
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,000
I really don't want

336
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,920
anyone around me

337
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,850
to encounter any accidents again.

338
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,390
What?

339
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,270
What did you just say?

340
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,730
I didn't hear you clearly.

341
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,920
Nothing.

342
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,810
I was just saying...

343
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,020
I kind of miss you.

344
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,370
You...

345
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,680
You know,

346
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,090
in Eastern Country,

347
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,530
everything is quite hard.

348
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,400
I was just lamenting to you.

349
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,330
Is that not okay?

350
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,640
I didn't mean it's not okay.

351
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,900
I have something to do.

352
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,420
Since you're not coming this time,

353
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,680
I'll hang up now.

354
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,720
Let's talk

355
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,790
when you come next time.

356
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,590
Bye.

357
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,830
How I wish you could come.

358
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,940
At least

359
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,790
there would be someone

360
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,110
to cry with.

361
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,160
Ran.

362
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,640
Ran.

363
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,030
I overslept.

364
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,070
I saw your note when I woke up.

365
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:50,960
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,680
Zan.

367
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,290
Did you pass

368
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,760
the EOD qualification test?

369
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,550
I passed half of it.

370
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,490
I passed the demining test.

371
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
You saw it.

372
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,830
As for the bomb disposal test,

373
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,840
I haven't passed it yet.

374
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,950
When you say you haven't passed it,

375
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,770
do you mean you didn't take the test, or you failed?

376
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,530
Then why are you going to Eastern Country?

377
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,340
I didn't investigate you.

378
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,720
Shen Bei just called

379
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,790
and said she saw your name

380
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,050
on the list of volunteers for this batch.

381
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,310
Benjamin called me and said that...

382
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,090
As for Zoro's death,

383
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,750
I should still keep it

384
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,130
from Ran for now.

385
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:15,950
He said

386
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,890
Eastern Country's situation was really bad.

387
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,510
You know how he is.

388
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,880
He wouldn't have called me

389
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,430
if it weren't really that bad.

390
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,500
So?

391
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,050
So I want to go back to Eastern Country

392
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,820
and see if I can do something more for them.

393
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,120
I know.

394
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,400
Of course I know.

395
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,030
But you already did it.

396
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,510
You've already done a lot.

397
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,210
You haven't fully recovered yet.

398
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,830
Do you know how dangerous it will be

399
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,630
if you go to Eastern Country now?

400
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,550
Do you have to

401
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,550
die in Eastern Country

402
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,000
to fulfill your duty?

403
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,240
Besides,

404
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,040
our situation is different now.

405
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,240
My mom's illness,

406
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,030
and my own...

407
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,580
My own state.

408
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,550
I'm almost breaking down.

409
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,520
Everything

410
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,080
has finally gotten better,

411
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,270
and now you're going to risk your life in Eastern Country again?

412
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,440
Why would you do that?

413
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,200
Do you know

414
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,460
how dangerous that is?

415
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,880
Do you know exactly

416
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,000
what you're doing?

417
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,490
Ran.

418
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,730
I know

419
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,200
it's been a tough time

420
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,510
for you

421
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,980
to hold on by yourself.

422
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,680
So I definitely

423
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,000
won't let you

424
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,750
face your mother's illness alone.

425
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,680
I've told Benjamin that

426
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,210
I'll postpone my trip to Eastern Country.

427
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,130
Postpone?

428
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,400
Until when?

429
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,010
When your mom's targeted therapy is over.

430
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,620
And then?

431
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,860
You will still go after that,

432
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,200
right?

433
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,740
Ran.

434
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,680
Over the past six months,

435
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,000
I've been working really hard

436
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,550
every day

437
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,110
to make myself better

438
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,680
and stronger.

439
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
Trust me.

440
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,170
I'll make it.

441
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,100
I promise

442
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,950
nothing will happen to me, okay?

443
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,390
I will be very careful.

444
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,960
I won't risk my...

445
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,790
When did you

446
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,680
decide to go?

447
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,040
Last month.

448
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,120
Last month?

449
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,070
Were you going to keep me in the dark

450
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,530
until you got on the plane?

451
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,810
It's such a big deal,

452
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,400
yet you never even thought about

453
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,660
discussing it with me.

454
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,830
I've thought about it.

455
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,030
Many times.

456
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,730
But I didn't know how to say it.

457
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,780
Even if you told me,

458
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,840
you'd still go

459
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,480
whether I agreed or not,

460
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,910
right?

461
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,550
Ran.

462
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,750
I must go.

463
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,340
The hole in my heart

464
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:28,690
can only be filled by going back to Eastern Country.

465
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,030
With this hole in me,

466
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,110
not only am I an invalid,

467
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,110
I'll also drag you

468
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,830
into the abyss with me.

469
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,260
Yes.

470
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,860
Since you must go,

471
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,820
don't postpone it.

472
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,720
Li Zan won't go back

473
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,810
on what he decided.

474
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,030
And I won't be the one to hold you back.

475
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,830
My mom's condition

476
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,820
is basically stable now.

477
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,400
I should be able to handle it

478
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,460
by myself.

479
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,750
They should have

480
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,280
bought you a ticket, right?

481
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,400
When is the flight?

482
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,910
Today.

483
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,160
I left in a hurry and didn't say goodbye properly to your mom.

484
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,960
Please help me explain it to her.

485
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,160
It's okay.

486
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,530
Be careful.

487
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,550
Okay.

488
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,400
I will.

489
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,960
It'll be a long journey.

490
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,060
Have a good rest.

491
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,060
I will.

492
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,290
Have a safe trip.

00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,560
This bomb disposer

585
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,960
was shot in the head

586
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,930
by those bastards' sniper fire

587
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,100
and died.

588
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,030

589
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,770

I'll leave you to it.

592
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,070
I'll come see you in a bit.

593
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,590
Okay.

594

Do you know how dangerous it will be

595
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,830
if you go to Eastern Country now?

596
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,920
Do you have to

597
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,690
die in Eastern Country

598
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,960
to fulfill your duty?

599
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,310
Let me.
