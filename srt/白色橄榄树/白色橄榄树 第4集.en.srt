4
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,390
You're not what you seem.

5
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,770
What's different?

6
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,310
What does he mean?

7
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,950
Buy some apples.

8
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,460
Hey beautiful girl,

9
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,829
do you need some apples?

10
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,770
It's very good.

11
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,260
It's super delicious,

12
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,060
and very good.

13
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,440
How much is the apple?

14
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,630
240 dollars.

15
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,160
Can you make it a bit cheaper?

16
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:35,910
No, no.

17
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,590
Sorry, I can't.

18
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,050
It's sold for 800 at Gamma.

19
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,890
Okay.

20
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,920
I'll pick a few.

21
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,960
I'll be back in a moment.

22
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,730
Reporter Song, you must be rich.

23
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,520
It's you,

24
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,470
Benjamin.

25
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,430
Reporter Song, you're young and pretty.

26
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,310
That's enough to attract a lot of attention.

27
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,340
Now, you're even showing off your wealth.

28
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,730
Where do you even live

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,760
in a place as dangerous as Uglai City?

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,420
Let me send you home.

31
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,080
It's safer.

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you for your kindness.

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,750
But...

34
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
I live right here.

35
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,680
You've already done the favor.

36
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,280
Thank you.

37
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,560
I'll be honest.

38
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,130
Don't waste your time on me.

39
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,280
I prefer a man who can farm

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,250
to a man who can shoot guns.

41
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,170
Well,

42
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,400
then consider this as

43
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,690
my payment for sending you to your hotel.

44
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,090
What a thief.

45
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,820
What are you talking about,

46
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,380
you brat?

47
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,900
I said mercenaries are all thieves.

48
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,450
Risking your life to make money isn't enough,

49
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,850
now you're stealing too.

50
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:32,560
How shameless.

51
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,490
Give it back to Reporter Song.

52
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,560
Why are you always targeting the mercenaries?

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,890
Aren't we mercenaries hired by your country?

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,830
If your country is powerful enough,

55
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,560
you wouldn't have to invite us.

56
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,050
There's nothing to be proud of.

57
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,040
Aren't we selling our lives to protect your people,

58
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,940
your country,

59
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,340
and also yourself?

60
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,790
I don't know what's there to be ashamed of.

61
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,900
As for this apple...

62
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,750
As for this apple,

63
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I am interested to hear how you will explain yourself.

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,260
It just fell on the ground,

65
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,240
and I happened to pick it up.

66
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,210
I was even wondering if...

67
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,480
I should send it personally to your room.

68
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,320
It appears to me that

69
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,640
this apple didn't fell to the ground,

70
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,670
but instead landed in your hands.

71
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,040
Otherwise, how come

72
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,640
there aren't any scratches?

73
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,510
Sasin.

74
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,260
Reporter Song is not only pretty,

75
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,420
but also very smart.

76
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,010
It's just a pity.

77
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,270
Why does she seem so close to that guy?

78
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,970
What's the matter, Ben?

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,780
Why are you still standing there after being rejected?

80
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,240
Come on.

81
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,440
Let's go have a drink.

82
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,920
I won't go.

83
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,360
I still have things to do.

84
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,930
Don't be angry anymore.

85
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,460
You don't have to take Benjamin seriously.

86
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,310
I'm just mad at myself.

87
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,600
I'm mad at myself for being useless.

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,130
I'm mad that my country is not strong enough.

89
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,330
I'm mad at that guy...

90
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,480
for actually making some sense.

91
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm fine.

92
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,690
Reporter Song.

93
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,580
You should go back first.

94
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,390
Okay.

95
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,590
That chap is being sneaky.

96
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,040
He must be up to no good.

97
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,670
Keep it for yourself.

98
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,680
No need.

99
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,920
I bought it specially for you.

100
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,070
They're all your favorites.

101
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,670
Have them.

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
Where did he get that

103
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,960
bag of fruits

104
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,310
to please that lady?

105
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,770
And yet, he acts all upright every day?

106
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,679
You don't have to speak like me.

107
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,030
Just be yourself.

108
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,840
I'm a reporter,

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,570
so I play a more secondary role.

110
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,309
You're the protagonist.

111
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,480
Hold on.

112
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,670
What's wrong?

113
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,030
Should I look at the camera

114
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,500
or should I look at you?

115
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,710
Either works.

116
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,410
I think I'll look at you.

117
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Don't be nervous.

118
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
Just talk to me like you normally would.

119
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,160
He saw me embarrass myself,

120
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,800
but was smiling instead.

[Sent]

122
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,630
As a volunteer,

123
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,480
my main task

124
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
is to train Eastern Country's soldiers on

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,510
demining and bomb disposal techniques.

126
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,710
So, my main area of activity is in the backend operations.

127
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,750
But...

128
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,600
She's with Li Zan every day?

129
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,080
The situation here is complicated.

130
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,550
No.

131
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,320
I can't let her get the advantage.

132
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,600
Coming.

133
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,040
Rina?

134
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,960
Come in.

135
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,550
Song.

136
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,030
These are fruits my son gave me.

137
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,080
It's delicious.

138
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,960
Try it.

139
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,250
Reporter Song.

140
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,150
You should go back first.

141
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,510
Okay.

142
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,470
My son sent me this photo today.

143
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,200
Look.

144
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,920
He won an award at school.

145
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,650
Your son

146
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,790
is Sasin?

147
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,840
Do we have to be so careful

148
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,960
every time we meet?

149
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm here to see my mother,

150
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,830
and not some secret lover.

151
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,050
If people find out

152
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,560
you have a mother like me,

153
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,640
it will affect you.

154
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,910
Besides,

155
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,360
your dad doesn't want us to meet.

156
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,030
If he finds out,

157
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,310
he will be very angry.

158
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
I don't care.

159
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,550
But I do.

160
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,760
If you want to continue your studies when you return,

161
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,420
you'll have to rely on your father financially.

162
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,920
This is...

163
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,280
the award from last time?

164
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,600
Today is Mother's Day.

165
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,660
It's my gift to you.

166
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,420
Song,

167
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,720
can you not tell anyone

168
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,990
about my relationship with Sasin?

169
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,510
Okay.

170
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,120
May I ask why?

171
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,760
When I was young,

172
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,470
I was with Sasin's father,

173
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,780
but he married someone else later.

174
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,490
My family is very poor.

175
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,750
It's normal

176
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,510
where I'm from.

177
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,670
But...

178
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,300
Sasin’s father won't let us see each other.

179
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,390
He's afraid that I'll affect him.

180
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:17,860
No.

181
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,670
His father did the right thing.

182
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,610
In Eastern Country,

183
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,390
I will embarrass Sasin.

184
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,840
If

185
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,480
the others find out

186
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,280
that his mom is a waitress,

187
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,000
people will look down on him.

188
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,580
Sasin is very nice to me.

189
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,390
He comes to see me every now and then.

190
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,450
I miss very much him too.

191
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,000
Song,

192
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,120
can you

193
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,440
not tell others about this?

194
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,760
This is a private matter between you and Sasin.

195
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,310
I will keep it a secret for you.

196
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,040
However,

197
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,080
I don't think it's shameful

198
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,410
for Sasin to have a mother like you.

199
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,880
I feel that those who think so

200
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,120
should change their old-fashioned views.

201
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,840
Thank you,

202
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,390
Song.

203
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,680
What you said is just like what Sasin said.

204
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,860
It's hard...

205
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,930
to expect change.

206
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,850
Our country

207
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,840
is different from yours.

208
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,630
W-We're very backward.

209
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,330
Come in.

210
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,000
This is...

211
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,170
Song Ran sent it back from Eastern Country.

212
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,110
I think the next topic

213
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,870
should be Song Ran's.

214
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,600
I've watched these videos several times.

215
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,790
I have to admit that

216
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,500
she did better than me.

217
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,600
Also,

218
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,560
Director,

219
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:45,990
I want to

220
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,070
apply to go to Eastern Country.

221
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,200
Song.

222
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,250
My mom said

223
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,070
you promised to keep the secret for us yesterday.

224
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,300
She asked me to take you

225
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,810
to Uglai City's monthly market

226
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,540
to thank you.

227
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
This market mainly sells

228
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,260
life's necessities.

229
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,660
You can barter too.

230
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,070
It's filled with Eastern Country's charms.

231
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,800
What do you want to look at first?

232
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,370
Or if you have any requests,

233
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,510
you can tell me.

234
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,430
I don't want to visit this market

235
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,490
as a tourist.

236
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,450
I want to know

237
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,470
their most authentic lives.

238
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,380
Can I?

239
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,030
Sure.

240
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,490
But you have to listen to me.

241
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,010
Put the camera away.

242
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,390
They won't open their hearts

243
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,790
to someone who only wants

244
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,940
to take photos.

245
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,360
When I put my camera away,

246
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,070
I realized

247
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
that I was

248
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,690
just a bystander before.

249
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,950
Perhaps, like Sasin said...

250
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,800
Like all foreign reporters,

251
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,270
I'm more like a recorder.

252
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,200
I was trying to record their desperate circumstances,

253
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,660
observe their hardships,

254
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,880
and even pity

255
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:24,730
or sympathize with them.

256
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,760
But I've never truly

257
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,510
walked into their lives.

258
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,370
So, I could never

259
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,510
empathize

260
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,000
with their despair.

261
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,120
When our Eastern Country trip is over,

262
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
we can still go home

263
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
and live happily.

264
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,030
That's all.

265
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,030
But today,

266
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,830
after I had temporarily forgotten

267
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,380
my job and identity,

268
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,830
I seemed to be able to

269
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,670
empathize with them more.

270

[Eastern Country's language]

271
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,510
What does she mean?

272
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,210
There is a saying in Eastern Country

273
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,340
that when people reach a certain age,

274
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,000
they can communicate with spirits.

275
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,530
We call them old immortals.

276
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,310
If these old immortals meet

277
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,480
their fated ones,

278
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,350
they will give or sell

279
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,350
something

280
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:52,970
to them.

281
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,110
This old woman

282
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,840
wants to sell something to you.

seeds of white olive trees.

286
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,770
Olive trees

287
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,750
have always been regarded as the symbol of peace.

288
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,660
But in Eastern Country...

289
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,240
Have you noticed?

290
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,690
Many places in Eastern Country

291
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,350
experience heavy sand and dust,

292
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,250
so the olive trees here

293
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
all seem to be covered with dust.

294
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,750
They look dirty.

295
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,310
Apart from protecting peace,

296
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:12,960
olive trees have another meaning.

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,480
Thank you.

350
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,730
♫Blossom and travel far♫

351
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,070
Will my wish...

352
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:30,300
come true?

353
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,190
Song,

354
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,130
many things these old immortals said

355
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,090
have come true.

356
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,670
Someone who only knows about drinking,

357
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,640
flirting with girls,

358
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,900
and fighting for money

359
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,130
won't understand even if you explain.

360
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,110
Brat.

361
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,090
At least I'm responsible for my actions.

362
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:54,270
I'm better than people like you

363
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,330
who don't admit what you secretly do.

364
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

365
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,830
Fine.

366
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,420
Then I'll tell everyone

367
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,450
what nonsense I'm talking about.

368
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,360
Who's the petite waitress

369
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,110
you met secretly at Roya Hotel?

370
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,330
What did you do after hiding inside

371
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,590
the storage closet?

372
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,820
Reporter Song.

373
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,240
Tell me.

374
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,680
Am I talking nonsense?

375
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,560
Or did he do something shady?

376
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,150
Benjamin.

377
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,120
Don't talk nonsense.

378
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,200
It's not what you think.

379
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,110
It's not what I think?

380
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,570
I saw it with my own eyes.

381
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,580
Reporter Song.

382
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,750
Don't be fooled

383
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,030
by his innocent appearance.

384
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,720
Shut up!

385
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,180
If you talk about my mom again,

386
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,710
I will...

387
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:49,680
I...

388
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,350
Mom?

389
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,460
You're lying.

390
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,590
Why do you have to sneakily meet your mom?

391
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,440
It's true.

392
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,280
Stop talking about it.

393
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,920
He has his reasons

394
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,070
for not wanting to talk about it.

395
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,070
Ridiculous.

396
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,130
Any reason would be absurd.

397
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,170
You don't even dare to see your mom openly.

398
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,900
You don't deserve to have a mom.

399
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,340
Are you okay?

400
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:30,480
I'm fine.

401
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,300
Why is that guy so flustered?

402
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,160
Reporter Song.

403
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,900
Can I borrow your camera?

404
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,030
It's a bomb.

405
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,750
Looks like they want to drive the car over

406
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,950
and detonate it in a crowded place.

407
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,400
Shit.

408
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm off today.

409
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:34,910
I forgot my gun.

410
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:35,880
Ben.

411
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,230
What about you?

412
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,370
Do I look like I have a gun to you?

413
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,640
You are

414
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,700
useless.

415
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,640
I saw a garrison pavilion

416
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,040
at the east of the market.

417
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
I'll ask for help.

418
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,220
You are a civilian.

419
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,510
The garrison won't listen to you.

420
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,000
Ben,

421
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,970
go with him.

422
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,290
Leave this place to me.

423
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,200
I'll help you.

424
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,660
Are you kidding me?

425
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,880
You're not a soldier.

426
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,590
Take care of Reporter Song.

427
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,680
Don't cause me any trouble.

428
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
You can't do it alone.

429
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,010
Him?

430
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,800
I can handle two more.

431
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,430
You can handle the man,

432
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,970
but what about the bomb?

433
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Fine.

434
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,400
I'll handle the man.

435
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
The bomb is yours.

436
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,380
Remember.

437
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,530
Be careful.

438
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,730
Don't act tough.

439
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,910
Reporter Song.

440
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,980
Hide somewhere safe.

441
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,820
Be careful.

442
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,610
What's wrong?

443
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,240
This building has been abandoned for a long time.

444
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,190
The rooftop window should be sealed shut.

445
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh no.

446
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,130
Wait here for me.

447
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,390
He has a gun.

448
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,270
Run!

449
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,680
Are you crazy?

450
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,580
Using a stone to hit a sniper?

451
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,490
Are you trying to get killed?

452
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,900
Your arm.

453
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,310
Stay here and don't move.

454
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,410
If you move again,

455
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,720
I'll kill you myself.

456
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,480
This way!

457
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,790
Come on. Here!

458
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,430
Retreat!

459
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,140
Quickly, this way!

460
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,760
We can't let them hit the bomb.

461
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,180
How long can you resist?

462
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,410
It's a double detonation system.

463
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,340
There's no time.

464
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,240
Zan!

465
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,950
What are you doing?

466
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,970
How are things?

467
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,930
This bomb is a double detonation system.

468
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,260
It's a bit complicated.

469
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,400
But I can solve it.

470
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,960
I just need some time.

471
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,140
You disperse the crowd first.

472
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,140
They need to be at least 50 meters away.

473
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,540
You...

474
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,110
Don't you trust me?

475
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,510
Don't waste time.

476
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,120
Go disperse the crowd.

477
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,489
Is that Zan in the car?

478
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,770
What is he doing?

479
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,139
Zan!

480
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,600
Zan!

481
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
Zan!

482
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,730
Zan.

483
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,110
Come on. This way.

484
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,630
Get him inside!

485
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,630
Get away.

486
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,230
Has anyone seen Instructor Li?

487
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,330
No, you can't go in.

488
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:46,850
Who?

489
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,920
Instructor Li,

490
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,710
Li Zan.

491
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,360
The one who just defused the bomb.

492
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,090
He's in the hospital.

493
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,230
Zan.

494
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,610

It must be because Reporter Song

got scared by the blood on me.

523
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:17,930
♫Let me guess♫

524
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,040
♫Have you ever walked into♫

525
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,320
You know,

526
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,350
girls have never seen this kind of scene.

527
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,960
♫The castle you built for me♫

528
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,710
It's understandable

529
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,260
that she's emotional.

530
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:29,510
♫And disappeared at dawn♫

531
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,210
I'll take Reporter Song

532
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,560
to get some fresh air.

533
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,760
Okay.

534
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,220
♫Let me guess, have you ever walked into♫

535
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,120
Can I?

536
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,610
♫The castle you built for me♫

537
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,190
♫And disappeared at dawn♫

538
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,190
Wipe it.

539
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,550
Thank you.

540
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:14,210
I used the corpse of a rioter

541
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,430
to push down the detonation system.

542
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,020
So...

543
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,860
I'm fine.

544
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,080
The Li Zan I know

545
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,860
is always confident and calm.

546
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,570
The expression on his face

547
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,500
right now

548
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,500
is one I've never seen before.

549
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,040
I'm fine.

550
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:49,860
It's a kind of dejection

551
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,250
that subtly stabs at my heart.

552
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,600
I'm fine too.

553
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,600
I mean just now.

554
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,710
Just now...

555
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,630
I was fine.

556
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,250
Have you experienced

557
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,310
something like this before?

558
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,310
I've only seen this on TV before.

559
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,240
This was my first time experiencing it in person.

560
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,430
I'm still shocked.

561
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,990
I experienced it last time I came here.

562
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,970
But no matter how many times

563
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,390
you experience something like this,

564
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,410
you can never get used to it.

565
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:19,880
Song,

566
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:20,970
Instructor Li.

567
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,510
Sasin.

568
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,420
I heard a bomb was found in Roya Hotel.

569
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,680
My mom is still there.

570
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:32,640
What's happening?

571
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,840
Why's everyone running out?

572
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,320
There's a bomb inside. Don't mill around.

573
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,480
It's dangerous!

574
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,880
Excuse me.

575
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,760
Have you seen Rina?

576
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,800
Rina is in charge of

577
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,510
the VIP floors,

578
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,110
but I didn't see her come out.

579
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,630
I'll go ask Ben

580
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,640
if he needs help.

581
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,230
I'll help Sasin find Rina.
