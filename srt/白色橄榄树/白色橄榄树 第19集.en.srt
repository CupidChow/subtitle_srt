4
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,780
Aren't you tired following me every day?

5
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,040
I...

6
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,370
Can't you walk faster?

7
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,860
Well,

8
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,590
I heard there's a new milk tea shop next door.

9
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,840
I heard it tastes good.

10
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,750
Let's try it.

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,710
No.

12
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,840
We're men. Why would we drink milk tea?

13
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,680
Fine.

14
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,610
Why can't men drink milk tea?

15
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,310
Mr. Li!

16
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,010
Why are you here?

17
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,460
I came to look for you

18
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,390
after receiving your message.

19
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,090
Let's go.

20
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,510
Milk tea's

21
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,300
on me.

22
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,470
It's weird for two men to drink milk tea together

23
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,610
but not for

24
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,940
three men, right?

25
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,720
Let's go.

26
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,030
Mr. Li treats you so well.

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,040
He cares about you and protects you.

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,080
I envy you.

29
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,120
Do I not protect you?

30
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,430
How about

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,610
take Mr. Li as your godbrother?

32
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,200
You won't lose anything.

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,329
He's handsome and an engineer.

34
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:18,770
He's nice to you too.

35
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,430
Why do you have so many weird ideas?

36
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,290
How is that a weird idea?

37
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,710
Mr. Li, please be the judge.

38
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,040
What's wrong?

39
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,579
I asked Jiang Yu to acknowledge you as his godbrother.

40
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,300
He said it's a weird idea.

41
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,650
What do you think?

42
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,450
Being a brother

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,079
isn't just about buying milk tea

44
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,040
and beating up some hooligans.

45
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,950
You adults are so troublesome.

46
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:18,880
I'm done.

47
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,779
Let's go.

48
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,779
Didn't you say you don't like milk tea?

49
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,950
You drank so fast.

50
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,350
I...

51
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,810
Was thirsty.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Can't I?

53
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,050
Jiang Yu.

54
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,240
Wait for me.

55
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,150
I have something for you.

56
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,090
Jiang Yu.

57
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,290
This basketball

58
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,520
is for you.

59
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,390
It's in addition to that coat.

60
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,890
Hope you like it.

61
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,510
Mr. Li, you're awesome.

62
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,240
It's signed by Burdick!

63
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,510
Wow...

64
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,870
I...

65
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,560
I don't know

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
how to describe you.

67
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,000
I...

68
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,260
Thank you.

69
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,510
Well,

70
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,060
let's go play basketball.

71
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,450
It'll be a big hit today.

72
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,440
You're welcome.

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,610
I'm back, Ran.

74
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,040
If you have something on your mind,

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,550
tell your family,

76
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,050
lover,

77
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,510
or friends.

78
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,630
Anyway,

79
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,040
don't keep it to yourself.

80
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,190
So soon?

81
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,970
I see.

82
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,120
Thank you.

83
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,310
Bye.

84
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,120
Zan!

85
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,030
Zan.

86
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,630
You're back.

87
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,000
So early.

88
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,460
Ran.

89
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,790
I have something to tell you.

90
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,300
I also have good news for you.

91
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:20,710
You go first.

92
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,340
Mine isn't that important.

93
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,360
You go first.

94
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,880
What good news is it?

95
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,660
You guessed right.

96
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,600
Dicheng's column

97
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
chose my plan.

98
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,430
They even asked me to take part in the shooting.

99
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,630
And

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,159
there's a good pay to it.

101
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,170
I knew

102
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,260
they would choose you.

103
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,610
They have the same good taste as me.

104
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,680
Yes.

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,960
You're so right.

106
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,480
Old immortal.

107
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,159
Really?

108
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,070
Let me see

109
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,440
how old I am.

110
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,800
Let's see if I can do 200 benchpresses.

111
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,870
Not old at all.

112
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,220
I was wrong.

113
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,800
You're not an old immortal.

114
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,430
But an amazing boyfriend.

115
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,310
Yeah, right.

116
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,660
You're not sincere at all.

117
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,530
What were you going to say?

118
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,750
It's nothing.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,430
It's nothing important.

120
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,640
Oh, right.

121
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,740
However,

122
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,600
they asked me to go to Dicheng as soon as possible.

123
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,420
Also,

124
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,760
I have to be there for a while.

125
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,800
This is what you like.

126
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,560
Go ahead.

127
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,330
Anyway,

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,240
it's very convenient with high-speed trains.

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,170
I can go look for you every weekend.

130
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,920
Really?

131
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,720
But

132
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,920
wouldn't it be tiring

133
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,840
for you to go back and forth?

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,070
Not at all.

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,870
Didn't you say

136
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,330
I'm an amazing boyfriend?

137
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,920
I can't say it no matter how tiring it might be.

138
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,910
Besides, if I go look for you,

139
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,190
I get a reward, right?

140
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,310
I will reward you right now.

141
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,530
Are you bringing this?

142
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,390
Booked.

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,620
For tomorrow morning.

144
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,510
By the way,

145
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,940
what did you want to tell me just now?

146
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,430
It's nothing.

147
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,120
I...

148
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,090
I was going to tell you that I'm going on a business trip.

149
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,910
Now you're going to Dicheng,

150
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,280
I don't need to report about it.

151
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,150
That's not right.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,260
You have to report to me

153
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,200
even if I'm in Dicheng.

154
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,150
Okay.

155
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,590
I'll put the charger cable in this bag for you.

156
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay.

157
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,460
[Entrance]

158
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,490
Wait for me here.

159
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,970
Bring two bottles of water with you.

160
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,530
One is enough.

161
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,280
It's dry in the trains.

162
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,800
It's a four to five hour trip.

163
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,100
All right.

164
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,440

After you entered the gantry.

209

Thank god I could use my passport as a ticket.

210

Otherwise, I wouldn't have made it in time.

211
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,880

213

214

and took a half day off.

215
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,730
So that I can go there with you first

216
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,220
and come back on Sunday.

217

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,700
I don't want to stay at home.

220

Let's stay in a hotel.

221
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,850
My mom is scary.

222
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,680
I didn't prepare this time.

223
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,240
It's better not to see her.

224
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,130
Being at home

225
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,890
will make us uneasy.

226

We've been together for so long.

231

But every time he kisses me,

232
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,990
or even if we are just holding hands,

233
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,340
my heart races for no reason.

234
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,020

to all these places with you.

347
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,990
Not just those below the red line.

348
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,100
Aren't you bored?

349
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,980
What are you doing?

350
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,390
I'm taking a walk.

351
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,690
I'm not bored.

352
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,650
I just like walking around.

353
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,460
Song Ran.

354
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,770
I have to go.

355
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,110
My colleague is calling me.

356
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,590
Okay.

357
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,910
Go back to work.

358
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,560
Ran?

359
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,060
Is that Song Ran?

360
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,960
It can't be that coincidental.

361
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,040
Taking a walk in the hospital?

362
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,880
I hope he isn't lying to Song Ran.

363
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,840
I have to ask you.

364
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,550
We can come here often in the future.

365
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,510
Hello.

366
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,110
Come here.

367
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,030
This way. Have a seat.

368
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,590
We're waiting for you.

369
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,270
Have a seat.

370
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,790
Who is this?

371
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,510
This is my boyfriend.

372
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,000
Li Zan.

373
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,410
Hello, everyone.

374
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,750
Sorry for being late.

375
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,730
It's okay.

376
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,000
Come, have a seat.

377
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,850
Why do I feel

378
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,730
Mr. Li looks familiar?

379
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,190
It's too late now.

380
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,140
He's already Song Ran's boyfriend.

381
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,670
What are you talking about?

382
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,110
Is Mr. Li

383
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,170
the volunteer Song Ran interviewed?

384
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,680
It's him?

385
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,140
Yes.

386
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,560
Just call me Li Zan.

387
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
See?

388
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,130
Right, it's him.

389
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,810
See?

390
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,400
No wonder Song Ran produced such a good program.

391
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,680
So there's a trick to it.

392
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,700
We weren't together at that time.

393
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,200
Even if

394
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,680
you weren't together,

395
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,160
did you already like him?

396
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,060
It's earlier than that.

397
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,170
Was it love at first sight?

398
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,350
Right?

399
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,440
Bingo.

400
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,870
I did fall in love with Zan

401
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,590
at first sight.

402
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,360
Ladies here,

403
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,290
learn from Song Ran.

404
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,540
Look at Song Ran.

405
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,730
She's so open minded,

406
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:03,590
hides nothing,

407
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,060
and is not pretentious at all.

408
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,580
No wonder Li Zan likes her.

409
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,120
I don't think it was just

410
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,360
love at first sight,

411
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,440
but also a two-way crush.

412
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,710
You're definitely more right.

413
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,180
It was a two-way crush.

414
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,750
I love it.

415
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,660
Li Zan.

416
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,200
Where do you work now?

417
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,050
Volunteering

418
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,670
is just your side job, right?

419
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,950
I majored in explosives engineering.

420
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,130
I'm now working at Hengsheng Construction

421
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,260
in Liangcheng.

422
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,710
Explosives engineering?

423
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,030
That sounds amazing.

424
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,040
I've never heard of it before.

425
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,910
There are many things you haven't heard of.

426
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,290
This is a good major.

427
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,430
It sounds manly.

428
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,110
It's really unique.

429
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,320
Li Zan,

430
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,670
if Song Ran decides

431
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,430
to stay in our TV station,

432
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,910
you'll be in a long-distance relationship.

433
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,550
No.

434
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,260
If Ran wants to stay here,

435
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,220
I'll ask my company

436
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,810
to transfer me to the branch here in Dicheng.

437
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,070
She should decide based on her interests

438
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,060
and worry about nothing else.

439
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,610
Gosh, I'm jealous.

440
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,190
So manly.

441
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,670
Don't just sit around.

442
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,990
Let's drink.

443
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,140
Cheers.

444
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:23,580
Congratulations.

445
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,560
Congratulations, Ran.

446
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,390
Okay, come on.

447
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,280
Cheers.

448
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,880
I'm in Liangcheng.

449
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,400
Reply me after you're

450
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,720
done with work.

451
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,350
I'll wait for you.

452
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,800
Ms. Fu.

453
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,270
Jiang Yu?

454
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,640
You're still here at this hour?

455
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,440
What's wrong?

456
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:06,510
I...

457
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,570
I have something to discuss with you.

458
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,550
Can you ask Li Zan to come

459
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,180
for the parents' meeting in a few days?

460
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,580
My grandparents are old.

461
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,270
It's inconvenient for them to come.

462
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,160
Also...

463
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,270
Also I have been doing well

464
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,790
academically lately,

465
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,660
I don't think there will be any criticisms of me.

466
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,410
I don't think you have anything

467
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,720
you want to tell my guardians in particular too, right?

468
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,310
So...

469
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,790
All right.

470
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,690
Your situation is special.

471
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,830
You did do well recently.

472
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,920
Consider it a reward.

473
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,620
Thank you, Ms. Fu.

474
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,270
Do you want me to inform Mr. Li?

475
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,080
No need!

476
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:49,450
I'll tell him myself.

477
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,920
He will be there on time.

478
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,830
Thank you.

479
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:52,750
Goodbye.

480
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,510
Bye.

481
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,530
Are you free?

482
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,870
Ms. Fu asked me to ask you

483
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,270
if you have time to participate

484
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,200
in my parents' meeting in two days?

485
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,400
She's afraid that my grandparents might not understand

486
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,250
some of the things she has to say.

487
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,580
So she told me to ask you.

488
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,250
Don't feel obliged to come.

489
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,420
I told Ms. Fu

490
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,750
that it's not like you're my guardian.

491
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,810
You have no obligation to attend such a boring meeting.

492
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,950
I'm just passing on my message.

493
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,410
Just tell me if you're busy.

494
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Don't feel uncomfortable to say so.

495
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,890
Jiang Yu, what’s did you come up with?

496
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,700
Sure.

497
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,730
Send me the time.

498
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,320
I'll be there on time.

499
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,250
See you at 4 p.m. on Friday.

500
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:30,760
[Five days later]

501
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,680
Ms. Fu said

502
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,710
you've improved the most.

503
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,730
Especially in English.

504
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:44,730
Your spoken English and listening are good.

505
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,170
She can see that you've worked hard.

506
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,410
I made great progress not to get praises.

507
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,610
Why did you work so hard

508
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,730
to learn English?

509
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,420
Why do you ask when you know?

510
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,260
You want to go to Eastern Country?

511
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,690
I'm curious

512
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,010
what kind of place

513
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,110
Jiang Lin wants to take me to.

514
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,340
I want to see Jiang Lin too.

515
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,100
I want to thank him face to face.

516
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,270
And also say sorry.

517
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,290
I know

518
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,850
he's gone.

519
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,040
He can't hear anything I say.

520
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,680
I'm just comforting myself.

521
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,830
That's why I want to go.

522
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,270
He risked his life

523
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,970
for Eastern Country.

524
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,110
I want to see

525
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,000
what I can do

526
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,480
to do

527
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,480
what he hasn't completed.

528
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,940
I'm his brother after all.

529
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,070
Jiang Yu.

530
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,750
That's surprising.

531
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Stop.

532
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,050
Don't praise me.

533
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,240
You know

534
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,510
how I was before.

535
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,650
I've never seen

536
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,320
any of Jiang Lin's friends.

537
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,680
When you came to look for me,

538
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,260
I even suspected you were a liar.

539
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,540
But now, I think

540
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,810
Jiang Lin has good taste.

541
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,240
What’s wrong?

542
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,030
Did Ms. Fu

543
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,440
say bad things about me?

544
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:22,910
Jiang Yu.

545
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,810
Jiang Lin sacrificed himself to save me.

546
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,510
What?

547
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,050
That day,

548
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,470
we received news about a terrorist attack.

549
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,610
The location is an orphanage.

550
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,820
You're gonna be all right.

551
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,890
Hold tight.

552
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,560
I didn't remember it before.

553
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,410
I just recalled it two days ago.

554
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,640
You are his brother.

555
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:35,270
You have the right to know the truth.

556
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,580
I have more than the right to know.

557
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,470
Do think you'll feel better

558
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,900
after being beaten?

559
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,850
I won't let that happen.

560
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:36,560
♫Stepping on my heart alone♫

561
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:46,670
♫You're triggering a bomb unknown♫

562
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:58,380
♫The sun of life reflects♫

563
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:06,760
♫Just stay where you are, don't go♫

564
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,130
Zan.

565
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,280
Why do you shave at night?

566
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,280
Didn't I say I'll give you a reward?

567
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,940
Of course it has to be

568
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:21,590
better benefits.

569
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,630
You still look handsome with some stubs.

570
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
By the way, Ran.

571
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,780
I might not be able

572
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:34,889
to go see you this weekend.

573
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,820
Are you working overtime?

574
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,400
Still, you can't stay up late.

575
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,150
Got it.

576
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,350
Also,

577
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,820
you have to make it up to me.

578
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,250
Of course.

579
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,020
I've even thought about

580
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,280
how to make it up to you.

581
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:54,630
Really?

582
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,840
Then tell me quickly

583
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,680
how will you make it up to me?

584
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,800
Look.

585
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,450
I'll go to all these places with you.

586
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,150
Keep your promise.

587
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,810
You're not allowed to complain

588
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,210
that you're tired before we visit them all.

589
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:22,660
We have to take photos everywhere we go.

590
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,360
Hang up only after

591
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,510
I've fallen asleep.

592
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,420
Good night.

593
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,610
There's an urgent case.

594
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,730
So I can only tell you at your place.

595
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,070
What case?

596
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,040
Let me see.

597
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,120
Did you get into a fight?

598
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:15,890
No.

599
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,040
I was beaten.

600
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,030
Who was it?

601
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,160
Why did they hit you?

602
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:35,170
Jiang Yu.

603
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,850
Jiang Yu...

604
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:45,270
Luo Zhan.

605
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,150
I remember how

606
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,900
Jiang Lin died.

607
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,280
Did you recall it

608
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,140
during the last team building?

609
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:14,940
You told Jiang Yu?

610
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:17,850
He's Jiang Lin's brother.

611
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,890
He has the right to know

612
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,650
the truth.

613
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,650
What truth?

614
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,170
That Jiang Lin died to save me.

615
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,310
He died to save you?

616
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,810
That means you were wrong.

617
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,700
You deserve to be beaten.

618
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,640
Li Zan,

619
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,650
I never agree with your perspective

620
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,780
on this matter.

621
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,970
You all did this for justice.

622
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,100
But the result may not be good.

623
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,690
Something is wrong with this saying.

624
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,320
We are all mortals.

625
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,550
We can only control the starting point

626
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,350
and that it's for a good purpose.

627
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,850
Whether the result is good or bad

628
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:37,730
is beyond our control.

629
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,990
Must you feel like you have to take responsiblity

630
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,230
for all these things that can't be controlled?

631
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,550
That's torture.

632
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,400
But you know this too.

633
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,560
Sometimes, emotions

634
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:08,930
can't be controlled by us.

635
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,070
Especially self-blame

636
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,920
and regret.

637
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,710
Li Zan.

638
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,560
You...

639
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,880
But you know this too.

640
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,870
Sometimes, emotions

641
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,100
can't be controlled by us.

642
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,320
Especially self-blame

643
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,820
and regret.

644
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:56,080
Since he risked his life

645
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,000
for Eastern Country,

646
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,360
I want to see

647
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,130
what I can do

648
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,360
to do

649
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,180
what he hasn't completed.

650
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,760
I'm his brother after all.

651
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,610
Last time I got hurt,

652
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,580
I couldn't help telling him

653
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,050
that I would bring him to Eastern Country at the end of the year

654
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,650
along with his grandparents

655
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,030
to live with us.

656
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:19,760
But...

657
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,130
But I'm not confident at all.

658
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,550
I want to

659
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,410
go to the explosion site

660
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:30,510
and see... if we can do more.
