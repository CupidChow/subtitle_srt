We're here to invite Mr. Li over.

176
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,770
Yes. Right.

177
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,520
We're all here to invite Mr. Li.

178
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,000
Hello.

179
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,670
So this is Mr. Li's girlfriend.

180
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,370
She's quite pretty.

181
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:33,930
Right?

182
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,490
-Am I right?
-They look really good together.

183
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,550
Hello.

184
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,600
I thought the wedding was about to begin.

185
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Does it take this many people to invite me over?

186
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,890
You're so beautiful, Mrs. Li.

187
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,950
You're so elegant.

188
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,120
Let's go.

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,400
Why did you just watch and not say anything?

190

Guys only fight.

225
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,270
We don't quarrel.

226
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,080
Did you fight?

227
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,750
Why are you so silly?

228
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,270
No.

229
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,280
Mr. Luo...

230
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,370
Maybe something happened to him.

231
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,830
And he's always been

232
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,510
a bit of a strange character.

233
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,440
I'm already used to it.

234
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,830
You scared me.

235
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,910
I thought you had a fight.

236
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:42,440
Come here.

237
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,010
This is the beautiful reporter

238
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,940
I told you about.

239
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,510
She's so pretty in person.

240
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,320
Right?

241
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,150
Hello.

242
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
Hello.

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,550
was taken by her.

246
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,480
Awesome, right?

247
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,620
I need to use the bathroom.

248
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,370
Really?

249
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,730
We finally get to meet her in person today.

250
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,810
Hello.

251
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,870
-Awesome, right?
-You're so pretty.

252
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,550
Thank you.

254
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,910
Dr. Liang.

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:43,890
I'm sorry.

256
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,240
I didn't know

257
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,600
Li Zan would bring his girlfriend here today.

258
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,080
I meant to ask you

259
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,960
to talk to Li Zan.

260
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,800
It's okay.

261
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,170
I didn't come here to talk to Li Zan to begin with.

262
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,440
I'm here to talk to you.

263
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,840
Me?

264
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:04,820
Li Zan came to me a few days ago

265
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,280
for a psychological test.

266
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,910
He said he wanted to be a volunteer again

267
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,640
and go back to Eastern Country.

268
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,770
Dr. Liang.

269
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,750
I plan to go back there to be an EOD volunteer.

270
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,120
The EOD certificate

271
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,150
requires annual

272
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,270
re-examination,

273
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,150
testing, and re-verification,

274
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,350
including psychological assessment.

275
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,630
So,

276
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,920
I'd like to ask you to give me another psychological test.

277
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,740
Sure.

278
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,970
I'd also like to see

279
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,120
how your treatment is going.

280
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,030
Thank you.

281
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,150
What's the assessment result?

282
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,240
He passed the test.

283
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,500
Everything is normal.

284
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,180
What?

285
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,550
He's fully cured?

286
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,030
At least from the assessment result,

287
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,050
he's qualified.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,660
That won't make a difference.

289
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,589
I won't grant him the leave to go.

290
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:07,200
When we were playing real-life CS

291
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,510
during the company's team building last time,

292
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,369
he couldn't...

293
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,109
He couldn't even stand that.

294
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,180
How could I let him go to Eastern Country now?

295
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:19,960
Take a look at this.

296
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,550

Li Zan showed me this.

316
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,130
That's why I agreed to give him the psychological test.

317
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,080
This...

318
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,120
How could this be?

319
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,650
Li Zan said

320
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:37,950
he was not mentally prepared that time.

321
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,950
It was too sudden.

322
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,350
Besides, it was during the time when his memory was recovering.

323
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,240
He could be relatively sensitive and fragile at that time.

324
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,790
When his memory recovers,

325
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,270
the patient will generally enter

326
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,920
a relatively stable state.

327
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,270
But it was just a game.

328
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,590
It's completely different from the situation in Eastern Country.

329
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,310
I saw it with my own eyes

330
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,000
how his condition was after he returned from Eastern Country last time.

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
If he has to experience it again,

332
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,760
I'm afraid he'll never recover.

333
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,160
This time, he fully cooperated with the treatment.

334
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,440
That means he's very determined himself.

335
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,840
I think it's a good thing.

336
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,110
He needs

337
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,320
full support from you,

338
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,720
his leader and friend.

339
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,170
I got it.

340
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,270
Dr. Liang.

341
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,240
I'll think about it.

342
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,610
Okay.

343
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,750
-Dr. Liang.
-Dr. Liang.

344
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,790
Dr. Liang told you

345
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,630
about the result of my psychological assessment, right?

346
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:36,350
Yes.

347
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,170
She said you've made up your mind,

348
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,680
and I couldn't stop you.

349
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,230
Can you listen to

350
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,580
the reason why I made up my mind

351
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,540
before you decide whether to stop me?

352
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,610
Your reason is too great

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,200
for me to understand.

354
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,630
I do want to go back to Eastern Country

355
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
to do something more

356
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,870
for the people there.

357
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,240
It also has a lot to do with

358
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
how Jiang Lin was my friend

359
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,040
and how he died to save me.

360
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,740
Jiang Lin was a soldier.

361
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,030
Even if that person weren't you,

362
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,000
he would've saved him regardless.

363
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,790
For him, it might be true.

364
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,150
But for me,

365
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,680
I owe him my life.

366
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,400
But...

367
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,130
But that's not the only reason.

368
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
I also have my own selfish thoughts.

369
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,070
Even without Jiang Lin,

370
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,660
I still have special feelings

371
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,790
for Eastern Country

372
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,920
and the people there.

373
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,410
Because I saw with my own eyes

374
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,920
what they went through.

375
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,810
I can feel their pain.

376
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,960
I want to help them

377
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,680
from the bottom of my heart.

378
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,440
Isn't that

379
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,220
why I volunteered in the first place?

380
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,050
You were once a volunteer, too.

381
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,630
You should know

382
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,230
this feeling.

383
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,570
But now...

384
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,110
Your situation is different now.

385
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,580
It's exactly because

386
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,810
I'm different now that

387
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,510
I want to go even more.

388
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,370
Because I don't want to be different.

389
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,290
I want to be a normal person

390
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,480
like I used to be.

391
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,190
I don't want to

392
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,070
hide from the so-called stimulus

393
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,300
and pretend that I've recovered.

394
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,160
I can't stand this fragile feeling.

395
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,180
"It is better to die a broken piece of jade

396
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,590
than to live a life of clay."

397
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,740
I think you understand

398
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,410
this sentence too.

399
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Because you've seen me

400
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,330
at my worst.

401
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,110
My ears

402
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,110
and my physical injuries have healed.

403
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,410
But there's still

404
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,060
a time bomb buried deep in my heart.

405
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,830
It could explode anytime

406
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,510
and blow me back to that mess again.

407
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,510
I want to demolish it completely.

408
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,480
Dr. Liang must have told you

409
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,920
it's risky

410
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,900
to face the stimulus head-on.

411
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,000
But there're also chances that

412
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,010
I can completely recover.

413
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,610
I want to give it a try.

414
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,710
I have

415
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,480
Ran now.

416
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
I don't want her

417
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,000
to protect my feelings carefully

418
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,840
for the rest of our lives.

419
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,170
I hope that after coming back from Eastern Country,

420
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,240
I can also give her

421
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,660
a normal and happy wedding

422
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,560
like this one.

423
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,800
So, have you told Reporter Song

424
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,350
that you're going to Eastern Country?

425
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,000
Not yet.

426
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,750
I want to wait until

427
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,970
I get the EOD certificate

428
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,240
before I tell her.

429
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,010
After all,

430
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,650
there'll be a simulation of a real explosive ordnance disposal.

431
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,370
I...

432
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,240
I don't know if I can pass.

433
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,000
If I fail,

434
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,200
there's no need for her

435
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,010
to go through the disappointment with me.

436
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,920
Don't go if you're so unconfident.

437
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,280
Alright.

438
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:08,880
Come on.

439
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,480
I'm sorry.

440
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,000
Everyone, please be quiet.

441
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You must've waited long.

442
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,640
The next game...

443
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,680
It's been a while, Reporter Song.

444
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,830
It's time to test your tolerance.

445
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,640
Hello, Mr. Luo.

446
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,750
Let's see whose cheesy lines

447
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,300
are the most unbearable.

448
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,720
Let's start with the bride and groom.

449
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,920
Come on.

450
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,000
Do you know...

451
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,680
Cheesy lines.

452
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,770
What the

453
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,030
closest distance

454
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,310
between two hearts is?

455
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,510
What is it?

456
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,350
This.

457
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,600
Next.

458
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,680
I'll go.

459
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Do you know

460
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,200
where my heart is?

461
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,200
On the left.

462
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,110
No.

463
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,820
It's in your heart.

464
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
What should we do when it's our turn?

465
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,870
Who'll say it?

466
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,050
Do you know any lines?

467
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,270
I hear them

468
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,470
talk about this a lot.

469
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,400
I know a few lines.

470
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,470
Mr. Li.

471
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,440
It's your turn.

472
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,110
Your eyes

473
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
are quite pretty.

474
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,540
Really?

475
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,820
But they're not as pretty as mine.

476
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,030
You're right.

477
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,840
That's not how you're supposed to respond.

478
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,740
What should I say then?

479
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,260
You need to play along.

480
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,720
How?

481
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,480
You need to ask me

482
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,510
why.

483
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,440
I'll ask you again.

484
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,150
Okay.

485
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,650
Your eyes are quite pretty.

486
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,290
Really?

487
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,370
But they're not as pretty as mine.

488
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,640
Why?

489
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,850
Because I've got you in my eyes.

490
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,000
I used to think

491
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,900
weddings were boring.

492
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,200
A lot of weddings are just formalities,

493
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,630
with ceremonies on the stage

494
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:28,370
and people below eating with their heads down.

495
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,630
It's so embarrassing.

496
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,280
But today is different.

497
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,370
Everyone is sincere.

498
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,010
I found that

499
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:46,680
you science geeks

500
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,710
are all goofy.

501
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,590
That's cute.

502
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,400
I found that

503
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,680
you said "embarrassing" twice today.

504
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,300
Are you afraid of embarrassment?

505
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:06,890
Yes.

506
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,550
It's like I have a phobia about embarrassment.

507
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,070
And it acts up a lot.

508
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,940
A phobia about embarrassment?

509
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,760
Then

510
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,910
when we get married,

511
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,020
we won't invite

512
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,570
so many irrelevant people,

513
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,090
so that you won't feel embarrassed.

514
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,670
Whether they're relevant

515
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,640
or not,

516
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,070
it doesn't matter who doesn't come.

517
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,420
As long as you're there.

518
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,480
Zan.

00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,320
Am I humorous?

520
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,470
Am I?

521
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,320
Not really.

522
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,960
Not very humorous.

523
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,070
I'm not humorous,

524
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,340
so why do you keep smiling at me?

525
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,550
Why?

526
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,350
Because...

527
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,050
Because I like you.

It's all your fault.

553
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,940
You drank so much yesterday.

554
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,270
I'm so sleepy.

555
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,220
I didn't know

556
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,690
you'd be grumpy when you got out of bed.

557
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I'm not.

558
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,970
You can catch up on sleep

559
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,520
on the plane later.

560
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,860
I have a meeting

561
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,990
this morning,

562
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,960
so I can't take you to the airport.

563
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,130
But I called a taxi for you.

564
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:32,260
It'll be there soon.

565
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,120
Zan.

566
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,310
There's something

567
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,070
I forgot to tell you yesterday.

568
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,330
What is it?

569
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,480
Go ahead.

570
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,210
I'm almost done with

571
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,840
my program at the TV station.

572
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,110
They want to invite me to stay.

573
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,700
But I feel like I've been out of job for too long.

574
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,790
I'm too scattered

575
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,230
to be employed now.

576
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,030
It's okay.

577
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,760
Just do as you wish.

578
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,580
I'll support you anyways.

579
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,110
However,

580
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,760
although the show is over,

581
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,650
I need to stay in Dicheng

582
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,020
for a while longer.

583
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,489
I've made some adjustments

584
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,639
to The Chronicles of Eastern Country.

585
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,730
I need to stay in Dicheng

586
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,920
and have meetings with Mr. Luo and the others for discussion.

587
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,650
You've made some adjustments?

588
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,360
What kind of adjustments?

589
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,780
It's a secret.

590
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,840
Could it be...

591
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,920
Related to me?

592
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,960
Stop guessing.

593
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,230
Ran.

594
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,010
Did you make those adjustments

595
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,960
because you don't want to go back to Eastern Country?

596
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,090
What about you?

597
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:24,840
Yes.

598
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,510
But I can't really do it.

599
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,600
Or is it because of me?

600
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,710
It's because I'm not sure...

601
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,320
I'm not sure

602
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,550
if I can face

603
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:45,370
those things.

604
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:49,960
I...

605
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,340
I want to wait a bit longer.

606
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm sorry, Ran.

607
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,170
I shouldn't have asked.

608
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,070
No one will

609
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,860
force you to face anything.

610
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,950
Don't worry.

611
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:18,930
Take your time.

612
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,080
By the way,

613
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,190
this is for you.

614
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,460
I hope you

615
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,590
will be safe forever, Zan.

616
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,300
This is only for my safety?

617
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,430
What about marriage?

618
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,310
You can rely on it for safety.

619
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,290
As for marriage,

620
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,430
you can rely on me.

621
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,350
Okay.

622
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,750
The car is here.

623
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,480
Text me

624
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,200
when you get on the plane.

625
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,400
I'll text you as soon as I get to the airport.

626
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,530
I'll text you when I board,

627
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,180
when the plane is about to take off,

628
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,350
and when I land.

629
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,550
Will you be tired of it?

630
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,520
Go.

631
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,130
Have a safe journey.

632
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,130
Be careful.

633
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,580
Sir.

634
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,450
We can go now.

635
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,280
Okay.

636
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,840
I wouldn't dare drive unless you let me.

637
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,070
I didn't want to disturb you.

638
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,870
Maybe there's some kind of ceremony or something.

639
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,230
We can go now.

640
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,180
Thank you, Sir.

641
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,550
Hello, Mr. Li.

642
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,630
Your volunteer application has been approved.

643
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,320
Our staff

644
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,810
will confirm the volunteer service period with you as soon as possible.

645
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:11,210
Please check carefully.

646
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,110
[Luo Zhan]

647
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,070
Li Zan.

648
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,230
Have you heard anything lately

649
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,760
about Eastern Country volunteers recently?

650
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,930
A bit.

651
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,990
Many volunteers are going to Eastern Country recently

652
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,100
because Eastern Country is in urgent need of them.

653
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,630
But I don't know

654
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,030
why they are in urgent need of them.

655
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,800
I didn't hear any news about it either.

656
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,600
What's wrong?

657
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,820
I just submitted the application,

658
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,670
and it already got approved.

659
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,070
The feedback was so fast,

660
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,590
so there must be a reason.

661
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,920
So I wanted to ask you

662
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,540
if you knew anything.

663
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,490
It's indeed a bit strange.

664
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,430
Hello.

665
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,920
Who's that?

666
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:03,930
Ben.

667
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,440
It's me.

668
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,500
Li Zan.

669
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,310
Zan.

670
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,340
I didn't expect it was you.

671
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,000
What's up?

672
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,590
How have you been?

673
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,410
I'm fine.

674
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,400
How are you?

675
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,540
How's the situation in Eastern Country now?

676
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,760
We're okay,

677
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,730
but Eastern Country...

678
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,540
How should I put it?

679
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,370
Ever since Ke was arrested,

680
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,280
the armed riots

681
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,360
have been negotiating with the government

682
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,010
for Ke's release.

683
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,400
Release Ke?

684
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,710
How is that possible?

685
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,710
Exactly.

686
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,510
The government turned down their request.

687
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,030
As a result, these bastards

688
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,630
started to expand the layout

689
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,000
and took revenge on the civilians.

690
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,960
They even used

691
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,560
those kind of dirty tricks.

692
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,250
The losses and casualties of civilians

693
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,180
are even more serious than before.

694
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,250
And we soldiers

695
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,810
can't really put our strength into use.

696
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,230
In fact, what Eastern Country

697
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,590
needs the most right now

698
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,450
is demining volunteers like you.

699
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,640
By the way,

700
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
how's it going between you and Song?

701
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,980
She's my girlfriend now.

702
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,930
I knew it.

703
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,550
The way you asked for assistance before

704
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,810
wasn't like you at all.

705
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:29,710
If it weren't for

706
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,920
the girl you love,

707
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,710
you wouldn't have done that.

708
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,970
Has there been any progress between you and Dr. Pei?

709
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,410
Our situation is different from yours.

710
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,340
You two are in love with each other.

711
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,510
And I dare say that

712
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,960
Song fell in love with you first.

713
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,690
As for Dr. Pei and I,

714
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,110
we've been blowing hot and cold.

715
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,000
It's quite hard to say.
