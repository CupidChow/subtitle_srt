[The White Olive Tree]

2
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,840
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,360
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,410
Seeing this brother and sister

5
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,280
reminds me of Sia and Zoro again.

6
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Shen Bei told me

7
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,040
Sia has been well taken care of,

8
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,850
but every time I see these children,

9
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,690
I can't help but fear that the moment they look up,

10
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,630
I might see Sia's face.

11
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,470
This is my third time stepping

12
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,350
onto the land of Eastern Country.

13
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,590
Scenes like this are

14
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,680
no longer unfamiliar to me.

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
But I still can't be indifferent

16
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,280
or remain unmoved.

17
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,740
I sincerely hope

18
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,329
they can live a better life.

19
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,329
Song.

20
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,300
Sasin.

21
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,650
It's really you.

22
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,870
Just now, a soldier told me

23
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,530
a reporter surnamed Song wanted to see me.

24
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,420
I can't believe it's true.

25
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,680
You've grown up.

26
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:39,960
No.

27
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,600
You've become maturer.

28
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,860
I've become older.

29
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,370
But you haven't changed.

30
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,240
You're still so beautiful.

31
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,020
You've also become a smooth talker.

32
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,090
Did you learn it from Benjamin?

33
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,470
Come on.

34
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,560
What can I learn from him?

35
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,630
Come.

36
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,090
Come inside and sit.

37
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,370
Here.

38
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,120
Thank you.

39
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,140
You didn't tell us in advance.

40
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:27,540
Ben and Zan are not here.

41
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,070
They rush to the hospital as soon as they're on break,

42
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,800
as if they're under some spell.

43
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,950
It's okay.

44
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,530
It's not like I'll leave tomorrow.

45
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,220
I'll come to see Ben next time.

46
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,040
As for Li Zan...

47
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,270
we've already met.

48
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,140
There's no need to see each other all the time.

49
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,000
Song.

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,220
Did you and Zan

51
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,610
quarrel?

52
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,430
It's...

53
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,170
not as simple as a quarrel.

54
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,600
If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.

55
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm not trying to pry.

56
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,110
I just think Zan has changed a lot

57
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,610
since he came back to Eastern Country

58
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,450
this time.

59
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,730
He's become even more silent.

60
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,670
Really?

61
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,720
But I think

62
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,920
whether you and Zan quarreled

63
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,930
or something else happened,

64
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,800
he still cares about you.

65
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,720
How do you know?

66
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,760
He would never bring it up himself.

67
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,960
Of course not. It's not what he said,

68
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,980
but what he did.

69
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,710
What did he do?

70
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,800
A few days ago,

71
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,120
we went on a mission outside Uglai City.

72
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,630
After the mission,

73
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,750
Zan ran to a small building and just stood there,

74
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,480
lost in thought for a long time.

75
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,720
His eyes were fixed on a road outside the building.

76
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,400
He said he saved a girl there.

77
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,230
I guess

78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,060
that's where Zan first saved you, right?

79
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,760
Look.

80
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,730
Is this the place?

81
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,730
Yes.

82
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,550
This is it.

83
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,480
You've already been there?

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
So you've really been there.

85
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,480
No wonder

86
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,680
Zan has got himself a new pair of gloves.

87
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,000
It turns out you picked up the old ones.

88
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,470
See?

89
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,720
This proves Zan still

90
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,500
cares about you, right?

91
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:20,870
Right,

92
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,350
this must be what you call fate.

93
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,070
I remember they say

94
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,330
if two people are destined, no matter where they are

95
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,430
or what identities they take,

96
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,159
they can always meet again.

97
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,720
There's no escaping it.

98
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,450
What's that saying again?

99
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,370
It's called...

100
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,630
Rekindling an old bond.

101
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,240
Yes.

102
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,170
You're leaving?

103
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,730
I'm going to the hospital.

104
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,680
Let's play a game.

105
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,039
Stand behind this line.

106
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:40,100
Anyone who can throw this into the bottle

107
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,600
will be rewarded.

108
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,330
I want to try.

109
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,710
Let me show you.

110
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,870
Well done!

111
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,150
I want to try.

112
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,960
Me first! Me first!

113
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,880
I want to try.

114
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,960
I'm gathering footage.

115
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,920
Let's play together.

116
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,110
It's your turn.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,170
Excuse me. Do you want to join us?

118
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,440
Given the distance, it shouldn't be hard, right?

119
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:45,640
-Can she throw it in?
-I don't know.

120
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,600
What a pity.

121
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,560
Yeah, that was close.

122
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,140
Here. I will teach you.

123
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay.

124
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,000
Here.

125
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,910
Use both of your eyes.

126
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,660
You can't just use one eye.

127
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,510
Accurately

128
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,220
judging physical space and distance visually

129
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,150
necessitates the use of both eyes.

130
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,100
Try again.

131
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,200
I hit the bottle.

132
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,750
Look.

133
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,430
But I still can't be indifferent

134
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,690
or remain unmoved.

135
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,670
I sincerely hope

136
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,960
they can live a better life.

137
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,840
Look.

138
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,170
Isn't it beautiful?

139
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,330
I'm so hungry.

140
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,750
How are you?

141
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,150
It's okay.

142
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,440
Julia,

143
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,430
that's the two kids.

144
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,030
It's okay.

145
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,200
Don't worry.

146
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,450
Zan.

147
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,150
Sia.

148
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,730
You've grown up.

149
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,200
Come with me. I'll take care of you.

150
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:37,260
Zan, wait for me.

151
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,040
Sia.

152
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,930
I have a gift for you.

153
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,090
In this way, Zoro is gonna be with you forever.

154
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,480
And you will never forget about him.

155
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,600
Captain.

156
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
Captain, you want to see me?

157
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,890
I saw Song today.

158
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,370
She was at the gate of the hospital.

159
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
You already met Song?

160
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,120
Yes.

161
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,450
You asked Song to go to the hospital for Zan?

162
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,600
So it wasn't a coincidence.

163
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,220
I didn't ask Song to go there.

164
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,910
I just told her

165
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,650
you and Zan always go to the hospital when you're free.

166
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,570
You're so nosy.

167
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,630
Well...

168
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,000
how are things between them?

169
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't know.

170
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,540
I only saw Song.

171
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,380
But this time's meeting

172
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,190
is definitely not what you want.

173
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,790
Why?

174
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,960
You're too young to understand.

175
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,600
Zan and Song are not like you.

176
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,750
Everything shows on your face.

177
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,150
You can't hide anything.

178
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,700
I can't hide anything?

179
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,030
You stole my star.

180
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,230
I haven't asked you to give it back to me.

181
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,960
Who stole your star?

182
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Then what is this?

183
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,030
Isn't it on your sleeve?

184
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,550
Captain, I'm going back if there's nothing else.

185
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,880
I'm going back to sleep.

186
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:39,960
Go.

187
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,730
I wonder if Ms. Song is interested

188
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,040
in covering our mission tomorrow.

189
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,960
I think Zan will go there too.

190
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,060
You're nosy too.

191
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,360
Hi, Morgan.

192
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,750
Ms. Song, hello. Long time no see.

193
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,450
Sasin asked me to come to have an interview.

194
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,720
You must follow my steps.

195
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,030
Okay.

196
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,600
Captain!

197
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Ms. Song arrived.

198
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,910
Song, long time no see.

199
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,030
I almost thought

200
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,250
you had forgotten us.

201
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,440
How could that be?

202
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,280
I've missed you all so much.

203
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,460
I shouldn't call you Benjamin now.

204
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,090
I should call you Captain.

205
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,870
Stop kidding.

206
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,150
Call me Ben.

207
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,030
You came at the right time.

208
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,230
Zan and Sasin are just about to finish planting the explosives.

209
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,950
In a moment, you'll see Zan's masterpiece.

210
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,109
Are you going to blow up this building?

211
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,200
Yes.

212
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,000
Now, those guys

213
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,140
don't dare to confront us directly,

214
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,109
so they've scattered,

215
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,069
hiding in these abandoned,

216
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,569
uninhabited buildings in the outskirts

217
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,000
and waiting for a chance to launch sneak attacks.

218
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,859
It's really giving us a headache.

219
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,810
But luckily,

220
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:19,810
Zan is here.

221
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,660
He can use a small amount of explosives

222
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,060
to bring down a building.

223
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,990
So,

224
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,110
we asked Zan

225
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,370
to blow up all these

226
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,550
hazardous buildings

227
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,280
to eliminate our future worries once and for all.

228
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,700
Once we win,

229
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,730
these buildings will have to be demolished and rebuilt anyway.

230
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,350
I didn't expect his expertise

231
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,950
to serve such a purpose here.

232
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,680
Song.

233
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,310
Ms. Song,

234
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,890
you're here.

235
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,410
Come, Ms. Song, stand here.

236
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,880
Zan, can we blow it up now?

237
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,510
Wait a minute.

238
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,680
Done.

239
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:00,900
You do it.

240
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,160
Song.

241
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,830
If you hadn't come,

242
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,820
I wouldn't have had this privilege.

243
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,620
It was always Ben planting the explosives

244
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,720
and Zan setting them off before.

245
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,180
I could only sit and watch.

246
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,070
But today, I'm benefiting from your presence.

247
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,320
Make sure to follow the sequence.

248
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,250
Don't mess it up.

249
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,160
Attention!

250
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,510
Yes, sir!

251
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,080
Squat.

252
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,510
Three, two, one!

253
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,590
I'll detonate it!

254
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,640
It worked!

255
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,400
Zan!

256
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,060
We love you!

257
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,520
What should we do with this landmine now?

258
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,020
Just like this.

259
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,360
That's all?

260
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,200
It won't explode?

261
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,270
You're laughing at me.

262
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,850
Stand behind me.

263
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,510
Attention!

264
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,510
Detonate!

265
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,550
Nothing seems to have changed.

266
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,440
But everything seems to have changed.

267
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,160
Clear up the place around

268
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,000
and check if there are others!

269
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,710
Got it?

270
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,230
Zan.

271
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,310
Take care of Song.

272
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,000
Song.

273
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,170
Wait for us here.

274
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:20,270
Okay.

275
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,840
Did you take a photo just now?

276
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,310
I forgot.

277
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,800
It's okay.

278
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,010
You still have a chance.

279
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,160
Really?

280
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,120
Do I still have a chance?

281
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,300
Yesterday...

282
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,640
did you throw it in?

283
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,590
No.

284
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,790
I only hit the bottleneck.

285
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,790
It's okay.

286
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,130
Just practice more.

287
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,790
I'm not a kid.

288
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,390
Why should I play that often?

289
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,850
Has your mother...

290
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,880
recovered?

291
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,980
She's much better.

292
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,470
Has she been discharged from hospital?

293
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,640
Yes.

294
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,000
She has gone back to work.

295
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,560
That's good.

296
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,030
Instructor Li,

297
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,830
come here! We found a landmine

298
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,510
we haven't seen before!

299
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,960
Got it!

300
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,340
Coming!

301
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,260
It's not safe here.

302
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,740
Don't walk around.

303
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,550
Mom! Mom!

304
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,550
Mom, please! I don't want to go!

305
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,880
Mom!

306
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,030
I don't want to leave!

307
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,130
Mom! Help!

308
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,590
I'm not a bad guy!

309
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,200
Watch out!

310
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,400
Didn't I tell you not to walk around

311
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,060
because it's dangerous here?

312
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,870
I didn't mean to walk around.

313
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,480
I just saw them...

314
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,280
Please, help me!

315
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,440
Mom!

316
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,110
Mom!

317
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,540
Please!

318
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,210
Stop screaming!

319
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,360
Please, I don't want to go!

320
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,720
Mom!

321
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,000
Just now, we had to detonate a landmine immediately.

322
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,920
The place where you were standing was not safe.

323
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,590
I wanted to call you,

324
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,390
but I didn't see you.

325
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,640
So I was anxious.

326
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,030
I'm sorry, Ran.

327
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,210
I'm sorry, Ms. Song.

328
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,960
It's my fault.

329
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,520
I want to go to the Bride Village.

330
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,710
I'm going to tell Sasin.

331
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,950
Can I leave now?

332
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,030
I'll go tell him.

333
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,930
Wait for me here.

334
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,620
The road to the Bride Village is not safe.

335
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,750
I'll take you there.

336
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,280
No need for that.

337
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,580
I'm not gonna wait for you.

338
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,240
Come here.

339
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,880
I have a car.

340
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,360
Your car is too slow.

341
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,270
I don't think so.

342
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,800
What's wrong?

343
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,650
Your helmet strap isn't fastened properly.

344
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
Are you seated properly?

345
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,960
Yes.

346
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,000
The agent is here!

347
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,350
Come on!

348
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,430
Come here!

349
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,720
Quickly!

350
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,640
Quickly!

351
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,800
Is he coming?

352
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,920
Wait. That's not the agent.

353
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,510
We waited in vain again.

354
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,370
Let's go back.

355
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,070
Come on. Let's go.

356
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,980
Let's go.

357
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,830
Beautiful braided hair

358
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,710
helps you marry well.

359
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:01,030
Well married. Well married.

360
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,610
Here you are.

361
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,500
Don't give it to me.

362
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,590
I don't want to wear it. I don't want to get married.

363
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,830
Be a good girl.

364
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,590
Life is miserable until you marry well.

365
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,310
Put it on.

366
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,920
I can only pay 200 dollars.

367
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,000
Or I'll go check somewhere else.

368
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,310
Please, wait!

369
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,530
Can't you add a bit more?

370
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,450
She is my only daughter.

371
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,150
Please!

372
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,730
That's just not possible.

373
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,690
It costs a lot to get her to another country.

374
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,610
It's okay, Mom.

375
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,400
It's okay.

376
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,590
Please.

377
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,490
How about this? I'll give you 300 more. Okay?

378
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,790
300.

379
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,400
Let's go.

380
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,370
Damn world!

381
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,780
By the looks of him,

382
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,430
I guess he once was a soldier.

383
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,260
He can't protect the women and children of his country.

384
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,110
There's nothing more tragic than that.

385
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,200
I don't want to take photos anymore.

386
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,270
Let's go.

387
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,370
Okay.

388
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,030
Are you upset?

389
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,640
I feel I suddenly don't know

390
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,570
the meaning of doing these things.

391
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,260
Why do you say that?

392
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,830
Is journalism

393
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,960
really a profession that feeds

394
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,440
on the misery of others?

395
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,190
If not,

396
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,550
how come we always witness suffering,

397
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,969
yet we're powerless to stop anything?

398
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,929
Just like I can't stop this girl from being sold

399
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,520
or stop this war.

400
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Is there an occupation in this world

401
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,679
that can stop war?

402
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,650
It seems even soldiers can't.

403
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,210
Do soldiers

404
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,240
feed on the misery of others?

405
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:23,950
About reporters,

406
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,920
I recall a saying I heard.

407
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,360
If you can't stop war,

408
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,110
reveal the truth of war

409
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,670
to the world.

410
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,320
I think

411
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,150
that is what you should do.

412
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,220
And that's what you've been doing.

413
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,840
But the truth is

414
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,670
there are always people suffering.

415
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,620
And there are always people dying.

416
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,700
Sometimes, I'd wonder

417
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,190
who in this world

418
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,420
would care

419
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,220
if they are injured or dead.

420
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,880
Yeah.

421
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,510
One day,

422
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,030
we will all die.

423
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,210
And everything that happened here

424
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,110
will become history.

425
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
It will surpass all individuals' anguish,

426
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,130
enduring through time.

427
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,830
But history needs to be recorded.

428
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,510
Once recorded,

429
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,810
it will be seen by the world.

430
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,530
Once it's seen,

431
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,350
there will be a chance for changes.

432
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,760
Maybe

433
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,700
that's where the meaning lies.

434
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,350
Zan,

435
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,250
you're still a gentle and sober-minded person,

436
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,220
who I trust the most.

437
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,030
Thank you.

438
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,080
Let's go.

439
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,510
It seems you've always been so determined,

440
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
just like before.

441
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,210
I just said those words objectively.

442
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,300
I'm flattered.

443
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,320
Do you ever feel lost?

444
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,380
Have you ever made a wrong decision?

445
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,650
♫In a distant city♫

446
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,220
♫Lie the faded memories of my days♫

447
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,060
Is there anything weighing on your mind?

448
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,660
♫The one you once loved♫

449
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,870
♫Is no longer the me standing before you♫

450
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,680
♫Who, like a fool♫

451
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,150
♫Once wrote poems for you?♫

452
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,310
♫I guess you don't remember♫

453
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,970
♫What I look like♫

454
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,580
♫I didn't understand the meaning of goodbyes♫

455
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,130
♫On the shore♫

456
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,290
♫Only one person's footprints remain♫

457
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,710
♫Let me guess, have you ever walked into♫

458
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:20,120
♫The castle you built for me♫

459
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:25,580
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

460
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,360
The curtain in my hotel room is broken.

461
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:29,760
Okay.

462
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,550
I'll go with you to buy a new one later.

463
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,400
Thank you.

464
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,160
The boss has already punched holes

465
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,460
in this tablecloth.

466
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,130
You can hang it up directly as the curtain

467
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,220
after you go back.

468
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,890
Can you do it yourself?

469
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
I can do it.

470
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,510
How did you know

471
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,940
this tablecloth would fit just right?

472
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,610
The windows of the hotel you're staying at

473
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,890
are about this size.

474
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,590
Your social media post had a location tag.

475
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,870
He knew I came to Uglai City.

476
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,620
Thank you for today.

477
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
Don't mention it.

478
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,900
The hotel you're staying at is very safe.

479
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,640
I'll leave you here.

480
00:39:59,360 --> 00:39:59,920
Okay.

481
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,490
PTSD is quite complicated.

482
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,190
It's your first time here.

483
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,850
It's normal that he wouldn't let you go near him.

484
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,100
Even Li Zan

485
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,410
can't get close to him every time.

486
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,520
Can I come to visit him again?

487
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,330
You want to come again?

488
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,430
Aren't you afraid of danger?

489
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,670
Don't you find this place stuffy?

490
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,190
He might not give you any response.

491
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,550
I don't need him to give me response.

492
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,810
I just want him to know

493
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,890
Li Zan cares about him,

494
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,600
and so do I.

495
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:55,590
Then maybe

496
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,190
he can make it through.

497
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,190
That's why I said

498
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,360
only you and Li Zan are the same type.

499
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,080
Really?

500
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,690
Zan,

501
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,550
is there something you've been through

502
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,210
that you don't want to tell me?

503
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,370
It's okay if you don't want to tell me now.

504
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,380
I can wait.

505
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,470
Tomorrow,

506
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,920
I want to go to the mausoleum in Matuman for inspiration.

507
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,980
I heard it's very hard to get in there.

508
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:55,400
Can you take me there?
