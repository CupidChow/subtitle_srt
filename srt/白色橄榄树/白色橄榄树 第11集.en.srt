00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,800

[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,560
Fei.

5
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,150
Rina

6
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,350
is Sasin's mother.

7
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,350
These two kids

8
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,730
are the children in the photo called "Carry."

9
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,480
I want to find out

10
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,080
why they've become orphans.

11
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,400
So...

12
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:09,870
Okay.

13
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,620
No problem.

14
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,210
Go ahead.

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680
The interview today is not complicated.

16
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,540
I can handle it.

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,190
Go,

18
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,720
Ms. Song.

19
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,079
We'll take good care of

20
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,120
your colleague.

21
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,470
Thank you.

22
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,030
Be careful.

23
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:29,710
Thank you,

24
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,310
Benjamin.

25
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,010
Why have they become orphans?

26
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,329
It's just fate.

27
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,920
So your bedroom is inside.

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,380
You can take a rest here.

29
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,540
You're welcome.

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,210
Thank you.

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,000
Rina.

32
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,500
Song.

33
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,220
Lea.

34
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,160
Take your time.

35
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,360
I gotta go. I have something to do.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you.

37
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,050
Tell me.

38
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,990
Why did you come to Happo?

39
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,210
And Sia and Zoro,

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,560
why did they come to the orphanage?

41
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,240
Don't tell me...

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,070
Their families all...

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,910
After that attack,

44
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,070
a lot of people went missing.

45
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,010
Later, they were found

46
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,450
buried in the ruins

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,500
or crushed by falling debris.

48
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,250
By the time they were discovered,

49
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,840
it was too late to save them.

50
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,080
Sia's and Zoro's parents

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,960
also...

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,630
Rina Mama.

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,910
Sia.

54
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,910
Sia.

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,190
Song, I know it's you.

56
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,519
How did you know it was me?

57
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,360
Yes.

58
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,920
Lea said that a beautiful journalist

59
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,070
comes here to help every day.

60
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,070
So I got it was you.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Comes here to help every day?

62
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,600
But that's not me.

63
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,920
Follow me.

64
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
It's Shen Bei.

65
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,600
What candy is it today?

66
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,750
I want this.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,800
Give me. Give me.

68
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,920
Give me candy.

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,040
Lea said

70
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,390
there's a journalist from a TV station

71
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,080
who comes to the orphanage every day as a volunteer.

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,150
She even brings things for the kids—

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,190
candy,

74
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,310
toys…

75
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,520
But she doesn't take photos or conduct interviews.

76
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
She just comes to help out every day.

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,480
I thought she was talking about you.

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,270
Can I have a try?

79
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:18,920
Please.

80
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,630
Candy. Candy.

81
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,180
Candy. Candy!

82
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,540
Candy, please.

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Sia.

84
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,800
Zoro.

85
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,340
Zoro.

86
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,750
Watch out.

87
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,200
Thank you.

88
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,690
It's alright.

89
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,270
Zoro!

90
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,120
Why don't you come out quickly?

91
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,370
I almost fell.

92
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,310
I'm here.

93
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,680
I-I won't…

94
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,600
Are you the kids

95
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,210
in the photo of "Carry"?

96
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,310
Yes.

97
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,800
Do you recognize us?

98
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,550
I heard you're a journalist.

99
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,810
Do you want to take a photo of us?

100
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,390
May I take a photo of you?

101
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,070
Sure.

102
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,720
If you don't take a photo, I can't explain it.

103
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,470
If I don't,

104
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,580
wouldn't it be a waste of Ms. Song's kindness?

105
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,830
How do you know that?

106
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,480
Journalist Song asked us to take a photo.

107
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,800
Zoro!

108
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,110
You must have just run out too fast!

109
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,240
You gave us away!

110
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,750
You can't blame me.

111
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,130
You've been the one talking all this time.

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
Why isn't it on you?

113
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,870
How dare you talk back?

114
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,790
Do you know what surprised me the most?

115
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,130
Running into me here today?

116
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,240
What's surprising about that?

117
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,740
Last time, I already knew that you came here often.

118
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,950
It's only a matter of time before I meet you.

119
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,080
I just didn't expect it to be this soon.

120
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
I was hoping that by the next time we met,

121
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,790
I'd have been fully accepted

122
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,909
and completed my interview.

123
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,159
See?

124
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,310
I'm so goal-oriented.

125
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,510
Why do some people

126
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,730
always like to make themselves sound so bad?

127
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,160
What surprised me

128
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
was that your "Carry" wasn't just a coincidence.

129
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,700
You actually have a connection with the two kids

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,870
in that photo.

131
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,070
Looks like

132
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,480
you're not just someone

133
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,340
who talks big about grand ideals.

134
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,870
You meant

135
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,510
what you said sometimes.

136
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,840
I didn't know I was so hypocritical

137
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,120
and awful in your eyes.

138
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,630
Yeah.

139
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,720
So awful

140
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,430
that you needed a kid to help you apologize.

141
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,030
Why would I need to apologize?

142
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,390
I just think

143
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,080
there are things about you

144
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,910
that I admire.

145
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,410
You can quietly find a way

146
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,230
to solve problems on your own.

147
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,240
I guess…

148
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,390
I can forgive you.

149
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,510
No need.

150
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,770
Let me make this clear—

151
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,910
all our competition is still on.

152
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,360
But we're not enemies anymore,

153
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,980
just rivals.

154
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,510
Sasin.

155
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,480
Song.

156
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,600
You're here.

157
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,440
Rina is…

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
She's in the backyard.

159
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,080
Go find her.

160
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,620
Okay.

161
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,270
So?

162
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,120
Want to use my camera

163
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,170
to take some photos of the kids?

164
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,790
I think

165
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,150
your topic,

166
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,790
"Orphans in the Flames of War,"

167
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,190
is actually pretty good.

168
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,550
Showing off again, huh?

169
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,870
Yeah.

170
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,200
The rival I've chosen

171
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,730
can't be mediocre.

172
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,600
I'll catch you!

173
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,600
Why have you become a volunteer?

174
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,210
What about your hotel job?

175
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,290
What exactly happened?

176
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,720
Your friend helped me become a volunteer.

177
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,490
After you all left Uglai,

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,910
that manager

179
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,490
still found an excuse to fire me.

180
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,240
But somehow,

181
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,990
Benjamin found out about it.

182
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,240
He stood up for me.

183
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,630
How was it?

184
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,240
Did everything go well?

185
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,790
Yes.

186
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,110
But…

187
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,860
I don't want to be a waiter anymore.

188
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,430
I want to change jobs.

189
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,080
Benjamin

190
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,870
took me to see Instructor Li,

191
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,980
who introduced me to volunteer work.

192
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,440
But being a volunteer

193
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,370
doesn't mean you had to do something this dangerous.

194
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,200
I like helping people,

195
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,840
especially these kids.

196
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,290
When I see them,

197
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,370
it's like seeing you as a child.

198
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
I hope that

199
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:59,020
when they grow up,

200
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,680
they can have the chance to go to college

201
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,150
and become as amazing as you.

202
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,160
Then Eastern Country

203
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,240
won't be like this anymore.

204
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,490
We'll get better,

205
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,440
truly better.

206
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:15,640
Son.

207
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,910
From now on,

208
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,870
let's not meet in secret anymore.

209
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,910
I was wrong before.

210
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,870
From now on,

211
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,330
if we want to meet, we meet.

212
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,230
Mom.

213
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,060
This...

214
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,250
I just made it for Benjamin.

215
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,690
He took the one

216
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
that's yours.

217
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,820
He wants to return it

218
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,870
to you himself.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,490
It won't be the same.

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,840
You gave that star to me

221
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,970
on my 18th birthday.

222
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
I'm 20 now.

223
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,580
It won't work anymore.

224
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,200
Silly boy.

225
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,650
I made them both with my own hands.

226
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,390
My love for you hasn't changed.

227
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,590
How could it not work?

228
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,400
Mom,

229
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,640
you're better with words than before.

230
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:40,850
But…

231
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,540
why did you make one for Benjamin too?

232
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,170
You're a journalist.

233
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,040
He's a soldier.

234
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,140
He's in even more danger.

235
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,370
Of course, I had to make one for him.

236
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,120
You were wasting your effort.

237
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,380
He doesn't care about something like this.

238
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,930
That's not true.

239
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I saw the way he looked at it.

240
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,490
He wants it.

[Bar]

251
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,830
A soldier ordered this for you.

252
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,710
He said he had training today

253
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,060
and might be late.

254
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,570
This is compensation for waiting for him.

255
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,100
He also said,

256
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,510
"Drink this.

257
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,930
Don't waste it anymore."

258
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,330
Thank you.

259
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,750
Goodbye, Instructor Li.

260
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,380
Bye.

261
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,660
Zan.

262
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,270
It's still early.

263
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,170
Where are you planning to go?

264
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,310
Where should I go?

265
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,240
The orphanage, of course.

266
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,670
Ms. Song is there, isn't she?

267
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,070
Don't you want to see her?

268
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,790
Isn't she about to be transferred back home?

269
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,480
You should take every chance to meet her.

270
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,600
I wish I could take Rina's star

271
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
and stick it on your mouth

272
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,660
to shut you up.

273
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,670
Zan.

274
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,730
Sasin should be

275
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,490
on his way to the orphanage too.

276
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,940
If he cries in his mom's arms,

277
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,560
take a photo and send it to me.

278
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,050
You really have the heart

279
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,990
to miss something like that?

280
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,380
That's because

281
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,190
I have a date with Dr. Pei.

282
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,120
Bye.

283
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,690
What happened?

284
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,530
Shen Bei.

285
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,040
Shen Bei.

286
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,560
Shen Bei.

287
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,840
Shen Bei.

288
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,450
We can't stay here.

289
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,710
Stop crying.

290
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,640
Be quiet.

291
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,760
Come with me.

292
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,470
Stay there.

293
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,860
Shen Bei.

294
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,670
We have to hide.

295
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,670
Be quiet. Don't cry.

296
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,160
Don't cry.

297
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,510
Come on. Let's go.

298
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,320
Don't cry.

299
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,900
Don't be afraid.

300
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,830
Don't be afraid.

301
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:05,680
Don't be afraid.

302
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,750
Everybody's here.

303
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,170
Don't be afraid.

304
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,520
Don't be afraid.

305
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,070
Sasin!

306
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
Rina.

307
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,700
Sasin.

308
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,070
Anyone there?

309
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,880
All clear!

310
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,550
Let's go.

311
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,110
Song Ran, are you okay?

312
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,900
Those bastards are headed to the backyard.

313
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Zoro… Zoro and Sia

314
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,920
are in the backyard.

315
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,720
Sia…

316
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,510
I'll go look for them.

317
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,410
Song, take care of my mom

318
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,760
and these children.

319
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,370
Sasin.

320
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,820
You bastards!

321
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,140
How can you even kill children?

322
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,820
Kill her!

323
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,870
Keep searching!

324
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,150
There may be someone else in there.

325
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,040
Lea.

326
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Sasin.

327
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,550
Sasin.

328
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,220
Sasin.

329
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,180
Hold them.

330
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,550
Don't let them run out.

331
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,530
There's something.

332
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,750
There's no one here.

333
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,270
Sasin.

334
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,030
Sasin.

335
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,980
Sasin, how are you feeling?

336
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,830
Zoro…

337
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,200
Rina Mama, Zoro is still inside.

338
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:54,260
I'll go.

339
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,030
Song.

340
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,870
I saved the two of them back then.

341
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,870
I must protect them.

342
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,420
Don't go.

343
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:03,770
Don't go.

344
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,110
Take care of Sasin for me.

345
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,530
Rina.

346
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,830
Rina.

347
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,070
Rina!

348
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,720
Zoro!

349
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,200
Sia!

350
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,200
Sia!

351
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,850
You can't go.

352
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,130
Get them together and kill them at once.

353
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,000
Everyone down!

354
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,400
Kill them!

355
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,240
Kill them all!

356
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,730
Move!

357
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,330
Don't show mercy.

358
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,550
Let them know what we've got!

359
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,380
Let's move! This way!

360
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,470
Kill them all!

361
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,680
I'll go this way.

362
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,240
Send a soldier.

363
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,320
Please send a soldier to help us.

364
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,400
Hurry! Save the people!

365
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,430
Here…

366
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,830

Zoro.

383
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,380
Zoro.

384
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,550
Benjamin,

385
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,750
have you seen Rina?

386
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,760
She went inside to look for Zoro.

387
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,580
Where's Rina?

388
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,600
Where's Rina?

389
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,090
Rina!

390
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,060
Take care of Sasin for me.

391
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,640
Also,

392
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,550
this is the little star I made for you.

393
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,800
Sasin said you wouldn't like it.

394
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,530
But

395
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,430
your job is dangerous.

396
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,310
Remember

397
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,340
to carry it with you.

398
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,440
Rina.

399
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,140
Rina!

400
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,670
Rina.

401
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,000
Search every inch.

402
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:56,920
Track those bastards down and tear them to pieces!

403
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,030
Follow me!

404
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,160
You, stop! Stay where you are!

405
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,980
Watch out! She's got explosives on her!

406
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,840
Take cover!

407
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,390
Help me! Help me, please!

408
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,350
Please, please, please.

409
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,680
I'll go take a look.

410
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,150
Stop moving!

411
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,440
Help me!

412
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,150
They tied a bomb to me.

413
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,470
Please, I don't want to die.

414
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,640
Don't worry. We can get you out of that.

415
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
Please, your arms up.

416
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,510
Okay.

417
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:56,550
Okay.

418
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,720
Just keep your arms in the air.

419
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,970
I know you're scared.

420
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,250
You need to cooperate.

421
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,950
Zan.

422
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,030
Come on. Get out of here! Move!

423
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,990
Come on!

424
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,200
Zan.

425
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,630
Come back!

426
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,850
Zan!

427
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,690
It took me a long time to fully understand the consequences

428
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,020
of that explosion and attack.

429
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,270
At the time, I was hit directly by the shockwave.

430
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,690
My spleen ruptured,

431
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,630
my cornea was partially damaged,

432
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,660
and I sustained multiple injuries.

433
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,880
I was rushed to the capital for emergency treatment

434
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
and was soon transferred back home.

435
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,820
For most of the journey,

436
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:57,920
I was unconscious.

437
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,200
I woke up sometimes,

438
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,290
but the intense pain

439
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,450
made me unable to move.

440
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,810
The world was a blur,

441
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,210
and the sounds around me were muffled and unclear.

442
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,930
But I knew one thing for sure—

443
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,040
[During the operation]

444
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,500
in those fragments of memories…

445
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,310
Zan.

446
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,960
Zan was not there.

447
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,780
You sure know how to play the good guy in front of our daughter.

448
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,400
Every time, I'm the one who has to be the bad guy.

449
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,670
Look at her now.

450
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,460
Tell me.

451
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,690
What should we do?

452
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,510
Calm down first.

453
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:37,390
The doctor said it's not serious.

454
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,030
She had surgery, and she's fine now.

455
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,960
No one wanted this to happen.

456
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,440
Do you think I'm not worried?

457
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,080
But this is the job she chose.

458
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,750
You've seen her success yourself.

459
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,310
You're so vain…

460
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:47,790
Zan.

461
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,310
And hypocritical.

462
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,480
You're being unreasonable.

463
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,000
How am I being unreasonable?

464
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,330
Listen, Song Zhicheng.

465
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,070
I only have one daughter.

466
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,000
You have plenty.

467
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,660
If anything happens to Ran,

468
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,540
I won't let this go.

469
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,030
Zan…

470
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,240
Ran.

471
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,060
Ran, you're awake.

472
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,830
Ran, you're awake.

473
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,650
How are you feeling?

474
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,310
Zan…

475
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,240
Zan…

476
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,690
What are you saying?

477
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,590
Ran, don't worry.

478
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,200
You'll be fine soon.

479
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,700
Your eyes are fine too.

480
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,570
The doctor said

481
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,650
you'll recover in a few days.

482
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,750
Ran, don't be afraid.

483
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,000
It's okay.

484
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,750
Zan…

485
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,640
A lot of people have come to see you.

486
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,440
The room is filled with flowers.

487
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,770
Once your eyes heal in a few days,

488
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,360
you'll be able to see them.

489
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,760
We even had to move some out.

490
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,920
Who came to see me?

491
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:00,210
The leaders and colleagues from the TV station.

492
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,980
I wasn't mistaken.

493
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,360
Go get a doctor.

494
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,200
Doctor.

495
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,790
There's no trace of Zan.

496
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,590
Doctor.

497
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,440
[Emergency Dept]

498
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,760
Over the next few days,

499
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,760
I kept calling everyone

500
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,719
and sending them emails.

501
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,280
Zan, Sasin, and Benjamin.

502
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,699
[Are you all okay? I miss you so much. Looking forward to your reply. Song Ran.]

503
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,310
But...

504
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:50,889
none of them

505
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,530
ever replied to me.

506
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,190
Zan.

507
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,430
Where are you?

508
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,270
Are you okay?

509
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,910
Time flies. Ran, you're getting discharged tomorrow.

510
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,470
We'll come pick you up tomorrow.

511
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,570
Where is Shen Bei?

512
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,640
She got transferred to the 16th floor.

513
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,630
She came back from Eastern Country in disgrace

514
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,490
yet still got into the most sought-after entertainment department.

515
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,280
She has connections after all.

516
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,590
Shen Bei isn't like that.

517
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,670
Don't talk about her that way anymore.

518
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,050
On the day of my discharge,

519
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,540
I even went to find Luo Zhan,

520
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,340
who I had only met once.

521
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,360
It felt like

522
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,620
he was my last straw to grasp.

523
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,070
Mr. Luo.

524
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,370
Ms. Song?

525
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,110
Why are you...

526
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,760
Li Zan

527
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,160
is in Liangcheng, right?

528
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,550
Who told you that?

529
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,970
Did he contact you?

530
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,000
No.

531
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,000
His car is clean,

532
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,840
so I thought…

533
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,500
I'm a bit of a neat freak.

534
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,230
I don't want his car to be dirty when he comes back.

535
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,120
Do you have any news about Li Zan?

536
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,380
Is he okay?

537
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,400
No.

538
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,880
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

539
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,450
If there's nothing urgent,

540
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,550
we don't really contact each other.

541
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,440
Why…

542
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,580
why wouldn't he be okay?

543
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,150
Mr. Luo,

544
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,940
haven't you seen the latest news from Eastern Country?

545
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,650
We were attacked

546
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,830
in Eastern Country.

547
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,620
I was injured and sent back home.

548
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,670
He was there too.

549
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,730
Li Zan will be fine!

550
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,020
If he's back, he'll definitely contact you.

551
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,730
Because he mentioned you to me.

552
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,800
He rarely mentioned anyone.

553
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,250
I have work to do.

554
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:18,910
I have to go.

555
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,520
Sorry.

556
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,510
The number you have reached

557
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,800
is not in service.

558
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,620
Why is his number not in service?

559
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,580
Could something really have happened to Li Zan?

560
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,040
Why didn't I call him more often before?

561
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,300
How's your recovery going?

562
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,360
I'm fully recovered now.

563
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,800
Don't worry.

564
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,440
That's good.

565
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,840
Oh, right,

566
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,440
there's something I need to tell you.

567
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,140
Your camera,

568
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,460
along with all the footage you shot in Eastern Country,

569
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,790
was brought by Shen Bei.

570
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,440
I have to say,

571
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,550
those photos

572
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:12,440
are really impressive.

573
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,920
The station has decided to select a few

574
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,720
to submit for the Boshi International News Award.

575
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,970
Pick some yourself.

576
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,360
Thank you.

577
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,270
I'll let you pick.

578
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,960
I'm fine with anything.

579
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,030
Alright then,

580
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,550
I'll pick them for you.

581
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Get back to work.

582
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,230
Excuse me.

583
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm looking for Shen Bei.

584
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,660
Is she here?

585
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,320
Shen Bei,

586
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,290
someone's looking for you.

587
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,250
She was just here.

588
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,030
Maybe she went to the restroom.

589
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,160
She'll be back soon.

590
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,320
That's her desk.

591
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,380
You can wait there.

592
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,710
Thank you.

593
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,640
You're welcome.

594
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,010
I know Shen Bei is avoiding me.

595
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,260
I understand.

596
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,110
Honestly,

597
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,390
I even think it might be a good idea.

598
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,960
After everything that happened in Happo,

599
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,920
everyone has something

600
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,230
they don't want to face.

601
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,020
I'm no different.

602
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:24,370
Song Ran?

603
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,300
You're amazing.

604
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,110
We've all seen the videos and photos

605
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,070
you took.

606
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,130
They're absolutely shocking.

607
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,130
The director said

608
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,190
your footage

609
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,120
is the only evidence of the attack.

610
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,740
It has caused an uproar internationally.

611
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,110
Many countries have started sending aid to Eastern Country.

612
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,510
Every traveler from afar

613
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,370
can reach out, take something from the tree,

614
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,150
and then walk away without looking back,

615
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,440
leaving it forgotten.
