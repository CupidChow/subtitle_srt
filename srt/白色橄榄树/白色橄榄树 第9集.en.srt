[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental]

4
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,509
Working in journalism,

5
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,530
I often witness moments

6
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,140
when ordinary people

7
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,340
become heroes.

8
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,370
But there are also

9
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,760
many moments full of malice.

10
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,220
Just as some people say,

11
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,240
there's as much kindness in this world

12
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,550
as malice.

13
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,970
But that's good.

14
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,250
At least half of it is kind.

15
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,260
♫Have you ever found someone♫

16
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,910
♫Who sees right through your smile♫

17
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,310
♫Your eyes♫

18
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,250
♫You're sick from the miles♫

19
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,780
♫Tires are low♫

20
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,060
♫But in his heart♫

21
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,180
♫There's a place to go♫

22
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,170
♫He will be the light and the darkness♫

23
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:17,140
♫In your highs and lows♫

24
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,940
♫And say, Te Amo♫

25
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,840
♫Still we don't know love♫

26
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,120

29
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,579
♫Just say, Te Amo♫

30
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,329
You...

31
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,560
♫Still we don't know how♫

32
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,450
♫But I feel loved♫

33
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,940
♫When I'm with you♫

34
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,620
Hey, kid.

35
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,990
I brought you a gift.

36
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,450
This is a little star.

37
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,590
It's a prize for your bravery.

38
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,440
Soldier.

39
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,460
Bring the kid to his parents.

40
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,180
You know that boy?

41
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,620
Not really.

42
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,070
But you were worried about his safety

43
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,360
and didn't want that bastard to hurt him.

44
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,130
It's not a bad thing to save someone

45
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,860
for a purpose other than money.

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,770
However, you're not the only one in the special force

47
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,659
who's good at shooting.

48
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,250
So,

49
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,440
if you disobey orders again,

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,880
leave the special force.

51
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,950
You deserve it.

52
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,330
You're gloating.

53
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,860
You stole my star.

54
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,590
I haven't got even with you yet.

55
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,350
You'd better

56
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,740
get the star back for me.

57
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,170
Otherwise, when you are kicked out of the special force,

58
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,830
I'll strike gongs and beat drums to send you off.

59
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,750
It's just a children's toy.

60
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,640
Isn't it embarrassing to keep it with you every day?

61
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,700
Yet you're reluctant to give it away.

62
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,420
Fine.

63
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,220
Just wait

64
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,159
for the day I get kicked out.

65
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,530
A bar?

66
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,620
There's still a bar open?

67
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:08,940
Yes.

68
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,520
I heard about it.

69
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,490
It's

70
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,340
on the business street

71
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,290
north of Happo University.

72
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Turns out

73
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,340
you pay attention to this, too.

74
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,330
I remember you said

75
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,690
you want to show people

76
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,620
the real Eastern Country.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,590
If you want to know

78
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,010
how young people in this city live,

79
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,560
you can go there and take a look.

80
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,610
You still remember that?

81
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,659
Of course.

82
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,180
You can also take a break there.

83
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:11,740
Me?

84
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,360
After all, there have been so many...

85
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,300
unnerving things going on lately.

86
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,110
It'd be great if you could take a break there, too.

87
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,420
Fall in!

88
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,310
Your bracelet...

89
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,390
It's broken.

90
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,050
Have you been wearing it for a long time?

91
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,690
Two years.

92
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,370
Maybe

93
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,920
it really warded off a disaster for you.

94
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,570
Buy a new one and put it on.

95
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,360
But I don't know

96
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,380
where I can get something like this.

97
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,299
I do.

98
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,570
I'll buy you one then.

99
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,680
Okay.

100
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,420
Thank you.

I think one hand is more than enough

to circle it.

This is for you.

149

Try mine

150

and see if it's sweet.

151
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,630
Sorry.

152
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,590
I was going to give that apple to you.

153

But you can't taste it anymore.

154
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,100
Thank you.

155
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,740
The apple was sweet.

156
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,960
What's wrong?

157
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:34,970
Nothing.

158
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,760
It's just that I thought

159
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,660
this would end soon.

160
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,240
But unexpectedly,

161
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,030
the conflict is getting worse.

162
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,780
Those bastards

163
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,890
are becoming more and more despicable.

164
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,000
My country is already poor.

165
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,140
Now, I feel...

166
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,970
helpless.

167
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,210
Song,

168
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,730
I'm really worried...

169
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,320
Worried about what?

170
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,470
I'm worried that my country

171
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,330
is doomed.

172
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,450
There's news!

173
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,470
Let's hope it's big news this time.

174
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,040
Over there! Over there.

175
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,420
Our suffering

176
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,130
has given many people a way to make a living

177
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,500
and helped many people receive honors.

178
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,950
This land

179
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,180
is like a giant tree

180
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,670
full of tragedies.

181
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,260
Everyone from afar

182
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,330
can get some fruit

183
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,330
from the tree.

184
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,270
Then, they leave without looking back

185
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,340
and forget this tree.

186
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,210
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,490
Sorry, Song.

188
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,030
I'm not criticizing them

189
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,420
or you.

190
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,330
God knows how much I like you.

191
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,310
I said that just now

192
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,610
just because

193
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,860
I found this world a bit ridiculous.

194
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,160
I understand.

195
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,610
Look.

196
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,380
You don't have to pay the money back.

197
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,060
There are many people like you,

198
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,400
who care about the fate of this country

199
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,500
and the fate of the people on this land.

200
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,330
So, I really think...

201
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,360
things will get better.

202
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,130
[Mom]

203
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,590
Mom.

204
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,590
You finally picked up.

205
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,560
I kept calling you, but you didn't answer.

206
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,740
You think you're amazing

207
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,800
just because you took a stupid photo?

208
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,450
No, Mom.

209
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,580
The signal is not good here.

210
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,670
Then why are you still there?

211
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,010
Do you think you're great?

212
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,250
You're seeking quick success.

213
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,330
In the past,

214
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,530
I didn't like getting calls from my mom.

215
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,280
She always said harsh words

216
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,420
that I didn't want to hear...

217
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,330
Don't think you can just keep quiet.

218
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,730
in a self-righteous way.

219
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,180
But now...

220
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,640
Even if you don't come to Dicheng...

221
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,140
the words I used to find harsh

222
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,260
suddenly became warm.

223
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,340
Risking your life to seek the limelight...

224
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,240
I think I want to hear more.

225
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,440
Got it.

226
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,390
I think you're just saying that.

227
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,000
All right. I have to go.

228
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,930
I have a conference call later.

229
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,980
I'm hanging up.

230
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,990
Stay safe.

231
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,760
Okay.

232
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,100
-Thank you.
-Sorry.

233
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,490
Do you think I'm an ungrateful person?

234
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,790
What are you sorry for?

235
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:39,450
You risked your life to save people in my country.

236
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,930
I can't thank you enough.

237
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,640
How can I blame you?

238
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,660
But I do blame you.

239
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,890
It was too dangerous.

240
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,530
If anything had happened to you,

241
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,010
I'd be responsible.

242
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,410
Don't be touched.

243
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,490
This is my quirk.

244
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,190
My mom always says

245
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,600
that I take myself too seriously,

246
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,610
thinking I'm responsible

247
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,610
for everything.

248
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,420
I ask for trouble,

249
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,020
while others may not appreciate it.

250
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
Why would others not appreciate it?

251
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,960
Do you think

252
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
everyone's ungrateful except you?

253
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,780
I think even Jiang Yu,

254
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,860
who's still young,

255
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,620
knows

256
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,860
you're good to him.

257
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,890
Otherwise, he wouldn't care about you so much.

258
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,690
When he saw the news,

259
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,690
he called you right away.

260
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,820
But I never fulfilled

261
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,900
my promise to him.

262
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,740
After his parents passed away,

263
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,290
I promised him

264
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,530
many times.

265
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,520
The last time I got injured,

266
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,580
I couldn't help telling him

267
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,210
that I'd take him and his grandparents to Eastern Country

268
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,820
at the end of this year

269
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,740
to live with me.

270
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,660
But actually...

271
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,090
I'm totally unsure.

272
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,440
You know what?

273
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,770
I'm actually a very ordinary person.

274
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,220
I think that sometimes,

275
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,450
no matter how hard I try,

276
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,480
there are many things I can't do well.

277
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,250
I can only let others down

278
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,870
and let Jiang Yu down

279
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,930
again and again.

280
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,550
Do you think I can be a good brother?

281
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,830
Will he blame me

282
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,190
or even...

283
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:25,860
hate me?

284
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,290
No.

285
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,460
He will know

286
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,870
you care about him.

287
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,050
Today, I told someone

288
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,520
there's as much kindness in this world

289
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,160
as malice.

290
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,660
I think

291
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,450
you're one of those who uphold kindness.

292
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
So are you.

293
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,550

The prices of material things will rise,

346
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,870
♫Has something special for me♫

347
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,180
but that of spirit can't.

348
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,490
Alcohol is spirit.

349
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,690
Yes.

350
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,540
Alcohol is spirit.

351
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,860
Sasin.

352
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,900
I really like the way you are now.

353
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,110
♫Come on, Santa baby♫

354
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,160
♫Please don't make me beg♫

355
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,400
♫I know you're a sweetheart♫

356
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,300
♫No matter what that old grinch said♫

357
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,380
In Chinese,

358
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,330
♫You think little Jacky and Jill♫

359
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,350
there's a phrase that means

360
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,350
♫Would notice one gift gone?♫

361
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,670
"living in a befuddled way, as if drunk or in a dream."

362
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,470
♫Let's open up that bag♫

363
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,380
Some books say

364
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,050
it's a bad phrase.

365
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,260
♫And see what you got going on♫

366
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,670
♫Santa♫

367
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:25,770
But I think

368
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,010
♫Won't you listen to me?♫

369
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,900
it's so charming.

370
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,250
♫I got a feeling that you finally see♫

371
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,370
♫Although I haven't been good♫

372
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,010
♫You know I'm not so bad♫

373
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,010
Living in a befuddled way, as if drunk or in a dream.

374
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,230
♫Gotta have a gift for me too♫

375
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,720
♫In that bag♫

376
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,510
♫Let's open that thing right up♫

377
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,610
♫And take a quick peek inside♫

378
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,010
If I had good wine like this

379
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,770
♫There's gotta be something floating around in there for me♫

380
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,800
and were in a beautiful dream like this very moment,

381
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,510
♫Maybe near that bottom corner♫

382
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,340
I'd be willing to not wake up again.

383
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,120
♫Something simple but something special♫

384
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,770
Never again!

385
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,400
♫Aw, Santa baby♫

386
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,430
♫Please don't make me beg, please♫

387
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,870
♫Please, Santa, please♫

388
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,620
In Chinese, there's also a line in a poem that goes,

389
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,190
"I only wish to get drunk and never be sober."

390
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,650
♫Aw, Santa, please, just lemme take a quick look♫

391
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,580
Wish

392
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,860
we'd never be sober.

393
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,760
Hey, everybody.

394
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Cheer up!

395
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,690
Cheers.

396
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,620
Hello,

397
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,290
Ms. Song.

398
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,750
Kid.

399
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,510
Are you an adult?

400
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,320
Can you drink here?

401
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,730
We shouldn't be surprised

402
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,900
to see you here.

403
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,220
I'm not surprised.

404
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,480
I just think he's a buzzkill.

405
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,390
How did you offend him this time?

406
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,630
His toy was stolen.

407
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,660
I just took his...

408
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,530
That girl

409
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,870
looks familiar.

410
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,390
That's Dr. Pei.

411
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:09,570
Ms. Song.

412
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,360
You're pretty,

413
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,840
but coming here dressed like this...

414
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,320
isn't good enough.

415
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,310
You should be dressed like Dr. Pei.

416
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:25,820
Dr. Pei

417
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,620
is not just good-looking.

418
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,450
She's popular

419
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,180
because she's good at dancing.

420
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,840
What?

421
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,430
You think I'm not good at dancing?

422
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,580
Boy,

423
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,730
watch carefully.

424
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:03,340
He's dancing well.

425
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,910
I need to use the bathroom.

426
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,900
Ms. Song.

427
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,730
I'm blushing.

428
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,830
Fortunately, I drank.

429
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,580
What a coincidence!

430
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,690
Why are you here?

431
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,620
It's not a coincidence.

432
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,660
It's him who told me about this bar.

433
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,820
What would you like to drink?

434
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,820
My treat.

435
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,500
No, thanks.

436
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,340
No.

437
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,940
You

438
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,010
gave me an apple today.

439
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,700
It's my turn to treat you now.

440
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,290
Okay.

441
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:56,180
Waiter.

442
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,410
Can I help you?

443
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,100
White wine.

444
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,940
Okay.

445
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,760
Thank you.

446
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,580
Your drink, sir.

447
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,500
Thank you.

448
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,660
Cheers.

449
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,660
Do you usually drink?

450
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:32,680
I don't drink much.

451
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,420
But among the volunteers,

452
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,300
there's a Russian

453
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,340
who carries some wine with him every day.

454
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,970
When he's sleepy,

455
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,210
he drinks some wine

456
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,700
to refresh himself.

457
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,480
Are you okay?

458
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,320
I just went back

459
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,240
and got some sleep.

460
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm quite energetic.

461
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,830
If I were you,

462
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,180
I wouldn't have woken up so soon.

463
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,380
Once, I slept from 10 AM

464
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,180
to 5 PM.

465
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,880
The explosion outside

466
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,270
didn't wake me up.

467
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,420
How sleepy were you?

468
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,900
What did you just say?

469
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,180
It was too noisy.

470
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,490
I didn't catch that.

471
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,210
I said,

472
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,190
why were you sleeping like a rock?

473
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,100
I don't know.

474
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,730
Anyway, when I woke up,

475
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,640
order on the streets had been restored.

476
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,000
By the way,

477
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,600
the bomb left a crack

478
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,970
in the wall of the place where I lived.

479
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,490
Is this good?

480
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,750
Do you want to try it?

481
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,180
Sure.

482
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,540
Why does it taste like this?

483
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,800
It's like drinking bullets.

484
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,100
Waiter.

485
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,280
What's so funny?

486
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,800
Not really.

487
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,720
Maybe

488
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,550
it's just that the music tonight is too relaxing,

489
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,450
and the bouquet of wine is too indulgent.

490
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,870
The blurry lights

491
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:56,860
are like a dream,

492
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,060

00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
who have a natural gift for dancing.

516
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,640
♫I'm so into you♫

517
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,460
If I dance,

518
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,370
it will be awkward.

519
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,630
♫I'm so into you♫

520
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,190
Then are you going back?

521
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,570
Yes.

522
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,620
Let me walk you back.

523
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,860
Are you drunk?

524
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,110
No.

525
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,690
I said I'd treat you.

526
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,610
Let's go.

527
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:12,500
Are you cold?

528
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,170
No.

529
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,130
It was a bit hot inside.

530
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,580
The temperature is perfect now.

531
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,420
It's cool.

532
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,920
♫When the moonlight♫

533
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:09,970
♫Glows on you♫

534
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,810
♫A soft glowing ring♫

535
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,460
Do you want

536
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,240
♫You're dancing in the grace♫

537
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,460
to dance?

538
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,090
Dance?

539
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,030
♫Moonlight, touch your face♫

540
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,800
There are

541
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,080
only the two of us here.

542
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,630
♫Weave their dreams away♫

543
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,210
If you take a misstep,

544
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,740
no one will laugh at you,

545
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,640
♫Let the stars fall in space♫

546
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,570
and you won't feel awkward.

547
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,390
♫As you're moving close to me♫

548
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,380
♫My heart will never believe♫

549
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,870
♫Cause you're so beautiful♫

550
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,110

♫Over in the sky, tonight♫

555
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,690
Hey, what are you two guys doing here?

556
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:15,790
Don't you see that?

557
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,460
The prince and the princess are dancing.

558
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,500
♫When the moonlight♫

559
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,630
♫Glows on you♫

560
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,500
♫Each step is singing in the light♫

561
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,280
♫The song of snowing the white♫

♫Moonlight♫

♫Over in the sky, tonight♫

575
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,410
I think this song

576
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,310
is not suitable for us.

577
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,500
Why?

578
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,570
No reason.

579
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:23,650
Dr. Pei,

580
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,780
why do I feel

581
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,100
you are afraid of me?

582
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,780
Are you shy?

583
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,420
Don't be so full of yourself.

584
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,090
I'm not afraid of you.

585
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,060
I'm not shy.

586
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,240
Then why are you running away?

587
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,760
I need to use the bathroom.

588
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,710
Can't I?

589
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,640
I'll see you at the bar.

590
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,970
Ms. Song and Zan have left.

591
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,670
Who told you I was looking for them?

592
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,460
Mind your own business.

593
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,360
You're so ungrateful.

594
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:34,930
Is it still because of that stupid star?

595
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,410
What stupid star?

596
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,130
Alright.

597
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,710
I'll get it back for you.

598
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,710
Okay?

599
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:44,900
What?

600
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,640
How...

601
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,880
How are you going to get it back for me?

602
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,300
I know that boy,

603
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,730
and I know where he lives.

604
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,400
I'll ask him for it cheekily.

605
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,680
Why are you staring at me?

606
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,620
You don't believe me?

607
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,840
I don't want to see your long face

608
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,880
every time we meet

609
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,920
as if I owed you a lot of money.

610
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,680
Then...

611
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,220
-I...
-Then...

612
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,800
Then you still don't know me.

613
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,170
When I see you angry,

614
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,290
I...

615
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,960
I feel very happy.

616
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,220
Well, you...

617
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,970
So, I'm not getting it back for you.
