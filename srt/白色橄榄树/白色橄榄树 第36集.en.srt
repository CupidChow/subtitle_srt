4
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
I wish you and Song a safe journey tomorrow.

5
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,009
I need to catch those who got away,

6
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,350
so I can't see you off.

7
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,510
I hope when you and Song get married,

8
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,400
I can go to China for your wedding…

9
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,280
and be your best man.

10
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,560
Alright.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,850
It's a deal.

12
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,590
I'm off.

13
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:32,870
Let's go.

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,800
Zan,

15
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,800
what should we do first when we get back?

16
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,730
What do you want to do first?

17
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,030
Let's talk about it when we get back.

18
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,980
Jose, what's wrong?

19
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,960
Zan…

20
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,370
Jose…

21
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,680
Jose, what are you doing?

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,910
Zan.

23
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,520
Zan!

24
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,490
Zan.

25
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,520
Zan.

26
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,350
Zan.

27
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,710
Let's go to the hospital.

28
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,400
Let's go to the hospital.

29
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's go to the hospital now.

30
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,680
It's okay.

31
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,310
Ran.

32
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,430
Ran.

33
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,400
Ran.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,310
Don't...

35
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,120
don't panic.

36
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,240
The stab isn't deep.

37
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,370
It's just a flesh wound,

38
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,430
like those minor injuries

39
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,680
I've had before.

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,430
Don't worry.

41
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,960
Trust me.

42
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,740
Zan.

43
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,560
Jose, why on earth did you do this?

44
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,910
It's like this.

45
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:00,840
Someone…

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,370
someone took little Sally.

47
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,390
He told me to kill Zan.

48
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,430
Otherwise...

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,040
otherwise, he'd kill Sally.

50
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,820
I'm the only one left at the orphanage.

51
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,430
Ben...

52
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,710
Ben and the others are gone too.

53
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,430
I...

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,680
Jose.

55
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,380
How many of them are there?

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,950
I only saw one.

57
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,310
Is he inside?

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,870
Yes.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,480
Ran.

60
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,360
Ran.

61
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,159
Go find

62
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,760
Benjamin and the others now.

63
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,000
He's alone at the moment.

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,330
I'm confident I can save Sally.

65
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,190
I just don't know

66
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,720
if he has any backup coming.

67
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,390
So you need to find Benjamin

68
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,990
and the others as soon as possible,

69
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,640
okay?

70
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,430
I can't.

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,360
I can't.

72
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't leave.

73
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,190
I can't leave.

74
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
Listen to me.

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,000
Right now, he's alone,

76
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,130
and I'm sure I can take him down.

77
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,150
But the longer we stay here,

78
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,560
the more likely he'll get suspicious,

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,160
and the more likely his reinforcements will arrive.

80
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,190
He's after me,

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,000
Ran.

82
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,360
Trust me.

83
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,040
Splitting up

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
is the best plan.

85
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,180
No.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,490
No.

Ran.

89
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,220
I promise you,

90
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,630
if it comes to the worst,

91
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,970
I'll choose to protect myself.

92
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,720
I'll do as you say.

93
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,240
Jose, Jose.

94
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,040
You shouldn't have stabbed Zan.

95
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,430
Pull yourself together.

96
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,550
Both of you have to stay alive.

97
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,100
You must stay alive.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,070
Okay.

99
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,470
Go now.

100
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:31,870
Jose,

101
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,520
I'll quickly stop the bleeding first.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,700
You go lure him out.

103
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,720
Make him think I'm done for.

104
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,860
As soon as he lets his guard down,

105
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,330
I'll have a chance to take him down.

106
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,390
But he's too heavy.

107
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,340
Step back.

108
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,570
I can't drag him back.

109
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,970
I could only bring you to take a look.

110
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,270
Back!

111
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,390
He's dead.

112
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,650
He's here.

113
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,830
You

114
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,870
and those special forces

115
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,830
have caused us big trouble!

116
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,140
We can't beat them,

117
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,160
but I can still deal with a volunteer like you.

118
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,030
Bu, did you get him?

119
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,470
Hey, speak!

120
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,940
Why aren't you talking?

121
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,670
You're not thinking of killing him, are you?

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Why not?

123
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,730
What kind of disaster has he put us in?

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,890
How many times do I have to tell you?

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,350
We need to keep him alive.

126
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,470
He can make bombs.

127
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,780
Also, your shooting

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,680
will attract

129
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,240
the special forces nearby.

130
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,690
Copy that.

131
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,600
You!

132
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,960
What?

133
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,310
Go and make a cut on his neck.

134
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:58,490
What?

135
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,270
Hurry up!

136
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,460
I can't.

137
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,190
Hurry up! Go!

138
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,120
Don't make me shoot you!

139
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,159
Hurry up!

140
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,070
Do it right away!

141
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,380
Bu, have you heard us?

142
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,000
We caught his woman.

143
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,240
This can make him suffer greatly.

144
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,020
You take him to Walite Street

145
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,170
and meet us.

146
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,080
I promise you, you'll get to vent your anger this time.

[Walite Street, Eastern Country]

148
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,030
Keep your mouth shut,

149

or I'll kill you!

Zan.

151
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,150
It's Zan. Keep driving forward.

152
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,680
See if there are any special forces behind us.

153

He's coming! He's coming!

Zan!

155

Go, Zan!

Zan, leave me!

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,430
♫This is our revolution♫

178
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,880
how would we explain it?

179
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,770
♫On fire, on fire♫

180
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,530
♫Reaching for the sky♫

181
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,510
♫And now we take it higher♫

182
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,700
♫This is our revolution, yeah♫

183
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,390
He can't save you! He's running away.

184
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,310
Why are you slowing down?

185
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,930
Why is there so much smoke?

186
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,450
What's happening?

187
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
That's coming from the tire!

188
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,370
Damn it!

189
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,670
Why is he carrying Bu's gun?

190
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,910
Zan, run!

191
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,720
Zan…

192
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,270
Bu is so useless.

193
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,600
Run!

194
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,200
Drop the gun and come with us!

195
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,780
Zan!

196
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,470
You don't care about her life?

197
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,850
I know I'm useful to you.

198
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,510
Let her go.

199
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,580
Take me.

200
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,550
Zan.

201
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,430
You want her?

202
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,120
Come here.

203
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,670
Zan!

204
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,790
Zan!

205
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,590
Zan!

206
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,130
Aren't you afraid of attracting the special forces?

207
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,780
Zan.

208
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,200
I'm begging you, please go.

209
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,710
Leave me.

210
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,000
Come on.

211
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,000
Come here.

212
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,170
Zan!

213
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,340
Zan.

214
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,990
Ran.

215
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,870
Don't be afraid.

216
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,890
It's okay.

217
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,620
Zan.

218
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,620
You promised me…

219
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,460
you'd keep yourself safe.

220
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,800
You must live well.

221
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,150
Live well.

222
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,100
Ran.

223
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,760
♫Heartache♫

-Blood pressure?
-88/57.

244
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,680
Prepare for surgery. The IV line has been established.

245
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,480
-Blood pressure?
-80/48.

246
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:48,960
Plasma.

247
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,070
1500 ml of type A blood is ready.

248
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,830
Not enough.

249
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,550
-Blood pressure?
-76/45. It's getting lower.

250
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,960
Start the surgery immediately.

251
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,920
Come on here.

252
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,860
Zan.

253
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,790
Zan…

254
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
Defibrillation.

255
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,070
Zan.

256
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,860
Is that you?

257
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,110
Zan.

258
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,550
Zan.

259
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,480
Zan.

260
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,030
Captain, Song is still in a coma.

261
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,470
I'll stay here.

262
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,350
You go back and have some rest.

263
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,980
You've barely slept for five days.

264
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,570
No.

265
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,000
I must take Zan back before Song wakes up.

266
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,520
We didn't get enough sleep,

267
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,040
but God knows what Zan has been through.

268
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,340
When she wakes up, tell her

269
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,750
to wait for us.

270
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,590
We promise to bring Zan back.

271
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,730
Yes, sir.

272
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,790
Let's go. I'll drive.

273
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,450
What are you doing? Why are we back in the camp?

274
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,450
Suke has a point.

275
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,270
We need to find Zan,

276
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,030
but before we do,

277
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,890
we need to make sure we stay alive.

278
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,190
Sasin, we'll take turns.

279
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,040
Tomorrow morning, you'll take over for me.

280
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,570
The two of us

281
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,010
are Zan's last hope.

282
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,580
We don't just need to find him;

283
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,090
we need to be able to bring him back.

284
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,550
But you,

285
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,320
Song,

286
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,470
Rena, and Sasin,

287
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,350
you made me feel

288
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,790
connected

289
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,030
to this world again.

290
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,560
I don't know how others see you,

291
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,840
but in my eyes,

292
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,400
you are all good people,

293
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,070
people I'd risk my life for.

294
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,240
You're like…

295
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,450
family?

296
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,690
Don't let Zan die. Dress his wounds.

297
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,940
We'll go first.

298
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,530
You take him when your car arrives.

299
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,460
It seems they're nearby.

300
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,410
We're going to transfer soon.

301
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,730
We'll eat something first.

302
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,560
Just lock the door.

303
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,900
Okay, let's go.

304
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
Did you see that?

305
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,190
He's actually crying.

306
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,350
Yeah.

307
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,550
He actually cried

308
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,350
after we killed that Asian girl.

309
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,070
He's such a tough guy.

310
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,390
He hasn't agreed to Boss's request.

311
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,790
You know, killing him would be a lot easier

312
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,460
than making him make a few bombs.

313
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,080
Let's go get a drink.

314
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,080
Ran.

315
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,690
Zan.

316
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,780
Yeah.

317
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,400
He actually cried

318
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,210
after we killed that Asian girl.

319
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,510
She wakes up!

320
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,670
Doctor, nurse!

321
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,800
Ran, run!

322
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,940
Zan.

323
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,200
Wake up, Zan.

324
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,000
Zan.

325
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,610
Shit!

326
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Where's the shooting coming from?

327
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,730
Let's go.

328
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,000
Let's find out.

329
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,720
Shit!

330
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,200
Go, go, go!

331
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,810
It's the special forces.

332
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,870
Call for support. They're trying to rescue Zan!

333
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,010
Zan.

334
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,070
Zan!

335
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,400
Hang in there.

336
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,000
I'll definitely take you to see Song Ran.

337
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,640
Looks like he's on his own.

338
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,160
Be careful!

339
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,680
Zan.

340
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,140
Did you hear me?

341
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,320
Let's go.

342
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,600
Stop! Stop running!

343
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,750
Stop there!

344
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,160
They're over there!

345
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,960
Find those two bastards!

346
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,600
Don't let them get away!

347
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Hurry up!

348
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,310
They're around the corner!

349
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,510
Almost to the gate.

350
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,880
Don't let them leave!

351
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,160
Go, go, go!

352
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,700
There's only one special forces guy.

353
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,310
Don't be afraid.

354
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,110
Don't kill Li Zan.

355
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,080
Take out the other one.

356
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,750
Stay close to me.

357
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,500
Go, go, go!

358
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,110
Be careful!

359
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,180
We want him alive!

360
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,720
Zan!

361
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,070
Zan!

362
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,010
Zan!

363
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,150
Ben, leave.

364
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,040
You can't do this alone.

365
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,360
Go get some backup.

366
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,660
I want to see Ran again.

367
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,150
Open the door!

368
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:16,830
Zan!

369
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,490
Open the door, Zan!

370
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,620
Break his fingers.

371
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,530
Pull him away.

372
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,560
Shit!

373
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,820
Zan.

374
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:25,910
Open the door, Zan!

375
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:26,630
Over here.

376
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,940
Don't let him run off.

377
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,410
He ran that way!

378
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,820
I think I got him!

379
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,720
Go, go, go!

380
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,750
Benjamin!

381
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,150
I put a tracker on Li Zan.

382
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,210
Go and save Li Zan.

383
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,840
Song.

384
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,690
Zan.

385
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,960
Ben.

386
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,200
Ben.

387
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,800
Ben.

388
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,230
Ben.

389
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,850
Song, Captain found Zan.

390
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,889
Sasin went for him himself.

391
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,320
He'll bring him back.

392
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,590
Doctor!

393
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,730
Doctor!

394
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,880
Help us. This man is dying!

395
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,280
Hurry up! Prepare for surgery!

396
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,480
Hurry up! He's dying.

397
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,320
Zan, Zan!

398
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,630
Doctor, please, save him!

399
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,630
Hurry up! The operating room!

400
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,250
Where's Benjamin?

401
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,930
In the operating room downstairs.

402
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,720
♫We're at the farewell station again♫

403
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,290
♫I wait with you but don't want the train to come♫

404
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,220
♫I can't find you♫

405
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,670
♫You don't belong to me anymore♫

406
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:37,100
♫We look at each other from afar♫

407
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,820
♫Far away from each other♫

408
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,070
♫Now, on other ends of the earth♫

409
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:55,340
♫How many places do you want to go?♫

410
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,700
♫When the flight and distance♫

411
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,450
♫Are no longer problems♫

412
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,520
♫Unfortunately♫

413
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,040
♫We lost contact long ago♫

414
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:16,530
♫When love is buried deep♫

415
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:20,590
♫The castle piled up on the beach♫

416
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,800
Zan!

417
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:24,620
♫Time washes it away♫

418
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,200
♫Let me guess♫

419
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:31,320
♫Have you ever walked into♫

420
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,230
♫The castle you built for me♫

421
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,780
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

422
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:46,710
♫This love is deeply buried♫

423
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,090
♫The castle piled up on the beach♫

424
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,120
♫Time washes it away♫

425
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,360
Bullets

426
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,420
♫Let me guess, have you ever walked into♫

427
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,710
severely damaged his liver and right kidney.

428
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:03,310
♫The castle you built♫

429
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,640
We tried our best.

430
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:09,610
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

431
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,670
The hormone

432
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,600
we just injected into him

433
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,440
might wake him up

434
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,110
for a few minutes.

435
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,640
♫Let me guess, have you ever walked into♫

436
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,800
No more than half an hour.

437
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,920
Seize this moment

438
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:19,660
♫The castle you built for me♫

439
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,520
and say what you want to.

440
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:26,870
♫And disappeared at dawn?♫

441
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,960
Zan…

442
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,040
Has Zan been rescued?

443
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,800
Yes.

444
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,330
When we arrived there,

445
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,690
those bastards had already left.

446
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,940
But the tracker you placed in the star

447
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,660
allowed us to locate them quickly.

448
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,940
Hang in there.

449
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,440
I'll definitely take you to see Song Ran.

450
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,540
You tricked me again.

451
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,090
You were lying here slacking off

452
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,940
while using a tracker to make us do the hard work.

453
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,130
You don't get any credit for rescuing Zan.

454
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,290
What about those bastards?

455
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,090
Did you catch them?

456
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,590
No,

457
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,370
we didn't catch any of them.

458
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,980
We killed them all.

459
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,710
Good.

460
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,930
You made them all pay with their lives for mine.

461
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,690
I won in the end.

462
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,000
What?

463
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,350
Why are you staring at me?

464
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,450
Even cats and dogs have a sense of their own death.

465
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,880
You don't think

466
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:32,090
I'm worse than a small animal, do you?

467
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,690
It's my fault.

468
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,060
I got you into this mess.

469
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,630
Otherwise,

470
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,640
you'd have left Eastern Country long ago.

471
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,960
I dragged you into this war

472
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,550
that had nothing to do with you.

473
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,020
I should give my life to repay you.

474
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,360
But

475
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,230
how can I

476
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,490
repay you with my life?

477
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:01,450
Sasin,

478
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,820
at a time like this,

479
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,970
I'll just speak my mind.

480
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:10,960
You

481
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,920
and Rena

482
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,470
are like family to me.

483
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:21,580
If you really want to repay me,

484
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,320
then

485
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,490
finish your journalism degree at Todewell University

486
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,180
and become a journalist in the future.

487
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,630
I want to see

488
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,440
the orphans in Rena's orphanage

489
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,630
look up

490
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,190
and see you on TV

491
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,220
reporting the news

492
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,840
with a serious face.

493
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,580
That would be hilarious.

494
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,100
What's hilarious about that?

495
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,510
Don't all news reporters have serious faces?

496
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,440
I think

497
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,920
the children would be so disappointed after watching that.

498
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,880
Unlike me,

499
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,340
who would still say I want to be a journalist.

500
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,620
Stop talking nonsense.

501
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,150
Shut up already.

502
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,840
Sasin,

503
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,250
you're disrespecting your superior again.

504
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,150
Remember this:

505
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:36,480
even if one day I'm not your captain anymore,

506
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,900
I'm still your brother.
