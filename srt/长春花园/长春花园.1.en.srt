00:00:51,157 --> 00:00:52,597
(specific person,
place, or building)

3
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,074
Is this the place?

4
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,199
Yeah.

5
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:52,532
Let's go inside.

6
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:58,866
You stay here.

7
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,299
Be on the lookout,

8
00:02:01,366 --> 00:02:02,726
and catch her if she tries to run.

9
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:06,366
All right.

10
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:14,699
What the hell?

11
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:36,074
Let's spread out.

12
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,049
Yell out if you find her.

13
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,366
Okay.

14
00:02:46,116 --> 00:02:47,824
Wow!

15
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:50,824
Hold on...

16
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:13,741
Huh?

17
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:35,532
What the hell?

18
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:01,449
That idiot...

19
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:29,241
Not so brave now, are you?

20
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,866
You think that's funny,
you crazy woman?

21
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:39,699
What is it?

22
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:41,574
Over there...

23
00:05:45,032 --> 00:05:46,032
Never mind.

24
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:47,866
Did you find her?

25
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:50,074
She must have run away.

26
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:54,032
Hey, get down here!

27
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,032
Did you find her?

28
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:04,657
No, she's not here.

29
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,866
Then, why did you call us?

30
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,057
- Wait a second...
- Why?

31
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:18,241
Why are there four?

32
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,449
Four?

33
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:24,241
- What?
- The lights...

34
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:28,574
I just saw Young-suk outside.

35
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:31,033
Then, there should only be three.

36
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,491
Hey, Young-suk!

37
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:43,574
Ji Young-suk!
Don't play games with us!

38
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,783
Turn off your light!

39
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:56,471
Let's turn off our lights,
one by one.

40
00:06:59,574 --> 00:07:00,616
Moon-hee.

41
00:07:01,241 --> 00:07:02,324
Eun-joo.

42
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:04,158
Jin-rae.

43
00:07:07,783 --> 00:07:09,449
Are you really Young-suk?

44
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,699
Answer us, you punk!

45
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:24,699
Cut it out, you freak!

46
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:27,908
Hey, stop it!

47
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:57,741
(Spring Garden)

48
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:19,866
Honey...

49
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:21,949
Honey...

50
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:24,616
Honey...

51
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:13,991
(Police)

52
00:09:29,741 --> 00:09:30,866
Hello, ma'am.

53
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,840
It took longer than I expected.

54
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:38,282
Are the results in?

55
00:09:40,032 --> 00:09:42,116
Your husband's cause of death
seems to be suicide.

56
00:09:42,657 --> 00:09:44,157
There are no signs
of murder at all.

57
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:48,307
But wouldn't he have left a note?

58
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,507
Or at least organized his shoes?

59
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:53,215
That's what
I'm wondering, as well.

60
00:09:53,282 --> 00:09:57,549
It's your job to find out
what happened...

61
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:58,758
How could a healthy man
die all of a sudden?

62
00:09:58,782 --> 00:10:03,282
You don't know, either!
So keep your mouth shut!

63
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:05,674
That's my point!

64
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:07,340
You and I may not know,

65
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:09,991
but your sister
was living with him!

66
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:12,840
Why isn't she telling us anything?

67
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:16,799
Your sister must have
caused Chang-soo's suicide!

68
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,449
- What?
- What do you mean?

69
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:20,343
- So-hee...
- You think I was cheating on him?

70
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:21,674
You think I was cheating on him?

71
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:25,049
Why else would
my brother hang himself?

72
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,699
What are you all doing?

73
00:10:29,574 --> 00:10:30,949
Give it a rest.

74
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,757
I knew marrying a girl

75
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:37,366
from a worthless family
would cause trouble.

76
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:46,157
You pricks!

77
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:49,007
Are you two even human?

78
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,699
You jerk!

79
00:10:53,907 --> 00:10:55,241
Let go!

80
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:02,741
Let go of her! Let go!

81
00:11:08,907 --> 00:11:10,974
Please stop!

82
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:31,807
So-hee...

83
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:34,782
So-hee!

84
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:38,932
So-hee!

(Hong So-hee Under Operation)

86
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:52,491
Are you Hong So-hee's guardian?

87
00:11:53,116 --> 00:11:56,257
Yes, that's right.

88
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:58,032
The mother is okay.

89
00:11:58,824 --> 00:12:02,016
But the baby didn't make it.

90
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:26,032
Come to my place.

91
00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:30,199
Don't worry about me.

92
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,741
You can come to my place!

93
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:39,741
So-hee!

(Bo-mi)

96
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:27,340
Hello?

97
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:28,741
Is this Ms. Hong So-hee?

98
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:33,324
Hello? Ms. Hong?

99
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:39,424
Yes, please go on.

100
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:41,866
I'm Park Ah-hyung,
attorney at law.

101
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:44,724
An attorney?

102
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:51,199
These are the files
related to your inheritance.

103
00:14:55,407 --> 00:14:56,741
What is this?

104
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,257
That house is your inheritance.

105
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,241
It's under your name.

106
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:03,366
Wow...

107
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:07,049
He never mentioned it to me.

108
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:11,349
He wanted to wait
until the house was finished.

109
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:20,157
You said that you found
something strange?

110
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:25,699
Take a look.

111
00:15:31,824 --> 00:15:34,257
One of our employees
took this picture.

112
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:35,616
Chang-soo?

113
00:15:37,366 --> 00:15:40,199
It looks like Mr. Seo, right?

114
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:41,741
Yes, it does.

115
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:46,574
The strange thing is,
that was taken two days ago.

116
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:48,782
Two days ago?

117
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:10,657
Hiding, are you?

118
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:42,782
This must be it.

119
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:22,657
Hold on...

120
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:27,739
What kind of place
do you want to live in?

121
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:36,349
I want to remodel a house
in a remote location.

122
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,174
There needs to be a yard

123
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,907
and a swing for our child.

124
00:18:45,074 --> 00:18:46,074
Most importantly...

125
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:49,866
There should be a flower garden.

126
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,302
I'll even name the garden.

127
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,924
May all of our days
be like spring...

128
00:18:58,991 --> 00:19:00,369
'Spring Garden.'

129
00:19:03,491 --> 00:19:04,491
So-hee!

130
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,159
Someone must have broken in.

131
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,741
We should clean this up.

132
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:25,741
This was here?

133
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:31,366
I'll clean this up.
You should go rest.

134
00:19:49,282 --> 00:19:51,507
Sweetie, did you get home?

135
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:53,241
Dad didn't come to pick me up.

136
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:56,116
What? He didn't?

137
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:30,782
So-hee!

138
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:03,616
Your husband put
a lot of effort into that house.

139
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,974
After all that preparation,
what a shame...

140
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,215
Hye-ran, stop the car!

141
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:18,212
Why?

142
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:19,532
Hong So-hee!

143
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:28,699
Hey, wait!

144
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:36,741
Excuse me...

145
00:22:41,616 --> 00:22:42,909
Who are you?

(Neuropsychiatry Park Sang-uk)

147
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,099
The surgery department
wants my opinion.

148
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:33,569
Your MRI results are clean.

149
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:39,641
I've heard your husband
passed away recently.

150
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:42,682
Could we talk about that first?

151
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,157
After he died,

152
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:50,491
there have been
several strange incidents.

153
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:56,779
Stress can cause hallucinations?

154
00:23:57,824 --> 00:23:59,474
That's what he said.

155
00:23:59,866 --> 00:24:01,712
He also said it will go away.

156
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:05,369
I knew it!

157
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,069
Do you really think
it's because of stress?

158
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,699
Do you think you saw a ghost?

159
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,132
I'm not sure.

160
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:18,132
But it was Chang-soo.

161
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:19,882
He was trying to
tell me something.

162
00:24:19,949 --> 00:24:21,032
So-hee.

163
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:26,069
It was definitely him.

164
00:24:26,907 --> 00:24:28,532
So-hee...

165
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,724
Hey, Hong So-hee!

166
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,215
Don't scratch anything.

167
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,569
1st floor, please.

168
00:25:36,491 --> 00:25:39,049
I told you to rest inside!

169
00:25:39,116 --> 00:25:40,199
I'll move one more box.

170
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,199
Have a cold drink.

171
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:52,829
So-hee, will you be okay
on your own?

172
00:25:54,532 --> 00:25:57,869
Just come live with me.

173
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:00,829
My husband and kids all like you.

174
00:26:01,432 --> 00:26:03,141
Don't worry, I'm not a child.

175
00:26:04,116 --> 00:26:06,199
My husband remodeled
this house for me.

176
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,699
I should live here,

177
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,116
for his sake.

179
00:26:51,866 --> 00:26:54,174
Hey, sis.

180
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:58,119
No, don't bring anything.

181
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:00,882
It's not a housewarming party.

182
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,949
It's just a family meal.

183
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:06,224
Okay, drive carefully.

184
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:26,882
- Welcome!
- Hello!

185
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:29,907
- Careful, everyone.
- Wow!

186
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:31,866
It's nice, isn't it?

187
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:54,965
Should we order Chinese food?

188
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,532
- Yes.
- Yeah.

189
00:27:58,199 --> 00:27:59,465
It's my turn!

190
00:27:59,532 --> 00:28:01,007
Barley, barley, rice!

191
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:02,549
Yay, I won!

192
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:05,069
You can play on the swing outside.

193
00:28:08,449 --> 00:28:09,449
Go play.

194
00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:12,659
Don't run!

195
00:28:14,116 --> 00:28:17,016
It's fine, I don't have
downstairs neighbors.

196
00:28:17,574 --> 00:28:18,674
Oh, right.

197
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:20,074
Run around!

198
00:28:22,116 --> 00:28:23,002
Rascals...

199
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:24,069
One.

200
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:26,657
Two.

201
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:29,199
Three.

202
00:28:30,532 --> 00:28:31,866
Four.

203
00:28:33,199 --> 00:28:34,699
Five.

204
00:28:35,282 --> 00:28:36,991
Six.

205
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,949
Where are you going?

206
00:28:49,016 --> 00:28:50,491
Keep pushing me!

207
00:28:59,866 --> 00:29:01,516
What are you doing there?

208
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,391
Are you hurt?

209
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:07,349
Do you want me to pull you out?

210
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:24,574
What was that noise?

211
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:27,616
Ji-won!

212
00:29:28,807 --> 00:29:30,449
What happened?

213
00:29:33,324 --> 00:29:35,949
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

214
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:40,532
Park Dong-hyun, did you do this?

215
00:29:41,699 --> 00:29:42,699
No.

216
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,116
Ji-won...

217
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:48,449
Uncle...

218
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:50,491
Uncle?

219
00:29:51,741 --> 00:29:52,866
What's wrong?

220
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:57,592
Uncle Chang-soo pulled me in,

221
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,366
and told me he wanted to be free.

222
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:24,907
- Mom...
- Yeah?

223
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,241
Ji-won lied.

224
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:29,840
About what?

225
00:30:29,907 --> 00:30:32,891
It wasn't Uncle Chang-soo.

226
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,349
- Who was it, then?
- An older girl.

227
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:39,724
- An older girl?
- Yeah.

228
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,116
Ouch...

229
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:40,279
Rock, paper, scissors!

230
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,699
Minus one!

231
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:47,069
What is it?

232
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,569
- Is your arm okay?
- Yeah.

233
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:55,908
Did you really see
Uncle last night?

234
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:57,807
Uncle?

235
00:31:58,366 --> 00:32:00,989
Mom, Uncle's dead.

236
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:06,529
Was it an older girl,
like Dong-hyun said?

237
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,516
I never said that.

238
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,324
What?

239
00:32:10,949 --> 00:32:13,299
You said that you saw her!

240
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:15,262
When did I say that?

241
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,891
Mom, what's wrong with you?

242
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,932
Mom, Dong-hyun's
kindergarten bus is here.

243
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:26,909
Right.

244
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:43,329
(...shouts loudly)

245
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:49,116
Hye-ran?

246
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:00,283
Chang-soo?

247
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:42,658
Chang-soo...

248
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:52,533
Say something!

249
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:38,369
(Maternal Note)

250
00:38:55,491 --> 00:38:57,449
This is our school uniform.

251
00:38:58,074 --> 00:38:59,369
What is this about?

252
00:39:01,783 --> 00:39:02,829
Well...

253
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,099
We can't help you
without any information.

254
00:39:06,699 --> 00:39:08,924
Sometimes, parents come
looking for their kids

255
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:11,616
because of custody
or financial issues.

256
00:39:12,074 --> 00:39:13,954
It's against school rules
to tell them anything.

257
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:18,074
I have a class to teach.

258
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,324
Hey...

259
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:32,408
Excuse me...

260
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:36,949
- Hey...
- Me?

261
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,199
Do you know her?

262
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,529
Hey, what are you doing?

263
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:30,991
Who are you?

264
00:41:36,324 --> 00:41:38,032
Leave this house immediately!

265
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:41,099
You're the one who's trespassing!

266
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:44,224
Leave, before I call the police!

267
00:41:50,866 --> 00:41:51,866
Take this.

268
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:58,324
If it enters your body,

269
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,507
you'll turn into the living dead.

270
00:42:01,574 --> 00:42:02,641
Remember that.

271
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:05,932
Don't beg for death later on.

272
00:42:16,866 --> 00:42:18,409
The teacher told me

273
00:42:19,391 --> 00:42:20,849
that you're looking for Hyun-joo.

274
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:32,682
I think my husband
hid this picture.

275
00:42:36,324 --> 00:42:39,241
Why would he do that?

276
00:42:39,783 --> 00:42:43,007
I thought she might know something

277
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:44,074
about his death.

278
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:48,491
What about you, Detective Nam?

279
00:42:49,016 --> 00:42:51,807
I'm also looking for her.

280
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:54,658
She ran away from home months ago.

281
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,033
Do you know her location?

282
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:02,574
Hello?

283
00:43:04,866 --> 00:43:07,329
Please excuse me.

284
00:44:08,324 --> 00:44:11,779
- How ridiculous!
- What the hell?

285
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:17,212
- Look at his face!
- You should have called me!

286
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,341
Don't mess with me!

287
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,216
- This is you?
- Yeah.

288
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:25,557
You're both idiots, you know that?

289
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:31,724
You know her, right? Eun Hyun-joo.

290
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:36,216
What?

291
00:44:36,283 --> 00:44:37,557
Do you know where she is?

292
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:39,424
Who the hell are you?

293
00:44:39,491 --> 00:44:40,807
Why are you looking for her?

294
00:44:43,074 --> 00:44:44,974
Why shouldn't I?

295
00:44:45,741 --> 00:44:47,949
- You know her, right?
- Forget this.

296
00:44:48,616 --> 00:44:49,616
Let's go.

297
00:44:50,574 --> 00:44:52,807
- Hold on...
- We're leaving!

298
00:44:56,866 --> 00:44:58,307
Please wait!

299
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:02,424
- Do you know where she is?
- Dammit, let's just go!

300
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,799
Dammit...

301
00:45:04,866 --> 00:45:06,408
Wait!

302
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:10,552
Just tell me where she is.
You must know.

303
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,908
Where is she now?

304
00:45:13,241 --> 00:45:14,409
Wait!

305
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:23,619
What the...

306
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:25,989
It was her, right?

307
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:28,382
What? I can't hear you!

308
00:45:28,449 --> 00:45:30,462
It was Hyun-joo!

309
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,216
You're right!

310
00:45:32,283 --> 00:45:33,829
Dammit.

311
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:41,869
- Damn!
- What's wrong?

312
00:46:07,324 --> 00:46:09,574
Where the hell is she?

313
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:19,507
Are you Jin-rae?

314
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:22,529
- What the hell?
- Wait!

315
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:28,007
(Under repair)

316
00:46:28,074 --> 00:46:29,674
Dammit...

317
00:46:29,741 --> 00:46:32,632
Jin-rae, I'm not the police.

318
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:34,182
What do you want?

319
00:46:34,783 --> 00:46:36,307
You said you wanted to join us.

320
00:46:38,158 --> 00:46:39,239
You?

321
00:46:39,658 --> 00:46:40,766
I'm sorry I lied.

322
00:46:41,658 --> 00:46:43,432
I just want to ask you something.

323
00:46:51,783 --> 00:46:53,632
Take a look at this picture.

324
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:55,699
I'll even pay you.

325
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:08,224
Look carefully. Do you know him?

326
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:12,141
Who is this?

327
00:47:13,616 --> 00:47:17,682
- You really don't know?
- I have no clue!

328
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:19,574
Who is it?

329
00:47:19,866 --> 00:47:21,241
It's my husband.

330
00:47:22,029 --> 00:47:23,569
What the hell?

331
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,069
This is important to me!

332
00:47:26,574 --> 00:47:29,974
You've never blackmailed him?

333
00:47:34,616 --> 00:47:36,029
I've never seen him before.

334
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:41,279
Is Hyun-joo staying with you?

335
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:43,819
Why are you looking for her?

336
00:47:44,283 --> 00:47:45,529
She's not with you?

337
00:47:47,074 --> 00:47:48,557
I haven't seen her
for a long time.

338
00:47:51,658 --> 00:47:52,824
Wait.

339
00:47:53,074 --> 00:47:54,199
What now?

340
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:58,099
Take this.

341
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:02,432
It's fine.

342
00:48:03,574 --> 00:48:04,574
Just take it.

343
00:49:36,116 --> 00:49:37,641
Damn...

344
00:49:48,741 --> 00:49:49,782
What the...?

345
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:52,591
What the?

346
00:49:52,658 --> 00:49:53,866
What the hell is that?

347
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,275
Dammit... Damn...

348
00:50:15,866 --> 00:50:17,116
Crap...

349
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:20,057
Dammit...

350
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:54,882
He muttered something.

351
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:57,674
Then, he spat on
the ground and left!

352
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:59,182
It was so creepy!

353
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:01,741
What is it?

354
00:51:03,158 --> 00:51:06,307
Let's just call the police.

355
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:18,409
What the hell?

356
00:51:37,069 --> 00:51:39,739
(Cheonwol Shrine)

357
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:44,533
Who are you?

358
00:51:45,116 --> 00:51:47,057
Why are you doing this?

359
00:51:49,533 --> 00:51:51,757
What the hell are you doing?

360
00:51:51,824 --> 00:51:53,159
It's already inside you.

361
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:56,349
Don't step outside the house.

362
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:58,932
Are you trying to scam me?

363
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:01,099
You must be behind everything.

364
00:52:02,033 --> 00:52:03,974
Why are you doing this?

365
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:09,074
You must die in there! Die!

366
00:52:18,366 --> 00:52:21,091
So-hee, calm down!

367
00:52:21,158 --> 00:52:23,074
Just calm down!

368
00:52:49,283 --> 00:52:50,432
- Did you check?
- Yes.

369
00:52:51,408 --> 00:52:53,757
Hong So-hee met with
the kids before they died.

370
00:52:53,824 --> 00:52:55,744
But she was somewhere else
when they were killed.

371
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:59,241
Both times, her cell phone
pinged miles away.

372
00:53:02,241 --> 00:53:03,132
Where are you going?

373
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:04,449
I have to check something.

374
00:53:14,779 --> 00:53:17,766
I'm fine. Nothing happened.

375
00:53:18,283 --> 00:53:19,882
Really?

376
00:53:19,949 --> 00:53:21,757
Yeah, really.

377
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:25,174
I'll bring some herbal
medicine for you.

378
00:53:25,241 --> 00:53:26,241
Why?

379
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:19,007
Hello?

380
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:21,349
Is anyone home?

381
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:40,182
Excuse me...

382
00:54:41,408 --> 00:54:42,682
Is nobody home?

383
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:52,949
Is someone there?

384
00:55:05,783 --> 00:55:07,158
Who are you?

385
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:12,266
Are you Eun-joo?

386
00:55:13,408 --> 00:55:14,408
Who are you?

387
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:17,266
Could we have a talk?

388
00:55:19,908 --> 00:55:21,199
You know Jin-rae, right?

389
00:55:21,741 --> 00:55:25,619
He said you might know
where someone is.

390
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:27,716
Who?

391
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:29,849
Hyun-joo. Eun Hyun-joo.

392
00:55:30,991 --> 00:55:32,382
Do you know where she is?

393
00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:34,641
Why are you
looking for that woman?

394
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:41,682
What on earth happened?

395
00:55:42,283 --> 00:55:43,616
I did nothing wrong!

396
00:55:44,783 --> 00:55:47,016
She wanted it!

397
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:50,724
What do you mean?

398
00:55:56,324 --> 00:55:57,641
Are you Hyun-joo?

399
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:02,532
Hi.

400
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:22,533
Come in. We're family now.

401
00:56:22,991 --> 00:56:24,974
Oh, wow!

402
00:56:25,574 --> 00:56:28,674
- Welcome!
- Let's go in.

403
00:56:28,741 --> 00:56:32,674
- Drink! Drink!
- Hurry up.

404
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:40,741
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

405
00:56:40,908 --> 00:56:42,341
Not bad!

406
00:56:42,408 --> 00:56:46,341
- Drink, drink!
- One more drink!

407
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:52,382
One more drink! One more drink!

408
00:56:52,449 --> 00:56:54,574
Let's drink some more!

409
00:57:37,158 --> 00:57:39,882
Where are you going?

410
00:57:39,949 --> 00:57:43,949
Where do you think you're going?

411
00:57:49,908 --> 00:57:53,932
Do you want us to
spread the video?

412
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:07,199
Let's go.

413
00:58:09,158 --> 00:58:11,132
A while later, Young-suk said

414
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,699
that he saw her
go into some house.

415
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:17,549
You went after her
to use her again?

416
00:58:17,616 --> 00:58:18,641
That's right.

417
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:20,300
Family members
should make sacrifices

418
00:58:20,324 --> 00:58:21,349
for each other.

419
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,557
That's not family!

420
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:26,741
That's not sacrifice!

421
00:58:27,616 --> 00:58:30,099
Where's Hyun-joo now?

422
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:32,699
She's still in there.

423
00:58:33,908 --> 00:58:34,908
Where?

424
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:37,016
The basement.

425
00:59:15,116 --> 00:59:16,341
(Cheonwol Shrine)

426
00:59:16,408 --> 00:59:20,283
You must die in there! Die!

427
00:59:46,741 --> 00:59:47,741
What's up?

428
00:59:56,033 --> 00:59:58,132
Hong So-hee's fingerprints

429
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,807
were found on the umbrella.

430
01:00:00,491 --> 01:00:02,266
Got it.

431
01:00:43,074 --> 01:00:45,682
Me? Why?

432
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:57,449
Over there?

433
01:01:05,616 --> 01:01:07,239
Where did she go?

434
01:01:07,741 --> 01:01:09,074
Park Ji-won!

435
01:01:12,283 --> 01:01:13,533
Ji-won!

436
01:01:14,533 --> 01:01:16,741
Answer me, or I'll scold you!

437
01:01:21,529 --> 01:01:22,824
Make way.

438
01:01:30,158 --> 01:01:32,016
Where did she go?

439
01:01:35,783 --> 01:01:37,224
Park Ji-won!

440
01:01:49,074 --> 01:01:50,599
You can't come inside.

441
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:52,574
Eun-joo...

442
01:01:56,824 --> 01:01:59,241
You'll never believe me...

443
01:02:01,241 --> 01:02:03,116
But I didn't hurt Eun-joo.

444
01:02:04,908 --> 01:02:06,408
Are you joking?

445
01:02:07,074 --> 01:02:09,007
I saw it with my own eyes!

446
01:02:09,074 --> 01:02:10,658
I'm telling the truth.

447
01:02:11,949 --> 01:02:14,533
I don't get it, either...

448
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:17,449
But it wasn't me.

449
01:02:18,283 --> 01:02:19,174
You killed those kids

450
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:20,591
to avenge your husband's death.

451
01:02:20,658 --> 01:02:22,574
You also created
a false alibi, right?

452
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:27,239
Hong So-hee, who else
could have done this?

453
01:02:30,574 --> 01:02:32,491
Will you still deny it?

454
01:02:47,324 --> 01:02:48,132
You know her, right?

455
01:02:48,199 --> 01:02:49,199
Dammit...

456
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:52,424
It's already inside you.

457
01:02:52,491 --> 01:02:54,641
Don't step outside the house.

458
01:03:30,574 --> 01:03:32,074
(Hye-ran)

459
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:36,007
So-hee, Ji-won's gone!

460
01:03:36,074 --> 01:03:37,341
Hye-ran...

461
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:39,507
Get out of the house!

462
01:03:39,574 --> 01:03:43,174
- Hye-ran, Hye-ran!
- Let go!

463
01:03:43,241 --> 01:03:46,466
Detective Nam, I have to go home.

464
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:47,909
- Please let me go.
- What?

465
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,182
My sister needs me.

466
01:03:51,783 --> 01:03:52,632
Are you crazy?

467
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:54,257
- I have to go!
- Let go!

468
01:03:54,324 --> 01:03:56,591
- I have to go home!
- Stay still!

469
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:58,533
So-hee!

470
01:03:59,574 --> 01:04:00,574
(So-hee)

471
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:08,741
Get a grip!

472
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,116
What are you doing?
Are you insane?

473
01:04:18,574 --> 01:04:19,949
Let go!

474
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:21,741
Let go!

475
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:42,991
Mom?

476
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:49,174
When did you come down here?

477
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:52,424
I was worried sick!

478
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:54,016
Well, I...

479
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:55,824
Huh?

480
01:04:56,408 --> 01:04:58,557
- What is it?
- Nothing.

481
01:05:00,783 --> 01:05:03,307
Will you stop scaring me?

482
01:05:05,824 --> 01:05:06,824
Ji-won...

483
01:05:08,116 --> 01:05:11,741
Did you really see
Uncle Chang-soo last time?

484
01:05:14,824 --> 01:05:16,408
Was it an older girl?

485
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:21,674
- I don't remember.
- It's okay, tell me.

486
01:05:21,741 --> 01:05:24,449
I won't scold you for lying.

487
01:05:25,741 --> 01:05:28,391
It was both.

488
01:05:29,574 --> 01:05:32,616
Uncle Chang-soo said
that he wanted to be free.

489
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:35,716
Then, a scary-looking girl said

490
01:05:35,783 --> 01:05:37,266
we should live together.

491
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:42,016
Why did you tell me
that you don't remember?

492
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:45,974
She said that if I told anyone,

493
01:05:46,932 --> 01:05:49,741
she'd kill you and Dad.

494
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,616
I told you not to tell anyone!

495
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:09,616
Ji-won?

496
01:06:10,824 --> 01:06:12,199
Ji-won...

497
01:06:13,324 --> 01:06:14,658
Sir?

498
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:22,599
Where did the woman go?

499
01:06:23,908 --> 01:06:25,182
No one else was in the car.

500
01:06:42,241 --> 01:06:44,074
Hye-ran!

501
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,215
Ji-won! Ji-won!

502
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:56,132
Hye-ran!

503
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:57,824
So-hee...

504
01:06:58,449 --> 01:06:59,341
Where's Ji-won?

505
01:06:59,408 --> 01:07:02,174
She's inside,
but this door won't open!

506
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:03,283
Open up!

507
01:07:05,491 --> 01:07:06,908
Open this door!

508
01:07:10,991 --> 01:07:12,324
Open up, now!

509
01:07:31,991 --> 01:07:35,592
Hye-ran, Hye-ran!

510
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:37,199
Hye-ran...

511
01:07:39,824 --> 01:07:41,366
Oh, no...

512
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:51,908
Ji-won...

513
01:08:06,658 --> 01:08:07,741
Ji-won...

514
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:29,241
Ji-won.

515
01:08:29,741 --> 01:08:31,074
Come here.

516
01:08:31,449 --> 01:08:32,599
We should leave.

517
01:08:52,949 --> 01:08:54,908
No, not Ji-won!

518
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:22,783
Why are you doing this?

519
01:09:23,949 --> 01:09:25,741
You killed Chang-soo, didn't you?

520
01:09:28,282 --> 01:09:30,408
What do you want?

521
01:10:32,283 --> 01:10:34,974
Hey, wake up!

522
01:10:38,741 --> 01:10:40,474
Are you awake?

523
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:42,489
Are you okay?

524
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:39,974
The weather's great.

525
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:43,241
Do you want me
to take your picture?

526
01:11:51,491 --> 01:11:52,741
It's all right.

527
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,741
You're good at that.

528
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:19,659
You...

529
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:30,869
Leave.

530
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:45,908
What are you doing?

531
01:13:46,908 --> 01:13:49,324
Give it back. Give it to me.

532
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:51,116
Give it back!

533
01:14:04,366 --> 01:14:07,074
- What is this?
- Our baby.

534
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:09,507
We're a real family now.

535
01:14:09,574 --> 01:14:11,829
The three of us should live here.

536
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:15,159
I want myself and
my baby to be happy.

537
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:20,449
Follow me.

538
01:14:23,491 --> 01:14:24,491
Look around.

539
01:14:24,529 --> 01:14:27,132
This is my baby's nursery!
My real family!

540
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,699
This house is for them.

541
01:14:29,074 --> 01:14:31,922
You think you're my family?

542
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:36,741
You're just a jerk
trying to trick me.

543
01:14:37,074 --> 01:14:39,007
I was kind to you,
and this is how you repay me?

544
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:44,074
How dare you mess
with me like this!

545
01:14:48,491 --> 01:14:49,908
You don't believe me?

546
01:14:51,408 --> 01:14:53,099
I'll show you
what's inside my belly.

547
01:14:53,949 --> 01:14:55,682
I'll show you our baby.

548
01:14:57,033 --> 01:14:58,724
If I show you...

549
01:15:01,283 --> 01:15:02,474
Will you believe me?

550
01:15:03,866 --> 01:15:05,132
What are you doing?

551
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:06,807
If we can't be blessed...

552
01:15:07,658 --> 01:15:09,766
We're better off dead.

553
01:15:10,824 --> 01:15:13,074
It shouldn't grow up like me.

554
01:15:18,033 --> 01:15:18,924
Stop!

555
01:15:18,991 --> 01:15:20,074
No, stop!

556
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:25,366
Hyun-joo!

557
01:15:27,241 --> 01:15:29,074
Hyun-joo, Hyun-joo!

558
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,324
Hyun-joo!

559
01:15:43,449 --> 01:15:44,574
Hyun-joo...

560
01:15:47,574 --> 01:15:48,783
Hyun-joo...

561
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:54,557
Hyun-joo, Hyun-joo!

562
01:15:56,574 --> 01:15:57,783
Hyun-joo...

563
01:15:58,574 --> 01:16:02,991
Oh, no... Hyun-joo...

564
01:16:03,866 --> 01:16:05,574
I'll dial 911!

565
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:07,574
Hyun-joo!

566
01:16:52,616 --> 01:16:54,408
I had nowhere to go.

567
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:03,908
This is my home.

568
01:17:20,491 --> 01:17:21,866
(Hyun-joo)

569
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:30,616
The number you have
called cannot be reached...

570
01:18:05,741 --> 01:18:06,741
Ji-won!

571
01:18:15,949 --> 01:18:18,491
Ji-won, Ji-won!

572
01:18:55,866 --> 01:18:56,866
Dad...

573
01:19:52,116 --> 01:19:54,074
Hye-ran, Hye-ran!

574
01:19:54,824 --> 01:19:56,074
Are you okay?

575
01:19:56,783 --> 01:19:58,074
Get up.

576
01:19:58,449 --> 01:20:00,033
Let's get out of here.

577
01:20:02,866 --> 01:20:04,824
Give me Ji-won.

578
01:20:05,491 --> 01:20:06,908
I'm her mom.

579
01:20:10,074 --> 01:20:11,574
Hye-ran...

580
01:20:22,074 --> 01:20:23,074
Hye-ran...

581
01:21:25,699 --> 01:21:26,741
So-hee...

582
01:21:30,824 --> 01:21:32,974
The three of us
should live here together.

583
01:21:36,366 --> 01:21:39,766
I want to become happy.

584
01:22:04,741 --> 01:22:07,391
You said you'd be my family.

585
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:10,174
We're a real family now.

586
01:22:10,241 --> 01:22:12,099
The three of us should live here.

587
01:22:13,408 --> 01:22:17,932
I want myself and
my baby to be happy.

588
01:22:19,074 --> 01:22:21,807
Can you live without me?

589
01:22:24,366 --> 01:22:27,557
I can't live without you.

590
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,307
Don't you believe me?

591
01:22:31,533 --> 01:22:32,949
You don't believe me?

592
01:22:33,574 --> 01:22:35,014
I'll show you
what's inside my belly.

593
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:37,141
I'll show you our baby.

594
01:22:37,908 --> 01:22:39,474
You'll probably still deny it.

595
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:42,307
Because you don't want to
become my family at all.

596
01:22:43,366 --> 01:22:46,557
Why can't I be happy?

597
01:23:02,074 --> 01:23:03,533
No, Hyun-joo.

598
01:23:03,991 --> 01:23:05,432
Please stop.

599
01:23:06,533 --> 01:23:07,574
I'll show you.

600
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,049
I believe you!

601
01:23:10,116 --> 01:23:13,016
- You don't have to show me.
- Liar.

602
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:16,074
You're going to leave me, too.

603
01:23:59,741 --> 01:24:03,699
Do you know how much it hurts?

604
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:07,408
I'll...

605
01:24:10,908 --> 01:24:13,199
Be your family.

606
01:26:35,741 --> 01:26:36,866
Come in.

607
01:26:38,408 --> 01:26:39,908
We're family.

608
01:26:49,866 --> 01:26:52,783
(Jo Yoon-hee)

609
01:26:53,283 --> 01:26:55,199
(Kim Joo-ryoung)

610
01:27:05,408 --> 01:27:08,241
(Directed by Koo Tae-jin)

611
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:13,552
(Spring Garden)

612
01:27:13,619 --> 01:27:18,408
(Spring Garden, one of
Korea's top 3 haunted house)

613
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:32,049
(Originally built as a house,
but renovated into a restaurant, )

614
01:27:32,116 --> 01:27:35,341
(it was closed after people died
from horrid accidents)

615
01:27:35,408 --> 01:27:38,716
(The owner changed numerously
but incidents continued, )

616
01:27:38,783 --> 01:27:43,783
(and eventually Spring Garden
was known to be haunted)
