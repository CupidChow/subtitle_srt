00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,710
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,280
Darling,

4
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,950
how do you like the milk tea?

5
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,430
Thank you for your patience.

6
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,110
Here are our last four milk teas

7
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,140
for today.

8
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,370
Thank you, Bosslady.

9
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,190
Thank you, Bosslady.

10
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,630
Enjoy.

11
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay.

12
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,380
Sir,

13
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,200
I'm so sorry.

14
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,440
We're sold out today.

15
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,580
It's you.

16
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,550
It's you again.

17
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,390
I think it's fate that has brought us together once more.

18
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,390
You own this shop?

19
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,470
Yes.

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,650
But today,

21
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,470
what we prepared is all sold out.

22
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,680
I came all this way.

23
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,670
It wouldn't be right to let me leave empty-handed, would it?

24
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,350
But

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,400
the drinks on the menu

26
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,710
are all sold out.

27
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,990
It's okay.

28
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,350
You can make me a drink

29
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,630
that's not listed on the menu.

30
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,430
A special one.

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,190
Okay.

32
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,170
Wait for me.

33
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,390
Red dates.

34
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,710
Preserved plums.

35
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,460
Lotus seeds.

36
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,660
Honey.

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,480
Corn silk.

38
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,860
Milk.

39
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,100
Oolong tea.

40
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,310
Cloves. Cinnamon.

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,290
You've also added a few types of jam to it.

42
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,590
You didn't just throw in

43
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,270
all the leftover ingredients

44
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,660
from the kitchen, did you?

45
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,040
This is really special.

46
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,640
You're good.

47
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,910
This drink I made

48
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,750
is not just special,

49
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,950
but the most special drink in the world.

50
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,460
Its name is

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,120
"Everything You Want."

52
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,990
You're lucky to have the chance to drink it today.

53
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,790
Interesting.

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,270
I must cherish

55
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,120
this special luck I have today.

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,710
It's not bad.

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,960
But

58
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,180
if only

59
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,960
I could bring it back for my friends to try

60
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,820
in Furong City.

61
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,550
If you like it,

62
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,520
come here often.

63
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,390
Miss,

64
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,150
would you like to sit down

65
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,520
and hear my ideas?

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,500
Certainly.

67
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,500
[Prince Xian's Mansion]

68
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,480
Mr. Butler,

69
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,070
the goods from our Xu's have arrived.

70
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:35,870
Please check.

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,700
Eunuch Zhou said

72
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,670
that we had a new supplier for the Jiuchongtian.

73
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,690
So, we don't want

74
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,430
any of your goods.

75
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,210
What...

76
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,040
Well...

77
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,690
We've already sent the deposit

78
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,220
to Linchun.

79
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,310
Take your goods away now.

80
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,090
Well...

81
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,740
Mr. Butler!

82
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,670
What should we do?

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,960
You're developing new products again?

84
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,250
I was inspired

85
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,860
by a guest the other day.

86
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,070
He said that I could try to use the tea for multiple purposes.

87
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,330
The Aromatic Tea can also be made into milk cake.

88
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,830
This way, you can enjoy the same flavor

89
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,029
with different textures.

90
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:16,790
It can not only save money

91
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,390
but also give our guests a fresh experience.

92
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,230
This will kill two birds with one stone.

93
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,290
What's the matter?

94
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,230
Do you want to join the Chamber of Commerce?

95
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,080
Now that you have a shop

96
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,750
and the owner of it,

97
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,210
you're qualified to join.

98
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,370
I can join the Chamber of Commerce?

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
Why can't you?

100
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,480
The purpose of the Chamber of Commerce in Linchun City

101
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,680
is to help each other.

102
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,070
If merchants are seeds,

103
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,720
then the Chamber of Commerce is the fertile soil.

104
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,970
It will provide you with enough information

105
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,830
and resources.

106
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,720
Don't you still want to open a new branch store?

107
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,220
I've done the procedures for you.

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,050
As long as you are willing,

109
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,110
signing it will do.

110
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,350
Oh no, Ling Se,

111
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,210
you're becoming more and more successful now.

112
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,600
I close my eyes, and I can imagine

113
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,400
that I'm already the richest girl in Linchun City.

114
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,820
I'll sign it.

115
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,970
I'll get the writing brush now.

116
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,910
Why don't you sign it for me?

117
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,430
My handwriting is too unique.

118
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,510
Are you sure you don't want to sign

119
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,710
such an important agreement yourself?

120
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,570
Fine.

121
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,470
Just "oh"?

122
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,590
Young Master, we have a problem!

123
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,330
Come with me now.

124
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,310
Manager Liu is still in the shop,

125
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,240
waiting for you!

126
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,000
Hurry up and go.

127
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:23,590
Okay.

128
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,530
Have we come to Prince Xian's men?

129
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,330
We have.

130
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,770
We didn't know until we asked them.

131
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,030
Prince Xian's side canceled

132
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,990
our order a long time ago.

133
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,680
But no one told us

134
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,890
about it.

135
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,190
The staff who is responsible for the delivery

136
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,710
went to see the Third Master.

137
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,510
The Third Master

138
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,240
has traveled north for business

139
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
and hasn't yet returned.

140
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,920
We haven't received any news from him yet.

141
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,909
Since this is so, we should accept it.

142
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,310
After all, we got Prince Xian's order

143
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,640
through my Third Uncle.

144
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,670
Let's wait for him to come back.

145
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,430
You

146
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,270
inform the staff at Furong City

147
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,790
to send the Jiuchongtian Incense

148
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,630
back to Linchun.

149
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:00,960
Okay.

150
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,160
Tell them to be careful.

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,910
Young Master,

152
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,120
will this impact

153
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,910
your three-month deal

154
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,950
with Master Tao?

155
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,210
It's almost time.

156
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,270
All of you have made progress

157
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,060
on this exam.

158
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,050
My efforts in teaching you haven't been in vain.

159
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,110
The Provincial Examination is coming.

160
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,480
Countless students

161
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,820
will be competing against you.

162
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,620
Don't become complacent

163
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,500
because of a little improvement.

164
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,280
Stay tighten.

165
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,270
Don't slack off

166
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,620
[Poor]

167
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,970
at the crucial moment.

168
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,170
This result

169
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,830
is much worse

170
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,870
than we expected.

171
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,390
I didn't even have a result this time.

172
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,520
This must be

173
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,740
my teaching method.

174
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,750
I must have drained too much energy out of you

175
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,060
by making you run.

176
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,780
It's really not your fault.

177
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,790
Perhaps

178
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,590
I'm just not cut out for studying.

179
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,450
I might as well

180
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,270
enjoy my life.

181
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,140
My father is the magistrate anyway.

182
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,030
The house he's left for me

183
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,330
is enough to last me half my life.

184
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,990
Why should I bother studying?

185
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,750
Wang,

186
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,690
don't give up easily.

187
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,330
Although you

188
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,710
are in last place,

189
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,890
there's still a difference

190
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,580
between being in last place

191
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,630
and being in the absolute last place.

192
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,710
You've always

193
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,000
submitted blank test papers in the past.

194
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,350
Look.

195
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:37,390
This time, you filled out the whole paper.

196
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,260
Isn't this a kind of progress?

197
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,270
Really?

198
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,540
Yes.

199
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,350
So, you've got to stick with it.

200
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,480
Don't forget

201
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,770
that I promised to treat you to dinner.

202
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,000
The Xu family will be doomed this time.

203
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,450
Exactly.

204
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,430
That was Prince Xian's order.

205
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,040
Besides,

206
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,700
the Young Master went to great lengths

207
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,050
to procure that batch of pepper

208
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,710
specifically for this shipment.

209
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,190
Yes.

210
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,420
This order must be very important.

211
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,150
And now the goods are finished.

212
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,630
We can't get back the money we've spent.

213
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,090
Do you think the Xu family will go bankrupt?

214
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,240
Bankrupt?

215
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,650
Young Madam.

216
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,630
Are you saying that the Xu family is going bankrupt?

217
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,620
We didn't say anything.

218
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,640
We know nothing.

219
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,670
Forget it.

220
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,250
You don't know anything.

221
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,750
I'll ask Xu Zilu.

222
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,610
Xu Zilu!

223
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,680
You didn't go to the store?

224
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,020
Did Prince Xian really cancel his order?

225
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,400
What should we do about it?

226
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,690
We have produced such an amount of incense.

227
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,030
We can't sell them now, can we?

228
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,560
Also,

229
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,900
your three-month deal with the Tao family

230
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,050
is almost up, right?

231
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:09,910
How will our turnover

232
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,950
compare to that of the Tao family?

233
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,150
Do you have any ideas?

234
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,620
You know quite a lot

235
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,790
about my business.

236
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,360
I heard it

237
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,450
from the servants.

238
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,590
You don't know.

239
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,070
Everyone is so worried

240
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,150
and says that the Xu family is going bankrupt

241
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,870
and they may end up sleeping on the street.

242
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,600
You really believe that nonsense?

243
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,940
Don't worry. I'm here.

244
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,020
Nothing will happen to the Xu family.

245
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,840
With our relationship,

246
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,070
you don't need to pretend

247
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,000
to be tough around me.

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,260
Just tell me the truth.

249
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,620
What's

250
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,030
our relationship?

251
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,730
What we have

252
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,120
is, of course, an unbreakable

253
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,720
contractual relationship.

254
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:49,660
Don't laugh.

255
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,420
If you need any help,

256
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,150
just tell me.

257
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,590
I can help with anything

258
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,390
except money.

259
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,680
It so happens

260
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,590
that I need your help

261
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,570
with something.

262
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,600
Go ahead.

263
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,210
Go watch an opera with me tonight.

264
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,170
You still have the mood to watch an opera

265
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,370
at this time?

266
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,630
Every day is a good day to watch opera.

267
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,770
He does not have a fever.

268
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,790
Why does he seem so off?

269
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,970
You promised to help me.

270
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,150
Are you going or not?

271
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,580
Fine.

272
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,750
The opera today

273
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,970
was good.

274
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,010
But it's the same old plot:

275
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,300
the male lead's family has fallen into decline,

276
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,780
and the two lovers have no choice but to be separated.

277
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,910
The heroine is forced to marry another man,

278
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,230
and in the end, she has to kill herself in the name of love.

279
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,490
It's too unrealistic.

280
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,810
In reality,

281
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,510
what often occurs is

282
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,880
that men can be fickle

283
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,790
and find other women.

284
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,610
In real life,

285
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,260
there are still many couples

286
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,570
who grow old together.

287
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,260
Besides,

288
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,750
it's not certain that the male lead's family

289
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,680
would fall into decline in the end.

290
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,770
Ling Se.

291
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,070
You really know how to bring up the most awkward topic.

292
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,150
I think

293
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,750
we don't have to watch this type of opera.

294
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,460
The operas such as "Zhang San Catches Thieves"

295
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,790
or "Li Si Fights a Tiger"

296
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,360
are very exciting.

297
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,630
I like this type of opera too.

298
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,560
I've forgotten

299
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,120
that you're the Eighth Master Hong who outsmarted the beggars.

300
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:29,830
Okay.

301
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,230
Tomorrow,

302
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,660
I'll take you to see an exciting opera.

303
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,200
Do we have to go to the theater again tomorrow?

304
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Is there something wrong with that?

305
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,230
No.

306
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,650
I just think,

307
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,480
don't you have to do work on the canceled deal?

308
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,080
They've already canceled it.

309
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,140
What else can we do?

310
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,390
It's getting late.

311
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,050
Rest early.

312
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,310
Okay.

313
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,260
Master,

314
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,440
have you heard?

315
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,450
That batch of goods from the Xu family

316
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,510
has been returned.

317
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,970
Surprised?

318
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,330
Didn't see that coming, right?

319
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,150
Dad.

320
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,590
Dad!

321
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,360
Tao's Mansion.

322
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,370
An order from Furong City?

323
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,220
Dad!

324
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,030
Xu Zilu,

325
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,600
don't be too sad.

326
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,200
There will always be a solution

327
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,330
for the canceled order.

328
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,090
No, no, no.

329
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,470
It's best not to bring it up.

330
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,270
It'll only make him feel sadder.

331
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,320
Just say, "Have something sweet,

332
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,150
and it will cheer you up."

333
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,830
That's it.

334
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,520
Who let you in?

335
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,950
I-I-I am sorry.

336
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,790
I...

337
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,070
I came

338
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,980
to bring you something to eat.

339
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,440
Aren't you in a bad mood?

340
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,010
I didn't see anything!

341
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,750
You just came

342
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,120
to watch me bathe, right?

343
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,850
No, I didn't!

344
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,320
I know.

345
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,600
You're worried about my whole family, right?

346
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,550
Even if something goes wrong

347
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,670
with Prince Xian's order,

348
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,770
I still have 100 ways

349
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,030
to deal with Tao Ziran.

350
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:05,990
Do you think I would

351
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,590
put all my eggs in one basket?

352
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,040
Stop overthinking.

353
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,470
Well...

354
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm not looking at you.

355
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,210
I put the dessert here for you.

356
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,840
I'll leave it here.

357
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,560
I didn't see anything.

358
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,140
Remember to eat it.

359
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,470
Today is

360
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,060
the day to choose the representative.

361
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,880
I hope that the ancestors of our family

362
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,770
bless my son to win out.

363
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,090
Mother.

364
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,390
I will do my best.

365
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,310
Okay.

366
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,390
I'll be waiting for you at home.

367
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,810
Take care, Mother.

368
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,150
What's wrong?

369
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,240
After some grooming,

370
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,580
I didn't expect you to look...

371
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,060
If you think your husband is handsome,

372
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:25,970
just say it.

373
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,380
You disgust me.

374
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,340
Young Master!

375
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,190
Young Master!

376
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,470
What's wrong?

377
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,580
Just now, Wang Zhujue said

378
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,870
that he took a look at his father's ledger

379
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,950
and found that Master Tao

380
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,550
suddenly had an order

381
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,550
from Furong City.

382
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,410
How did this happen?

383
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,640
[Linchun Guild Hall]

384
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
The three-month deal

385
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,530
between the Xu and Tao families has ended.

386
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,530
Now, I've got the turnovers

387
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,020
for both of you.

388
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,920
Today we're going to choose

389
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,770
the representative of Linchun

390
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,950
to run for Imperial Merchants in Furong City.

391
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,540
As verified by the Chamber of Commerce yesterday,

392
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,540
the Xu family has five shops in total

393
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,740
with a combined turnover of 10,000 taels

394
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,310
over the past three months.

395
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,010
The Tao family has three shops,

396
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,109
and the turnover is 6,000 taels in total.

397
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,270
Today, the Tao family has just presented a new order

398
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,950
from Furong City.

399
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,620
The total order amount is 5,000 taels.

400
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,020
So, the Tao's total turnover is

401
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,800
11,000 taels.

402
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,700
If the Xu family doesn't have any new orders,

403
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,240
the Tao family

404
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,270
will be the representative of Linchun City

405
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,070
to run for the Imperial Merchant

406
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,170
in Furong City.

407
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,290
Wait!

408
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,710
Lord Wang,

409
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,570
I have a shop.

410
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,750
This shop is also the Xu family's property.

411
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,370
The Xu family has more than just five stores.

412
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,230
Check it.

413
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,080
The total value of the title deed and money

414
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,280
amounts to 306 taels,

415
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,190
which is still less than that of the Tao family.

416
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,200
Don't worry.

417
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,910
Just wait a little longer.

418
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,550
In that case,

419
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,760
I hereby announce...

420
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,170
Wait.

421
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,210
Lord Wang,

422
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,270
I still have some orders

423
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:48,870
on the way.

424
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,340
Please

425
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,560
don't be impatient.

426
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,270
Stop stalling.

427
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,510
Dragging this out won't prevent you from losing.

428
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,510
Mr. Tao, you should know

429
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,390
how you got

430
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,900
your orders.

431
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,730
What do you mean by that?

432
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,450
Are you being a sore loser?

433
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,460
If you're going to be one, go find a quiet place

434
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,180
and cry!

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,860
I never said that I would lose.

436
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,100
Bro!

437
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,590
Bro!

438
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,880
Bro! Bro!

439
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,870
Who is it?

440
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,510
Who is he?

441
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,320
I've never met him.

442
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,050
I don't know.

443
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,430
So many banknotes.

444
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,790
I am here!

445
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,430
Rotti!

446
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,160
Am I late?

447
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,430
No.

448
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,160
You came at the right time.

449
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,350
Come on, cheers!

450
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,620
By the way, Xu Zilu,

451
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,590
when did you come to

452
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,310
Pavarotti?

453
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,090
A long time ago.

454
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,350
Bro,

455
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,260
what can I do for you?

456
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,310
Here.

457
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,100
This is

458
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,110
our finest incense, He Incense.

459
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:56,950
You can bring it

460
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,110
to your business friends.

461
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,430
If they think it's good,

462
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,760
we can establish long-term cooperation.

463
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,030
Okay.

464
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,850
Your incense smells way better than mine.

465
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,930
It will be a hit.

466
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,920
So, you knew

467
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,610
that Mr. Tao

468
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,440
would do such a thing,

469
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,700
and came up with a solution before he did?

470
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,050
No.

471
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,350
I just think it's better to be prepared.

472
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,420
You're indeed

473
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,680
a big profiteer!

474
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,970
I'll take that as a compliment.

475
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,710
I gave you my shop

476
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,120
out of that critical situation.

477
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,850
It's about time

478
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,870
you gave it back to me, right?

479
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,490
Shop?

480
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,430
What shop?

481
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,770
My shop.

482
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,470
This deed?

483
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,840
Didn't you say it's our Xu's shop?

484
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,060
The deed is mine now.

485
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,630
Wait.

486
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,200
It's not yours.

487
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,080
You even came here to take it back.

488
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:57,750
You...

489
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,710
Bro.

490
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,460
Don't be in cahoots.

491
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,950
Let's drink together.

492
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,580
Rotti,

493
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,340
don't always

494
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,570
use those fancy words.

495
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,700
It's intimidating.

496
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
I am feeling dizzy.

497
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,830
Rotti can certainly handle his liquor.

498
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,670
I'm sorry

499
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,910
you have to worry about me with this matter.

500
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,950
What are you talking about?

501
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,410
We're all on the same side.

502
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,510
Okay.

503
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,370
We're on the same side.

504
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,780
Why are you laughing?

505
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,910
Did I say it wrong?

506
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,350
No.

507
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,450
I just didn't expect

508
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,610
that you would save me

509
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,360
with the shop

510
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,330
that you value the most.

511
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,270
As long as you can become the Imperial Merchant,

512
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,870
my little effort is nothing.

513
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,550
It's just that, in the end,

514
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,390
I still wasn't able to help you.

515
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,190
The result is good, and that's enough.

516
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,170
Fortunately, you prepared in advance.

517
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,290
Speaking of which,

518
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,510
Master Tao

519
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,750
is truly despicable.

520
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,560
If he had won in the end,

521
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,320
I would have taken him down

522
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,290
and gotten back at him for you.

523
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,420
How would you do it?

524
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,040
I'm the Eighth Master Hong.

525
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,190
Of course, I can get back at him for you.

526
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,350
If

527
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,150
something like this happens again in the future,

528
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,710
you

529
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,710
can use commercial tactics,

530
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,750
and I'll use

531
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,770
unconventional methods.

532
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,000
Anyway,

533
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,950
no one can bully you.

534
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,220
Why are you looking at me like that?

535
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,770
Y-Y-You're drunk.

536
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,680
Your face is all red.

537
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,600
Rest early.

538
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,950
I can't drink this much next time.

539
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,600
Young Master,

540
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,190
you couldn't control yourself just now, right?

541
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,150
You and the Young Madam

542
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,810
were so close in the corridor.

543
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,470
It'd be bad if others saw you.

544
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,950
Don't worry.

545
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,200
I won't

546
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,570
tell anyone about that.

547
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,960
It's okay if you do.

548
00:23:59,100 --> 00:23:59,900
Young Master,

549
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,140
you have finally admitted

550
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,600
that you like Young Madam.

551
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,050
My young master

552
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,710
will finally have happiness.

553
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,590
Stop.

554
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,610
Well...

555
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,870
Young Master,

556
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,380
when are you going to

557
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,730
confess your feelings to the Young Madam?

558
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,980
Well, I'll have to

559
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,510
find a proper opportunity.

560
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,960
Young Master, if there is no right opportunity,

561
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,220
you need to create one.

562
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,070
If you're going to wait for it,

563
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,670
you'll have to wait forever!

564
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,370
You have a point.

565
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,530
Old Master.

566
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,310
Master.

567
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,230
Bad news.

568
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,730
I know it.

569
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,390
You already know about the sachet?

570
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,860
What happened to the sachet this time?

571
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,790
Many people came to our shop today.

572
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,720
They all said

573
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,450
there's a problem with the quality of the sachets

574
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,100
we've been working on with the Ling family.

575
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,700
They are all demanding a refund.

576
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,070
What should I do?

577
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,920
Something is wrong with the sachets.

578
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,650
Then, you go to the Ling family!

579
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,230
You should go to the Ling family!

580
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,110
You...

581
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:53,640
Master!

582
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,200
Why are you here

583
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,770
bothering me with it?

584
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,040
Yes. Yes.

585
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,370
Well...

586
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:06,700
Well...

587
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:13,760
Master!

588
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:15,370
Master!

589
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,960
What's wrong?

590
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,350
We're over.

591
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,390
Over?

592
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,700
Why are we over?

593
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,980
The sachets we supply to Tao's

594
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,960
have not been selling well.

595
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,370
These days, there are even people

596
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,240
who have been complaining about the quality.

597
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,300
The Tao family says

598
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,290
it's all my fault.

599
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,120
This batch of goods

600
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,330
not only turned out to be a loss,

601
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,040
but Tao Ziran is also demanding that I pay him compensation.

602
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,210
I've put all my money into it.

603
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,620
I don't have any spare money.

604
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:56,800
Master,

605
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,830
stop crying.

606
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,590
Will crying get you money?

607
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
Don't you have

608
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,070
a son-in-law who is an Imperial Merchant now?

609
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,460
Master,

610
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,930
we treated Se well

611
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,860
and married her off so well.

612
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:11,820
Her maiden family is in trouble now,

613
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,340
so she should help us.

614
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,610
The Xu family is so rich.

615
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,380
As long as she asks,

616
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,830
the problem will be solved.

617
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Stop right there!

618
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,990
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

619
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,190
Just say it if you have something to say.

620
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,560
I'll cut to the chase.

621
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,630
Now,

622
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,830
we need some money

623
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,200
to do business.

624
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,580
Your brother also needs money

625
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,830
to travel to the city for the imperial examination.

626
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,390
So,

627
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,680
you need to take out some money

628
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,030
to contribute to household expenses.

629
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,160
How much do you want?

630
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,250
500 taels.

631
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,190
How can I have 500 taels?

632
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,810
You think I don't know?

633
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,970
You've joined the Linchun Chamber of Commerce.

634
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,980
You own a shop,

635
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,980
and the Xu family is qualified to be the Imperial Merchant.

636
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,010
You are the Young Madam Xu.

637
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,650
How can you be short on money?

638
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,760
My shop has just opened, so I haven't made any money yet.

639
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,380
I don't have any money right now.

640
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,380
I heard that your shop is doing well.

641
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,990
If you sell it,

642
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,840
won't you have some money?

643
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,030
How can you be so shameless?

644
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,480
How dare you speak to me that way?

645
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,550
You unfilial daughter!

646
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm not filial?

647
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:52,190
I was only four when my mom was seriously ill.

648
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,210
Yet, I knew enough to stay by her side, day and night.

649
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,070
What about you?

650
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,080
Did you ever go to see her?

651
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm not filial.

652
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,960
What are you, then?

653
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,080
Now that you've married into the Xu family,

654
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,990
you don't want to acknowledge me as your father anymore, do you?

655
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,980
Who is this?

656
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,920
What are you talking about so early in the morning?

657
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,650
Old Madam Xu.

658
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,830
Sorry to disturb you.

659
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,840
It's Se's father.

660
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,920
Why are you so angry?

661
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,130
It was Ling Se who got upset first.

662
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,700
She yelled at me.

663
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,230
So, I couldn't hold back

664
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:25,960
and ended up scolding her a bit.

665
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,830
Mr. Ling,

666
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,360
I don't know

667
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,480
how you taught her

668
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,960
when she was unmarried.

669
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,010
Now that she's married into my Xu family,

670
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,600
she's my daughter-in-law.

671
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,910
Now you're scolding my daughter-in-law

672
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,430
in my own home.

673
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,110
What?

674
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,400
Do you want to scold me too?

675
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,660
Of course not; I wouldn't dare.

676
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,700
Old Madam,

677
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,900
you're mistaken.

678
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,790
I'm here

679
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,440
to discuss some family matters with her.

680
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,170
It's just some family matters.

681
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:06,100
Why are you standing out here discussing them?

682
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,500
Let's go inside and talk about them together.

683
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,070
No need.

684
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,110
I still have other appointments.

685
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,240
I'll be leaving now.

686
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,600
Take care, and you can let yourself out.

687
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,820
What does your father want from you?

688
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,940
Nothing. Don't mind him.

689
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,760
Mom.

690
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,690
The weather is nice today.

691
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,790
How about we go out

692
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,210
and play some rounds of mahjong?

693
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,430
Mahjong?

694
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,870
Sure.

695
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,930
Let's go play some rounds.

696
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:43,460
Let's go.

697
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,840
Go.

698
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:45,620
Let's play some rounds.

699
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,510
You dare to deceive His Highness

700
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,240
by passing off inferior goods

701
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,370
as Jiuchongtian.

702
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,910
Master Tao,

703
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,500
you really have the nerves.

704
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,790
Please calm down, Eunuch.

705
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,520
Please calm down.

706
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,090
I really, really

707
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,740
used the best materials

708
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,990
and hired the finest craftsmen, who worked overtime

709
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,200
to complete this batch of goods.

710
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,990
H-H-How could it

711
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,470
have ended up like this?

712
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,590
Look, well...

713
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,690
It's just a small gift

714
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,630
for you.

715
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,250
You must be tired from your long journey.

716
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,160
Do you still remember

717
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,190
Eunuch Zhou?

718
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,080
Eunuch Zhou? I know him well.

719
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,460
You and Eunuch Zhou are...

720
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,900
Eunuch Zhou accepted your bribe

721
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,070
and placed the order without permission.

722
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,710
Now,

723
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,880
he was relieved of his head.

724
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,230
I-I-I was wrong.

725
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,550
Please spare my life, Eunuch!

726
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,250
Eunuch, no...

727
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,110
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

728
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,450
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

729
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,470
I was wrong!

730
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,140
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

731
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,300
Please spare my life!

732
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,850
-Your Highness, please spare my life!
-Master Tao.

733
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,850
His Highness is merciful.

734
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,460
Since this is your first time,

735
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,960
he has given you a way out.

736
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,570
Within three days,

737
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,270
you must...

738
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,910
re-prepare the Jiuchongtian

739
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,180
and send it to Furong City.

740
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Then His Highness

741
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,230
can let you off.

742
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,440
The production of Jiuchongtian is complex.

743
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,640
Within three days...

744
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:16,100
and it's a large order.

745
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,150
I-I-I'm afraid...

746
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,070
Master Tao,

747
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,720
at this point,

748
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,610
you still have the audacity to bargain?

749
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,510
I...

750
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,420
I... I dare not.

751
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,970
I... I dare not.

752
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,600
If you can't do it,

753
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,080
we won't make things difficult for you.

754
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,670
Just count your assets

755
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,110
and wait to compensate for His Highness's loss.

756
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,390
[Tao's Fragrance Shop]

757
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,810
Master,

758
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,240
after deducting the expenses for these past few months,

759
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,040
we still have 3,000 taels

760
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,310
in cash on the books.

761
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:01,270
3,000 taels?

762
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,620
3,000 taels.

763
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,720
Plus the valuables in the mansion.

764
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,610
It should be able to compensate for the order from Furong City.

765
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:15,740
Master,

766
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,170
but you've forgotten

767
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,430
the contract signed with Furong City,

768
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,070
which clearly states

769
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,910
that if we fail to complete the order,

770
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:22,670
we'll need to pay ten times the order amount

771
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:23,990
as compensation.

772
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,990
So,

773
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,220
for a 5,000-tael order,

774
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,060
we have to pay 50,000 taels in compensation.

775
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,810
These days,

776
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,210
many traveling merchants have come

777
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,470
to return the sachets.

778
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,890
All originally intended orders

779
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:50,420
have been canceled as well.

780
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,470
The stores are short of cash.

781
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,070
I'm afraid

782
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,590
that the cash in the shops...

783
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,190
Think of a way.

784
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,320
Find a way.

785
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,360
The only way now

786
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,230
is to sell your shops

787
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:00,910
and mansion

788
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,370
so that we can have enough money.

789
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,440
Nonsense!

790
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,730
You think of something.

791
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,550
There must be a way.

792
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,520
F-F-Fifty thousand taels?

793
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,630
F-F-Fifty thousand taels?

794
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,350
F-F-Fifty thousand taels?

795
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,100
Your application for membership

796
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,630
has been approved by the Chamber of Commerce.

797
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,040
It's that what Chun Commerce?

798
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,070
That's great.

799
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:35,950
I'm now

800
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,010
someone of status.

801
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,230
Is this making you that happy?

802
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:39,950
Of course.

803
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,990
Although I'm still not quite your match right now,

804
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,620
we can be

805
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,020
considered equals now.

806
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,170
Since you've joined the Commerce,

807
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,000
your shop will also have to participate in

808
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,470
the charity donation event

809
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,780
and prepare an auction item.

810
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,910
What item?

811
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,960
Every store

812
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,110
needs to prepare something

813
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,040
for the auction.

814
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,650
All proceeds from the auction

815
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,220
will be donated to the disaster-stricken people.

816
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,890
It's best

817
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,470
if the item has symbolic significance

818
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,179
or collecting value.

819
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,870
If it needs to have collectible value,

820
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,630
it can't be cheap, right?

821
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,280
It's not about the value of the item;

822
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,320
the thought behind it is more important.

823
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,880
If you can't think of anything,

824
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,639
you can go to our family's warehouse.

825
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,790
Let's pick one together.

826
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,580
No.

827
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,040
As you said, the item will

828
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,540
represent our Fragrant Aromatic Tea Shop.

829
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,710
How can I

830
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,600
use your stuff?

831
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,540
That's good too.

832
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,770
Then, you prepare something good.

833
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,190
These are the title deeds

834
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,190
of our Tao family.

835
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,000
Wait!

836
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,430
Where is the money?

837
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,460
Master Tao,

838
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,660
the buyer has just sent a message

839
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,860
that the private bank

840
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,680
can't come up with that large amount of money

841
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,810
in such a short time.

842
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,150
They may need some time to get the money.

843
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,170
Didn't we agree

844
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,310
that I'd give you the title deeds

845
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:23,900
and you'd give me the money today?

846
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,200
40,000 taels of cash

847
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,830
is not a small amount.

848
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,290
The private bank also can't

849
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,950
give you that amount of money.

850
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,090
There's nothing we can do either.

851
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,620
Master Tao,

852
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,890
how about this?

853
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:35,750
You

854
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,670
lower the price.

855
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
Perhaps the buyer can get the money.

856
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,950
This mansion's market price

857
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,300
is at least 50,000 taels.

858
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,450
I'm already suffering a great loss

859
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,610
by selling it for 40,000 taels.

860
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:51,920
Well,

861
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,280
since you don't want to sell it,

862
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,060
we can't force you.

863
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,260
Then you can find another buyer.

864
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,030
Let's go. Go.

865
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:00,660
Go.

866
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,350
Wait!

867
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,550
How much money does the buyer have?

868
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,780
30,000 taels,

869
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,750
and he can give it to you now.

870
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,040
30,000 taels?

871
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,750
You've taken a cut

872
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,350
from the buyer, haven't you?

873
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:25,910
You're colluding

874
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,120
to take advantage of my crisis, right?

875
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,310
I don't want to sell my mansion anymore.

876
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,070
Leave.

877
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,410
Master Tao,

878
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,010
you need to think this through carefully.

879
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,980
Who in Linchun

880
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,040
can give you

881
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,870
30,000 taels in cash all at once?

882
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,960
If you pass by the window,

883
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,650
your only option will be

884
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,030
to sell your daughter for money.

885
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:48,990
You...
