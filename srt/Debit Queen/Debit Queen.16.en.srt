1
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,990
[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,780
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,070
Uncle, I think you can recognize

4
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,729
your own handwriting, right?

5
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,910
These are

6
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,780
the letters you and Chen Yun

7
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,910
wrote to each other.

8
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,870
Do you know

9
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,910
how I got them?

10
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,990
Young Master.

11
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,199
Chen Yun.

12
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,410
I will forgive you for your crimes

13
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,270
which you've committed before.

14
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,990
Now I'll dispatch you and Chen Bin

15
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:15,830
to be my spies.

16
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,090
Young Master,

17
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,420
what can I do for you?

18
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,090
Go send a message to Third Uncle.

19
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,360
Tell him that I'm investigating

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,760
the case of the order to transfer the goods.

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:27,630
Yes.

22
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,030
Young Master.

23
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,670
Chen Bin sent a message.

24
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,740
[Third Master wants to sell the Harmony Incense and is looking for a buyer. Chen Bin]

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,150
Is there something going on

26
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,450
at Third Master's place?

27
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,230
I've spread the net so extensively.

28
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm finally going to close the net.

29
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,030
Third Uncle will soon

30
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,270
come to Linchun to inspect the goods.

31
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,400
We need to get ready.

32
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,390
Mr. Qi.

33
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,260
There's something I want you

34
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,160
to help me with.

35
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,270
Okay.

36
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,360
Because Chen Yun and Chen Bin

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,420
were both my spies.

38
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,740
Mr. Qi was also an informant planted by me.

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,340
Xu Zilu.

40
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,340
You designed the trap so meticulously

41
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,579
to make me jump into it.

42
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,170
I'm completely convinced.

43
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,000
I just think that it's ridiculous.

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,900
I've been working so hard outside dedicatedly

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,020
for the Xu Family's business.

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,810
I made efforts alone

47
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,310
in Furong City for the business.

48
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,450
I've introduced many high-ranking

49
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,910
officials and dignitaries to the Xu Family.

50
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,740
The Xu Family is so wealthy today

51
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,800
all due to my own efforts, isn't it?

52
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,370
I just took some goods.

53
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,630
Do you guys have to stand here

54
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,140
to criticize me?

55
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,240
I just embezzled some money, didn't I?

56
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,540
I deserve it.

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,150
Enough!

58
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,550
How could you say that?

59
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,910
I've even treated you as my own family all this time.

60
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,220
Third Brother.

61
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,649
You've really disappointed me.

62
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,000
You guys may leave now.

63
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,880
As for the rest of it,

64
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,110
I'll solve it.

65
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,820
-Yes, Young Master.
-Yes, Young Master.

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,550
Third Uncle.

67
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,020
We can't embezzle the money.

68
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,370
Intergrity is essential for doing business.

69
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,670
We can't do anything that will harm the Xu Family.

70
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,670
You taught me all these principles.

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,040
After my father passed away,

72
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,350
just like my own father, you've been

73
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,590
teaching me how to be a decent man.

74
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,120
What on earth has happened,

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,100
which made you become

76
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,030
like this now?

77
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,810
Enough!

78
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,250
I can imagine what you're

79
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,990
going to say next.

80
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,760
I feel guilty for the Xu Family.

81
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,390
From now on,

82
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,780
I, Xu Yushan, will no longer be a member of the Xu Family.

83
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,990
You and I will have

84
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,760
no relationship with each other anymore.

85
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,630
What are you looking at?

86
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,610
After my father passed away,

87
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,120
Third Uncle would made a mark

88
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:00,670
here for me every year.

89
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,740
When my mother punished me,

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,550
Third Uncle would always secretly

91
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,010
bring me something to eat.

92
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,210
When he hit me,

93
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,020
he would still pacify me.

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,670
He also taught me

95
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,720
all the experiences

96
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,050
and principles of business.

97
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,360
Without him,

98
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,300
I wouldn't have become like this.

99
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,560
A person

100
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,790
might get irrational sometimes.

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,840
I never thought that

102
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,720
this day would come.

103
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,570
Nor did I expect that

104
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,230
such a thing would happen to me

105
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,110
and would occur

106
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,210
between Third Uncle and me.

107
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,800
Although

108
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,490
people will change,

109
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,390
there are still many people

110
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,420
who have always treated you so well.

111
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,080
Even just for them,

112
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,110
you have to pull yourself together.

113
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,150
Okay.

114
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,620
[Ling Se]

115
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,000
Ping'er!

116
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:13,900
Wang!

117
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,810
Where are you going?

118
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,550
I'm going to see you.

119
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,180
You'll take the exam tomorrow morning.

120
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm worried about you,

121
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,140
so I wanted to go check on you.

122
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,390
Me, too.

123
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,750
I couldn't sit or read books

124
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,600
at home.

125
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,440
Unconsciously,

126
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,910
I came to your place.

127
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,919
Have you prepared everything

128
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,130
for tomorrow's exam?

129
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,720
Have you tried your writting brush, ink stick, paper and ink?

130
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,120
Yes, I've tried them all.

131
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,169
That's good.

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,820
After you go back tonight,

133
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,169
just don't read books anymore.

134
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,409
Take a good rest.

135
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,980
In this way, you won't be nervous when you

136
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,310
take the exam tomorrow.

137
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,480
By the way,

138
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
you must get full tomorrow morning.

139
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,560
Only when you're full can you have the strength to take the exam.

140
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,310
That's not right.

141
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,180
What if you're too full

142
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,070
and get sleepy

143
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,030
during the exam?

144
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,550
Let me think about it.

145
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,010
What else should I tell you?

146
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,610
Oh, right.

147
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,930
Don't drink too much water

148
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,380
when you take the exam tomorrow.

149
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,530
If you drink too much water,

150
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,890
you'll want to go to the toilet.

151
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,550
There are no toilets

152
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,710
in a place like that.

153
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,600
I even thought about several tips.

154
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,670
Ping'er.

155
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,580
I've kept them all in mind.

156
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,490
You're the one who will take the exam,

157
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,060
but I'm so nervous about it.

158
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:22,910
Ping'er.

159
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,760
Give me your good wishes.

160
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,500
With your good wishes,

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,580
I'm sure I'll do well in the exam.

162
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,230
I specially got this for you

163
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,270
a few days ago.

164
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,600
Remember to take it with you during the exam.

165
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,670
I will certainly take it with me.

166
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,930
I'll never take it off.

167
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,160
Go for it!

168
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,810
I believe that you will do well in the exam.

169
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,390
Go for it!

170
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:49,990
Guys,

171
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,060
can you step aside to have a date?

172
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,990
You're blocking the way for my business.

173
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,550
Let's go.

174
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,090
Young Master.

175
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,470
I've heard that

176
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,230
Wu Qi seems to be

177
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,070
looking for people to compete with him

178
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,830
on incense all over the country now.

179
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,230
And he has won many shops.

180
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,470
I've also heard that

181
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,190
currently, Linchun City

182
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,600
just doesn't deserve

183
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,330
its reputation as

184
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,870
the Great City of Incense Making.

185
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,990
It's just the same as the way how Young Madam

186
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,250
said that you couldn't do it at that time.

187
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,990
Besides,

188
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,610
now there are also some people who urge

189
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,510
these Chambers of Commerce

190
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,350
to ask our Xu Family

191
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,600
to have a competition with him.

192
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,260
I don't want to have a competition with him.

193
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,120
I think so, too.

194
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,120
But Young Master, do you think

195
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,230
there is such a possibility?

196
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,630
Maybe he just wants to force you to come out?

197
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,310
In the end,

198
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,630
we can still promote our products.

199
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,360
Just say that

200
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,540
Wu Qi invited Young Master Xu to be back to the arena.

201
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,270
But Young Master Xu refused it.

202
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,410
It'll be a trending topic.

203
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,600
Most importantly, he has won many shops.

204
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,730
If at this time,

205
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,660
he comes to trouble Young Madam again,

206
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
what should we do?

207
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,050
It smells so good.

208
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,070
What's that smell?

209
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:50,800
Young Madam.

210
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:51,630
You're here.

211
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,430
I could smell it even in the yard.

212
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,390
This is the first incense

213
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,910
made by our Xu Family's ancestors.

214
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,530
It's called Tranquillity Incense.

215
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,400
Our Xu Family

216
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,400
thrived because of

217
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,200
this incense.

218
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,430
If you think it smells good,

219
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,160
just take it.

220
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,110
Can you tell what is inside it

221
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,970
by smelling it?

222
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,420
It seems that there is

223
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,270
sandalwood and chrysanthemums.

224
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,220
Is your nose that sensitive?

225
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,200
Why are you here?

226
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,450
Oh, right.

227
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,110
your room here smells

228
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,260
quite good to me, isn't it?

229
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,010
Take some incense

230
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,410
and put it in my room, too.

231
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,630
Sure.

232
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,670
Our family does the business of making incense.

233
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,340
Since childhood,

234
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,590
I've been learning how to distinguish different incense.

235
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,990
My mother often says that

236
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,760
if you want to make incense,

237
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,470
you need to know how to distinguish different incense first.

238
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,400
To make incense,

239
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,170
there are three principles.

240
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:48,320
We have to put three kinds of perfume materials in it at least.

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,920
The rule of making incense is

242
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,650
"the emperor, the minister and the coordinator."

243
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,840
The emperor is primary, while the minister is secondary.

244
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,190
Then the coordinator is the minor part.

245
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,430
You have such a sensitive nose.

246
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,090
Smell this.

247
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,140
To distinguish different incense,

248
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,430
you can't be impatient.

249
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,630
You need to stay calm.

250
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,800
Only by smelling it slowly

251
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,060
can you know what it is.

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,730
Give it a try.

253
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
According to what you said just now,

254
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,190
inside it,

255
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,100
agarwood is the emperor,

256
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,060
chrysanthemum is the minister,

257
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,000
and camellia is the coordinator.

258
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,220
Am I right?

259
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,190
Your nose is as sensitive as that of a dog.

260
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,990
You're the one who has a dog nose.

261
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,840
What's this incense called?

262
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,310
This incense

263
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,710
is made of the best chrysanthemums

264
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,370
during the Autumnal Equinox.

265
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,950
So,

266
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,210
its name is Autumn.

267
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,020
In that case,

268
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,370
you can make incense for the four seasons.

269
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,390
You can make

270
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,710
Peach Blossom Incense for spring,

271
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,710
Lotus Incense for summer,

272
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,110
and Chrysanthemum Incense for autumn.

273
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,510
As for winter...

274
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,890
Plum Blossom Incense.

275
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,750
That's right.

276
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,810
Coincidently,

277
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,070
the plum blossoms in our Xu Mansion's estate

278
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,940
have just bloomed.

279
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,260
They're quite beautiful.

280
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,720
I'll go see them tomorrow.

281
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,530
Do you

282
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,820
want to go with me?

283
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,520
There has been a lot of work to do in the aromatic tea shop these days.

284
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,720
I can't take a day off.

285
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,130
Forget it then.

286
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,050
I was thinking that

287
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,330
plum blossoms

288
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,100
can not only be used to make incense,

289
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,750
but they can also be made

290
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,270
into something to eat or drink.

291
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,130
If you can't go,

292
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,050
then I'll go by myself.

293
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:47,670
Wait.

294
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,550
We'll go tomorrow, right?

295
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,650
I thought about it.

296
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,370
Qian can look after the shop, too.

297
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,030
I don't think it'll be a big problem

298
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,760
if I take a day or a half a day off.

299
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,310
So...

300
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,980
You agreed?

301
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,670
Ask the servants to prepare more food.

302
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,160
We can eat while enjoying the fragrance of flowers.

303
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,220
What other requirements do you have?

304
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,690
Prepare

305
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,220
two more bottles of this.

306
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,960
Playing string instruments in unison and drinking a cup of wine.

307
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,920
Playing string instruments in unison and drinking a cup of wine. Right.

308
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,850
What is it again?

309
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:30,930
That's not right.

310
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,260
Why can't I remember it?

311
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,130
Playing string instruments in unison and drinking a cup of wine.

312
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,790
Playing string instruments in unison and drinking a cup of wine.

313
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,590
Playing string instruments...

314
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,620
Young Master.

315
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,390
Young Master.

316
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,510
His Lordship noticed that the light in the study room was still on,

317
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,350
so he asked me to bring some tea here.

318
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,810
Don't be

319
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,870
too tired.

320
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,870
Just take a rest when you should.

321
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Look at me.

322
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,970
I can't even control myself.

323
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,420
Young Master.

324
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,570
How... How come your hands are shaking again?

325
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:58,770
I don't know, either.

326
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,660
I've recited it and memorized it obviously.

327
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,560
What should I do

328
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,520
if I forget it in the exam tomorrow?

329
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,830
Young Master.

330
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,440
Why don't you try making a cheat sheet?

331
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,410
Making a cheat sheet?

332
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,970
What does it mean?

333
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,770
It means

334
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,100
folding the paper into three columns,

335
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,850
making the width of the paper

336
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,460
suitable for your palm to grasp it,

337
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,740
and then using the regular script in tiny characters

338
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,990
to write all the knowledge points

339
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,800
on it.

340
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,710
In that case,

341
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,090
you can put it on your waist.

342
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,950
If you really forget the content,

343
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,510
you can even take a look at it.

344
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,930
There's stuff like this?

345
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,480
Young Master.

346
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,880
You don't even know this?

347
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,090
As the saying goes,

348
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,010
if you don't do your homework beforehand,

349
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,890
you have to take

350
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,520
the cheat sheets with you.

351
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,300
I see.

352
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,250
You can both do your homework

353
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:44,690
and make a cheat sheet.

354
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,990
Just get prepared for both eventualities.

355
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,900
Then you won't be worried after you get well prepared.

356
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,610
I'll give you a big reward.

357
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,040
Making a cheat sheet?

358
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:57,730
Fuding!

359
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,950
Fuding, come here.

360
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,350
Ask the people of the estate to prepare for it tomorrow.

361
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,070
I'm going to admire flowers with Young Madam.

362
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,110
Ask them to prepare some delicious food and drinks.

363
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,840
In addition,

364
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,510
ask them to clean

365
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,310
the room, too.

366
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,580
If we stay there too late tomorrow,

367
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
we'll live there.

368
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,240
Young Master.

369
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,970
Not many early plum blossoms have bloomed there.

370
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,110
How many rooms do you want to book?

371
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,110
What do you think?

372
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,550
Got it.

373
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,120
There's only one room left in the estate.

374
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,860
Tomorrow, you'll...

375
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,260
I won't go with you as I have something to do.

376
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,070
Young Master!

377
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,090
Young Master!

378
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:28,870
Bad news!

379
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,550
The caretaker of the Laurel Garden in the south

380
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,280
sent a letter here and said that

381
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,560
there was a mudslide on the mountain.

382
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,270
The laurels in the yard

383
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,470
were mostly destroyed.

384
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,720
There were also many farmers who were injured.

385
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,450
Some people were even missing.

386
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,590
Fuding.

387
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,660
Get the carriage ready.

388
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,720
Let's go there now.

389
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,300
What about Young Madam?

390
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,400
I'll go tell her.

391
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,590
Let's go get ready, too.

392
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,120
Why are you here?

393
00:16:58,950 --> 00:16:59,550
Tomorrow,

394
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,230
I may not be able to admire

395
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,430
the flowers with you.

396
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm sorry.

397
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,150
I have to leave tonight.

398
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,319
An accident happened in the Laurel Garden in the south.

399
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,650
I need to go deal with it.

400
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,310
It's okay.

401
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,650
Just go deal with it first.

402
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,730
Business comes first.

403
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,530
The plum blossoms will be in bloom for a whole winter.

404
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,260
There's no rush to see them now.

405
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,310
I'll give you a bunch of them first.

406
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,250
Wait for me to come back.

407
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,780
Then I'll take you to the plum blossom forest.

408
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,430
Okay.

409
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,110
Then I have to go now.

410
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,700
I'll wait for you to come back.

411
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,150
Without etiquette, it'll be dangerous.

412
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,120
With etiquette, the relationship between people will be harmonious.

413
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,890
Without etiquette, it'll be dangerous.

414
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,690
That's right.

415
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,770
With etiquette, the relationship between people will be harmonious.

416
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,260
Without etiquette, it'll be dangerous.

417
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,720
With...

418
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,190
With...

419
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,470
With etiquette, the relationship between people will be harmonious.

420
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,550
Without etiquette, it'll be dangerous.

421
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,350
That's right.

422
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,480
With etiquette, the relationship between people will be harmonious.

423
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,880
Without etiquette, it'll be dangerous.

424
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,470
With etiquette, the relationship between people will be harmonious.

425
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,400
With etiquette, the relationship between people will be harmonious.

426
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,420
What are you doing?

427
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,280
What are you doing?

428
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,740
Well...

429
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:37,560
Instead of focusing on the exam,

430
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,960
why are you looking at me?

431
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,880
I have a stomachache.

432
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,310
In the ancient times, people valued morality.

433
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,660
They did everyhing dedicatedly without expecting any favor in return.

434
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,570
And then it's...

435
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,370
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

436
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

437
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,360
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

438
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,200
It is impolite not to reciprocate.

439
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,650
Examinees, get ready!

440
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,680
Enter the exam hall now!

441
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,590
When Heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on what?

442
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,650
You're here, Wang.

443
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,190
Give that stuff to me.

444
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,750
What stuff?

445
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,270
I'll give you another chance.

446
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,740
If you give me the cheat sheet now,

447
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,270
I'll only cancel

448
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,890
your qualification of the exam this time.

449
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,220
If you refuse to tell us the truth,

450
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,620
when we find out about it,

451
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,140
you'll be forbidden to take the exam

452
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,430
for the rest of your life,

453
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,070
and your membership will be deprived with a public announcement.

454
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:37,920
Cheat sheets?

455
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,180
I don't have a cheat sheet.

456
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,070
Since there's nothing,

457
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,720
why are you trembling like this?

458
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,180
How could there be nothing?

459
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,130
I saw it.

460
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,730
Well...

461
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,680
What... What are you doing?

462
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,600
Did you report it?

463
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,680
Where is the cheat sheet?

464
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,010
Well...

465
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:17,670
I clearly saw it.

466
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,120
Don't waste time anymore.

467
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,280
Then can I go take the exam now?

468
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,800
You look suspicious.

469
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,510
To be safe,

470
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,380
you have to take the exam alone.

471
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,540
Hurry up and write it.

472
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,300
Time's up.

473
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,730
Hand in the test paper.

474
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,820
Ping'er.

475
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,970
Look at you.

476
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,960
It's Wang who is taking the exam.

477
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,520
Why are you so nervous?

478
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,220
I can't help it.

479
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,350
You didn't say anything

480
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,330
during these two hours.

481
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,190
But you were in a daze eight times.

482
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,170
Don't worry.

483
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:46,910
At this time,

484
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,190
just do our best and leave the rest of it to fate.

485
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,990
That's right.

486
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,820
Ms. Liu.

487
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,070
Instead of being busy with your business,

488
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,230
why are you criticizing

489
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,870
me here?

490
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,070
Business?

491
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,040
I have no business

492
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,250
to do now.

493
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,110
Let's talk about Manager Wang who sold

494
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,310
perfume materials across the street.

495
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,310
Not only did he lose his shop to Wu Qi,

496
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,830
but he also owes lots of debts now.

497
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,870
In order to avoid the creditors,

498
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,470
he ran away

499
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,220
with his wife and children last night.

500
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
Look at my inn now.

501
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,990
From the opening of the door this morning till now,

502
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,440
it's getting dark.

503
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,640
There are only these guests at this one table.

504
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,370
Plus you two.

505
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,430
I think sooner or later,

506
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,340
I'll have to shut it down.

507
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,430
You still have the two of us here, don't you?

508
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,230
That's right.

509
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,430
We will help you.

510
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,250
It would be fine not to mention you two.

511
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,020
Speaking of you two,

512
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,660
I'm so angry.

513
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,300
You guys are on good terms with Wu Qi now.

514
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,220
You went on a picnic

515
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,000
and ate roasted rabbits with him.

516
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,650
So you and he

517
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,380
are such intimate friends now?

518
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,790
No.

519
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,940
When Mr. Wu

520
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,280
was with us,

521
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,910
he wasn't like what you said.

522
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,670
He's an Imperial Merchant from Furong City.

523
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,580
He's knowledgeable and well-informed.

524
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,040
Why would he play with you?

525
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,800
He must have a purpose.

526
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,720
Just think about it carefully.

527
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
Old Madam Xu,

528
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,380
we really don't know what to do.

529
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,570
If in the past few days,

530
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,770
Wu Qi hadn't taken away our shops

531
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,670
or made all the perfume materials merchants

532
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:10,810
so worried,

533
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,950
we wouldn't have

534
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,350
come to see you here.

535
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,510
I want to

536
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,030
think about this matter further.

537
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,560
Why don't you go back first?

538
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,400
Old Madam.

539
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,710
You can't let

540
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,540
Wu Qi cause trouble like that anymore.

541
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,130
That's right.

542
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,530
You can't let him do that.

543
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,420
That's right.

544
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,190
Old Madam.

545
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:27,650
Old Madam.

546
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,430
Please help us.

547
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:28,970
Old Madam.

548
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:29,460
Old Madam.

549
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,240
[Invitation Letter to the Competition on Incense]

550
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,580
Wu Qi asked someone to deliver this letter here.

551
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,340
Wu Qi?

552
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,240
What a bastard!

553
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,130
How dare Wu Qi

554
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,200
threaten

555
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,400
our Xu family!

556
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,480
Wu Qi is just too...

557
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,350
What did he say?

558
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,480
He can't compete with the elders.

559
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,190
He's afraid it will be disrespectful.

560
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,520
He wants to compete with my son, Zilu, on incense.

561
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,060
If Zilu wins,

562
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,170
he will return the shops

563
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,050
he has won.

564
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,160
That's great, Old Madam.

565
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:09,110
Please ask Mr. Xu to participate in it.

566
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,720
Old Madam.

567
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,250
Please come out to manage the business again.

568
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:11,990
Please make a decision.

569
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,850
Yes, Old Madam.

570
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,220
Please make a decision.

571
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,230
Everyone,

572
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:18,970
our Xu Family

573
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,220
won't escape on the eve of a battle like a rat.

574
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,260
This matter

575
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,480
concerns the dignity of all the merchants

576
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,700
in our Linchun City.

577
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,690
Our Xu Family

578
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,930
won't sit by and do nothing.

579
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,920
This is the Kung Fu Tea I brought.

580
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,920
Miss Ling, please taste it.

581
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,150
I've heard that

582
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,750
you have won

583
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,840
many shops in Linchun these days.

584
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,520
It's not worth mentioning.

585
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,340
But your little tricks

586
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,130
have made many merchants in the city

587
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,530
lose their livelihoods.

588
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,540
You must have

589
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,810
spent lots of efforts on this tea.

590
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,540
Mr. Wu,

591
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,890
what on earth is your purpose?

592
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,680
Didn't you know

593
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,480
my purpose

594
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,640
from the beginning?

595
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,060
What's more,

596
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,100
it's Young Master Xu who has been hiding from me

597
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,870
in order not to compete with me on incense.

598
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,830
Do you want to compete with the Xu Family on incense that much?

599
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,690
Yes, it's true.

600
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,030
I dare not lie to you.

601
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,110
But many people lost their jobs

602
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,680
because of the competition on incense.

603
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,430
Don't you think

604
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,710
it's a bit too cruel

605
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,050
to use such small tricks

606
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,710
for your own selfish desires?

607
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,070
Before the competition,

608
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,530
we all agreed on the rules.

609
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,930
It was necessary to admit defeat if they lost.

610
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,030
They had to pay the price after losing the competition.

611
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,890
Now you're saying that I'm cruel.

612
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,650
You've really wronged me.

613
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,000
But you set the rules by yourself.

614
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,110
Of course the conditions were beneficial to you.

615
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,420
This was not admitting defeat for losing the competition.

616
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,350
It was obviously

617
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,390
a trap for others.

618
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,470
I've always gained victory

619
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,620
with my own reputation.

620
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,270
I disdain to do such dirty things.

621
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,070
Then just return the shops to them.

622
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:06,740
How can I return

623
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,800
the shops I've won?

624
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,400
What's more,

625
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,440
I've won these shops

626
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,900
with my own capabilities.

627
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,760
If they don't accept it,

628
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,170
they can win them back with their own capabilities.

629
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:18,940
In that case,

630
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,340
you're determined not to return the shops.

631
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,600
Business is business.

632
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,280
Ma'am,

633
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,770
you used to run a shop, too.

634
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,350
It's not hard for you to

635
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,340
understand the feelings of

636
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:30,580
giving up

637
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,750
something you've gained, right?

638
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,090
Alright.

639
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,880
If that's the case,

640
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,620
our Xu Family will fulfill

641
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,760
your request.

642
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,170
In seven days,

643
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,080
my husband will definitely have

644
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,640
a competition with you.

645
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,590
Okay.

646
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,260
I'm

647
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,790
looking forward to it.

648
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Just wait and see.

649
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,320
How is the situation of the severe disaster?

650
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,590
Seventeen people died.

651
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,770
Twenty-five people were seriously injured.

652
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,900
Eighteen people had minor injuries.

653
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,360
And some people suffered property losses.

654
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,000
We've compensated them for their losses.

655
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,330
For those where were seriously injured,

656
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,790
each of them can get 20 taels.

657
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,230
For those who had minor injuries, each of them can get 10 taels.

658
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,570
For the family of the deceased,

659
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,950
each household can get 60 taels.

660
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,210
Yes.

661
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:27,410
Tell them if they need

662
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,200
any help

663
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,080
in the future,

664
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,130
our Xu Family

665
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,800
will take the responsibilities.

666
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,620
Yes, Young Master.

667
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,190
Just go

668
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,720
comfort the injured people

669
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,450
and the family of the deceased.

670
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:37,550
Yes, Young Master.

671
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,110
Young Master.

672
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,020
This is an urgent letter from Old Madam.

673
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,600
[The success of the incense industry in Linchun will depend on this. It's urgent. I hope that you can come back soon.]

674
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,600
[My dear son, Zilu, I hope this letter finds you well. Mr. Wu wants to have a competition with our Xu Family and stake numerous shops in Linchun on it.]

675
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,560
Wu Qi is so annoying.

676
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,800
I need to go back.

677
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,950
But Young Master,

678
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,270
the temperature just dropped last night.

679
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,870
I don't think it's easy to walk on the plank road along the cliff.

680
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:57,470
It'll take five days at least

681
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,400
for us to go back.

682
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,660
Get the horse ready.

683
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,110
Okay.

684
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,650
Your Highness.

685
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,910
This is the visiting card from Xu Yushan.

686
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,270
Ask him to go back.

687
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,150
I'll let him wait for two more days.

688
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,430
Yes.

689
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,220
Come back.

690
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,040
Your Highness.

691
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,050
Have you found the person I asked you to find?

692
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:18,920
Since the clue

693
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,910
was lost in the south last time,

694
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,790
there has been no news about this person.

695
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,410
It's been so long.

696
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,410
But you can't even find this person.

697
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,430
It's my fault.

698
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:30,990
Forget it.

699
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,020
I'll find someone else to do this task.

700
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,820
Keep a close eye

701
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,240
on that thing for me.

702
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:37,920
Yes!

703
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,030
Fuding.

704
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,080
What's wrong?

705
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,350
Young Master.

706
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,040
Someone is lying there.

707
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,150
Go take a look.

708
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:06,950
Okay.

709
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:14,430
Buddy!

710
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,470
Buddy!

711
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:16,840
Are you okay?

712
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,700
I'm fine.

713
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,540
I'm fine.

714
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,630
How come you're injured so seriously?

715
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,490
What happened?

716
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:23,670
I was in a hurry to travel to my destination.

717
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,330
Unexpectedly,

718
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,130
I was robbed by bandits halfway.

719
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,670
How about this?

720
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,780
Get into my carriage first.

721
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,300
Fuding.

722
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:34,750
Okay.

723
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,220
Thank you.

724
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,270
You're welcome.

725
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,110
I have some clean clothes here.

726
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,970
Put them on now.

727
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,320
Thank you.

728
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,800
Sir, where are you from?

729
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
I'm from Linchun.

730
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,400
So you're a businessman?

731
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,790
I'm just doing some small business.

732
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,560
They're right ahead. Chase them!

733
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,620
Catch up with them!

734
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,550
That carriage!

735
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,260
Fuding.

736
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,100
What's going on?

737
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,870
Young Master.

738
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,400
A few people are chasing us!

739
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,460
Sir.

740
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,030
The stuff inside this parcel

741
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,090
is very important.

742
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,930
If anything wrong happens to me,

743
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,240
please take it

744
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,690
to Furong City.

745
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,610
Furong City?

746
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,920
Sir, leave at once!

747
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,140
Fuding!

748
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,710
Hurry!

749
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,990
Young Master!

750
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,030
We can't go on doing it like this.

751
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,030
I'll distract them.

752
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,350
No!

753
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,270
It's too dangerous. What if you...

754
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,030
Don't worry, Young Master.

755
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,760
I'll be fine.

756
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,350
Fuding!

757
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:04,830
Fuding!

758
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,240
I'm right here!

759
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,740
Come and catch me!

760
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,380
Catch him!

761
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,030
Yes!

762
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,480
Zheng.

763
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,520
It's not here.

764
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:19,510
[Linchun Guild Hall]

765
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,190
Young Madam.

766
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,770
Young Madam.

767
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,700
Young Master is still not back yet.

768
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,150
Alright.

769
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,300
Go check on the situation again.

770
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,060
Well... Well...

771
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:43,720
Well...

772
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,810
Young Madam Xu.

773
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,800
Young Master Xu is still

774
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,170
unwilling to see me indeed.

775
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,710
It's a pity that

776
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,110
your Xu Family has to give a shop to me.

777
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,240
I'll just accept it.

778
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
How come you'll accept it without finishing the competition?

779
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,020
Giving up is admitting defeat.

780
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,750
Isn't that the rule in Linchun?

781
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,450
Nonsense!

782
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,790
Our Young Master hasn't come yet.

783
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,190
Why do think he has given up?

784
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,190
If Young Master still doesn't come,

785
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,250
you just can't delay the competition

786
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,199
to tomorrow again and again, can you?

787
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,030
Since we've agreed to participate in the competition,

788
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,219
if we don't compete with you,

789
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,830
we will become cowards, won't we?

790
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,159
Young Master Xu still hasn't come yet.

791
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,830
I've also agreed that

792
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,469
I won't compete with the elders.

793
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:18,020
Well...

794
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,250
Is there anyone else who can compete with me?

795
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,550
If I compete with you on incense,

796
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,489
am I qualified?

797
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,370
Young Madam Xu,

798
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,010
are you really going to compete with me on incense

799
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,530
in place of Young Master Xu?

800
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,110
Yes.

801
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,710
Before Young Master Xu left,

802
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,820
he specially asked me

803
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,500
to take good care of the Xu Family.

804
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,830
Since he's not here now,

805
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,150
I can surely make decisions

806
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,150
for the Xu Family.

807
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,190
Young Master Wu,

808
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,790
you have no objections, huh?

809
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,239
Young Madam Xu!

810
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,199
Ordinary people need many years' hard practice

811
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:50,800
to master the skills of incense competitions.

812
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,320
It doesn't matter.

813
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,510
Even if there's only a tiny chance of winning,

814
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,190
I will still

815
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,350
bet with you on this.

816
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,949
Mr. Wu,

817
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:57,950
please.

818
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,130
Please.

819
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,720
In today's incense competition,

820
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,070
there will be three rounds.

821
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,070
The first round is

822
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,940
creating incense.

823
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,000
The second round is

824
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,860
smelling incense.

825
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:07,860
The third round is

826
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,030
coiling incense.

827
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,500
The person winning two rounds at least

828
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,850
will be the final winner in the competition.

829
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:14,090
If Mr. Wu wins,

830
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,580
the Xu Family's Perfume Shop

831
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,640
at the Peony Street

832
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,950
will be given to Mr. Wu.

833
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,910
If the Xu Family wins,

834
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,720
Mr. Wu will have to return all the shops he has won before

835
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,180
to their original owners.

836
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,220
I've discussed it with Mr. Wu.

837
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,440
Considering that

838
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,300
I'm a newbie,

839
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,930
he has agreed to increase

840
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,830
the stakes.

841
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,580
If Mr. Xu participates in it,

842
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,790
we'll be saved.

843
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,380
The Xu Family will have to

844
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,510
give a shop to him after a vain attempt.

845
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,010
If I lose,

846
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,490
I'm also willing to give Young Madam Xu

847
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,020
one of our Wu Family's shops

848
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,510
in Furong City.

849
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,390
He'll give it to her?

850
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,250
A shop in Furong City?

851
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,450
Is the shop big?

852
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,440
How is its location?

853
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,130
For the shop that I might give you,

854
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,440
it surely has the best location

855
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,640
and the biggest size.

856
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,270
Okay.

857
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,390
Sister, go for it!

858
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,970
I bet you'll win.

859
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,210
Come on.

860
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,110
The first round is creating incense.

861
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,110
It begins now.

862
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,790
What is this?

863
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,920
The first round is creating incense.

864
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,620
This round is over now.

865
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,390
Mr. Wu, what is this?

866
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,100
This is called

867
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,970
"An egret is flying in front of Mount Xisai.

868
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:50,890
Fat mandarin fishes are swimming in the river on which peach blossoms are floating."

869
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,920
A flying egret?

870
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,030
Does it mean that he wants

871
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:53,780
Xu Zilu to fly away?

872
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,580
What an ominous meaning.

873
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,500
Young Madam Xu,

874
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,630
what about yours?

875
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,530
This is

876
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,550
"Flying among the white clouds in the sky".

877
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,280
Does it look like a flying bird?

878
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:06,860
Well...

879
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,100
Yes, yes, yes.

880
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,470
The first round is creating incense.

881
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,390
Mr. Wu wins.

882
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,020
The second round is

883
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,400
smelling incense.

884
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,520
It begins now.

885
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,360
This smell is a little familiar.

886
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,640
This incense consists of

887
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,710
agarwood,

888
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,930
and sandalwood

889
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,550
with cloves and elecampane

890
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,760
being the supplementary materials.

891
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,140
He's right.

892
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,600
The Xu Family will definitely lose.

893
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,470
Yes.

894
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,720
To distinguish different incense,

895
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,050
you can't be impatient.

896
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,280
You need to stay calm.

897
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,430
Only by smelling it slowly

898
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,690
can you know what it is.

899
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,180
I don't know how the situation is now.

900
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,950
There's another kind of material here,

901
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,210
Plum Blossom Incense.

902
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,630
She can even sense that?

903
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,290
-Amazing.
-She's so amazing.

904
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,170
The second round is smelling incense.

905
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,430
The Xu's Mansion wins.

906
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,130
Great!

907
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,400
That's great!

908
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,710
Mr. Wu,

909
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,630
thank you.

910
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,830
The third round is

911
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,070
coiling incense.

912
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,980
It begins now.

913
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,160
What is coiling incense?

914
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,080
She doesn't even know

915
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,480
what coiling incense is.

916
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,310
Young Master.

917
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,500
Then in the third round...

918
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,690
In the third round,

919
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:49,550
I admit defeat.

920
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,720
-He admitted defeat?
-He admitted defeat?

921
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,590
Mr. Wu,

922
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,780
if you admit defeat now,

923
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:56,680
you'll still have to return the shops.

924
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,280
All I want is to

925
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,410
compete with the strongest opponent.

926
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,520
Unfortunately,

927
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,410
in this competition,

928
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,380
it's fine if I lose.

929
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,420
What do you mean?

930
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,760
For the shops I've won before,

931
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,290
I'll return them to you all.

932
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,140
That's great!

933
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,940
That's great!

934
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,150
This is so great!

935
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,410
Great! He'll just return them like that.

936
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,300
It's really not easy.

937
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:18,760
Ling Se.

938
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,070
Go home to take a look at once.

939
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:22,850
What happened?

940
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,090
Xu Zilu

941
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,490
had an accident.
