[Episode 18]

3
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,110
The suburban posthouse is just ahead.

4
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:44,970
Let's go there.

5
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,710
Okay.

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,020
Those are our targets.

7
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,970
We've finally found them.

8
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,910
Let's follow them first

9
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,120
to find out how many people

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,180
are meeting them

11
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,910
and whether they have any guards.

12
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,910
Let's wait for the right time to act.

13
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,390
Okay.

14
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,730
It's quite lively here.

15
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,759
Come and take a look.

16
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,640
Candied haws!

17
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,380
Don't miss out!

18
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,730
What's the matter, Ping'er?

19
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,780
Nothing.

20
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,890
Nothing?

21
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,870
You always have this expression

22
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,950
whenever you see someone selling candied haws

23
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,910
along the way.

24
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,570
Did you miss Wang?

25
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,250
I didn't.

26
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,400
Please, stop it.

27
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Wang?

28
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,590
And you said you didn't miss him.

29
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,850
You're even seeing him in everyone else.

30
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,230
Ping'er.

31
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,860
Ping'er!

32
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,440
You're really here!

33
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,390
You silly.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,550
I didn't expect

35
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,510
that you would really come to Furong City.

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,040
Ping'er.

37
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,470
I've passed the Provincial Examination

38
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,330
and now I'm here for the next imperial examination.

39
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,270
Wang,

40
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,850
I knew you could do it.

41
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,210
I didn't expect you to be so good.

42
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,790
Look.

43
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,030
I... I can't read.

44
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,420
Is it real?

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,140
Of course.

46
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,810
Ping'er, let me tell you.

47
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,150
The questions you left for me

48
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,079
were crucial.

49
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,050
The exam this time was all about

50
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,170
the questions you left for me.

51
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,880
I've written those questions out dozens of times.

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,400
Good for you, Wang Zhujue.

53
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,160
Now you've lived up

54
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,960
to the care and effort Ping'er put into

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,840
helping you.

56
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,430
This is nothing.

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,310
It's possible

58
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,670
that I'll become the Number One Scholar

59
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,800
if I try hard enough.

60
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,780
You? Become the Number One Scholar?

61
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,130
In that case, it looks like our Qing State

62
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,170
is doomed.

63
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,430
You're just jealous.

64
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,260
Now that Ping'er is here,

65
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,790
I won't stoop to your level.

66
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,500
Ping'er.

67
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,210
I came here immediately

68
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,630
after I learned about it.

69
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,740
I wanted to tell you

70
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,000
that I passed the exam!

71
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,110
Wang, I knew it.

72
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,120
As long as you work hard,

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,160
you'll make it.

74
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,150
Oh, right.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,910
Wang Zhujue,

76
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,570
have you found a place to stay?

77
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,150
Don't even ask.

78
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,080
I finally got a room

79
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,390
at the posthouse last night,

80
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,430
but that bastard Wang Zixuan

81
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,510
tricked me.

82
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,890
I've been running

83
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,779
all over the neighborhood this morning.

84
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,579
All the hotels

85
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,420
are full.

86
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,430
Then, what should we do?

87
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,480
Our Xu family's reputation is well-known here,

88
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,430
and we have some connections with the suburban posthouse.

89
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,090
I'll ask them to get you a room.

90
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,330
Let's go.

91
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,200
Wang,

92
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,970
come with me.

93
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,300
Okay.

94
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:37,580
Let's go.

95
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,520
Ping'er.

96
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,870
I specifically bought

97
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,200
a roasted sweet potato for you yesterday.

98
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,600
It's still hot.

99
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,690
Eat up.

100
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,160
Boss.

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,100
Mr. Xu, it's been a long time.

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,180
Are you going to stay here too?

103
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,070
Three rooms.

104
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,950
Mr. Xu,

105
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,470
to be honest,

106
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,430
all the rooms

107
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,230
are fully booked today.

108
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
I'm really sorry.

109
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,990
I can only

110
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,670
get one room for you.

111
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,110
Think of a way.

112
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:18,810
Well...

113
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,270
There's really nothing we can do.

114
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,990
Xu Zilu?

115
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,610
It's been years.

116
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,290
I trust you have been well.

117
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,800
You know each other?

118
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,430
Yes.

119
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,270
No.

120
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,880
Do you know him or not?

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
I'm Lyu Qingfeng,

122
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,200
a constable from the Ministry of Personnel.

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,560
-Lyu Qingfeng.
-I'm from Linchun

124
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,630
and an old acquaintance of Xu Zilu.

125
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,770
May I know your name, Miss?

126
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
My name is Ling Se.

127
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,600
Hello, Ms. Ling.

128
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,420
And you are his...

129
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,670
She is my wife.

130
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,750
Congratulations, then.

131
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,990
Oh, so that's who he is.

132
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,710
Oh, right.

133
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,030
There are so many of you

134
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,800
with girls.

135
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,410
One room is not enough.

136
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,440
How about this?

137
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,660
I've booked two rooms,

138
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,830
and I can give you one.

139
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,050
I'll share one with my men.

140
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,820
It's okay.

141
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,620
Thank you, Lord Lyu.

142
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,610
Madam Xu, you're too kind.

143
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,400
We're from the same hometown.

144
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,590
I should help you out.

145
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,490
You haven't applied for

146
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,340
the Entry Permits yet, right?

147
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,010
Recently,

148
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,460
many students came to the city.

149
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,680
You have to queue up for a long time for it.

150
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,610
It'll be faster if I'm helping you.

151
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,230
Thank you.

152
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,980
No need.

153
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,420
We can apply for them ourselves.

154
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,540
Mr. Xu,

155
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm being kind.

156
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,250
Then, I must thank you

157
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,930
for this small favor of yours.

158
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,520
Excuse us, Lord Lyu.

159
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,350
What's wrong with you?

160
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,310
Why are you speaking so sharply?

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,590
Lord Lyu,

162
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,000
my husband usually

163
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,930
isn't like this.

164
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,690
Is there some kind of conflict

165
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,900
between you two?

166
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:51,190
Well...

167
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,870
If you don't speak up,

168
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,530
no one will think you're mute.

169
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,159
Ling Se.

170
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,500
It's getting late. Let's go.

171
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,430
We can't get in the line for permits if we're too late.

172
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,940
Let's go.

173
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,100
You go.

174
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,490
They have officials

175
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,390
with them.

176
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,130
It's hard to make a move on them.

177
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,860
We have to do it, no matter what.

178
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,830
Otherwise, our trip here will be in vain,

179
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,440
and we'll be punished after we go back.

180
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,420
Let's sneak in first

181
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,420
and play it by ear.

182
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,460
Okay.

[Suburban Posthouse]

184
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,990
Mr. Xu, you're back.

185
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,800
Young Master!

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,159
Young Master!

187
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,830
I've finally met you!

188
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,870
You have no idea

189
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,860
what kind of danger I've been through to get here!

190
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,560
I thought

191
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:42,780
I would never see you again!

192
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,980
All right. All right.

193
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,380
Let go of me first.

194
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,340
Didn't I tell you to stay home

195
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,260
and protect my mother?

196
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,190
Why are you here?

197
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,630
Old Madam was worried about you,

198
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,090
so she asked me to come to you.

199
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,220
But don't worry, Young Master.

200
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,870
I've arranged everything

201
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,720
for the Old Madam.

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,850
She's very safe now!

203
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,640
You...

204
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,830
Se! Se!

205
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,540
Se! Se!

206
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,460
Ling Shuo?

207
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,920
Why are you here?

208
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,550
Se,

209
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,820
I won first place in the Provincial Examination,

210
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,450
so I came here for the Metropolitan Examination

211
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,680
You... You came here

212
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,470
with Fuding?

213
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,440
Dad said we had no money,

214
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,220
so he told me to stop studying

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,710
and wanted me to go back to the countryside

216
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:16,570
with them.

217
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,840
I didn't want to,

218
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,880
so I escaped.

219
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,080
I wanted to come here with Wang.

220
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:21,950
But...

221
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,690
he forgot about me.

222
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,560
So, I could only

223
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,430
travel here alone.

224
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,060
It's okay.

225
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,640
That darn Wang Zhujue.

226
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,600
When I see him later,

227
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,930
I'll beat him up for you.

228
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,890
Brother Ling didn't bring enough money for the trip,

229
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,390
and we ran into each other halfway.

230
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,450
So, I came with him.

231
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,700
Thank you, Fuding.

232
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,500
It's nothing.

233
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,429
Se,

234
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,169
I was so scared.

235
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,110
Mr. Xu,

236
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,220
your Entry Permits are ready.

237
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,010
I can take them.

238
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,520
Why are you here?

239
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,320
You know each other?

240
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,360
He's the one

241
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,510
who stole the Young Master's fiancée.

242
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,110
Fuding.

243
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,540
Why did you bring that up?

244
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,900
Your fiancée is...

245
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,850
Ling Se.

246
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,070
If it weren't for you,

247
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,210
our Young Master wouldn't have become

248
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:02,390
the laughingstock of the entire Linchun City.

249
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,070
He wouldn't have remained unmarried

250
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,070
for so many years.

251
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,870
You have a fiancée,

252
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,460
and you still married my sister?

253
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,900
No...

254
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,640
No.

255
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,110
Wait.

256
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,410
-I can explain.
-Wait. Wait.

257
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,150
Let me sort it out.

258
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,220
I can't keep up with what you're saying.

259
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,790
Madam Xu,

260
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,350
you don't need to think too much.

261
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,480
It's all in the past.

262
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,470
I sincerely wish you two

263
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,740
to be happily married for a long time.

264
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,590
I still have some official work to do.

265
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,650
I'll take my leave.

266
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,520
That darn Lyu Qingfeng. Is it not enough

267
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,360
to cuckold

268
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,640
our Young Master once?

269
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,040
Young Madam,

270
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,510
you have to stay away from him.

271
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,110
Our young master

272
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,130
can't take another blow.

273
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,650
Fuding,

274
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,250
take Ling Shuo back to the room.

275
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Young Master,

276
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,410
good luck to you.

277
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,530
-I'm not leaving.
-Let's go.

278
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,420
I have to protect my sister.

279
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,150
Let's go. Go.

280
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,810
I don't want to go!

281
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,730
You won't grow taller if you don't get enough sleep at night.

282
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,730
Come on. Let's go.

283
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,070
Actually...

284
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,560
I'm sleepy too.

285
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
I'll go back and rest.

286
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,610
So...

287
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,780
it was

288
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,670
Mr. Lyu

289
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,840
who took Young Master Xu's fiancée.

290
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,300
That's unlikely.

291
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,190
I've seen Lord Lyu.

292
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,710
He is bordering on

293
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,350
good-looking, at most.

294
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,270
He is not that attractive,

295
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,690
compared to Young Master Xu.

296
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,880
If you ask me,

297
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,900
I think that there must be something wrong

298
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,430
with that girl's eyes.

299
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,350
Otherwise, how could she

300
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,670
cheat on Young Master Xu?

301
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,310
Ping'er,

302
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,620
which side are you on now?

303
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,670
What side?

304
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,700
Of course, I'm on your side.

305
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,070
No, what you were implying

306
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,750
just now

307
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,290
is that Xu Zilu's previous fiancée

308
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,840
is a better match for him.

309
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,040
Se,

310
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,030
why are you jealous of everything now?

311
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,250
She's already married.

312
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,650
What are you bothered by?

313
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
I'm not being jealous.

314
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,710
I'm just a little curious.

315
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,060
What kind of person

316
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,710
do you think

317
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,110
his ex-fiancée is?

318
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,070
Xu Zilu

319
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,850
is so picky.

320
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:58,920
So, she must

321
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,870
be a beauty.

322
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,990
As for her family background,

323
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,000
if she is going to be a good match for Xu Zilu,

324
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,050
she should be

325
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,950
a noble lady

326
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,470
from a wealthy family.

327
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,910
Fine.

328
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,830
Se,

329
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,600
let me analyze it for you.

330
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,420
Go ahead.

331
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,950
Don't you want to know

332
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,070
that girl's background, appearance,

333
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,070
and personality?

334
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,660
It'd be better

335
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,670
if I could know whether anything has ever happened

336
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,050
between them.

337
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,760
Then, go ask him.

338
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,520
What are you overthinking

339
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,720
all by yourself here?

340
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,630
How should I ask him?

341
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,260
Where should I start?

342
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,810
Fine.

343
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Let's not ask him.

344
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,790
We're the bigger one here.

345
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,960
Why do we ask him these questions

346
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,820
that will only make us look petty?

347
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,600
Let me continue

348
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,830
analyzing it for you.

349
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,950
Then the story

350
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,910
would become

351
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
that the male lead

352
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,180
and his ex-fiancée

353
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,300
meet each other once more

354
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,220
on an unfamiliar street.

355
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,530
Both of them recall the part of

356
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,710
their young and beautiful time in their memories.

357
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,640
Then,

358
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,890
he and his contract wife

359
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,430
are done

360
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,680
and cut ties with each other.

361
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,330
Ping'er,

362
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,090
you're getting more and more mean.

363
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,550
You're trying to bully me.

364
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,020
Don't you just want me to ask him?

365
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,830
Fine.

366
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,780
I'll go.

367
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:27,570
Come on.

368
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,590
I won't tell you, even if I ask him what happened.

369
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,520
It's not like I really want to know.

370
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,310
Something happened at home, right?

371
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,150
Young Master,

372
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:42,910
on the night

373
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,880
you left,

374
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,130
two men in black

375
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,420
sneaked into your room.

376
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,560
They seemed to be looking for something.

377
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,640
But I've already

378
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,860
scared them all away.

379
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,930
Old Madam

380
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,960
thought that it was the Third Master who was behind it,

381
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,020
so she asked me here

382
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,960
to tell you this.

383
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,950
Manager Wan told me

384
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,670
that we couldn't take back the shop in Furong City.

385
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,390
Looks like

386
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,070
my Third Uncle still won't just accept it.

387
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,870
Young Master,

388
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,250
if it's really

389
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,510
the Third Master who is behind it,

390
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm afraid our trip here

391
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,300
will not be peaceful.

392
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,970
I don't want peace either.

393
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,230
Go

394
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,730
transfer some men at home here.

395
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,030
After we enter the city,

396
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,870
protect the Young Madam.

397
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,930
Yes, Young Master.

398
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,110
Why are you here?

399
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,120
Did you come to see me

400
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,580
for something?

401
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,140
To admire the moon.

402
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,110
Aren't we admiring the moon?

403
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,510
Why are you staring at me?

404
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,720
Are you still thinking about

405
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,060
what happened today?

406
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,360
No, I am not.

407
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,840
I'm just

408
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,080
a little curious.

409
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,690
Is that the rumored...

410
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,230
Lord Lyu?

411
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,710
Then,

412
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,440
he and your ex-fiancée...

413
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:29,710
Are you

414
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,950
still not over this?

415
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,220
If you do,

416
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,010
I won't ask.

417
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,470
You can.

418
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,430
Is she pretty?

419
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,870
How should I put it?

420
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,130
She is not the most beautiful girl in the country.

421
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,860
Because

422
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,760
we grew up together

423
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,560
and studied at the same academy.

424
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,970
Those who wanted to pursue her

425
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,590
could form a long queue.

426
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,200
Every day,

427
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,780
all kinds of strangers

428
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,640
would come to our academy

429
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,770
just to see her face.

430
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,740
The academy?

431
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,590
Everyone in Linchun City

432
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,090
knows that she has both beauty and brains.

433
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,910
Apart from the minor issue with her eyes,

434
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,240
everything else about her is impeccable.

435
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,870
So,

436
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,390
you seem quite regretful

437
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,650
for not being with her.

438
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,910
No.

439
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,450
I didn't know love before.

440
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:18,990
Now you know?

441
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,540
Yes.

442
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,080
It's good that you know.

443
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,410
I'm going back to sleep.

444
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,940
Ling... Ling Se.

445
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,630
Who are you?

446
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,270
Get him!

447
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,200
Don't move!

448
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,160
Get up!

449
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,590
Tell me.

450
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,130
Why do you try to kill me?

451
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,130
Who sent you here?

452
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,070
My Lord,

453
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,290
we caught

454
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,470
his accomplice outside.

455
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,520
Take them to the storage room first.

456
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,590
Let's bring them back to the city tomorrow

457
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:43,430
and interrogate them together.

458
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,990
Yes!

459
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,070
Go!

460
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:45,760
Go!

461
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,580
You've offended someone?

462
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,520
Isn't that your duty

463
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,400
to find out?

464
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Would it kill you to say "thank you"?

465
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,590
Are you okay?

466
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,829
I heard there were thieves in the posthouse.

467
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,640
Did they attack you?

468
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,380
Are you hurt?

469
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,280
I'm fine.

470
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,109
They have been arrested.

471
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,150
That's good.

472
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,910
It scared me.

473
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,930
If you ask me,

474
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,950
it's all because you're dressed too richly.

475
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,109
How did that saying go?

476
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,310
"Keep your wealth hidden."

477
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,910
You should lay low next time.

478
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,310
Okay.

479
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,410
I'll listen to

480
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,740
whatever you say in the future.

481
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,670
Don't be afraid.

482
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,790
I-I-I'm going to bed.

483
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,210
It's my fault

484
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:46,220
that got you scared.

485
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,290
After entering the city tomorrow,

486
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,280
I'll take you to eat

487
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,610

488
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,200

W-W-What are you talking about?

00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,020
You...

491
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,630
should go to sleep now.

492
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,630
It'll be dawn if you don't sleep now.

[Capital Specialties]

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,320
Young Madam!

496
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,180
Young Madam!

497
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,510
We've arrived in Furong City.

498
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,370
It's still too early to eat.

499
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,160
Would you like to get off and take a look around here?

500

Let's go!

501
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,410
Come on, Young Madam.

502
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,090
Furong City is really lively.

503
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,880
Young Madam,

504
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,950
let me introduce the city to you.

505
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,330
This street is called Xilin Street.

506
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:53,340
It's the most bustling street

507
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,130
in the whole city.

508
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,480
There are stores selling everything.

509
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,340
There're a lot of things

510
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,650
we don't often see in our Linchun.

511
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,130
Really?

512
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,390
Such as jewelry and accessories.

513
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,390
The most famous shop

514

515
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:01,580
It's just around the corner.

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,180
-Really? I want to see.
-Yes.

517
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,300
What's wrong, Young Master?

518
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,820
I'm shopping with my wife.

519
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,430
Why are you so excited?

520
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,680
I'm also happy to accompany Young Madam shopping!

521
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,970
I brought you to Furong City,

522
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,940
not for you to go shopping.

523
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,870
Get back to work!

524
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,740
You won't be so lively soon.

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,560
I'll get off and take a look.

532
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,300
It's so lively outside.

533
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,690
The stores here are much bigger

534
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,220
than those in Linchun City.

535
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,380
Linchun is quite lively too.

whether the shops are big or small

538
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,630
won't make much difference, right?

539
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,850
There is a big difference.

540
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,920
Let's get off for some fresh air.

541
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,190
I don't think so, Wang.

I have a headache.

is very similar to our Xu's.

But the word on it

566
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,110
is not "Xu's," right?

567

00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,640
there is no way

574
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,980
we can't take this shop back.

575
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,390
Let's go back and have some rest.

576
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,990
Next time,

577
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,050
I'll take back this shop

578
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,650
myself.

579
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,840
Okay.

580
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:08,650
My Lord,

581
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,910
the two locked in the storage room

582
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,360
killed themselves by taking the poison.

583
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,190
It's my fault.

584
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,160
Please punish me, my Lord.

585
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,440
It seems that these two

586
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,350
were really not ordinary thieves.

587
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,620
They used their lives

588
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,260
to cover their master.

589
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,430
Let's go back to Furong City

590
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,950
and consider the matter further.

591
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,530
Yes.

592
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,860
[Xu Mansion]

593
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,090
Young Master, we've arrived.

594
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,230
That soon?

595
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,160
Here.

596
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,360
-Young Madam.
-Come on.

597
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,270
We've finally arrived.

598
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:40,710
You go

599
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,600
and help them.

600
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,110
Okay.

601
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,440
Greetings, Young Master and Young Madam.

602
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,710
You must be tired

603
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,730
from the long journey.

604
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,390
This is the Three Flower Tea

605
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,520
that I've specially prepared for you.

606
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,500
Here.

607
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,400
You're so thoughtful.

608
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,330
It's delicious.

609
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,410
As long as you like it, Young Madam.

610
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,270
This is the specialty of our city.

611
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,740
By the way, Young Madam,

612
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,900
I'm sorry

613
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,030
for having offended you before.

614
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,550
Offended me?

615
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,790
Chen Bin?

616
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,450
What are you doing here?

617
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,400
Not bad.

618
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,490
You're dressed like a decent man now.

619
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,510
I haven't introduced him to you yet.

620
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,720
This is Butler Chen.

621
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,310
Butler Chen.

622
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,290
Which house are you managing?

623
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,610
Of course,

624
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,880
it's our Xu Mansion in Furong City.

625
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,850
Fuding, my brother.

626
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,450
It's been a long time.

627
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,200
Wait, Young Master.

628
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,860
C-C-Can I have a word with you?

629
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,380
What's going on?

630
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:57,630
After what happened with my Third Uncle,

631
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,780
I asked him to stay here

632
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,640
to be my butler.

633
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,580
What's wrong?

634
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,020
Young Master, how can you

635
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,280
let him be your butler?

636
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,470
How long have I been serving you?

637
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,060
Have I not been beaten enough?

638
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,850
You let him...

639
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:12,050
How come you don't let me be your butler?

640
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,000
You're not very happy

641
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,810
with your current job,

642
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,580
are you?

643
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:17,710
If you don't want to do it, then quit.

644
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,010
Young Master.

645
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:20,740
Young Madam.

646
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,810
Let's go inside.

647
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's go.

648
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:23,850
Come on.

649
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,670
Watch the steps.

650
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,430
Come on.

651
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:29,500
I...

652
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,350
A tiger...

653
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:34,710
You are like a tiger that has fallen into the plain and is bullied by dogs.

654
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,630
Right?

655
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,100
Look.

656
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,640
There's an artificial mountain

657
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,560
and garden here.

658
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,270
This is not about

659
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,030
whether I should

660
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,860
be the butler.

661
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,090
It's mainly about

662
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,020
that only I can take care of you, Young Master!

663
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,220
I am your only one,

664
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,040
Young Master!

665
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,340
I'm very useful, really!

666
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,140
Young Master,

667
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,510
I know this place very well,

668
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,310
Young Master!

669
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,780
Xu Zilu has arrived in the Furong City?

670
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,710
Yes, Old Master.

671
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,280
I didn't expect him to enter the city so quickly.

672
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,250
How's everything

673
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,380
at the perfume shop?

674
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,960
After Manager Wan left,

675
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,820
we started to

676
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
transfer things.

677
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,220
As for those things that can't be seen,

678
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,820
they have been taken care of.

679
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,750
It's just

680
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,550
that I'm afraid that we don't have enough time

681
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,010
to transfer the money from the perfume shop.

682
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,080
If I really

683
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:17,710
leave him with an empty shop,

684
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,550
will he ever let it go?

685
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,920
He is already here.

686
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,710
We can't keep the perfume store.

687
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,570
Old Master,

688
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,990
should we go see Young Master Xu?

689
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,740
You are family after all.

690
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,070
When has he ever treated me like family?

691
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,730
I go see him?

692
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,860
To let him humiliate me again?

693
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,460
That ungrateful boy.

694
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,120
He wouldn't have kicked me out

695
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,430
if he had even thought that we were a family, even just a bit.

696
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,910
For now,

697
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,470
I can only find another way to make money.

698
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,260
Any response from Wu Qi?

699
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,410
Old Master,

700
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,140
Mr. Wu has returned

701
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,850
your visiting card.

702
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,540
These young people.

703
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,210
All of them

704
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,180
are looking down on others.

705
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,570
If it weren't for Prince Xian

706
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,030
viewing him differently,

707
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,430
why would I be

708
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,980
lowering myself like this?

709
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,260
Lack of patience in minor matters can disrupt the overall plan.

710
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,020
He wants his social standing,

711
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,200
and I'll give him that.

712
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,970
[Wu Mansion]

713
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,920
Come and take a look.

714
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,270
Master Xu,

715
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,630
please go back.

716
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,090
Our young master doesn't want to see you.

717
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,200
Did he mention

718
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,490
the reason that he doesn't want to see me?

719
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,370
The Young Master said,

720
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,370
"People with different values can't work together."

721
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,900
Master Xu, please.

722
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,120
Alright.

723
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,240
Sorry to disturb you.

724
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,220
Different values.

725
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,410
Wu Qi,

726
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,760
don't blame me for being ruthless in the future.

727
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,030
Young Master,

728
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,850
he's gone.

729
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,410
The Third Master Xu is good.

730
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,070
I have to be careful to avoid him

731
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,400
when I go out these days.

732
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,360
Young Master,

733
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,490
where are you going?

734
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,140
To meet an interesting person.

735
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:33,990
Mr. Wu!

736
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,170
Young Madam Xu,

737
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,740
how have you been?

738
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,580
I'm doing well.

739
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,120
How about you? How have you been?

740
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,660
When I heard that you were coming,

741
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,840
all my worries disappeared.

742
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,970
Everything is fine.

743
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,150
Come take a look.

744
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,110
How is this shop?

745
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,670
Is this the shop

746
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,870
you want to give me?

747
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,890
It's so big.

748
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,960
This shop is also considered to be

749
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,310
in a prime location in the city.

750
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,710
The size is rarely ideal.

751
00:26:58,610 --> 00:26:59,410
The price of it

752
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,720
is greater than the combined value of ten shops in Linchun.

753
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,650
That expensive?

754
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,160
You're willing to give this shop to me?

755
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
I had planned to open a branch here

756
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,180
after buying this shop.

757
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,810
But then I went to Linchun

758
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,970
and met you.

759
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
And of course, Mr. Xu as well.

760
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,380
I feel we really hit it off.

761
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,420
It must be fate.

762
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,110
In that case,

763
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,810
money doesn't matter.

764
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,040
Mr. Wu, you are so generous.

765
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,390
If I refuse it,

766
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,040
wouldn't that make me look pretentious, right?

767
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,100
But this shop

768
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,950
is in such a great location,

769
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,840
and it is so big.

770
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,330
If I only sell Aromatic Tea and cakes,

771
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,140
wouldn't that be a bit of a pity?

772
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,900
Young Madam Xu,

773
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,080
why not let your imagination run wild

774
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,630
and consider doing some bigger business?

775
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,030
If you have any concerns,

776
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,390
we can cooperate.

777
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,710
It's just a matter of investing a bit more capital.

778
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,440
Mr. Wu, you're truly generous.

779
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,000
Zilu.

780
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,730
-Darling.
-What are you here?

781
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,890
I've just finished my work.

782
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,490
So, I'm here to take you home.

783
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,910
Mr. Xu, how have you been?

784
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,190
Mr. Wu, how have you been?

785
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,510
Mr. Wu,

786
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,080
you're so warm and generous.

787
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,090
My wife and I

788
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,450
are really grateful.

789
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,900
Mr. Xu,

790
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,260
you don't have to say that.

791
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,520
Business is business.

792
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,940
We are simply discussing a potential business partnership.

793
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,230
Since you're here,

794
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,250
why don't we have some tea together?

795
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,900
I have

796
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,040
our new specialty,

797
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,070
Three Flower Tea.

798
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:14,130
It has a rich aroma.

799
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,870
Perhaps

800
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,480
it can inspire you

801
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,870
in your incense-making.

802
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:18,430
Okay.

803
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,320
I want to look around this shop more.

804
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,150
You can go have some tea first.

805
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,170
I'll come to you later.

806
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,630
Okay.

807
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,960
Please.

808
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,530
[Wu Mansion]

809
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,940
Mr. Xu, is your visit to the city this time

810
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,200
to accompany your wife in receiving a shop and starting a business,

811
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,660
or do you have other plans?

812
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:47,880
Mr. Wu,

813
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,310
just say what you want to say.

814
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,420
Something happened to your family recently.

815
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,480
Is Third Master Xu

816
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,690
still a member of your family?

817
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,060
You seem to be quite concerned

818
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,520
about our family matters.

819
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,230
It's not that I like to meddle in other people's business.

820
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,030
It's just that

821
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,970
Third Master Xu

822
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,640
has tried to see me many times.

823
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,220
I'm in a dilemma about

824
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,680
whether to meet him or not.

825
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,910
So, I wanted to get a sure answer

826
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,910
from you.

827
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,430
Since you've heard about it,

828
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,690
why do you still ask me?

829
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,070
Okay.

830
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,710
Since you said so,

831
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,670
I understand.

832
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,730
However,

833
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,510
given our past interactions in Linchun,

834
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,880
I'd like to

835
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,070
remind you of something,

836
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,510
now that you're here.

837
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,220
Just out with it.

838
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,740
Furong is unlike Linchun.

839
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,300
There are more important people in the capital.

840
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,700
So, there are many rules.

841
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,700
Although we are both Imperial Merchants

842
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,080
and can do more large-scale business

843
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,120
under this title,

844
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,390
it's just that you have to know more details

845
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,250
about the things you need to know.

846
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,510
In this era of peace and prosperity,

847
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,970
people live in abundance.

848
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,710
Furong

849
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,200
is even more bustling with prosperity.

850
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,470
Over the past few years,

851
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,580
Prince Xian has been favored by His Majesty,

852
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,580
and he likes to make acquaintances.

853
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,550
So, he must have made connections

854
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,170
with a lot of people everywhere.

855
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,440
How forgetful of me.

856
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,430
I forgot

857
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,050
that you already have business dealings

858
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,200
with Prince Xian.

859
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,660
Of course, you know more than I do.

860
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,660
I talked too much.

861
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
I'll keep

862
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,680
what you have said in mind.

863
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,560
However...

864
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,460
there's something

865
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,890
I still can't figure out.

866
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,100
From Lingnan to Linchun,

867
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,160
and from Linchun to Furong,

868
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:36,590
you've been approaching me.

869
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,230
Why?

870
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,580
Young Master Xu,

871
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,260
you and I

872
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,290
will be connected

873
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,110
because of a certain person.

874
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:54,900
But...

875
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,620
don't worry, Young Master Xu.

876
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,470
This person

877
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,660
will not be your wife.

878
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,600
[Xu Mansion]

879
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,830
Young Master,

880
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,960
do you want to see me?

881
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,570
Have you sent my visiting card

882
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,430
to Prince Xian?

883
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,350
Yes.

884
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,690
Fuding personally sent it to Prince Xian's mansion.

885
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,450
After you came,

886
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,690
Fuding has become more diligent.

887
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,050
Young Master,

888
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,780
you are so bad.

889
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:29,590
By the way,

890
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,090
are there any bustling streets

891
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,510
here?

892
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,810
I'd like to show the Young Madam around.

893
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,950
Young Master,

894
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,870
you've asked the right question.

895
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,670
Tomorrow

896
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,000
is the Qianqiu Festival Garden Party.

897
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,600
How about we

898
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,580
take the Young Madam to join it?

899
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,200
Garden Party?

900
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,010
Sounds good.

901
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,390
You go ahead and arrange it.

902
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,520
Okay, Young Master.

903
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,350
By the way,

904
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,280
Young Master,

905
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,110
do you know?

906
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,750
In our city,

907
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,080
the Qianqiu Festival Garden Party

908
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,360
is a day when two lovers

909
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,230
exchange sachets to affirm each other's feelings.

910
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,070
It's said that

911
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,230
if lovers exchange sachets on that day,

912
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,030
the two of them

913
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,310
will be blessed by God

914
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,250
and be a happy couple

915
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,030
forever.

916
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:13,260
Young Master,

917
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,030
shall I

918
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,440
buy a sachet for you

919
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,350
to give to the Young Madam tomorrow?

920
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,950
No need.

921
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,390
Go back to work.

922
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,350
Okay.

923
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,950
I'm getting back to work, Young Master.

924
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,960
Still up at this hour.

925
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,950
You don't even know

926
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,080
how to take care of yourself properly.

927
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:32,230
Why did you get up so early today?

928
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,030
It's new clothing. You've dressed up?

929
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,570
I heard

930
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,270
that the city is hosting the Qianqiu Garden Party.

931
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,770
There will be lots of delicious food and fun activities.

932
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,990
I think you'll enjoy it.

933
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,520
How about

934
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,480
we go together tonight?

935
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,440
Okay.

936
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,430
Then, I have to

937
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:50,710
wear some new clothes.

938
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,970
I can't lose to you.

939
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,360
I've prepared it for you.

940
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,030
Here.

941
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,450
Wait for me.

942
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,190
Now,

943
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,469
you finally

944
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,830
look like my other half.

945
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,679
Don't read into it too much.

946
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,949
I just think

947
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:58,300
that dressing like this suits you better.

948
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,270
Beautiful.

949
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:02,910
Of course.

950
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,350
I was born beautiful.

951
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,430
Let's go.

952
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,350
Young Master.

953
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,570
I've prepared some Three Flower Tea for you.

954
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,830
I know you didn't sleep at all last night.

955
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,970
You didn't sleep at all last night?

956
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,450
No. I was trying to make some new incense.

957
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:25,950
Here.

958
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,630
Young Madam.

959
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,490
I don't need it.

960
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,260
You've improved.

961
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,190
By the way, Young Master,

962
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,520
Prince Xian has replied

963
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,660
and wants to see you.

964
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,790
When?

965
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,920
Now.

966
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,950
Well...

967
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,100
I don't have time now.

968
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,040
You reply to His Highness and say we'll come visit him another day.

969
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,240
But, Young Master, that's Prince Xian.

970
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,670
It's fine.

971
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,870
You go busy.

972
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,050
I'll go by myself.

973
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,900
How can you go to the Garden Party alone?

974
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,350
Then,

975
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,070
I'll take Ling Shuo with me

976
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,290
and take this chance to show him around.

977
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,450
How about this?

978
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,610
I'll meet him first and keep it brief.

979
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:11,910
Wait for me.

980
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,390
Go.

981
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:25,830
[Three Flower Tea]

982
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,060
I'm Xu Zilu.

983
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,080
Greetings, Your Highness.
