[Fulai Inn]

4
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,930
My poor dear sister.

5
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,050
So young and already living like a widow.

6
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,750
My dear sister,

7
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,220
I'm going to kill you.

8
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,150
Wait,

9
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,090
I even prepared a gift for you.

10
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,410
Am I sweet?

11
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,160
Yiyang Powder.

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,130
It's expensive.

13
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,830
I thought you had

14
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,510
some tasty treat for us.

15
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,030
What a disappointment.

16
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,560
You really

17
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,120
love causing trouble, huh?

18
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,520
If you have the time,

19
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,470
you might as well

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,710
give me the interest.

21
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,990
Didn't we agree on half?

22
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,910
I don't want this.

23
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,480
You never

24
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,000
let anyone take advantage of you.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,760
And you never

26
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,450
miss a chance to get a bargain.

27
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,020
You're so stingy.

28
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,030
Take it.

29
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,360
I won't admit it once you go out.

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,340
Thank you.

31
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,710
Count it.

32
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,960
Welcome.

33
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,790
How is it?

34
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,150
Isn't the publicity effect good?

35
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,690
How dare you come?

36
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,510
I've been looking for you.

37
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,110
Come here.

38
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:42,990
Well...

39
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,390
You Hong Sect

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,990
is getting more and more outrageous.

41
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,090
I asked you to spread

42
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,930
dirt about Xu Zilu.

43
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,329
I didn't ask you to spread

44
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,230
bedroom secrets.

45
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,390
Now even I'm involved.

46
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,829
I'll ask you for a refund.

47
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,120
Refund? Don't.

48
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,070
You know the rumor

49
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,200
is uncontrollable.

50
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,480
You can't blame me.

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,620
I...

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,720
Forget it.

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:06,670
I won't argue with you.

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,530
Just think of a way

55
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,050
to suppress the rumors.

56
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,750
I'll figure out a way,

57
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,010
But since spreading a rumor costs money,

58
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,230
suppressing a rumor

59
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,520
will cost even more...

60
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,230
How dare you ask me for money?

61
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,030
I have no choice.

62
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,640
No, not enough.

63
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,840
Not enough.

64
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,890
Still not enough?

65
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,430
No,

66
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,780
these may not be enough.

67
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,390
You know, it's hard

68
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:42,990
to supress

69
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,630
the rumor.

70
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,420
It takes a lot of effort.

71
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,260
I know it's hard.

72
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,040
Go.

73
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,940
Don't let me see you again. Hurry.

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,430
Young Master Xu,

75
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,230
you're such a generous man.

76
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,110
Please forgive me this time, okay?

77
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,510
You can have the chicken.

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,570
No, no, no.

79
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,030
Young Master Xu,

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,780
I know you've been working hard lately.

81
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,710
This roast chicken

82
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,030
is for your health.

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,790
Try it.

84
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,080
Young Madam,

85
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,250
what are you murmuring about?

86
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,550
Well,

87
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,500
is Young Master Xu in the study?

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,850
How could you

89
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,870
even mention him?

90
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,820
Young Madam,

91
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,710
you know

92
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,100
how proud he is.

93
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,310
How could you say those things

94
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,440
about him publicly?

95
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,700
I didn't mean to.

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,360
He did something

97
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,310
awful to me first

98
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,510
and even grounded me.

99
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,210
I just did it

100
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
out of anger.

101
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,360
Young Madam,

102
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,730
you should be content.

103
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,760
Young Master

104
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,920
has been good to you.

105
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,190
Your engagement with him

106
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,560
has already caused trouble to him

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,690
with the Tao family.

108
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,270
But you

109
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,470
went there

110
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,180
and irritated Ms. Tao.

111
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,510
Now Master Tao is angry

112
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,350
and cancelled

113
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,180
the cooperation with the Xu family.

114
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,240
They even cut off

115
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,340
our pepper supply.

116
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,909
We nearly

117
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,670
couldn't fulfill

118
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,870
Prince Xian's order.

119
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,750
And still,

120
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,290
Young Master didn't blame you,

121
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,180
just had you stay home

122
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,980
for two days.

123
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,990
If it were me,

124
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,640
I'd be dead in the moat

125
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,470
by now.

126
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,580
Peppers can be made into sachets?

127
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,270
Yes.

128
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,750
But...

129
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,350
with all that's happened,

130
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,010
why didn't Xu Zilu tell me?

131
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,060
What should we do now?

132
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,710
I'll go beg Tao Meili.

133
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,310
Wait.

134
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,530
No need, Young Madam.

135
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,210
There aren't many

136
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,960
businessman

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,970
as wise and crafty as

138
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:25,770
Young Master.

139
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,230
He's already handled

140
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,960
everything.

141
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,870
Young Madam,

142
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,040
please don't be mad

143
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,800
at him again.

144
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,560
As long as it's handled.

145
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,590
You're right.

146
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,600
I shouldn't see him

147
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,310
right now.

148
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,080
You can have the roast chicken.

149
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,020
Okay.

150
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,909
Chicken for free.

151
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,850
Why are you here alone?

152
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
I just heard

153
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,000
someone else outside.

154
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,080
Young Madam came

155
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
and gave me a chicken.

156
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,990
Put it down.

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,430
But

158
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,510
she gave it to me...

159
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,970
Even took the chicken.

160
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,580
Take a look.

161
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,610
Come and take a look.

162
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,980
From today on,

163
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,350
anyone who doesn't gossip

164
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,280
about Young Master Xu's health

165
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,890
will get a ten-coin

166
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,840
reward from me!

167
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,650
Not only will I stop gossiping,

168
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,909
I'll praise Young Master Xu

169
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,840
for being strong and brave!

170
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,070
I know.

171
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,610
Mr. Xu is the best!

172
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,710
Yes.

173
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,890
Mr. Xu is amazing.

174
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,570
It wasn't me.

175
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,150
I swear.

176
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,480
Definitely not me.

177
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,950
The strongest.

178
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:00,700
Mr. Xu

179
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,750
is the best.

180
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,700
Mr. Xu

181
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,810
is the best.

182
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,930
Mr. Xu

183
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,940
is the best.

184
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,030
Mr. Xu

185
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
is the best.

186
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,600
To be honest,

187
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,090
this batch of goods

188
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,780
isn't great quality.

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,010
They'll be hard to sell.

190
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,660
Yes.

191
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,790
It's all my fault

192
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,400
for judging it wrong.

193
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,700
I shouldn't have made that mistake.

194
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,390
My fault.

195
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,330
How about this?

196
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,870
I have some

197
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,510
fine aged agarwood in my warehouse.

198
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,330
We can pair it

199
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,540
with dried flowers

200
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,860
to make sachets.

201
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,909
Consider your materials an investment.

202
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:41,909
Let's cooperate.

203
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,030
What do you think?

204
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,600
Good for you.

205
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,510
Brilliant idea.

206
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,470
Have you heard about

207
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,400
Young Master Xu?

208
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,430
Rich people are so funny.

209
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,880
His ability is poor,

210
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,040
but doesn't want others to talk about it.

211
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,700
He even paid for compliments.

212
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,640
I heard.

213
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,830
They're saying he's as strong

214
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,070
as an ox now.

215
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,030
Isn't that just covering it up?

216
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,120
People

217
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,290
always brag about what they lack.

218
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,680
Poor Young Madam Xu.

219
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,400
Let's go.

220
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,360
Have some tea.

221
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,970
Have some tea.

222
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,400
I gotta go.

223
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,950
See you.

224
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,760
Let's go.

225
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,030
Young Master,

226
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,560
I've heard about your reputation

227
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,830
since I was a junior steward

228
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,390
that you have

229
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,430
a good taste.

230
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,270
Seeing the Tao Mansion now,

231
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,690
it truly stands out.

232
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,870
Thanks, I'm flattered.

233
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,470
It's rare for you

234
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,470
to visit Linchun.

235
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,070
Please accept this

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,770
small token of respect.

237
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,510
No need, maybe next time.

238
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,280
I'm just passing

239
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,860
through Linchun on my way,

240
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,430
and I'll be heading

241
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,440
south tomorrow morning.

242
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,520
You're not here for

243
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,810
the Xu family's order?

244
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,060
You are

245
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,860
well-informed.

246
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,920
I only learned recently

247
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,750
that the Xu family is struggling

248
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,010
to get an ingredient

249
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,490
for their incense.

250
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,210
So you're not here for this.

251
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,920
What?

252
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,360
Xu Zilu didn't mention that

253
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,470
to me yesterday.

254
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,600
To make the Jiuchongtian Incense,

255
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,870
they need pepper.

256
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,350
Xu's pepper supply is in big trouble.

257
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,750
You know how scarce pepper is

258
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,960
in Qing.

259
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,670
It won't be easy

260
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,110
to fulfill a large order

261
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,750
in such a short time.

262
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,880
Well, well, Xu Zilu.

263
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,980
Mr. Xu,

264
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,220
whatever you need, just tell me.

265
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,470
Don't keep turning your back on me.

266
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,310
It's creepy.

267
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,320
Want some water?

268
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,070
Take a break.

269
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,710
Supressing rumors

270
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,430
takes time.

271
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,650
It won't be that soon.

272
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,920
I knew it.

273
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,950
You're the one letting them say that I'm

274
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,350
as strong as a tiger, huh?

275
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,650
What nonsense did the

276
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,120
Nosy Parker make up?

277
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,240
Do you know

278
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,800
what people are saying now?

279
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,190
What?

280
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,940
That I'm spending a fortune to squash the rumors,

281
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,710
that I'm biting off

282
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,880
more than I can chew!

283
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,590
I was just trying to help.

284
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,280
I didn't expect the rumors

285
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,780
to spiral out of control.

286
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,110
Help?

287
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,030
Fine.

288
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,240
I appreciate your help.

289
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,290
Can you

290
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,390
stop doing this?

291
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,900
You may not care about

292
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,990
your reputation, but I do.

293
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,270
How am I supposed to do business like this?

294
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:29,990
Tell me.

295
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,620
How?

296
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,830
Young Master.

297
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,520
Young Master.

298
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,550
Young Master, there's been an incident.

299
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,370
What happened?

300
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,490
Early this morning,

301
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,150
there was a fire at the port.

302
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,940
Some goods were burned,

303
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,050
including a shipment of pepper

304
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,050
we just received.

305
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,870
Did you report it?

306
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,270
Yes,

307
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,280
the authorities came to investigate

308
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,560
but found no clues.

309
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,320
They say it's just

310
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,450
an accidental fire,

311
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,930
caused by dry conditions.

312
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,910
Accident?

313
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,770
No, it wasn't accidental.

314
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,590
Young Master.

315
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,240
Young Master.

316
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,160
Eunuch Zhou is here again.

317
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,810
He doesn't look happy today.

318
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,340
He came right after the fire.

319
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,980
Quite the timing.

320
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,930
Good trick.

321
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,450
Get ready.

322
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:12,670
Fuding.

323
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,440
Manager Wan said a batch of

324
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,370
pepper got burned.

325
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,490
Is it the batch of pepper

326
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,320
Xu Zilu bought?

327
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,920
Yes.

328
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:22,950
What should we do?

329
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,990
What else can we do?

330
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,930
It's Prince Xian we're dealing with.

331
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,330
Who would dare cross him?

332
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,110
Now,

333
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,730
unless a miracle happens,

334
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,280
the Xu family is doomed.

335
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,330
What are you doing?

336
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,160
Are you okay?

337
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,730
What do you think?

338
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,790
I'm sorry.

339
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,510
I know it's all my fault.

340
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,700
If I hadn't

341
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,130
messed up with Tao Meili,

342
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,430
you wouldn't be so stressed

343
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,430
about the pepper.

344
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,090
Is there anything I can do?

345
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,360
Let me help.

346
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,570
This isn't your fault.

347
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,510
The Tao family didn't cooperate with the Xu family

348
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,500
because of me.

349
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,270
I'll handle it.

350
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,190
Just don't

351
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,490
cause me any more trouble.

352
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,100
Ping'er,

353
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,110
where else can I buy

354
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,950
that pepper?

355
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,790
My lady,

356
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,270
you've asked me

357
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:44,640
the same question

358
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,400
many times in the past two days.

359
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,740
I really don't understand.

360
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,190
Is it that precious?

361
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,850
I went to see Liu Yeniang that day.

362
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,290
She has a small bottle of it in the kitchen.

363
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,160
Just a tiny bit,

364
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,190
and she wouldn't give it to me.

365
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,520
So much for sisterhood.

366
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,030
Of course pepper is precious.

367
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,990
Even in the palace,

368
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,390
it's used sparingly.

369
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,950
Our Qing State

370
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,370
doesn't produce pepper.

371
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,940
What you see

372
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,590
is all imported from abroad.

373
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,970
That's why Young Master Xu

374
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,610
has been so busy these days.

375
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,160
I heard from Fuding

376
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,770
that he hasn't been home

377
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,900
for the past two days

378
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:18,190
and even plans to use the incense formula for trade.

379
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,030
Isn't an incense formula just like a recipe?

380
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,510
If he gives it away,

381
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,790
how can he do business?

382
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,560
Yeah.

383
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,410
He has no choice.

384
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,460
If we can't buy it,

385
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,350
can we not do it?

386
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,840
Of course not.

387
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,610
Although Young Master Xu is very rich,

388
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,610
he is just a commoner.

389
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,360
If Prince Xian really blames him,

390
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,890
I'm afraid he can't do anything about it.

391
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,990
Oh no, it's over.

392
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,840
I've really doomed

393
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,840
Xu Zilu this time.

394
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,590
No,

395
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,710
I have to go out and find a solution.

396
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,020
My dear lady,

397
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,870
please don't cause Young Master Xu

398
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,670
more trouble.

399
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,560
The rumors

400
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,660
and pepper issues

401
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,270
have already

402
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,470
given him a hard time.

403
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,190
If you stir up

404
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,620
more trouble at this time,

405
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,390
I'm afraid

406
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,970
he'll be pissed off by you.

407
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:06,920
Besides,

408
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,640
aren't you going to

409
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,340
meet your friend Luodi today?

410
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,550
You're not going?

411
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,350
I forgot about that.

412
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,120
Forget it.

413
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:16,590
I'm not in the mood.

414
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,430
I'm not going.

415
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,560
Just sitting here

416
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,240
won't solve anything.

417
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:23,670
Try to

418
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,650
stay positive.

419
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,160
Stop eating.

420
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,470
Your face is full.

421
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,150
I'll eat it.

422
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,990
You are full.

423
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,720
Enjoy yourselves.

424
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,050
Here are the dishes.

425
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,130
Your friend is quite generous.

426
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,700
And quite unique looking too.

427
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,540
It's just not my type.

428
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,290
I can't.

429
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,740
My dear sister,

430
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,850
you don't have to

431
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,190
fall in love with

432
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,510
every man you meet.

433
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,700
Ling Se,

434
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,820
your friend

435
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,850
is really useful.

436
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,510
Anyone who treats you to a meal

437
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,590
is a good friend?

438
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,310
Come on.

439
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,850
Friends, let's drink.

440
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:02,670
Drink.

441
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,440
Let's drink.

442
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,830
Your friends are here.

443
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,260
What about your husband?

444
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,910
Here I heard

445
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,660
every day that

446
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,840
Xu Zilu is sick.

447
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,330
What illness does he have?

448
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,470
Well, this rumor

449
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,710
is going to spread abroad soon.

450
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,170
All right.

451
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,720
This

452
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,050
Luodi

453
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,250
has prepared roast lamb leg for you.

454
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,150
Make some room.

455
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,530
Come on.

456
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,390
Roast lamb leg.

457
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,990
Eat it while it's hot.

458
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:35,710
Come on.

459
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,630
Wait,

460
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,620
it doesn't taste good this way.

461
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,020
It needs more seasoning.

462
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,540
Oh my goodness,

463
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:46,980
are you

464
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,550
out of your mind?

465
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,640
How much will all

466
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,030
this pepper cost?

467
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,030
Not enough. More.

468
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,400
Wait.

469
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,950
Luodi,

470
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
this is pepper?

471
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,280
Luodi,

472
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,050
do you have more?

473
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,750
Sure,

474
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,870
I have plenty.

475
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,830
Give this to Manager Chen.

476
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,450
Remember,

477
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,190
don't let anyone

478
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,120
read the letter.

479
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,990
Young Master, what's in the letter?

480
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,190
The incense formula.

481
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,910
Young Master, you can't do this.

482
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,610
Many have offered

483
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,350
fortunes for it,

484
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,360
but we've never sold it.

485
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,890
How can we just give it away?

486
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,440
I don't have

487
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,490
other choices.

488
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,040
This is the only way.

489
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,850
But Young Master,

490
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,520
this is our

491
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,150
exclusive incense formula.

492
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,430
No,

493
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,840
you can't sell the incense formula.

494
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,460
What are you doing here?

495
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,020
This is ground into powder,

496
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,680
but it should still be usable.

497
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,640
What is it?

498
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,150
Pepper?

499
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,190
You want pepper?

500
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,180
How much do you need?

501
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,650
As much as you have.

502
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,470
A big cartful?

503
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,320
I don't have that much,

504
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,660
but I do have two sacks.

505
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,260
You can have them.

506
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,730
He says he only has two sacks.

507
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,589
Is that enough?

508
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,829
Yes.

509
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,200
Could I buy these two sacks from you

510
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,329
at the market price?

511
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,060
Translate.

512
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,880
He said, "10 taels per kilo,

513
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,770
will you sell?"

514
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:19,900
No, no, no.

515
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,869
No.

516
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,920
I won't sell it.

517
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,630
You are my friend.

518
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,360
I'll give them to you for free.

519
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,310
Great!

520
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,410
Pavarotti,

521
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,020
you've only been in town for a few days,

522
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
and your vocabulary has grown a lot.

523
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,680
Thank you for your help.

524
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,210
Thank you.

525
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,630
He said thank you.

526
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,840
No thanks.

527
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,230
You are my good friend.

528
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,310
Let's swear by heaven and earth.

529
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,850
He wants to swear with you.

530
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,550
Not a marriage oath,

531
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,030
it's a brotherhood vow.

532
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,300
There's no need to be so formal.

533
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,360
We are friends now.

534
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,990
If you ever need my help,

535
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,720
just tell me.

536
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,790
Fine, you are my buddy.

537
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,880
And he's your bro.

538
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,750
What?

539
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,790
Buddy and bro.

540
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,180
Perfect match.

541
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,980
Awesome!

542
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,110
Perfect match.

543
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:23,590
Perfect match.

544
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,130
Perfect match.

545
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,300
Friend.

546
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,000
Thanks...

547
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,390
for today.

548
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,190
You're welcome.

549
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,720
I owe you.

550
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:38,470
By the way,

551
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,950
about those rumors, just give me some time.

552
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,480
I'll figure something out.

553
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,320
Forget it.

554
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
Don't waste your effort.

555
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,760
After some time,

556
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,630
people will probably forget.

557
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,240
No,

558
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,570
I have to find a way.

559
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,290
Otherwise,

560
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:51,870
I'll feel like

561
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,830
I owe you.

562
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,250
What can you do?

563
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:55,600
Do you want me

564
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,320
to put on a show

565
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,130
in public?

566
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,640
Just ignore it.

567
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,520
Young Master Xu,

568
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,040
you are really smart.

569
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,990
I have an idea.

570
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,360
Did I remind her anything?

571
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,390
Come in.

572
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,150
Why are you here?

573
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,580
Young Master Xu,

574
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,280
I specially made this calming tea

575
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
for you.

576
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,520
Have a taste.

577
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,030
Get to the point.

578
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Here's the thing.

579
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:42,970
To break the rumor,

580
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,170
I came up with an idea.

581
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:44,990
Tonight,

582
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,370
I'll stay in your room.

583
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:03,830
Don't worry.

584
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,910
I promise to serve you

585
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,090
well tonight.

586
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,860
Tonight's weather

587
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,330
is perfect for barbecue.

588
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,250
Miss Ping'er,

589
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,620
do you think we'll see

590
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,020
shooting stars tonight?

591
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,780
I just heard it.

592
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,790
I'm not sure as well.

593
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,870
We have barbecue.

594
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,900
Who cares about shooting stars?

595
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,220
That's right, Miss Ping'er.

596
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,480
Young Madam is so nice,

597
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,800
even gave you money

598
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,660
to buy us meat.

599
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,450
You're overthinking it.

600
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,370
She's not usually

601
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,370
this generous.

602
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,350
Darling,

603
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,310
let's go to bed early.

604
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,670
Young Master and Young Madam

605
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,980
are in the same room.

606
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,610
Young Master,

607
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,730
the audience is all set.

608
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,110
After tonight,

609
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,600
all your rumors

610
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,390
will vanish.

611
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,590
Get out.

612
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,750
If I get out,

613
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,740
it'll only confirm

614
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,010
the rumors about your illness.

615
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,440
Suit yourself.

616
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,760
Why doesn't this bed move...

617
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,900
Why doesn't this bed move at all?

618
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,700
Redwood beds are the sturdiest.

619
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,660
My mother had this bed

620
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,240
custom-made from Beiyun.

621
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,010
It doesn't make any noise.

622
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,160
Then my plan

623
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,230
will be ruined.

624
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,150
No way.

625
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,750
I have to

626
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:00,770
make up for it.

627
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,970
If I go out now,

628
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,270
I'll be in trouble too.

629
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,910
What is the lady up to in there?

630
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,980
Oh my.

631
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:16,700
What?

632
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,430
I heard it.

633
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:25,880
Yes.

634
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,140
What are you doing? Where is Young Master?

635
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,400
Fuding,

636
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,580
don't ruin our Young Master's good time.

637
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,780
What good time can Young Master have?

638
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,390
Why didn't I kno...

639
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,510
Rumors are not credible.

640
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,970
Our Young Master is strong as ever.

641
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,230
It's been over an hour.

642
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,670
It hasn't stopped yet.

643
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,950
An hour?

644
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:53,840
Come on.

645
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,150
Come on.

646
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,430
Come on.

647
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,720
Go back.

648
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,550
Hurry up.

649
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,160
I can't do this anymore.

650
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,030
I can't.

651
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:41,950
I can't.

652
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,950
I give up. I surrender.

653
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,370
I failed.

654
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,030
I'm going back to sleep.

655
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,350
Wait.

656
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,480
If you leave now,

657
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,840
the rumor you spread

658
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,880
will be settled.

659
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,400
Please,

660
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,060
I was wrong.

661
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,270
My fault.

662
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,710
I spoke wildly.

663
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,520
I was reckless.

664
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,990
I won't talk nonsense again.

665
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,560
Please let me go back to sleep.

666
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,760
Just

667
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:11,790
stay here tonight

668
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,820
and leave tomorrow morning.

669
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:14,830
Okay.

670
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,150
I'm going to sleep.

671
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,310
Stop.

672
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,390
Get down.

673
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,060
Don't touch my bed.

674
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,090
Where should I sleep?

675
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,530
Except the bed,

676
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,060
you can sleep anywhere you want.

677
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,870
Who cares?

678
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,410
Fine.

679
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,040
Young Master,

680
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,760
I will fix it for you.

681
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,360
Don't worry.

682
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,030
Why are you kneeling

683
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,490
in the middle of the night?

684
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,010
I don’t have money for you.

685
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,350
In the ninth year of Yonghe,

686
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,470
the year of Guichou,

687
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,750
in early spring,

688
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,190
we gathered at Lanting in Shanyin of Kuaiji

689
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,070
for a cleansing ritual.

690
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,700
All the esteemed guests,

691
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,900
young and old, were present.

692
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,410
The place was surrounded by high mountains

693
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,220
and lush bamboo groves,

694
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,960
with...

695
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,270
Stand up.

696
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,950
Still sleeping?

697
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,630
Master,

698
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,520
I wasn't sleeping.

699
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,470
Then tell me,

700
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,030
what is 'Liu Shang Qu Shui'?

701
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,110
A type of wine diluted with water.

702
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,480
Hopeless.

703
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,420
Class dismissed.

704
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:28,850
Let's go.

705
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:29,510
What is

706
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,660
'Liu Shang Qu Shui'?

707
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,760
A type of...

708
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,810
wine diluted with water.

709
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,310
You...

710
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,980
What?

711
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,480
I don't want to talk to

712
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,150
someone who doesn't even know

713
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,680
what "Liu Shang Qu Shui" is.

714
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,050
Who says I don't know?

715
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,260
Let me tell you,

716
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,050
not only do I know,

717
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,710
but I'm also going to host one.

718
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,100
Starting tomorrow,

719
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,150
I'll be the first to host

720
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,680
the Wine Cups Floating Feast in Linchun City.

721
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,540
And my mark on the history of

722
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,760
Linchun City will be significant.

723
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,730
Why don't you host one too?

724
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,380
Why not?

725
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Can you afford it?

726
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,940
If you are capable,

727
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,970
talk about it when it's done.

728
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,510
Let's go.

729
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,950
Ling Shuo,

730
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,880
how can we hold

731
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,570
the Wine Cups Floating Feast?

732
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,640
We need to choose a location first.

733
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,190
As I said, our daughter is sold...

734
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,660
married to a good guy.

735
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,060
If it weren't for Xu Zilu,

736
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,600
we would be in big trouble.

737
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,030
But I heard

738
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,660
all the trouble with Xu Zilu

739
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,950
were caused by

740
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,020
Ling Se.

741
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,180
What if he gets mad and doesn't

742
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,260
cooperate with us?

743
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,500
Even after getting married,

744
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,760
she can't settle down.

745
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:50,910
How disgraceful.

746
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,170
Your Ling family

747
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,170
has always been honest and trustworthy.

748
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:54,950
How did you end up

749
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,410
with such a troublemaker?

750
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,280
What are you talking about?

751
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,270
Alright, darling.

752
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,510
Don't be angry.

753
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,170
I'm thinking that

754
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,170
even if Xu Zilu doesn’t mind,

755
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,280
Old Madam Xu

756
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,600
might not tolerate it.

757
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,140
If Old Madam Xu

758
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,950
can't tolerate her

759
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,250
and vents her anger on us,

760
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,260
it'll be bad.

761
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:19,990
My Lord,

762
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,430
I have an idea.

763
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,310
Before Old Madam Xu

764
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,610
reacts,

765
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,590
we should take the initiative,

766
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,860
inviting them to a banquet

767
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,220
to apologize.

768
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,380
Let's get things done first.

769
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,430
That way, Old Madam Xu

770
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,830
will have nothing to say.

771
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,620
Darling, you're right.

772
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,200
But doing this will

773
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,090
make our family

774
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,550
lose some face.

775
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,730
Face doesn't matter.

776
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,050
We're doing this

777
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,450
for long-term bargains.

778
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,430
No,

779
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,090
for long-term benefits.

780
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,830
Alright,

781
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,010
it's settled.

782
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,480
Send an invitation to the Xu family.

783
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,000
No.

784
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,630
Mother, you can't go.

785
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,870
It's not a festival or a holiday.

786
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,750
Yet Master Ling suddenly invited you to dinner,

787
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,010
There must be a reason.

788
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,370
How about this?

789
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,110
I'll send someone to find out

790
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,280
before we decide.

791
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,090
Se,

792
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,110
you're overreacting.

793
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,860
Since you married in,

794
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,670
I haven't met

795
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,690
your father.

796
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,540
Now he's asking me to a banquet.

797
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,180
If I don't go,

798
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,830
it will look like our Xu family

799
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,310
is disrespecting you.

800
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,250
No, Mother.

801
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,670
No one would think so.

802
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,870
I know what you're thinking.

803
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,250
You're just worried about me

804
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,110
and that it's too tiring.

805
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,170
It is a bit troublesome.

806
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,060
Zilu,

807
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,250
how about this?

808
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:44,850
Tomorrow,

809
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,080
you go back with Se.

810
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,240
But remember,

811
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,010
you must take care of

812
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,520
the gifts for the Ling family yourself.

813
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,250
Understand?

814
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,370
Don't embarrass Se.

815
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,470
Yes.

816
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,710
I understand.

817
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,690
Thank you, Mother.

818
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,420
Young Master Xu, wait for me.

819
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:03,940
How about this?

820
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,900
You seem busy.

821
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,910
Let's just lie to Mother

822
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,170
that we've been there. What do you think?

823
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,110
It's just a visit.

824
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,290
What's the big deal?

825
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,870
Or,

826
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,100
you think I'll embarrass you?

827
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,070
Of course not.

828
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,580
How could you embarrass me?

829
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,700
You are so handsome

830
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,000
and charming.

831
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:22,880
I'm just worried about

832
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,320
wasting your time.

833
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,830
Your father and I

834
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,210
are doing business together.

835
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,810
He's also my father-in-law.

836
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,750
He sent me an invitation.

837
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,980
If I don't go,

838
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,250
it would be too disrespectful.

839
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,640
How about this?

840
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,670
I'll pay you.

841
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,850
I only worth ten coins?

842
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,690
I've spent all my savings

843
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,410
dealing with rumors.

844
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,690
This is all I have.

845
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,260
Money can do.

846
00:31:59,130 --> 00:31:59,950
100 taels.

847
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,570
Why don't you go rob someone?

848
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,580
[Ling Mansion]

849
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,030
Ling,

850
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,240
how is the preparation going?

851
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,930
Wang, look.

852
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,400
I've drafted it for you.

853
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,570
The water flowing activity around the Orchid Pavilion is very interesting.

854
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,570
Let's hold the feast in late autumn.

855
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,980
Wang's Wine Cups Floating Feast.

856
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,330
Sincerely inviting all scholars and guests

857
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,330
to come and enjoy.

858
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,950
Impressive,

859
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,240
you've got it done so quickly.

860
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Of course.

861
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,500
You're my friend, Wang.

862
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,180
Is there anything else missing?

863
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,240
I'll add it for you.

864
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,280
Everything

865
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,030
is ready.

866
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,780
From now on,

867
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,450
I'll be the first to host

868
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,980
the Wine Cups Floating Feast in Linchun City.

869
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,630
By then,

870
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,090
my mark will be prominent

871
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,890
in the history of Linchun City.

872
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,740
Wang,

873
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,750
from now on,

874
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,370
you will be as famous as

875
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,130
Wang Xizhi and Huang Tingjian.

876
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,360
Whether I can bring glory

877
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,390
to the Wang family

878
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,940
depends on this.

879
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,830
Wang.

880
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,340
Ling.

881
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,170
Wang.

882
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,800
Ling.

883
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,000
I checked the lunar calendar today.

884
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,990
The auspicious day is in three days.

885
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,610
Let's set for that day.

886
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,390
Hubian.

887
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:38,870
Young Master.

888
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,010
Young Master.

889
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,070
Make 50 copies of this

890
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,800
and send them out immediately.

891
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,680
To whom?

892
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,780
Any standards?

893
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,400
Exclude those with poor reputation,

894
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,590
like Xu Zilu.

895
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,240
Yes.

896
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,880
Remember to invite Young Madam Xu

897
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,470
and her maid Ping'er.

898
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,990
Yes, Young Master.

899
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,230
Ling,

900
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,820
thank you for your help.

901
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,480
I really appreciate it.

902
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,570
You're welcome.

903
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,330
I'm leaving.

904
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:09,870
Wang,

905
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,460
actually, I have a favor

906
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,190
to ask you.

907
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,790
Go ahead.

908
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,909
My father is doing business with

909
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,040
my brother-in-law.

910
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,330
I heard that he's inviting

911
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,330
Xu Zilu and my sister to have dinner.

912
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,639
You know how my father

913
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,880
tries to please Xu Zilu

914
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,210
at my sister's expense.

915
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,980
Wang, can you help me to

916
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,320
support my sister?

917
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,600
Leave it to me.

918
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,370
Wang Zhujue,

919
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,909
why are you everywhere?

920
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,469
My wife came home.

921
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,300
Why are you here?

922
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,179
My father

923
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,560
is a governor,

924
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,830
dedicated to serving the people.

925
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,060
Now he knows

926
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,020
the cooperation between the Xu and the Ling family,

927
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,489
he wanted to come himself.

928
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,800
Unfortunately, he's too busy,

929
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,110
so I came on his behalf.

930
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:55,900
What?

931
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,510
You don't welcome me?

932
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,470
Welcome.

933
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,390
Magistrate Wang

934
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,670
is really considerate.

935
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,930
We are all family here.

936
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,200
Make yourself at home.

937
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,030
Let's eat.

938
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,010
Come on.

939
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,890
Ling Se,

940
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,290
why are you so inconsiderate?

941
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,710
You don't even serve food

942
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,550
to your husband and the elders.

943
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,410
Let me tell you,

944
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,530
after a woman gets married,

945
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,330
she must

946
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,190
follow her husband's rules.

947
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,920
Understand?

948
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,020
Yes.

949
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,260
Master Xu,

950
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,450
there's something you don't know.

951
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,480
Young Madam Xu

952
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,620
has suffered a lot.

953
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,330
No, I haven't.

954
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,210
Stop defending him.

955
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,130
I know everything.

956
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,190
Xu Zilu

957
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,160
is a scumbag.

958
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,330
You publicly insulted

959
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,820
your wife late at night.

960
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,970
The entire Linchun City

961
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,890
know it now.

962
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,030
You have no manners as a husband.

963
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,810
Poor Ling Se

964
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,830
is mistreated

965
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,120
and has no one to turn to.

966
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,610
Wang Zhujue,

967
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,430
what's wrong with you?

968
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,710
Poor Ling Se.

969
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,540
Well done.

970
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,930
I'm good at it, right?

971
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,190
Zilu,

972
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,710
I’m not talking about you.

973
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,570
Come, sit down.

974
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:19,870
I mean

975
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,610
you did well.

976
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,560
My daughter

977
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,950
is bad-tempered

978
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,430
and needs to be scolded.

979
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,860
In the future,

980
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,200
don't show her respect.

981
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,250
Your scolding is for her own good.

982
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,930
Zilu, you did the right thing.

983
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,500
Yes, exactly.

984
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:36,910
Mr. Wang,

985
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,640
Anything else? Go ahead.

986
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,030
Well...

987
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,680
Ling Se was kidnapped,

988
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,820
but Xu Zilu ignored her

989
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,960
for a whole day and a night,

990
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,470
just leaving her

991
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,620
to fend for herself.

992
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,370
Do you think

993
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,240
this is what a human should do?

994
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,920
Well done.

995
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:57,750
Mr. Xu,

996
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:58,880
Ling Se

997
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,960
grew up without a mother.

998
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,100
She

999
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,410
was raised wild,

1000
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,230
and mixed with

1001
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,390
all kinds of people.

1002
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,540
It's her fault

1003
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,420
for making you

1004
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,920
the laughingstock of the city.

1005
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,310
Now

1006
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,970
she's married to you

1007
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,040
and become one of the Xu family.

1008
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,910
You don't have to consider.

1009
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,110
Just teach her a lesson as you like.

1010
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,370
Don't let it affect

1011
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,030
our families' relationship.

1012
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,260
Yes.

1013
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,630
Yes.

1014
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,390
Yes,

1015
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,810
it's all my fault.

1016
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,580
What fault do you have?
