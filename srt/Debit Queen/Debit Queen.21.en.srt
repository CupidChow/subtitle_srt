[Debit Queen]

00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,900
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,430
Tomorrow,

4
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,030
I'm going to visit Wanrong's home.

5
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,229
You don't have to wait for me for dinner.

6
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:48,810
How come there are people who invite you

7
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,940
to dinner every day?

8
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,150
My wife has let me down, too.

9
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,840
She forgets her old lover when she has a new lover,

10
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,440
leaving me alone in the room.

11
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,789
I

12
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,870
prefer the way how you

13
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,470
used to talk less.

14
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,080
Then I'll just resume my style

15
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
of looking aloof.

16
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,030
Oh, come on.

17
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,310
No matter what you look like,

18
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,440
your expressions are almost the same.

19
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,450
No matter what my wife looks like,

20
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,410
I just like her.

21
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,750
Young Master! Young Madam!

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,510
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,620
What's the matter? Say it.

24
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:37,650
Well...

25
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,910
Young... Young Madam.

26
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,040
I've put

27
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,400
that paint in your shop.

28
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,880
Well, you...

29
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,960
Prepare a carriage for me.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,200
I'll go there later after I get changed.

31
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,579
Well,

32
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:51,990
I need to deliver some face powder

33
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,670
to Wanrong.

34
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,710
Prepare it for me.

35
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,310
Okay.

36
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,550
I'll ask Fuding to put it

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,450
in the carriage by that time.

38
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,110
I have to go.

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,060
Young Master.

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,350
I told you to keep an eye on Third Uncle, didn't I?

41
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,230
Why are you back?

42
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,390
I haven't been by your side

43
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,310
for so many days.

44
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,570
I'm worried that you can't get used to it.

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,300
Have you found anything?

46
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,670
I haven't found anything yet so far.

47
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,230
Have you found out about the truth of the case

48
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,290
of the Lingnan Box?

49
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,690
I also haven't found any clues yet.

50
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,090
Then why don't you go now?

51
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,230
Okay.

52
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,370
How come it's empty?

53
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,360
Oh, Xu Zilu,

54
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,920
how can you be so careless?

55
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,230
The box is nice anyway.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,130
I'll take it.

57
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,860
Young Madam.

58
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,120
The carriage is ready.

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,040
Coming.

60
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,610
[Xu's Mansion]

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,350
Alright.

62
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,860
I'm just going to paint my shop.

63
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,209
You don't have to go with me.

64
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,110
You didn't even ask me to help you

65
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,519
with the opening of your shop last time.

66
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,980
Now that I'm your husband,

67
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,480
you still don't let me go?

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,630
It's not that I don't let you help me.

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,530
I'm just afraid that since you don't know

70
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,310
how to paint a house,

71
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,400
the more you help, the more trouble you'll bring.

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,580
Fine. I won't go.

73
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,170
Didn't... Didn't you say that you would help me?

74
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,630
Why did you change your mind?

75
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,230
You didn't even insist on it.

76
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,390
Since my wife is

77
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,000
begging me to go,

78
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,620
then I'll just go.

79
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,740
However,

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,260
I want a reward.

81
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,520
How come you even want a reward?

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,830
Let's go paint the shop now.

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,409
After we finish it,

84
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,210
we can come back early for a rest.

85
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,950
You're asking your own husband to do

86
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,680
physical work with you in the middle of the night.

87
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,030
I guess only my wife would do

88
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,230
something like that.

89
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,410
The opening ceremony is coming soon.

90
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,360
Time is limited and the task is heavy.

91
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,980
Besides,

92
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,950
it was not easy for me to finally buy the paint

93
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,830
after I bargained with the shop owner.

94
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,960
No one asked him to send it at this hour.

95
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,640
What's wrong?

96
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,100
What are you doing?

97
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,510
Stop!

98
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,820
Darling.

99
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,270
Protect yourself.

100
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,950
I'll go chase him.

101
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,420
Zilu!

102
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,820
This is not okay.

103
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,950
I'm going to report it to the police.

104
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,180
Stop!

105
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,920
Stop!

106
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,550
Stop!

107
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,090
Stop!

108
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,650
Tell me! Who sent you here?

109
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,390
Buddy, you don't value martial virtues at all.

110
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,220
I just asked you

111
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,240
who sent you here.

112
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,530
If you didn't want to tell me, you could have left.

113
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,590
Why did you hurt me?

114
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,070
Who are you?

115
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,750
Catch him for me!

116
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,090
Yes!

117
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,780
Zilu!

118
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,590
Are you okay?

119
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,440
I'm fine.

120
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,800
Why are you bleeding?

121
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,630
It's just a a minor injury.

122
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,690
It doesn't matter.

123
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,230
Xu Zilu.

124
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,270
What happened just now?

125
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,200
Who was that man?

126
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,380
I didn't get a clear answer.

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,120
Can you

128
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,850
dispatch more people

129
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,830
to guard my wife's shop

130
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,630
more closely?

131
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,080
Don't worry.

132
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,380
Am... Am I very close to you?

133
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,030
How dare you order me around?

134
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:39,670
Let's go back and bandage your wound at once.

135
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,670
You're bleeding.

136
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,710
I'm fine.

137
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,130
You're not polite at all.

138
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,110
I'm going to put some ointment on your wound.

139
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,030
It might hurt.

140
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,100
Just bear the pain.

141
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,830
Does it hurt?

142
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,409
It's just a minor injury.

143
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:00,670
It doesn't hurt at all.

144
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm going to bandage it for you.

145
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,490
You don't have to bandage it up so well.

146
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,150
Don't move.

147
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,170
Let me do it.

148
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,930
Did I hurt you?

149
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,430
No, no.

150
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,180
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,040
Darling.

152
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,910
It's done.

153
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,350
I'm injured.

154
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,010
It's fine if it hurts a bit.

155
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,090
Luckily, you're not injured.

156
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,410
Otherwise,

157
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,890
I'll feel very sad.

158
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,670
Shut up.

159
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,059
Sorry to make you worry.

160
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm fine.

161
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,520
Don't worry.

162
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,980
It hasn't been so long since you

163
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,510
had an accident in Lingnan.

164
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,820
And something like this happened again today.

165
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,330
How can I not be scared?

166
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,440
Darling.

167
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,430
When you hit me just now,

168
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,540
you did it more cruelly than that thief.

169
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,130
I hit you for Mother.

170
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,150
Because you risked your own life.

171
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,310
How could you not think about

172
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,070
your identity as the master of the family?

173
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,110
There are several hundred people in the Xu Family.

174
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,470
If something wrong had happened to you,

175
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,870
what about the business?

176
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:11,840
What about them?

177
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,990
My wife is so capable.

178
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,270
If something wrong had really happened to me,

179
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,000
the Xu Family

180
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,630
and my mother would be entrusted to you.

181
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,620
Don't say such ominous things.

182
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,610
Then how could you not think about

183
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,540
what I should do?

184
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
I'm just kidding.

185
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,330
I got it.

186
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,530
From now on,

187
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,400
I won't act so rashly again.

188
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,230
Don't lie to me.

189
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,950
I'm not lying to you.

190
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,560
Well,

191
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,690
this thief in Furong City

192
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,820
was really strange.

193
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,230
There was nothing

194
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,230
in my shop.

195
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,040
What could he steal?

196
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,750
He...

197
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,190
must be a new thief.

198
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,670
And he doesn't value martial virtues at all.

199
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,870
What should we do now?

200
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,750
Lyu Qingfeng is investigating the case now.

201
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,280
Let's wait for his results.

202
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,970
Don't go to the shop recently.

203
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,210
I've finished painting my shop.

204
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,610
I need to open it sooner or later, don't I?

205
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,210
It's okay.

206
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,920
I'll go there during the day from now on.

207
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,520
At night,

208
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,680
I'll close it early.

209
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,820
But as for you,

210
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,270
don't forget what you've promised me.

211
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,800
You have to be careful, too.

212
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:18,770
Okay.

213
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,280
I've kept it in mind.

214
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,750
Butler Chen.

215
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,640
What... What is this?

216
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,050
Young Madam.

217
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,970
This is Young Master's order.

218
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,660
Since something

219
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,030
like that happened yesterday,

220
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,620
Young Master has been very worried

221
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,790
about your safety.

222
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,090
So he specially

223
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,440
asked me to pick several

224
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,670
smart, capable

225
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,050
and strong workers

226
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,750
to protect you.

227
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,370
Come on.

228
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,220
Show it to Young Madam.

229
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,200
I don't want it.

230
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,620
Why don't you want it?

231
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,660
Since I'm a girl,

232
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,370
if four men are following me when I'm out,

233
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,300
it'll be inappropriate, won't it?

234
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,310
So far, I haven't found any female guards

235
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,180
who have mastered some martial arts skills.

236
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,310
Just make do with it.

237
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,130
But I have to do business outside.

238
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,560
These four men look so fierce.

239
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,650
They'll scare the customers.

240
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,510
They just don't look so gentle

241
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,590
on the facade.

242
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,300
Right?

243
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,230
That's right.

244
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,670
Yes.

245
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,630
You're right, Young Master.

246
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,250
Come on.

247
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,730
Show your gentleness to Young Madam.

248
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,190
One, two, three. Smile.

249
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,170
Look. How gentle they are.

250
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,030
Just let them stay by your side

251
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,650
to protect you.

252
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,150
Only in this way can I rest assured.

253
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,620
But...

254
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,630
Ling Se.

255
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,600
It's so dangerous outside.

256
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,360
You can't always

257
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,670
make me keep thinking about your safety

258
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:59,050
and be unable to do anything else, right?

259
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,840
Be good.

260
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,510
Okay?

261
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,090
Then I'll get back to work.

262
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,290
Buddy.

263
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,030
What business

264
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,230
do you do in this shop?

265
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,390
Buddies,

266
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,390
while you're standing here,

267
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,750
before my shop is opened,

268
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,810
you'll just scare my customers away.

269
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,630
Se.

270
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,510
Yeniang!

271
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,780
Se!

272
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,510
What? Does this mean that

273
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,560
I'm not welcome here?

274
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,760
You're welcome here.

275
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,370
Why are you here?

276
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,010
Without seeing you for a few months,

277
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,330
I think you have quite heavy taste now.

278
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,470
Well,

279
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
it's a long story.

280
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,590
Let's talk inside.

281
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,590
-Let's go.
-Okay.

282
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,270
Young Master.

283
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,020
I'm fine.

284
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,530
Young Master.

285
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,950
You always had an accident when I was not by your side.

286
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,270
You always had an accident when I was not by your side.

287
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,350
No matter what happens in the future,

288
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,230
you have to let me follow you closely.

289
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,950
Alright.

290
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,510
By the way,

291
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,450
I asked you to investigate

292
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,490
the sources of the goods

293
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,470
of our current perfume shops.

294
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,060
How is it going with your investigation?

295
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,200
I followed them all the way to their warehouse.

296
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,350
But their actions

297
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,370
were very covert.

298
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,230
I couldn't get into the warehouse.

299
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,620
So,

300
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,000
the clues are not completely connected yet.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,790
How about this?

302
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,050
I'll teach you a trick.

303
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,670
Think of a way

304
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,730
to be a member of them.

305
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,220
In this way, isn't it easier to investigate the case?

306
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,710
Just go.

307
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,590
Well...

308
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,520
That's not right.

309
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,010
Young Master.

310
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,190
I have to stay by your side to protect you.

311
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,950
The most important thing now

312
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,270
is to find out about the sources.

313
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,150
Don't come back if you can't find out about the truth.

314
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,110
Young Master, don't worry.

315
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,240
I won't let you down.

316
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,260
How many years have you worked?

317
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,150
Two years.

318
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,350
Go over there.

319
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:30,740
Okay.

320
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,100
Buddy.

321
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
What's your name?

322
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,340
Ding Fu!

323
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,710
Ding Fu!

324
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,470
How many years have you worked?

325
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,730
One... One year.

326
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,820
One year?

327
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,130
With your small figure,

328
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,460
you look like a weak man.

329
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,460
Can you do this?

330
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,510
Buddy.

331
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,850
I can do it!

332
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,560
Look.

333
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,370
Buddy, look at me.

334
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,790
I... I'll call you... Big Brother.

335
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,790
Okay.

336
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,220
You have big strength.

337
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,140
Take him to the place where we live.

338
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,390
Buddy.

339
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,810
Don't I need to work today?

340
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,370
I'll let you know if there's work for you.

341
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,430
Why are you asking so many questions?

342
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,510
Okay.

343
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:18,990
Just go.

344
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
My name is Wang Er.

345
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,150
[Ping'er, I dreamt of you, and I still miss you after I woke up. I love you so much.]

346
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,130
Your Grace.

347
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,620
His Highness is here.

348
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,100
Your Highness, why are you here?

349
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,460
I've heard that

350
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,310
you like eating

351
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,770
the Stinky Tofu from the Xilin Street, right?

352
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,430
So I ordered someone to buy it for you.

353
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:48,890
Taste it

354
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,070
while it's still hot.

355
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,930
Your Highness.

356
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,380
Recently, I've been feeling unwell

357
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,570
and had a bad appetite.

358
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,430
Your Highness, just take it back.

359
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,770
Are you okay?

360
00:15:59,150 --> 00:15:59,880
Do you need to

361
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,040
send for a doctor?

362
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,310
I'm fine.

363
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,650
It's not a serious disease.

364
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,850
I'll recover after a rest for a few days.

365
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,240
This is not okay.

366
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,170
You are a noble girl.

367
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,030
You suffered a lot when you were away from

368
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,360
Furong City during this half a year.

369
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,400
Now that you're back,

370
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,640
you should take good care of yourself to recuperate.

371
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,150
Look.

372
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,770
Your cute face

373
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,230
has become...

374
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,980
a bit thinner.

375
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,260
Please behave yourself, Your Highness.

376
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,780
Moreover, our wedding is coming soon.

377
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,830
By that time, it'll attract the attention of the entire country,

378
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,100
and the people will congratulate us.

379
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,250
We can't let anything

380
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,750
go wrong with your health.

381
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:40,260
What if I don't want to marry you?

382
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,060
Ping'er.

383
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:44,650
Don't say such childish things

384
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,330
to express your anger anymore.

385
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:48,370
Our engagement was decided a long time ago.

386
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,430
How can you go back on your word again?

387
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,160
But

388
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,190
I have no feelings for you.

389
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,960
With your identity,

390
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,810
isn't it good for you to marry a girl

391
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,080
who comes from a noble family

392
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,480
and has feelings for you?

393
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,260
After our wedding,

394
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,420
you will be

395
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,349
the Princess of the Qing State.

396
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,380
By that time,

397
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,490
no matter what you want,

398
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,890
I can satisfy your needs.

399
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,980
You can't give me what I want.

400
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,960
Enough!

401
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:25,349
Ping'er.

402
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,460
Considering that you are young and ignorant,

403
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,940
I can forgive you for all that

404
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,390
you've done before.

405
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,820
But if you keep

406
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,210
making trouble again and again,

407
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,050
I think you're just

408
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
immature.

409
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:47,540
There are so many noble ladies in Furong City.

410
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,560
Why do you have to force me to marry you?

411
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,570
I don't want anyone else.

412
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,640
I only want you.

413
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,640
Why?

414
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,460
We had better get married as soon as possible.

415
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:00,930
However,

416
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,700
I kindly advise you that

417
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,450
even though I'm not

418
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,650
the one whom you love,

419
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,590
don't try to escape again.

420
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,040
After all, our engagement

421
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,040
was decided by His Majesty.

422
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,340
It's not a trifling matter.

423
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,530
If you try to escape marriage again,

424
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,930
you'll be guilty of deceiving His Majesty.

425
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,110
The consequence

426
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,070
is not something you can

427
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
afford alone.

428
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,660
Eat it while it's still hot.

429
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,260
Don't wait till it gets cold.

430
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,980
I kindly advise you that

431
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,460
even though I'm not

432
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,660
the one whom you love,

433
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,770
don't try to escape again.

434
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,230
After all, our engagement

435
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,120
was decided by His Majesty.

436
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,260
It's not a trifling matter.

437
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,420
If you try to escape marriage again,

438
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,820
you'll be guilty of deceiving His Majesty.

439
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,860
The consequence

440
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,670
is not something you can

441
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,500
afford alone.

442
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,140
Ping'er.

443
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,860
When on earth can we

444
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,120
meet each other again?

445
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,880
I'm also wondering how you're doing now.

446
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,300
Come in.

447
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,870
What are you doing?

448
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,940
I'm...

449
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,420
reading a book carefully.

450
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,100
Then do you want to read this?

451
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,240
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

452
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,230
I knew it.

453
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,380
This is the only way to keep you alive.

454
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,140
Ping'er gave it to me.

455
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,260
You're so petty-minded.

456
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,930
I'll just take a look.

457
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,630
And I may not understand it when I read it.

458
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,180
Besides,

459
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,120
who wants to read those

460
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,110
mushy and sentimental words between you two?

461
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,370
Just read it yourself.

462
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,870
[Wang, it's all in the past that we met each other. I'll face the storm alone from now on. I wish that you and I could live a peaceful life respectively.]

463
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,210
Go!

464
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:43,550
Why are you here again?

465
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,780
Her Grace won't see anyone.

466
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,510
Will she really not see anyone just as you said so?

467
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:48,680
Get lost at once!

468
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,190
Take a look.

469
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,990
Make way, please. Make way.

470
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,760
It's fresh.

471
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,590
Take a look.

472
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,560
Make way, please. Make way.

473
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,910
Excuse me.

474
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,940
Why are you so late today?

475
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,930
The tender cucumbers you had ordered were out of stock.

476
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,390
I went to several markets

477
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,440
and then bought them finally.

478
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,590
So I'm a bit late.

479
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,080
Deliver the goods inside.

480
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,070
Put it here.

481
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,650
Come with me to settle the bill.

482
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,200
Okay.

483
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,760
This Marquis's Mansion is so heavily guarded.

484
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,910
How can I get insdie?

485
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,980
Her Grace refused to eat again?

486
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,380
Yes.

487
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,310
The snacks and fruits we brought her yesterday

488
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,510
were scarcely eaten.

489
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,690
It'll be a waste to throw them away.

490
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,710
We can eat them.

491
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,780
I've said that no one is allowed to

492
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,050
disturb me, haven't I?

493
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,010
Why did you refuse to eat?

494
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,540
Wang!

495
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,450
Why are you...

496
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:29,050
Then why did you suddenly

497
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,110
say goodbye to me?

498
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,970
Aren't you going to

499
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,610
take the Metropolitan Examination soon?

500
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,290
Prepare for the exam carefully first.

501
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,310
We can talk about

502
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,450
our relationship after you finish the exam.

503
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:38,950
Okay?

504
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,040
Well,

505
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,100
after I finish the exam,

506
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,690
will I be unable to see you again?

507
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,890
-Your Grace.
-We…

508
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,820
Hide... Hide yourself.

509
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,030
What's the matter?

510
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:04,750
Your Grace.

511
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,730
Prince Xian is here.

512
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,650
His Lordship wants you to go there.

513
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,190
Got it.

514
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,370
I'll go after I put the things away.

515
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:10,810
Yes.

516
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,680
Wang.

517
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,890
Wait for me here.

518
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,950
Don't go anywhere.

519
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
I'll be back soon.

520
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,260
Okay.

521
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,330
Greetings, Your Highness.

522
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,950
Don't stand on ceremony, Your Grace.

523
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,010
There's no need to do this between us.

524
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:39,260
Grandpa,

525
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,070
why do you want to see me?

526
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,140
His Highness came here personally

527
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,180
in order to discuss the wedding date with you.

528
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:47,590
Your Grace.

529
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,450
It's been over half a year since His Majesty

530
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,660
granted us a marriage.

531
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,180
Now that you've returned from your journey,

532
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,090
I'm going to report it to His Majesty

533
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,210
so that we can get married as soon as possible.

534
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:56,930
So soon?

535
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,570
It's not very soon.

536
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,610
If you had not travelled around

537
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,650
the Qing State to see the scenery of each city,

538
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,380
we would have

539
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,420
got married two months earlier.

540
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,110
Your Highness.

541
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,970
I still want to stay with my grandfather

542
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,690
to take care of him for some more time.

543
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,620
I don't want to get married so soon.

544
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,080
A grown girl can't be kept at home all her life.

545
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,480
She'll have to get married sooner or later.

546
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,270
Grandpa.

547
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,210
I...

548
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:20,820
I...

549
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:21,870
I...

550
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,180
Ping'er doesn't want to marry him.

551
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,710
Why do you have to force her?

552
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,390
Do you have the right to speak here?

553
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:29,940
Marquis,

554
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,420
I can't believe that this maid

555
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,300
in your mansion is so ill-bred like this.

556
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,480
When did our mansion

557
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,230
hire such a tall maid?

558
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,710
She's my maid.

559
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,980
Her name is Wang'er. She's a newcomer.

560
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,590
She is not very smart.

561
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,810
She talks nonsense sometimes.

562
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,800
Just ignore her.

563
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,340
I'll take her away first.

564
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,520
Let's go.

565
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:47,900
Stop!

566
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,760
Wang'er?

567
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,880
Isn't this Candidate Wang?

568
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,180
How dare you!

569
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,200
Isn't this just a man?

570
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:12,970
You...

571
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,670
Ping'er, what's going on?

572
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,310
Grandpa.

573
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,040
I brought Wang

574
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
into our mansion.

575
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,480
I don't want to marry Prince Xian.

576
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,940
I only want to marry Wang.

577
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:24,950
You...

578
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,420
This is ridiculous!

579
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,810
I want to marry someone I love.

580
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,610
Is that wrong?

581
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,490
We'll talk about

582
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,620
your affairs later.

583
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,150
Guards!

584
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,860
Drive this pervert

585
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,940
out of here at once!

586
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,520
Yes!

587
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,370
Guards!

588
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,610
Drive him out for me!

589
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,340
-Yes!
-Yes!

590
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,870
Put me down!

591
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,320
Put me down now!

592
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,320
Wang!

593
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,990
Ping'er!

594
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:51,700
Ping'er!

595
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,000
You don't want to marry me.

596
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,110
But you want to marry such a person.

597
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,540
What kind of person is he?

598
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,130
In my mind,

599
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,800
he's the best man.

600
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,330
Ping'er.

601
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:13,660
Marquis.

602
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,960
Actually, there's another reason for me

603
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,150
to come here today.

604
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,330
The wedding day is coming soon.

605
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,320
But your granddaughter and I

606
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,100
still don't know each other very well.

607
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,500
Today,

608
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,060
I'm going to take her back to my mansion

609
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,500
so that she can live there for a few days.

610
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,780
I can take this chance to learn about

611
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,780
her preferences.

612
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:28,590
In this way,

613
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,610
all the servants in my mansion

614
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,210
can get well prepared for it.

615
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,960
Your Highness.

616
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,160
Your Highness, look.

617
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,110
You two haven't finished the wedding ceremony yet.

618
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,010
If she lives in your mansion so hastily,

619
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,290
isn't it quite inappropriate?

620
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,290
I didn't mention it just now,

621
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,150
because I was worried about this.

622
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:46,240
But now it seems that

623
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,260
your granddaughter is not quite close to me.

624
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,000
But she's

625
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,980
quite close to someone else.

626
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,840
I really feel uneasy.

627
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,820
I can understand why you're worried about this.

628
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,330
However,

629
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,500
if Ping'er goes to your mansion now and lives there,

630
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,430
I'm afraid it will affect her reputation.

631
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,630
Besides,

632
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,590
if her aunt wants to see Ping'er,

633
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,140
it'll be quite inconvenient, too.

634
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,820
In my opinion,

635
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,380
since the wedding day is coming soon,

636
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,240
how about this?

637
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,100
During this period,

638
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,700
just let Ping'er stay at home

639
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,050
for self-cultivation.

640
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,420
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

641
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,860
Just wait for your wedding.

642
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,670
In that case...

643
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:33,800
it's fine.

644
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,040
Let go of me!

645
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,520
Let go of me!

646
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,550
Let go of me!

647
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:46,940
Stop!

648
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,650
This is the only trick you guys can use.

649
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,580
What did you say?

650
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,840
Go!

651
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,650
Young Master.

652
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,470
Guards!

653
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,050
Young Master.

654
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,680
It's me.

655
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,040
Fuding?

656
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:20,710
You...

657
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,700
Why are you wearing this fake moustache?

658
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,930
Young Master, you taught me this.

659
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,890
You asked me to infiltrate into the inner part

660
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,550
of the enemy's organization.

661
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,400
How is your investigation?

662
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,280
Young Master,

663
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,450
according to my various inquiries

664
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,500
in the past few days,

665
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,660
what Third Master is doing

666
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,500
is probably

667
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,110
related to smuggled goods.

668
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,320
Where did the goods come from?

669
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,310
I'm not sure about this yet.

670
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,490
But I heard them

671
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,560
talking about

672
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,150
a certain prince.

673
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,320
A prince?

674
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,000
Yes.

675
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,980
There are so many princes in Furong City.

676
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,090
Who on earth is he?

677
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,310
What else?

678
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,730
There's... There's nothing else.

679
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,310
Thanks for your hard work.

680
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,350
Thank you for your concern.

681
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,260
My heart feels so warm.

682
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,890
I must see Ping'er today.

683
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,930
If I can't enter from the front gate,

684
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,660
I must see her even if I have to climb over the wall.

685
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,300
Wang?

686
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,400
Ping'er.

687
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,650
Wang.

688
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,660
Ping'er.

689
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,550
Be careful.

690
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,710
It's raining.

691
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,480
Beware of the slippery floor.

692
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,420
Ping'er.

693
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,510
Why did you climb over the wall?

694
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,100
Did they give you a hard time?

695
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,500
I was in a hurry to see you.

696
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,900
They didn't give me a hard time.

697
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,300
My grandpa is still here.

698
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,670
Though he has a sharp tongue,

699
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,370
he's actually a soft-hearted man.

700
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,100
That's good.

701
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,220
Ping'er.

702
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,940
Even if I have to risk my own life,

703
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,090
I won't let you marry

704
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:22,420
someone you don't like.

705
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,050
Wang.

706
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,770
Let's elope with each other.

707
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,020
Okay.

708
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,190
That's great.

709
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,720
Let's go.

710
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,060
This is not okay.

711
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,570
I can't take this risk

712
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,830
until the last moment.

713
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,540
I don't want you to suffer.

714
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,630
Nor do I want you to feel wronged.

715
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,550
Wait for me.

716
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,380
I'll take the Metropolitan Examination soon.

717
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,730
When I become the Number One Scholar,

718
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,460
I'll ask His Majesty

719
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,460
to marry you to me.

720
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,140
By that time,

721
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,370
your grandpa won't think that

722
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,470
I'm such a loser.

723
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,720
I'll go beg your grandpa again

724
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,530
and ask him to beg His Majesty

725
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,640
for mercy with us.

726
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,080
Okay.

727
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,020
I'll wait for you.

728
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,410
Whether you can be the Number One Scholar or not,

729
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,670
I'll just wait for you.

730
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,350
Ping'er.

731
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,210
You have to suffer for a few more days.

732
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,140
Don't be afraid.

733
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,150
I'm here for you.

734
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:34,990
You...

735
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,700
You kissed me?

736
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,120
[Xu's Mansion]

737
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,610
You didn't leave anything behind, did you?

738
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,300
Sister.

739
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,739
You've told me 800 times.

740
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,489
Everything is

741
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,370
inside here.

742
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,370
That's because of

743
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,449
your bad habit of being so forgetful,

744
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,420
isn't it?

745
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:32,190
Remember to pick us up after the exam.

746
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,960
We'll take the exam for three days and nights.

747
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,820
We'll definitely get exhausted.

748
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,020
Do your best.

749
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,030
You're even educating me?

750
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,080
Alright.

751
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:43,810
Got it.

752
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,219
For Ping'er,

753
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,670
I'll try all my best.

754
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,630
Young Masters.

755
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,480
Get into the carriage now.

756
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,060
Just go.

757
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:52,730
Sister, Brother-in-law,

758
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,750
I have to go.

759
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:56,699
Do your best in the exam.

760
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,180
Got it.

761
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,350
Sister, Brother-in-law, bye.

762
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,020
Candied haws!

763
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:14,500
Sir.

764
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,140
Give me a bowl of wontons.

765
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,080
[Joy Game Shop]

766
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,730
-Good!
-Good!
-Good!

767
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,640
Ma'am.

768
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,890
Where can I get some drinks?

769
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,860
Ladies, please have a seat inside.

770
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,140
I'll make some Aromatic Tea for you.

771
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,200
How do we play this?

772
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,710
It's like this.

773
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,410
This one

774
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,510
is used to shake the dice.

775
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,180
This total number of the dice is the number of steps.

776
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,510
Then the number is four.

777
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,610
Excuse me. Make way, please.

778
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,250
Take care, sir.

779
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,110
Embrace joy and pleasure in your flourishing life.

780
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,860
Never show an empty cup to the moon.

781
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,840
Joy Game Shop.

782
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,790
Young Master, your literary skills are so good.

783
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,170
Young Master, wait a minute.

784
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,530
It's done.

785
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,240
Darling.

786
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,110
Have fun.

787
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,740
You're here.

788
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,910
Darling, wish you a good opening

789
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,310
and wish you prosperity.

790
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,060
You gave me a small tangerine previously.

791
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,810
Now there are so many tangerines.

792
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,970
So the gift has been upgraded?

793
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,570
Of course.

794
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,020
My wife has opened the first game shop

795
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,160
in Furong City.

796
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:15,990
So,

797
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,410
the pomp should be upgraded, shouldn't it?

798
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,570
Come on. This way.

799
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,420
Well,

800
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,570
thank you, Young Master Xu.

801
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,010
Didn't you say that

802
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,010
in this shop,

803
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,450
guests can feel at home?

804
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,530
I'm already here.

805
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,960
But I haven't seen anyone receiving me.

806
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,820
Why are you here?

807
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,130
It's all because of Liu Yeniang, isn't it?

808
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,620
She commended this new shop

809
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,850
very highly.

810
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,930
Coincidentally, our manager also

811
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,930
came to Furong City.

812
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,330
So I'm here to take a look.

813
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,620
Here's a red packet for you.

814
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,460
Wish you a good opening.

815
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,060
Thank you.

816
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,310
What's going on?

817
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:57,940
Tidy it up at once.

818
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,570
Okay.

819
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,690
Wait.

820
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,820
Go tell His Highness now.

821
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,400
Your Highness.

822
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,080
I'm going to

823
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,670
drink a toast to Master Xu.

824
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,890
I am indeed

825
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,290
using your trade caravan

826
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,640
to smuggle munitions.

827
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,120
Why are you panicking?

828
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,660
I always do things meticulously without any mistakes.

829
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,420
No one else knows this thing

830
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,080
except you and me.

831
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:56,990
But those workers...

832
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:00,730
They had to risk

833
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,070
their lives earning money anyway.

834
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,460
Beiyun State is such a powerful country.

835
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,320
With the help of the Beiyun State,

836
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,690
if I want to become

837
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,930
the emperor,

838
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,590
it is possible.

839
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,100
What?

840
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,130
You don't believe me?

841
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,600
Your Highness.

842
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,740
Treason

843
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:37,050
is a capital crime which implicates all the nine branches of a family.

844
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,270
How can a man aspiring to

845
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,610
big achievements be such a coward?

846
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,490
What's more,

847
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,510
if we fail,

848
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,460
it'll be a capital crime.

849
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
But if we succeed,

850
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,380
we will have endless glory and wealth.

851
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,360
Master Xu,

852
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,550
how come you just think that I'll fail?

853
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:00,680
I've been hiding my ambitions for many years for this goal.

854
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,610
After I marry the granddaughter

855
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,810
of Marquis Wei,

856
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,650
I'll become an in-law of the Grand General in the present dynasty.

857
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,390
By that time,

858
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,440
I'll have the military power.

859
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,720
Plus the help from the Beiyun State,

860
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,270
it's just like adding wings to a tiger.

861
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,270
Master Xu,

862
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,680
do you still think that I will fail?

863
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,040
I dare not.

864
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,670
I have entrusted

865
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,680
all these important tasks

866
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,840
of life and death to you.

867
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,290
Master Xu,

868
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,260
you won't let me down,

869
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,840
will you?

870
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,200
I will definitely try all my best

871
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,700
to work for you

872
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:58,020
and spare no effort in performing my duty.

873
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,640
Good.

874
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,030
In the future,

875
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,850
I'll definitely treat you well.

876
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,780
If you help me achieve my great cause,

877
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,660
I guarantee that you'll be promoted to a high-ranking position

878
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,990
and live a wealthy life.

879
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,770
By that time, Xu Zilu

880
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,190
won't even deserve to hold your shoes for you.

881
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,020
Young Master.

882
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,450
In the past few days,

883
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,250
his delivery warehouse

884
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,300
has been more heavily guarded.

885
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,530
It took me a lot of effort,

886
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,860
but I still couldn't get any information.

887
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,340
Young Master.

888
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,550
Are you thinking

889
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,220
which prince they were talking about

890
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,820
in the news I heard last time?

891
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,130
I'm afraid

892
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,820
what's behind this

893
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,820
will implicate the Xu Family.

894
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,570
But

895
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,530
Third Master has already

896
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:44,640
left the Xu Family.

897
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,170
Although his name

898
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:48,170
has been removed from the genealogy,

899
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,300
how can the kinship

900
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,560
be cut off thoroughly?

901
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,550
How about this?

902
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,700
Contact Third Uncle.

903
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,560
I want to see him

904
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:55,780
and ask him about it clearly.

905
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,220
Yes.

906
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,300
My Lord.

907
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,130
Xu Zilu wants to see you.

908
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,350
Hot steamed buns.

909
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,060
So delicious.

910
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,640
Fresh wontons for sale.

911
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,060
It'll be ready soon.

912
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,050
I'll clear up the table soon.

913
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,450
Give me a bowl of wontons.

914
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,020
Okay.

915
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,840
Wait a moment.

916
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,340
Where are you going

917
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,340
with a fire lance?

918
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,990
Yushan.

919
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,970
I've warned you about

920
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,050
the consequences

921
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,150
of betraying me.

922
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,680
Clean up the traces.

923
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,470
Yes.
