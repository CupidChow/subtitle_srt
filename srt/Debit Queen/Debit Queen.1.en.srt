Excuse me.  Excuse me.

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:55,759
Who is it?

6
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,259
Stop running! Stop!

7
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,130
I'm Ling Se,

8
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,870
owner of the most popular food stall

9
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,800
in Linchun City.

10
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,230
I'm popular because

11
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,110
everyone knows

12
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,350
that I love money.

13
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,009
No haggling is allowed at my stall.

00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,030
Know

15
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,800
that every copper coin

16
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,420
matters to me.

17
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,910
Little one,

18
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,740
where do you think you can run?

19
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,130
I'm famous

20
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,960
because

21
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,190
my shop is doing well.

22
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,050
The desserts and sweets I sell

23
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,430
are very delicious.

24
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,850
Whoever eats it knows.

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,510

and she'll treat you well every day!

31

This is Ping'er,

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,000
whom I took in a few months ago.

36
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,550
I bought her a meal

37
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,020
and wanted to take her in to work for me.

38
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,520
She said she was a maid

39
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,400
who had escaped from a rich family.

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,880
But she can't do anything

41
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,880
that maids do.

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,000
She's always so mysterious.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,230
And she eats a lot.

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,080
She can eat all day long.

45
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,070
I've really taken a big loss.

46
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,890
If I hadn't been able to make money,

47
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,020
she would have already drained me dry.

48
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,630
Every day after closing,

49
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,210
I turn into another girl.

50
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,520
The young lady from Ling's Silk Shop

51
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,240
in the city.

52
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,600
But I'm not at all like

53
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,760
what you might imagine of a young lady.

54
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,010
My mother passed away a long time ago.

55
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,220
I have a stepmother,

56
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,240
but she doesn't want me, no matter what.

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,920
She is determined

58
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,180
to raise me like a maid.

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,160
As the saying goes,

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,790
"When you have a stepmother, even your father becomes a stepfather."

61
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:29,750
My father's ambition

62
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,810
is the same as hers.

63
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,170
Look at yourself.

64
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,510
You don't look like a young lady at all.

65
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,470
Go outside

66
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,350
and ask around about your reputation.

67
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,410
If it weren't for me

protecting you

69
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,110
because you lost your mother when you were little,

70
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,030
your father would have long

71
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,000
beaten you up

72
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,090
and kicked you out.

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,079

You don't have a place to speak here.

Why haven't I seen

77
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,670
a maid like you in the house?

78
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,560
It's all my fault.

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
It's all my fault.

80
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,670
Listen carefully.

We'll have a noble guest today.

83
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,270
stay in your room

84
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,440
and behave yourself.

85
00:03:59,440 --> 00:03:59,700
Okay.

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,980
Don't come out and cause trouble!

87
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,570
Do you hear me?

Behave yourself!

89
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,510
Just looking at you like this

90
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,770
makes me feel unlucky.

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,200
So annoying.

92
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm already used to it.

93
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,300
I just need to put up with them for a little while longer,

94
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,630
and I can be free of them.

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,630
I love money, and I'm good at making it.

96
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,290
I want to fulfill my ambition,

which is to buy a shop,

expand my business,

99

move out on my own,

100

This is it.

110

111

we've found this shabby shop

What do you know?

114
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,460
When doing business,

115
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,030
you need to have a long-term perspective.

116
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,350
Besides,

117
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,280
I have some insider information.

118
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,740
In less than a year,

119
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,190
this street will be busier than the East Market.

120
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,390
You even know that?

121
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,990
Of course. Who am I?

122

Look at my shop.

It's not that big,

00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,030
but not that small either.

is fine.

The problem

134
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,920
is the price.

135
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,270

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,950

139

I sell it for only 100 taels.

140
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,670
It's already a good bargain.

141
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:35,810
I can only offer 50 taels.

142
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,990
How can you bargain like this?

143
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,520
The prices are

144
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,850
all determined by the location.

145
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,820
You have said it yourself.

146

Your shop is not

on Peony Street in the East Market.

148
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,870
There are not many customers coming here.

149
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,540
Of course, it can't be the same price, right?

150
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,320
Look at your cabinets.

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,310

Sell me the shop along with the rice.

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,070
is in my shop?

about business or a wedding?

And didn't I say no maids?

Why are there still maids here?

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,630
It's just down the road.

195
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,860
I won't listen to you.

196
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,840
My precious banknotes.

197
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm counting on you to buy the shop.

198
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,920
Why isn't Fuding here yet?

199
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,790
Since when do we have such a handsome man in our family?

200
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,190
Why don't I remember him?

201
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,230
I thought

202
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,030
the maids at Ling's Mansion

203
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,160
were well-trained,

204
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,190
but you're no different

205
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,920
from the maids in other houses.

206
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,620
It's one thing not to help,

207
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,810
but do you have to add snide comments?

208
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:10,430
It's true that you men

209
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,230
are no good!

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,180
Today is definitely not my lucky day.

211
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,010
Maid, stop right there!

212
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,970
Are you calling me?

213
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,580
Get me a new pair of shoes and socks.

214
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,790
You don't have to bring them to me.

215
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,990
Let the servant do it.

216
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,070
Jackpot.

217
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,690
I'm not going.

218
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,590
Say that again.

219
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,710
I said,

220
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,280
"I'm not going."

221
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,890
Unless...

222
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,640
Unless what?

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,050
Unless you pay me.

224
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,300
Socks, 10 coins. Shoes, 3 taels.

225
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,050
Stay away from me.

226
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
Thank you for your kindness.

227
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:01,510
You're not a member

228
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,390
of our family,

229
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,270
and I'm not obligated to help you.

230
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,560
But if you pay me,

231
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,930
things are different.

232
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,090
As the saying goes,

233
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,770
"Take someone's money and resolve their troubles."

234
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,080
I have no other hobbies

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,420
besides making money.

236
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,610
How about this?

237
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,110
I'll give you a discount for the whole set,

238
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,790
3 taels.

239
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,350
Fine.

240
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,610
I'll pay you.

241
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,390
You don't have any money?

242
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,990
Then why are you so arrogant?

243
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,870
How about this?

244
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,870
I'm generous,

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,860
so I'll give you some free advice.

246
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,720
Didn't you step on dog's poop?

247
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,480
Just take it as a sign

248
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,740
that you're going to have some good luck!

249
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,030
I'm giving you this piece of advice

250
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,390
for free.

251
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,330
Being fussy

252
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,610
is unbecoming of a man.

253
00:09:59,140 --> 00:09:59,940
Mr. Xu,

254
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,270
let's just forget what happened just now.

255
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,270
Let's get down to business.

256
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,890
I'm sure you know

257
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,070
that my Qifu Silk Shop is the largest silk shop

258
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,910
in Linchun City.

259
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,070
If you can

260
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,590
give me

261
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,170
this opportunity,

262
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,150
I will give you

263
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,370
another 10% discount

264
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,860
on the basis of offers from other merchants,

265
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,340
and I guarantee the quality is better.

266
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,850
Mr. Xu, what do you think?

267
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,150
If you want to become the new packaging supplier

268
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,550
for Xu's Perfume Shop...

269
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,810
you'll need to offer at least a 30% discount.

270
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,170
30%?

271
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,710
Mr. Xu,

272
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,300
my offer is already very low.

273
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,680
I will soon

274
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,370
become an imperial merchant.

275
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,630
The sachets made by my shop will be sent to the palace

276
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,690
in a steady stream.

277
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,590
This is a big deal.

278
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,190
Mr. Ling,

279
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,030
you need to take everything into account when doing business

280
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,630
and have a long-term vision.

281
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,070
Mr. Xu,

282
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,740
take care.

283
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,830
Young Master,

284
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,900
you were so cool

285
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,090
just now.

286
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,270
Did you see

287
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,330
Master Ling's face?

288
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,590
His face was all green.

289
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,880
Young Master, no wonder

290
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,210
you are a big profiteer.

291
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,720
No.

292
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,550
I mean, you are great!

293
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,720
Check if the people of Ling Mansion have left.

294
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,520
They left. Young Master, you...

295
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,010
What's wrong, Young Master?

296
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,040
Are you stupid?

297
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,840
Where did you find the shoes?

298
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,120
I-I-Impossible.

299
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,920
The shoes I found for you are new.

300
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,960
See for yourself. Are they small?

301
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,650
Are they small?

302
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,550
I'm asking you, are they small?

303
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:43,870
I...

304
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,470
Your salary for next month is gone.

305
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,110
No, no, no!

306
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,670
Come on, Young Master.

307
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,430
This way.

308
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,630
My clothes.

309
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,560
Isn't this Young Master Xu?

310
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,110
Why are you dressed so shabby?

311
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,270
Are you trying to experience the hardships of common people?

312
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,730
Fuding,

313
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,280
check the horoscope before going out in the future.

314
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,910
Why?

315
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,310
I don't want to run into some haunting ghosts

316
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,030
when I go out.

317
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,310
Wait!

318
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,070
You're scolding me?

319
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,920
Yes, you.

320
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,670
Wait.

321
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,590
Aren't these

322
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,550
the limited edition shoes with cloud embroidery

323
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,430
I ordered for 20 taels of silver?

324
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,070
Why are they on your feet?

325
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,150
Well...

326
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:25,760
Here...

327
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,630
I...

328
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,560
Here's the thing.

329
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,390
Master Ling

330
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,660
invited my young master here for a business meeting.

331
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,620
Then my young master

332
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,620
accidentally stepped on the dog...

333
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,350
What?

334
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,190
You stepped on my baby dog?

335
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,350
That’s Wealth!

336
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,710
If anything happens to it,

337
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,440
you're dead!

338
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,600
Wang,

339
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,130
let’s meet another day.

340
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,400
My Wealth!

341
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,230
Young Master,

342
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,530
the dog poop you stepped on is called Wealth?

343
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,170
And it seems to be his baby.

344
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,250
Wang Zhujue,

345
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,030
I didn't expect your friend

346
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,060
to be so different as well.

347
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,990
You're a genius.

348
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,710
He hasn't passed the Provincial Examination

349
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,600
for four years in a row.

350
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,150
Yeah.

351
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,230
At such an age,

352
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,970
he is still going to school.

353
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,430
Does your father know you're out, embarrassing your family?

354
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,290
Where did he go?

355
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,650
None of your business.

356
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:14,950
My father

357
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,410
is doing his best

358
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,580
for the city.

359
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,850
For the plan of the new market in the western part of the city,

360
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,960
he hasn't been home for days.

361
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,950
We, from official families,

362
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,420
really have no desire to

363
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,250
associate with people like you

364
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,880
who only care about business and making money.

365
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,180
Xu Zilu!

366
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,730
You ran away again!

367
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,530
My young master,

368
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,850
you're finally back.

369
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,440
I'll ask my men

370
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,230
to light up the candles now.

371
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,030
No need.

372
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,510
So as not to disturb my mother.

373
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,280
Fuding is enough to serve me.

374
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,750
Okay.

375
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,940
You still know you have a mother in the room?

376
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
Stop yelling

377
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,180
in the middle of the night!

378
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,540
Greetings, Mother.

379
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,400
Xu Zilu,

380
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,760
there's a limit to my patience

381
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,870
with you.

382
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,450
I can’t just sit back and watch

383
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,370
the Xu family fall into ruin

384
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:26,180
under your hands.

385
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,170
You're still not married.

386
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,380
How can I face

387
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,770
your late father?

388
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:31,750
Mother.

389
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,460
These are two different things.

390
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,040
How can you mix them up?

391
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,630
Fine.

392
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,370
Let me ask you.

393
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,450
What are the requirements

394
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,400
for becoming an imperial merchant in the Qing State?

395
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,810
You tell me!

396
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,570
Firstly, be the industry leader.

397
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,940
Secondly, have a clean family background.

398
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,550
Thirdly, have no direct relatives in official positions.

399
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,280
Fourthly...

400
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,730
F-F-Fourth...

401
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,690
Four...

402
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,390
Xu Zilu!

403
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,960
Fourthly,

404
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,620
the person in charge must be an adult

405
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
and have a family.

406
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,030
Mother.

407
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,710
Even if I'm to marry,

408
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,560
I should find a suitable partner.

409
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,800
Your childhood sweetheart

410
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,460
left you at the altar. So what?

411
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,430
For the past few years,

412
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,410
No maid can even enter

413
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,140
our mansion.

414
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,210
I asked you

415
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,420
to go on a blind date with the Eldest Miss of the Tao family.

416
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,190
Did you go?

417
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,150
No wonder...

418
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,490
No wonder the whole Linchun City

419
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,250
is saying my son is not interested in women.

420
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:36,830
Tell me,

421
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,260
do you have any hidden illness

422
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
or do you have some

423
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,680
peculiar preferences?

424
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,240
Mother,

425
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,520
what are you talking about?

426
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,080
The Imperial Merchant selection happens every four years.

427
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,560
It's not the only chance.

428
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,320
Please give me more time.

429
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,110
Within four years, I'll get married and have children.

430
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,030
Rest early.

431
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Stop right there.

432
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,390
Xu Zilu,

433
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,510
do you think I arranged

434
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,990
for you to meet Miss Tao

435
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,740
just for a blind date?

436
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:10,800
How naive.

437
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,990
The Tao family

438
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,350
controls vital trade routes with

439
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,460
the Yanchen State.

440
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,350
And the ingredients

441
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,480
for our new fragrance

442
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,560
come from there.

443
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,470
Now that the palace has tripled their order,

444
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,110
if we can't deliver on time,

445
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,430
it will be

446
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,630
a serious crime.

447
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,680
I know.

448
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,460
If that's your concern,

449
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,490
Mother, don't worry.

450
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,440
I will cooperate with the Tao family

451
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,720
in my own way.

452
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,260
Mother, go to sleep.

453
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,920
You...

454
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,610
What's your way?

455
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,790
All you do is lying to me.

456
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,750
I...

457
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,710
Hello, here I am.

458
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,370
Have you been waiting?

459
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,420
You're already packing up for me.

460
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,310
Miss,

461
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,869
I've been waiting for you.

462
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,160
What took you so long?

463
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,470
My 50 taels aren't

464
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,599
a small amount, huh?

465
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,119
I was thinking of

466
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,750
selling it to you for 50 taels.

467
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,230
I don't care about that.

468
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,640
That's good.

469
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:18,640
But

470
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,400
I waited for you for a long time but you didn't come.

471
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,740
Another buyer came along

472
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,780
and bought here.

473
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,369
Look.

474
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,830
Wait.

475
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,800
I've been waiting for this day for six years.

476
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,260
This...

477
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,980
Who's trying to take this shop from me?

478
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,990
Who dares?

479
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:37,790
Me.

480
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,070
Do you have a problem with that?

481
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,630
You again.

482
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:46,650
What?

483
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,830
You know each other?

484
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,590
-Yes.
-No.

485
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,350
Sir,

486
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,130
you have a really bad memory,

487
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,650
already forgetting what happened yesterday.

488
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,090
Fine.

489
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,650
It doesn't matter.

490
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,350
But first come, first served.

491
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,520
Do you know the rules?

492
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,030
I chose this shop first.

493
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,950
First come, first served.

494
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,550
You first.

495
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Do you have proof?

496
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,420
I...

497
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,130
The shopkeeper can testify.

498
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,130
I came here first yesterday, right?

499
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,020
Did she pay first

500
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,900
or sign the agreement first?

501
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,170
Or,

502
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,290
you sold the shop to two people?

503
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,550
No, no, no.

504
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,370
Since that's the case,

505
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,710
first come, first served.

506
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,270
Whoever pays first gets it.

507
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,670
You understand, right?

508
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:29,190
I...

509
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,310
I'll give you a suggestion for free.

510
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:31,790
What?

511
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,630
Go somewhere else.

512
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,520
Shopkeeper,

513
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,270
have you prepared the title deed?

514
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:38,990
Yes.

515
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,520
Here it is.

516
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,190
Wait,

517
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,490
we can talk about it.

518
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,550
Sir,

519
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,010
I'll pay the original price.

520
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,940
Could you give me the shop instead?

521
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,660
Young Master, are you alright?

522
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,550
Hey, you.

523
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,280
How could you

524
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,610
touch the Young Master?

525
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,160
Well,

526
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,570
I just slightly touched him.

527
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,930
Is he that delicate?

528
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:57,820
Of course.

529
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,790
Not just anyone

530
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,890
can touch the Young Master.

531
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,530
Alright.

532
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,330
If I touch him, will he jump into the river?

533
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:02,880
Let's go.

534
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:07,990
You...

535
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,950
Don't move.

536
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,860
What's wrong with you?

537
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,590
If you're sick, go see a doctor.

538
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,420
Shopkeeper, who is he?

539
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,680
The richest man in Linchun City, Xu Zilu.

540
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,230
The rich man

541
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,540
who became the head of his family at twelve

542
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,640
and rumour has it that he's afraid of women?

543
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,580
Yes.

544
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,070
How much did he pay for it?

545
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,280
One tael less than you.

546
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,160
49 taels.

547
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,060
Young Master,

548
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,750
so we've been

549
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,810
wandering here for such a long time

550
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,270
just for that shabby shop?

551
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,550
Why not?

552
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,310
No problem,

553
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,940
but it's just getting harder

554
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,270
to figure you out.

555
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,480
Come here.

556
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,070
Well, you've been

557
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,010
with me for so many years.

558
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,730
What have you learned?

559
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:02,180
Well...

560
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,810
Wang Zhujue said yesterday

561
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,150
that his father is planning to develop the west market.

562
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,420
Once the news is revealed,

563
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,620
the land prices there will surely rise.

564
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,920
This shop is in the center of the west market.

565
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,250
Not to mention 50 taels,

566
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,150
even 100 taels are worth it.

567
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,770
You're back so soon.

568
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,630
Looks like things went well today.

569
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,090
I'll leave this stall to you.

570
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,740
I gotta go.

571
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:27,010
What a bad day.

572
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,390
I think

573
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,050
we should just give him 20 taels.

574
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,010
In a few days,

575
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,580
we could set up our own shop.

576
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,870
It’s better than making trouble.

577
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,790
It's not a matter of

578
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:43,810
20 taels anymore.

579
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,840
We're

580
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,830
already

581
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,830
in trouble now.

582
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,590
So someone bought

583
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,800
the shop you wanted?

584
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,270
Just because you tried to save some money

585
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,950
and didn't pay the deposit,

586
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,400
now it's taken.

587
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,270
Forget it.

588
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,770
As long as we have money,

589
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,820
we will figure out a way.

590
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,310
Luckily,

591
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,640
we still have 100 taels.

592
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,800
Look at you.

593
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,410
What's wrong?

594
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,160
I exchanged the 100 taels

595
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,860
for a bank note

596
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,120
and put it in the liner.

597
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,930
It's gone.

598
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,420
This is weird. It must be in this room.

599
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,460
It can't be lost.

600
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,080
Think about it.

601
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,740
Have you checked the cabinet?

602
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,870
This room is just this big.

603
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,480
It must be

604
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,410
somewhere.

605
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,020
It must be...

606
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:41,780
Where is it?

607
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,510
Have you checked your clothes?

608
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,710
My Lady.

609
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,390
My Lady.

610
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,270
Oh no.

611
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,010
I left the bank note

612
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,290
in the dirty clothes.

613
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:05,440
But who would take

614
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
my dirty clothes?

615
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,510
The clothes are really hard to wash.

616
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,970
No matter how hard I wash it, it keeps shedding.

617
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,470
Well,

618
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,820
once I get paid next month,

619
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,900
I have to buy some

620
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,390
new clothes for my sister.

621
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,880
Young Master,

622
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,140
the young lady is back.

623
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,610
Back so early?

624
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,280
Hurry up.

625
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,480
Hurry. Let's go.

626
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:43,910
Okay.

627
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,470
Xiang, go take a look.

628
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,150
Okay.

629
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,860
Have you seen

630
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,750
a green outfit?

631
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,670
Outfit?

632
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,920
What outfit?

633
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,190
An outfit exactly

634
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,590
like the one I'm wearing.

635
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,300
I think it was hanging in the courtyard.

636
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,160
The courtyard?

637
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,230
Let's go.

638
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,260
Is this it?

639
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,270
No.

640
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,200
This is your clothes.

641
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,770
No one has ever

642
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,080
washed her clothes.

643
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,760
When she sees this,

644
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,420
she'll definitely praise me.

645
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:27,950
Se.

646
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,860
Which bastard

647
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,270
washed my clothes?

648
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,110
How could you not check inside

649
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,270
before washing?

650
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,040
My 100 taels.

651
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,170
Ling Shuo, what did you say?

652
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,730
Did you see

653
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,480
who washed my clothes?

654
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,230
I don't know.

655
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,280
I didn't see it.

656
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,480
Who is so wicked?

657
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,760
Not only is the bank note gone,

658
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,490
but the clothes are ruined too.

659
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,270
Was it you who washed my clothes?

660
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:07,980
No,

661
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,610
I don't even know how to do it.

662
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,910
What is this?

663
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,470
I should have thought it was you.

664
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,090
It really wasn't me.

665
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,060
I'll kill you.

666
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,150
Otherwise, I won't be Ling Se.

667
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:17,550
Se.

668
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,560
It really wasn't me.

669
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,590
Se.

670
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,530
Stop right there!

671
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,530
Believe me, Se.

672
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,940
Stop right there!

673
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:23,830
I must kill you today!

674
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,090
You have to believe me.

675
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,900
You have to believe me.

676
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,570
Young Master, stop running.

677
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,320
Se.

678
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,780
Se.

679
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,710
Stop!

680
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,490
Believe me.

681
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,860
I didn't do it.

682
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,520
100 taels.

683
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,040
100 taels.

684
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,800
I saved that money for six years.

685
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,910
Don't cry.

686
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,390
Actually,

687
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,430
if it's meant to be, it will be.

688
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,090
If it's not, you can't force it.

689
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:00,990
You still thinking

690
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,290
about the 100 taels of silver

691
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,630
won't help at all.

692
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,120
Stop with

693
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,900
the poetic nonsense.

694
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,540
It's giving me a headache.

695
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,730
What should we do now?

696
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,620
How much money do we have?

697
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,040
There are only three taels left.

698
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,470
What can we do then?

699
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,350
Should we go beg

700
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,250
that black-hearted guy?

701
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,270
Ping'er.

702
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,000
I was talking nonsense.

703
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,310
Don't take it seriously.

704
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:38,890
Yes.

705
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,470
I can go beg Xu Zilu.

706
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,470
I don't care.

707
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,770
As long as he's willing to

708
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,310
rent me the shop,

709
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,120
he's a good guy.

710
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,710
Se,

711
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,460
you always give up

712
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,490
so unexpectedly.

713
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,430
What about your bottom line?

714
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,350
No bottom line,

715
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,750
only a deadline.

716
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,260
I'll ask him tomorrow.

717
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,150
Just wait and see.

718
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,930
This one is pretty.

719
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,750
This one is good too.

720
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,750
Son, look.

721
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,250
Aren't they beautiful?

722
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,720
This booklet

723
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,020
took a lot of effort

724
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,660
to get.

725
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,060
That fat woman

726
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,370
is indeed the most popular matchmaker

727
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,400
in Linchun City.

728
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,900
She has the best resource.

729
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,900
Over 300 girls on it

730
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,130
are unmarried.

731
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,650
I've read them all.

732
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,970
Pretty good.

733
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,230
As merchants, we can't be

734
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:29,990
as picky as those

735
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,230
noble families.

736
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,980
Good character and looks

737
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,220
are enough for us.

738
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,790
I don't even

739
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,460
care about their background.

740
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,510
Zilu,

741
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,970
even if you

742
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,480
bring a courtesan back,

743
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,190
I'd be happy too.

744
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,570
Just

745
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,020
pick one today.

746
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,880
Pick one,

747
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,750
and I'll handle the rest for you.

748
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,090
I don't want to.

749
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,370
I don't care if you want to.

750
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,630
As long as I'm willing.

751
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,230
Also,

752
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,730
ever since Xie Wanrong

753
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,490
ran away from her wedding,

754
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,320
you've been dodging the idea

755
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,920
of marriage with every excuse.

756
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,190
Enough with all your

757
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,160
excuses.

758
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Mother, what are you talking about?

759
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,000
I just don't want to

760
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,400
get married carelessly.

761
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,700
I'm telling you, Xu Zilu,

762
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,070
you have to pick one today.

763
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,800
If you don't,

764
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,350
I'll pick for you.

765
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:15,940
Mother,

766
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,410
there are still three months

767
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,860
until the Imperial Merchant selection.

768
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,800
Why are you

769
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,490
in such a rush for my marriage?

770
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,150
Who told you

771
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,470
there are three months?

772
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,330
Didn't your third uncle tell you?

773
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,160
Governor Wang has sent someone

774
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,470
to inform us.

775
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:33,760
The Imperial Merchant is being reformed.

776
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,430
This is the last selection.

777
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,090
It will be held on the first day of next month.

778
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,590
We have

779
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,930
barely ten days left.

780
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,700
Do you think I want to force you?

781
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,890
Forget it.

782
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,110
Madam.

783
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,520
I won't care about you anymore.

784
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,300
Whether you get married or not,

785
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,750
who you marry,

786
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,840
or if you even want to

787
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
marry a girl,

788
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,540
I don't care anymore.

789
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,410
Thank you, Mother.

790
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,470
Yushan.

791
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,370
Sister-in-law.

792
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:08,830
Yushan.

793
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,050
I have a favor to ask.

794
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,540
From today on,

795
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,710
you will take over as the head of the family...

796
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,040
I...

797
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,030
and join the Imperial Merchant selection for the Xu family.

798
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,670
Xu Zilu,

799
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,940
from today on, neither the Xu family

800
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,490
nor Xu's Perfume Shop

801
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,240
have anything to do with you.

802
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,590
Mother.

803
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,830
Ms. Jia.

804
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,680
Madam.

805
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,110
Inform the elders of our clan

806
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,150
to come here.

807
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,910
Yes.

808
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,470
I...

809
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,120
It's just getting married.

810
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,120
Three days.

811
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,300
I'll bring back a wife in three days.

812
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,910
Zilu,

813
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,440
what nonsense are you talking about?

814
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,850
I'm not talking nonsense.

815
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,300
Three days it is.

816
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,080
If you can't get married in three days,

817
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,880
I won't change my mind

818
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,500
no matter how hard you beg me.

819
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,720
Fine,

820
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:55,950
three days it is.
