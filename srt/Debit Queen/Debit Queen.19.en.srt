00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,360
My name is Xu Zilu. Greetings, Your Highness.

4
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,870
Don't stand on ceremony in front of me.

5
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,530
Have a seat.

6
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,410
Thank you, Your Highness.

7
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,080
Here.

8
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,310
Yes.

9
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,430
I have resided in Furong City for a long time

10
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,949
and have a fondness for incense.

11
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,190
I’ve long heard of the fame of the Xu family in Linchun.

12
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,390
Now that I’ve met you,

13
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,630
you indeed live up to your reputation as a young and capable leader.

14
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,090
Indeed,

15
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,460
you are qualified to be the Imperial Merchant of Qing.

16
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,190
You flatter me. Your Highness.

17
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,150
It is only thanks to Your Highness’s favor

18
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,150
that our Xu family

19
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,760
has received such an honor.

20
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,829
However, I wonder

21
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,150
if the Jiuchongtian incense sent to Furong City

22
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,350
has met with Your Highness’s approval?

23
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,950
I’ve heard something

24
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,750
about the Jiuchongtian matter.

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,700
It was due to the negligence of a eunuch in my residence.

26
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,500
Your Xu family has been wronged.

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,270
Let’s do this.

28
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,240
From now on,

29
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,070
all incense used in my residence

30
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,150
will be supplied by your Xu family.

31
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,150
What do you think?

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,590
The Xu family will give our utmost effort

33
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,700
and will not disappoint Your Highness.

34
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,070

35
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,520
the best merchants and shops from across the country.

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,230
Although your Xu family’s goods are excellent,

37
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,270
if you wish to maintain

38
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,950
the title of Imperial Merchant for a long time,

39
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,610
you’ll need

40
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,590
to put in more effort.

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:04,630
Yes.

42
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,220
You are young and wise.

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,110
You should understand.

The grand prize is

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,810
is this one-of-a-kind

Of course.

73
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,470

You’ve crafted the cat well,

107

but this round focuses on

108
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,930
capturing a vivid essence.

109
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,020
Your work

110
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,430
is too childish.

111
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,390
It’s not just a cat.

112
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,740
It’s also an incense burner

113
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:37,740
that emits smoke.

114
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,080
My sister used the incense burner

115
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,310
to evoke

116
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,070
the atmosphere of lingering fragrance.

117
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,710
How can you say it lacks essence?

118
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,750
You just said

119
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,230
the winner would be the one whose work best captures a vivid essence.

120
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,110
I’m afraid you don’t really understand

121
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,070
what that means.

122
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,380
You...

123
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,960
This young man is right.

124
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,000
The Untitled Poem says,

125
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,320
"Do not let your spring heart compete with the blossoms,

126
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,770
for every inch of longing is an inch of ash."

127
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,970
This incense burner has profound meaning

128
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,250
and should advance to the next round.

129
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,290
Alright, if that’s the case,

130
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,950
then congratulations to this lady

131
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,790
for advancing to the finals.

132
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:20,920

Thank you for your kind words.

134
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,280
I was just speaking the truth.

135
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,370
If you truly want to thank me,

136
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,230
could you give me

137
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,430
this incense burner?

138
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,640
My hometown is famous for making incense,

139
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,940
and I’ve loved it since childhood.

140
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,400
Could it be that you're also from Linchun?

141
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,110
Yes.

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,960
We're also from Linchun.

143
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,720
What a coincidence.

144
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,770
To meet here in such a vast city

145

like Furong City

146
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,110
is truly fate.

147

Young man,

148
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,190
I noticed your impressive literary talent just now.

149
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,700
May I ask who your teacher is?

150
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,720
I study under Master Lu at Wansong Academy.

151
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,870
Wansong Academy?

152
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,260
I also studied there.

153
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,310
What a coincidence!

154
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,110
Furong City truly feels small.

155
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:08,950
Sis.

156
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,260
We really are fated.

157
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,520
Then, I’ll give you this incense burner.

158
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,490
Thank you. Sis.

159
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,510
But I won’t go easy on you

160
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,630
just because

161
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,850
you gave me this gift.

162
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,740
Don't worry.

163
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,630
Winning or losing

164
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,290
should be based on true skill.

165
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,590
Sister, we’ve advanced!

166
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,270
We’re one step away

167
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,420
from winning the jade pendant for brother-in-law.

168
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,790
Your words just now

169
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,590
were impressive.

170
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,990
You really helped me out.

171
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,760
You did well.

172
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,110
You’ll handle the martial part, and I take care of the scholarly part.

173
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,280
Siblings united.

174
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,540
We’re unstoppable.

175
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,300
It’s frustrating

176
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,750
wanting to go out but being unable to,

177
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,210
wanting to join the fun but not being able to.

178
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,730
Guess who I am.

179
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,510
Mr. Wang!

180
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,870
Do you like it?

181
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,670
I like it.

182
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,110
Is this for me?

183
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,790
It’s especially lively outside today.

184
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,120
I went out for a stroll

185
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,840
and specifically found someone selling this

186
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,640
to buy for you.

187
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,870
How is it?

188
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,350
Can you tell who I am?

189
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,950
Whose

190
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,860
little fox is this?

191
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
What a pity.

192
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,080
You’re still not well yet.

193
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,789
Otherwise,

194
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,730
I’d take you out to join the fun.

195
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,070
I'm fine.

196
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,940
I’m feeling much better today.

197
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,660
Wang,

198
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,320
let’s go out for a bit.

199
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,470
Ping'er.

200
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,500
I don’t think you should push yourself.

201
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,270
You should listen to the doctor’s advice.

202
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:54,840
If they say

203
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,990
you should stay at home,

204
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,870
then stay at home.

205
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,070
If you really can’t, I’ll stay with you.

206
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,910
I’m not pushing myself. I’m really fine.

207
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,790
Let's go.

208
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,350
Really?

209
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,690
Today,

210
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,630
I’ll be

211
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,360
a little fox that no one can recognize.

212
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,230
What is this?

213
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,730
Ping'er.

214
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,830
Do you like this?

215
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,670
Wang.

216
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,600
Don’t just buy fun things

217
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
fun things for me.

218
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,070
Pick out something for yourself too.

219
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,270
I'll give them to you.

220
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:40,830
Miss,

221
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,180
Pick a mask.

222
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,850
Here, take a look.

223
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,220
Why don't you pick a mask for me?

224
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,390
Okay, I'll pick one for you.

225
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,030
Miss, have a look.

226
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,870
This is good.

227
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,350
This mask of Sun Wukong on his somersault cloud

228
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,280
is just like you.

229
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,110
Every time I need something,

230
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,870
you always appear first

231
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,070
with delicious food.

232
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,190
Try it on.

233
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,700
It suits you well.

234
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,040
Bosslady.

235
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,350
Here's the money.

236
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,040
Okay.

237
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,030
Take care, Miss.

238
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,270
Ping'er.

239
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:30,590
Are you hiding

240
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,120
from your previous master?

241
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,710
No, not at all.

242
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:39,630
Actually,

243
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,630
you're not sick.

244
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,030
You’re just afraid of running into someone you know, right?

245
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,830
The reason you could go out today

246
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,070
is because

247
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,930
you were wearing a mask, isn’t it?

248
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,630
Wang.

249
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,190
You noticed?

250
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,540
I have a guess.

251
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,790
Ping'er, don’t be afraid.

252
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,810
What I mean is,

253
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,150
if you don’t want to

254
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,690
go back to your previous master’s place,

255
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,670
we can go

256
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,850
and tell him clearly together.

257
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,380
We’ll say

258
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,550
you have a new master now

259
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,040
and you don’t want to go back.

260
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,700
That way,

261
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,430
you won’t have to hide anymore.

262
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,750
Or

263
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,870
do you have a bondservant contract with someone else?

264
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,640
I can help you redeem it.

265
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,680
You don’t have to be a maid anymore.

266
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,280
You can do whatever you want.

267
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,400
I'll support you.

268
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,630
Wang.

269
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,670
If one day

270
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,270
I leave,

271
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,530
will you come find me?

272
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,970
Where are you going?

273
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,550
Don't you want to stay in the Xu family?

274
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,020
No.

275
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,110
I mean if...

276
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,490
I mean, if, just if,

277
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,870
I have to go back

278
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,550
to where I was before?

279
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,070
I will.

280
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,490
I will definitely come looking for you.

281
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,630
But Furong City is so big,

282
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,760
among the countless people,

283
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,950
where will you find me?

284
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,310
I can.

285
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,910
Am I not your Sun Wukong?

286
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,830
Wang.

287
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,800
You really are like a monkey.

288
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,150
Whether a monkey

289
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,930
or Sun Wukong,

290
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,510
as long as you call me,

291
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,580
no matter how many mountains or seas are between us,

292
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,310
I will find you and be with you.

293
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,620
And I’ll bring you delicious food.

294
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,790
Even if I grow old

295
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:05,940
and ugly,

296
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,490
as long as I scratch my head,

297
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,680
you'll know it's me.

298
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,440
Alright.

299
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,650
It’s a promise.

300
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,120
We must be together.

301
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,970
Alright.

302
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,020
It’s a promise.

303
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,330
Mr. Xu, how long do you plan

304
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,700
to stay in Furong City?

305
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,520
I’ll return

306
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,780
to Linchun once I’ve finished organizing the shops

307
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,910
here in Furong City.

308
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,030
You’ve just been promoted to the Royal Merchant.

309
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,290
Why not stay a few more days

310
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,200
in Furong City?

311
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,160
How is

312
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,230
the scenery here?

313
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,470
The building is high.

314
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,510
The view from the top is excellent.

315
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,910
Ordinary people might think

316
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,600
this is just an expensive restaurant,

317
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,240
but standing here

318
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,680
gives a view over all the common people.

319
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,790
This is

320
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,170
why

321
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,500
I like this place.

322
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,460
It’s a pleasure to meet you today,

323
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,300
Mr. Xu.

324
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,610
From now on,

325
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,060
just mention my name,

326
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,850
and you can come here anytime.

327
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

328
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,550
I have something else to do.

329
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,750
That's all for today.

330
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,370
Take care, Your Highness.

331
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,730
Did you catch a cold?

332
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,470
No, it’s just that I ate

333
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,230
too many salty and spicy things earlier.

334
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,290
My throat feels a bit uncomfortable.

335
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,330
There’s a place that sells pear soup and pear syrup.

336
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,660
I’ll go buy some for you.

337
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,020
Wang.

338
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,160
There’s no need.

339
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,030
Ping'er.

340
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,470
Ping'er!

341
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:37,910
Ping'er!

342
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,480
Ping'er!

343
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,320
Ping'er!

344
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,050
Ping'er!

345
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,340
Ping'er!

346
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,040
[Golden Panda Restaurant]

347
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,770
I’m so frustrated.

348
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,360
I didn’t get the jade pendant

349
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,730
and wasted money on tickets

350
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,730
and admission.

351
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,890
Sister, don’t think like that.

352
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,100
It’s more important to have fun,

353
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,500
right?

354
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,900
It’s hard to feel happy when there’s no money left.

355
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,620
Sis.

356
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,900
What a coincidence.

357
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,970
Come, join us.

358
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,650
Sis.

359
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,020
You're eating here too?

360
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,910
Then we won't be polite.

361
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,140
This is a local specialty of Furong City,

362
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,050
Three Flower Tea.

363
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,510
Here.

364
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,630
Have a taste.

365
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,810
It’s different from what you’d find in Linchun.

366
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,770
It has a unique flavor.

367
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,430
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

368
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,750
Sis, are you waiting

369
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,140
for someone here by yourself?

370
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,630
Yes.

371
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,660
I'm waiting for my husband.

372
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,380
What a coincidence.

373
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,020
I'm also waiting for my husband.

374
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,880
Let's sit down and wait together.

375
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:45,860
Sis.

376
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,210
Why do you

377
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,940
like this jade pendant so much?

378
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,840
To be honest,

379
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,000
I wanted

380
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,420
to give this jade pendant

381
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,540
to my husband.

382
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:56,860
He is a businessman.

383
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,700
and I thought this “Prosperity” character

384
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,050
would suit him very well.

385
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,590
Moreover, this design is unique

386
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,590
and not available for sale outside.

387
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,010
Unfortunately, my knowledge

388
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,880
isn't as good as yours,

389
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,510
so I lost.

390
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
What a coincidence.

391
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,430
I also wanted to give this jade pendant

392
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,750
to my husband.

393
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:12,740
Sis.

394
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,020
You are good at everything.

395
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,609
It’s clear you come from a noble family

396
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,010
with exceptional taste.

397
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,859
How could you like a jade pendant

398
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,260
with the character for "prosperity" on it?

399
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,790
It seems a bit tacky.

400
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,290
My husband works in the government.

401
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,740
He has been diligent over the years

402
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,580
but was just a bit short on luck for a promotion.

403
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,420
I don't really care about these things.

404
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,280
I just know he has some ambitions,

405
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,330
so I wanted to give him

406
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,570
this pendant.

407
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,850
I didn’t expect both of you

408
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,860
to have the same thought.

409
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,960
It’s quite rare.

410
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,900
You talk too much for a child.

411
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:47,900
Sis.

412
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,340
If you like it so much,

413
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,190
I’ll let you

414
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,440
have this pendant.

415
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,260
No.

416
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,220
If I lost, then I lost.

417
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,730
I’ll find something else

418
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,130
suitable for my husband.

419
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,960
It’s a coincidence

420
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,570
to meet a fellow townsfolk in Furong City.

421
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,570
If you ever return

422
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,760
to Linchun City,

423
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,190
please visit my shop for some fragrant tea.

424
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,630
I’m afraid I might not return to Linchun.

425
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,650
Why?

426
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,530
Nothing.

427
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,060
Just a past event.

428
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,120
It's not worth mentioning.

429
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,290
It’s alright.

430
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,740
Since you don’t want to talk about it,

431
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,580
I won't ask.

432
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,640
We've been sitting here for a long time.

433
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,260
I think your husband

434
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,260
will be here soon.

435
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,980
We'll move to another table.

436
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,140
Sister,

437
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,610
why didn’t you take the pendant

438
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,620
when she offered it to you?

439
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,020
You spent so much effort.

440
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,170
Besides, the pendant is quite nice.

441
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,520
You...

442
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,740
You just said it was tacky.

443
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,170
I was trying to help you.

444
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:45,730
Let me tell you.

445
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,730
That pendant

446
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,960
is something we must not accept

447
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,620
Didn’t you hear that sister say

448
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,140
she wanted to give it to her husband?

449
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,450
How can we take something meant for someone else?

450
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,050
It's fine.

451
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,300
I’ll find something nice

452
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,690
to give to your brother-in-law later.

453
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,020
Okay.

454
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,440
Be careful.

455
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,740
Alright. The wine is ready.

456
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,140
I told you, it’s alright.

457
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:09,740
Zilu.

458
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,210
Zilu.

459
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,550
Wanrong?

460
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,000
Long time no see.

461
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,430
Long time no see.

462
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,020
You've

463
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,320
changed a lot.

464
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,880
Are you doing well?

465
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,830
I’m doing fine.

466
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,950
That’s good to hear.

467
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,340
At that time, I was too impulsive.

468
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,230
It caused you to be pointed at and criticized by others.

469
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,430
You care so much about your reputation.

470
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,820
You must have felt embarrassed.

471
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,410
It’s all in the past now.

472
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,160
Let’s not bring it up anymore.

473
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,710
Darling.

474
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,500
You know each other?

475
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,500
This is Mrs. Lyu, whom I mentioned

476
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,840
to you before.

477
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,080
So this young lady

478
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,230
was waiting for you.

479
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,290
You two…

480
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,650
Know each other?

481
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,350
Yes.

482
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,960
We participated in the competition together.

483
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,940
But I didn't expect her

484
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,410
to be your wife.

485
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,210
Xu Zilu did mention you to me.

486
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,550
Sis, you truly are

487
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,360
both talented and beautiful, beyond reproach.

488
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,890
I’d say, for him to have

489
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,330
such an intelligent and charming wife,

490
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,720
he is truly fortunate.

491
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,460
A few days ago, at the suburban posthouse,

492
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,390
I was grateful for Lord Lyu’s help.

493
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,030
You have such a good husband.

494
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm happy for you.

495
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,070
He often mentions you to me.

496
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,860
But he didn’t tell me

497
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,400
about your meeting when he came back.

498
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,090
By the way,

499
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,390
how is your mother?

500
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,980
I haven’t been back to Linchun for years.

501
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,400
If you’re going back,

502
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,240
please send my regards to her.

503
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,050
My mother is in good health.

504
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,250
If you have time,

505
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,220
you can also visit Linchun.

506
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:53,290
Sister, she is

507
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,130
the wife of Lord Lyu.

508
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,930
She used to...

509
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,460
You must have a lot to talk about

510
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,770
with an old acquaintance.

511
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,310
I’ll leave you to it.

512
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,100
Ling Se.

513
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:04,670
Sister.

514
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,860
Sister, don't be angry.

515
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,190
You should go after her.

516
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,930
She has been busy

517
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,130
all day for you.

518
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,040
Madam Xu.

519
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,260
Hello, Mr. Xu.

520
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,150
Good.

521
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:18,880
Sister.

522
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,610
No matter what, you and my brother-in-law

523
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,650
are the real couple.

524
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,530
We're not a real couple.

525
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,130
It’s a contractual marriage.

526
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:24,830
And we are about to divorce soon.

527
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:26,200
Also, don't follow me.

528
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,850
I need some fresh air.

529
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,600
Contractual marriage?

530
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,780
What does that mean?

531
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,960
Try a bite.

532
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,930
How is it?

533
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,860
Is it good?

534
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,390
So sweet.

535
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,140
It's delicious.

536
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,070
Xu Zilu.

537
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,870
Why didn't you chase me?

538
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,460
Miss,

539
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,170
are you alone too?

540
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,820
Why are you out here

541
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,820
instead of being with your fiancée?

542
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,960
Fiancée?

543
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,020
That was so long ago.

544
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,470
She is now someone else’s wife.

545
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,240
What kind of person will I be if I stay with her?

546
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,130
Young Master Xu,

547
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,800
if you still have lingering feelings,

548
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,060
you can keep pursuing.

549
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,060
I have

550
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,900
a wife now.

551
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,780
This is not appropriate.

552
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,780
We’re just bound by a contract.

553
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,250
It can be terminated at any time.

554
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,390
As long as the money is sufficient,

555
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,930
you can continue

556
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,330
to pursue your true love.

557
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,000
Why are you looking at me?

558
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,180
I'm not Xie Wanrong.

559
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,310
Darling.

560
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:43,740
Are you jealous?

561
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,830
Jealous?

562
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,140
Why would I be jealous?

563
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:50,970
You still deny it?

564
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,040
Then why did you hit me?

565
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,970
I’m not jealous…

566
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,210
I’m not angry.

567
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,630
I don't want to talk to you.

568
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,500
Come on.

569
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,270
Darling.

570
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,690
You’re walking so fast. Where are you going?

571
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,020
I’m going out for a stroll. Why do you care?

572
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,500
I'll accompany you.

573
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,020
Who wants your comapny?

574
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,170
Liar.

575
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,950
You promised to accompany me.

576
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,930
I bought this for you.

577
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,090
I don't want it.

578
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,260
Don't be angry.

579
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,540
It's my fault

580
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,140
for causing the misunderstanding.

581
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,420
Let me take you somewhere.

582
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,470
There’s such a quiet place

583
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:16,100
in Furong City?

584
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,250
My father passed away early.

585
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,280
Every time my mother came here,

586
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,480
she’d bring me along.

587
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,670
She’d leave me here

588
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,070
while she did business.

589
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,640
I’d play here all day.

590
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,320
Aren’t you bored being alone?

591
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,290
Not bored.

592
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,040
I'm familiar with

593
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,880
every shop and every stall here.

594
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,390
I watch them do business

595
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,080
and the various people

596
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
on the street.

597
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,770
It’s very relaxing.

598
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,910
As expected of you.

599
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,860
The way you played as a child

600
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,390
was different from others.

601
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,850
You know what?

602
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,700
I used to

603
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,490
sit here waiting

604
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,440
for my mother to come back.

605
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,120
Sometimes,

606
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,130
if she took a long time with business,

607
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,660
all the stalls would close.

608
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,740
I’d look at the sky

609
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,340
and think about the day’s events.

610
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,780
I’d think about how I’d run the business

611
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,060
if I were the boss.

612
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,650
You know?

613
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,780
When I went back to Linchun,

614
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,780
I’d nag my mother.

615
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:16,670
I’d say,

616
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,430
“Mother,

617
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,490
when will you take me

618
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,700
to Furong City again?

619
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,300
I want to come here.”

620
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:22,990
Because

621
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,160
I felt very happy

622
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,900
and joyful

623
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,560
on this street.

624
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,440
After I grew up,

625
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I’ve been to Furong City many times.

626
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,710
But

627
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,200
I've never been to this street again.

628
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,580
Why not?

629
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,140
Because I made a promise

630
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,890
to myself.

631
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:49,290
Next time I come,

632
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,620
I must bring someone

633
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,900
I think I can

634
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,660
spend my life with.

635
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,130
I always thought

636
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,950
I’d never find someone

637
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,850
to spend my life with,

638
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,580
until you appeared.

639
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,090
Actually,

640
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,400
I don’t know

641
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,860
when I started to like you.

642
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,610
Maybe

643
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,540
it was when you hugged me

644
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,220
in the Plum Forest.

645
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:46,970
Maybe

646
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,830
it was when you took out your savings

647
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,530
at the Imperial Merchants Conference.

648
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,660
I also have a shop.

649
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,630
This shop is also Xu family property.

650
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,130
The Xu family has more than just five shops.

651
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,770
Maybe

652
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,440
it was when you were at the sawmill.

653
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,500
I never imagined

654
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,300
someone like you

655
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,860
would enter

656
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,900
my life.

657
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,130
Carefree and quirky.

658
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,360
Often making me laugh and cry.

659
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:23,530
But I have no way

660
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,660
of dealing with you.

661
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,600
Gradually,

662
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,220
I seemed to get used to

663
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,620
your presence in my life.

664
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,440
Watching your silly side,

665
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,500
I think

666
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
you're very cute.

667
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,220
I want to know more about you,

668
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,850
help you,

669
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,470
and take care of you.

670
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,590
I used to resist

671
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,860
physical contact with the opposite sex.

672
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,990
You even said I was overly fastidious.

673
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,610
But that night,

674
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,160
I secretly kissed you.

675
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,340
I didn’t expect myself

676
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,500
to do that.

677
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,150
Maybe even earlier.

678
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,230
In any case,

679
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,930
by the time I realized it,

680
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,630
it was already too late.

681
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,190
Ling Se.

682
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,410
I know

683
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,220
you’ve suffered a lot

684
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,910
and faced many grievances since you were young.

685
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:34,900
I also know

686
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,910
you’re fearful

687
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,250
of a relationship

688
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,110
and don’t know how to express them.

689
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,370
So

690
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,150
I’ll take this step

691
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,360
for you.

692
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:56,140
Will you

693
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,250
be my real wife?

694
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:24,970
Contractual couple? Fake marriage?

695
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,160
No.

696
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,350
I need to clarify everything

697
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,590
when they return.

698
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,980
Why are you laughing?

699
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,580
I'm happy.

700
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:39,650
Why are you laughing?

701
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm happy too.

702
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,530
Ling Shuo.

703
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
I left you there.

704
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,140
Good thing you remember the way.

705
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,140
Sister.

706
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,490
I have a question for you.

707
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,510
You are all here.

708
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,990
Ping'er is missing.

709
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,020
Wasn't Ping’er at home?

710
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,850
I went out with her all day.

711
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,680
Then I went to buy pear soup.

712
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,740
I took my eyes off her for a moment,

713
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,670
and she was gone.

714
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,390
I’ve looked everywhere.

715
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,780
But there were too many people on the street.

716
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,910
I couldn't find her.

717
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,900
Did she go home?

718
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,760
That's impossible.

719
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:22,930
Butler Chen has searched all around

720
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,100
the Xu residence.

721
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,140
But she hasn’t returned.

722
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,220
Well...

723
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,900
Calm down.

724
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,690
Let's split up and search.

725
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,090
Ling Shuo, go get Fuding.

726
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:32,730
Okay.

727
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,910
Let's go.

728
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,440
Let's go.

729
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:41,850
Look over there.

730
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,180
Okay.

731
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,110
Nope.

732
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,420
Look ahead.

733
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,950
Look how good this is.

734
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,700
Have one.

735
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:03,890
Ping'er.

736
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:07,350
Young Master. You got the wrong person.

737
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,420
I'm sorry.

738
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,020
It's okay.

739
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,660
Ping'er.

740
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,180
Where have you been?

741
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,130
[Marquis Wei's Mansion]

742
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,530
You've been the most obedient and sensible since young.

743
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,810
But I never

744
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,020
expected you

745
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,750
to do something so outrageous.

746
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,330
A princess running away from marriage.

747
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,460
If this gets out,

748
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,550
it will disgrace

749
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,660
the royal family.

750
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,690
I don't want to marry him.

751
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,240
Even if you’re unwilling,

752
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,940
you still have to marry.

753
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,380
If you keep refusing,

754
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,340
it won’t just be the royal family’s reputation at stake,

755
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,820
but even your grandfather’s face

756
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,690
will be lost.

757
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,080
I know.

758
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,100
Although Prince Xian is not perfect,

759
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,830
he is still a prince of the Qing.

760
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,410
Your grandfather spoils you the most.

761
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,220
Yet you disregard the marriage alliance of both families

762
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,090
and ran away.

763
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,770
Have you ever thought

764
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,900
about your grandfather’s situation?

765
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,790
Your father sacrificed himself

766
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,270
for the country in battle.

767
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,290
Your mother, deeply in love with him,

768
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,420
was heartbroken and died in sorrow.

769
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,690
If something happens to you

770
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,950
while you’re out here,

771
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,740
how will I explain it

772
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,530
to them in the afterlife?

773
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,260
Aunt.

774
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,440
I was wrong.

775
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,510
I was thoughtless.

776
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,740
I made you worry.

777
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,780
But

778
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,610
I really don't want

779
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,410
to marry someone I don't like.

780
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,540
Then tell me

781
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,490
what kind of person you want,

782
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,350
who is better than His Highness?

783
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,990
I want to marry someone

784
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:07,820
who can truly invest

785
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,260
in a relationship.

786
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,900
Someone who is honest

787
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,630
and sincere.

788
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,080
Someone who can cry

789
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,090
and laugh with me.

790
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,770
Someone who doesn’t care whether I’m from a noble family

791
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,510
or just a humble maid.

792
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,120
Ping'er,

793
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,800
do you have a crush?

794
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:28,850
I...

795
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,150
What are we going to do?

796
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,929
Don't worry.

797
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,860
We will definitely find her.

798
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,929
How about you, Wang Zhujue?

799
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,260
Have you found Ping'er?

800
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,300
I’ve searched Chaoyang Street

801
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,449
and Xilin Street.

802
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,500
I even waited at the place

803
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,290
where Ping’er went missing until dawn,

804
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,820
but I still didn’t find her.

805
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:51,800
Sister,

806
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,219
I’ve checked all the streets

807
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,050
around the Xu Mansion.

808
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,810
There’s no sign of her.

809
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,610
I’ve asked everyone I could, but

810
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,020
no one has seen Ping’er.

811
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,260
What should we do?

812
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,670
Maybe we should report this to the authorities?

813
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,930
Wang Zhujue.

814
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,190
Let’s go and report it.

815
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,310
The Princess is here.

816
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,920
What's going on?

817
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,940
Sister.

818
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,050
Ping'er?

819
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,430
When you see the Princess, shouldn’t you kneel?

820
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,980
No need.

821
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,340
Everyone, please rise.

822
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,850
Sister, I'm sorry.

823
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,330
I didn't

824
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,670
tell you yesterday,

825
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,650
which made you all worry.

826
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,650
Ping'er.

827
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,290
You scared me.

828
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,460
I thought

829
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,520
you were in danger.

830
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:51,980
How dare you!

831
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,880
Don’t you know that men and women should not have physical contact?

832
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,380
And

833
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,960
how dare you

834
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,510
touch the Princess’s hand?

835
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,500
Wang, I'm sorry.

836
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,680
I'm fine.

837
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,220
Ping'er.

838
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:06,670
What...

839
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,100
What’s going on here?

840
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,510
Ping'er, you...

841
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,690
How come you’re a princess?

842
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,900
You told me you were…

843
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,240
The Bureau...

844
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,910
The Marquis Wei of the Bureau of Astrology.

845
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,040
I'm his granddaughter, Wei Qingping.

846
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,090
Since she's back,

847
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,900
let's talk inside.

848
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,530
Alright, you all go back to the Marquis Mansion first.

849
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,850
I'll go back after dinner.

850
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:35,510
Your Grace.

851
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,870
I don't think it's appropriate.

852
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,370
There’s nothing inappropriate about it.

853
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:39,700
I just want to stay and play a little longer.

854
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,810
You can go back first.

855
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,470
I’ll come to pick you up later.

856
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:53,950
Ping'er.

857
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:55,460
Why didn't you tell me earlier

858
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,790
that you’re a princess?

859
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,920
Is it important

860
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,840
whether I’m a princess or not?

861
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:04,980
No.

862
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,010
The most important thing is that you're Ping'er.

863
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,700
Oh no.

864
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,600
Now Wang seems

865
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,360
even more unworthy of Ping’er.

866
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,220
Ping'er.

867
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,990
So you went home yesterday?

868
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:21,700
Yes.

869
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,260
I met

870
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,180
an old friend

871
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,520
while shopping

872
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,110
with Wang.

873
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,450
He took me back to the Marquis Mansion.

874
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,580
I intended to inform you

875
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,290
as soon as I arrived

876
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:32,620
at the Marquis Mansion.

877
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,650
But my grandpa

878
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,910
talked to me for a long time.

879
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:35,470
This

880
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,660
delayed me,

881
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,040
so

882
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,310
I only came back this morning.

883
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,570
It's okay.

884
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,120
As long as you’re safe.

885
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,010
But why did you run away

886
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,110
to Linchun City?

887
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,460
Did you have a fight

888
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,460
with your family?

889
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:50,990
And

890
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,660
when you went back last night,

891
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,260
did they give you a hard time?

892
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,030
No, no.

893
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,420
Actually, I…

894
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,660
Why are you asking her

895
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,450
why she ran away?

896
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,160
It must be something unhappy.

897
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Let’s not ask about unhappy things.

898
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,570
Ping'er.

899
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,450
I made a lot of

900
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,320
your favorite snacks.

901
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,650
Let’s go eat them later.

902
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,990
What's wrong?

903
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,010
Young Master.

904
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,500
Prince Xian is here.

905
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,170
He says

906
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,840
he’s here to take Princess Ping'er.
