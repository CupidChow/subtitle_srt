Don't worry, Mother.

He will be fine.

What...

00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,259
What exactly

10
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,880
happened to my son?

11
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,950
Someone sent a message,

12
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,950
saying Mr. Xu might have died

13
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,030
on the walkway.

14
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,660
When the government sent someone there,

15
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,660
they only found

16
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,310
his belongings.

17
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,260
They didn't see him anywhere.

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,480
It's midwinter now.

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,310
It's been so long and they still haven't found him.

20
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,310
It's... It's very likely that he...

21
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,590
It's very likely?

22
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,390
It's very likely that he what?

It's very likely that he what?

24
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,110

28
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,740
Old Madam fainted

29
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,590
due to a sudden surge of grief

30
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,070
and anger.

31
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,430
I'll prescribe medicine for her to take for a few days.

32
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,030
Remember,

33
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,870
it's best to let her rest quietly to recuperate.

34
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,800
Don't let her get emotional again.

35
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,820
Thank you.

Have some water first.

47
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,110

No matter what happens,

63

to enjoy plum blossoms with me.

67
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
He will come back.

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,580
Don't be like this.

78
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,300
good news now.

You're in such a hurry.

After Third Master came back to the city,

84
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,230
he transferred all the shops in Furong City

85
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,630
under Young Master's name

86
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,030
to his own.

I'm afraid the Xu family's properties in Furong City

91
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,240
will all be taken by Third Master.

even if I have to risk my life,

99
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,180
I must protect the Xu family.

You are still young.

117

I'd better go myself.

118
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:50,870
I told you

Where do you want to go?

To find Young Master Xu?

134
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,260
No.

135
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,420
I'll go into the city tomorrow

136

to take back the shops in Furong City for the Xu family.

137

As long as I can help,

140
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,810
I must do everything I can.

141
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,770

and take good care of Mother for me.

147

You promised you'd come back soon.

148
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,370
You promised you'd enjoy flowers with me.

149
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,460
But now, there is no news about you at all.

150
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,000
Didn't you say

152
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,390
I'll give you a spray first.

153
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,390
After I come back,

154
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,430
I'll take you to the plum forest.

155
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,720

160
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,680
I'm sorry

161
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,070
for making you worried.

162

You finally came back.

Do you know

164
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,210
the family has been in a mess?

165
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,070
Mother fell sick.

166
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,710
I was so worried.

167
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,230
It's all my fault.

168
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,410
I made you worried.

169
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,180
It's good that you're back.

170

Old Madam.

174

Look who's back.

175
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,440
Mother.

176
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,510
I'm back.

177
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
Let me have a look.

178
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
Let me have a look.

179
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,060
Where did you go?

180
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,280
My horse was frightened that day.

181
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,200
I accidentally fell into a river.

182
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,530
I got delayed on the way.

183
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,070
Nothing serious.

184
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,120
It's good that you're back.

185
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,950

186
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,920
I will definitely

187
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,160
stay with you these days

188
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,220

189
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,590
In a few days,

190
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,100
I'll go to Furong City.

191
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,570
You have to go.

192
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,470
Then...

193
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,740
what about Se?

194
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,390
Mother,

195
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,950
I want to go with Zilu.

196
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,350
Okay.

197
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,800
Okay.

198
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,400
We are together again.

199
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,870
We are reunited.

200
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,280
Young Master.

201
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,150
Young Master.

202
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,150
Mother.

203
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,790
Young Master.

204
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,030
What's wrong?

205
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,560
There's a man named Wu Qi at the doorway.

206
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,410
He wants to see you.

207
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,150
Wu Qi?

208
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,800
Young Master just came back. Why is he here?

209
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,260
Young Master, how about refusing to see him?

210
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,520
Since he's here,

211
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,030
I should go meet him.

212
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,350
Sorry.

213
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,150
The smell of the incense

214
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,630
is too strong and pungent.

215
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,770
This is top-quality An'nan agarwood.

216
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,350
It's mixed

217
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,100
with patchouli, ebony, musk, and nard.

218
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,440
Although the smell is strong

219
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,650
and pungent at first,

220
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,320
the base note is rich

221
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,270
and endlessly captivating.

222
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,340
The combination

223
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,100
is wonderful.

224
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,170
Mr. Wu, you're indeed

225
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,030
from a noble incense appreciation family.

226
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,290
Mr. Xu, I'm flattered.

227
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,950
After all, appreciating incense is like understanding a person's character.

228
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,880
Mr. Wu,

229
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,500
what brings you here?

230
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,070
This is the shop in Furong City

231
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,240
that I lost to Young Madam last time.

232
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,070
I came to deliver the ownership certificate myself today.

233
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,950
Mr. Wu, you're indeed a man of your word.

234
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,950
You'll make something of yourself.

235
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:05,510
But

236
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,160
why did you bring

237
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,440
the God of Fortune too?

238
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,270
I guess

239
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,890
it's something you cherish.

240
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,240
I thought about it.

241
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,910
It's better not to take away what others like.

242
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,630
So I'm giving it back to you.

243
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,360
But you...

244
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,430
you already spent money on it.

245
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,760
You should take it back.

246
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,670
The money was for charity anyway.

247
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,980
It won't result in any losses for me.

248
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,220
Mr. Wu, you really are a kind man.

249
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,780
What's wrong?

250
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,650
Didn't you just say you were fine?

251
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,710
Darling,

252
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,580
can you go make me a cup of hot tea?

253
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,390
No problem. I'm going now.

254
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,420
My wife is not here now.

255
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,830
Let's be frank with each other.

256
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,920
Why did you admit defeat on purpose

257
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,070
on the day of the incense making conference?

258
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,990
Young Madam is indeed a unique woman.

259
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,880
I really admire her.

260
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,330
Then why did you

261
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,590
stir things up in Linchun

262
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,410
and provoke the Xu family?

263
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,640
Take a guess.

264
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,620
I'm not joking.

265
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,190
Mr. Xu,

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,120
your family has a long history of making incense.

267
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,460
I just want to compete

268
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,300
with you.

269
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,960
So I came here to take a look on a whim.

270
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,350
I already smelt the incense

271
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,150
made by you.

272
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,330
My trip here is worthwhile.

273
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,480
Then...

274
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,640
you've got what you wanted.

275
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,450
I wanted to stay here for a few more days,

276
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,380
but the people in Furong

277
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,580
have been rushing me.

278
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,310
So,

279
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,420
I should get going.

280
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,390
Goodbye then.

281
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,760
I heard you've become an Imperial Merchant.

282
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,560
Furong is a more dangerous place

283
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,950
compared to Linchun.

284
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,830
If you want to enter the city,

285
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:59,230
you must be very careful.

286
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,120
Thank you for reminding me.

287
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,490
It's not your concern.

288
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,069
Mr. Wu,

289
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,030
see you.

290
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:10,910
Fuding.

291
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,450
Walk him out.

292
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,589
Yes, Young Master.

293
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,750
Mr. Wu, you're leaving so soon?

294
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,990
Anyway,

295
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,589
you have a shop in Furong now.

296
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,369
Go to Furong

297
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,510
to take a walk around

298
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,750
and take over the shop later.

299
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,710
See you in Furong City another day.

300
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,329
See you in Furong City.

301
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,510
Mr. Wu, this way please.

302
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,220
Do you really plan to take over the shop in Furong City?

303
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,160
Of course.

304
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,070
Anyway, we'll

305
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,430
go to Furong City.

306
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,030
It'll be a waste if I don't take over the shop.

307
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,590
To me, Wu Qi

308
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,360
is a chicken

309
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,120
capable of laying golden eggs.

310
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,820
Let's go take a look at this shop

311
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,340
when we get there

312
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,070
and see what business we can do.

313
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,370
After we hire a manager,

314
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,960
we can earn money naturally,

315
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,750
right?

316
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,370
If its location

317
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,240
is not good,

318
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,270
we can rent it out.

319
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,950
It's also a profitable deal.

320
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,070
If you're busy by that time,

321
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,190
don't worry about me.

322
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,190
I can go by myself.

323
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,560
Even if I'm busy,

324
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,870
I should go with you.

325
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Have some tea.

326
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,990
Thank you for the tea.

327
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,310
Is there anything wrong with this?

328
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,790
No.

329
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,510
Candied haws.

330
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,830
Wang.

331
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,430
I've been looking for you.

332
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:42,960
Ping'er.

333
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,490
Look what I bought for you.

334
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,380
Actually,

335
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,950
I'm here today

336
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,150
to say goodbye to you.

337
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,450
I'll go to Furong City with Se.

338
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,880
If you are free tomorrow,

339
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,050
can you come to see me off?

340
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,990
You'll go to Furong City?

341
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,040
I'll go with you.

342
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,670
You'd better stay here

343
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,430
and wait for the result of the autumn exam.

344
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,360
After all, that is more important.

345
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,210
Bosslady,

346
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,430
get me some wine.

347
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,930
You've drunk so much.

348
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,790
Stop drinking.

349
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,990
Get me some wine!

350
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,820
The wine has been sold out.

351
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,030
Have some tea to sober up.

352
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,710
Sold out?

353
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,200
Wang,

354
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,870
what's wrong?

355
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,670
Ping'er will leave tomorrow.

356
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,250
But I don't have the guts to see her off.

357
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,870
Why?

358
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,390
I feel ashamed.

359
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,590
Look.

360
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,690
Ping'er is such a good girl.

361
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,210
But look at me.

362
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,660
I can't do well in my studies

363
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,870
or exams.

364
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,430
I know

365
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,510
I'm a joke

366
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,940
in your eyes.

367
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,630
Wang, don't be like this.

368
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,310
Everything will be fine.

369
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Anyway, I'm not good enough for her.

370
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,880
I shouldn't waste her time.

371
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,820
Forget it.

372
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,230
Drink.

373
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,560
Wine is the best medicine.

374
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,670
It's all on me.

375
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,470
Have you fed the horse?

376
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,970
Yes.

377
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,320
Okay.

378
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,250
Young Master, everything is ready.

379
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,250
We can set off now.

380
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,710
Fuding.

381
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,430
This time,

382
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,890
don't go with me.

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,380
My posthouse is almost at full capacity.

574
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,330
There is

575
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,360
only one room available now.

576
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,340
Why don't you

577
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,180
share a room?

578
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,420
-Never!
-No way!

579
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,380
Don't! Don't fight!

580
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,790
Wang,

581
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,210
we agreed to go

582
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,800
to Furong City to take the exam together.

583
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,250
You promised you'd wait for me,

584
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,580
but you left on your own.

585
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,590
I can't catch up with you.

586
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,680
I'm in the middle of nowhere.

587
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,840
It's quite creepy.

588
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,130
God helps those who help themselves.

589
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,040
I have a place to sleep now.

590
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,850
Is anyone here?

591
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,250
Hello?

592
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,170
Don't move!

593
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,700
Hurry. It's right ahead.

594
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,460
Don't move!

595
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,900
Are they robbers?

596
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,190
Fuding?

597
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,270
Tell me.

598
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,180
Where did Xu Zilu go?

599
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,380
Speak! We're talking to you!

600
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,400
Speak!

601
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,590
Tell us now.

602
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,350
Where did Xu Zilu go?

603
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,390
Who are you guys

604
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,430
to ask about Young Master Xu?

605
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,070
Man,

606
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,630
my brother is one of the top three killers

607
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,110
in the martial arts world.

608
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,030
If you stand against him,

609
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,410
he can kill you anytime.

610
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,920
Handsome guy,

611
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,240
I have 27 ways

612
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,730
to make you tell the truth.

613
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,340
I'm going to ask you again.

614
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,490
Where did Xu Zilu go?

615
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,230
Young Master...

616
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,670
went to Henan.

617
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:15,710
Henan?

618
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,390
Your heart is pounding.

619
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,670
Brother, he's lying.

620
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,790
You even did a polygraph test!

621
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,920
I... Well, I...

622
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,200
I'll only count to one.

623
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,060
Three.

624
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:32,550
Wenlai!

625
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,710
Two.

626
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,010
I'm going to ask you again.

627
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,340
Liu... Liuqiu.

628
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:38,950
One!

629
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,150
Young Master,

630
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,810
you must avenge me!

631
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,230
Fuding!

632
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,750
Fuding!

633
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,200
I'm up here.

634
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,720
Young Master Ling?

635
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,640
What are you doing here?

636
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,030
I'm on my way to the city to take the exam. I was resting here.

637
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,190
But I saw you were...

638
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,020
Are they... Are they dead?

639
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,010
They're fine. It would be better if they are dead.

640
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,030
What are you doing up there?

641
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,290
Come down and untie me!

642
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,080
Okay.

643
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,310
You kicked me just now!

644
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,590
You kicked me just now!

645
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,400
Coming.

646
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,470
Why did they kidnap you?

647
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,470
Is my sister okay?

648
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,510
This

649
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,920
is a secret of the Xu family.

650
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,450
It's not proper to tell you.

651
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,330
The Xu family's own people have even turned against each other.

652
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,680
Can my sister still be safe in the Xu family?

653
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,480
Don't worry, Young Master Ling.

654
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,840
Your sister is quite safe in the Xu family.

655
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,100
She and Young Master Xu

656
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,200
went to Furong City.

657
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,890
What? My sister went to Furong City?

658
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,310
Great.

659
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,590
Then I can see my sister

660
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,740
after I enter the city tomorrow, right?

661
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,420
Of course.

662
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,290
But I'm penniless now.

663
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,400
I don't know if I can

664
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,490
get to Furong City.

665
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,560
Seriously?

666
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,250
The Ling family

667
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,440
didn't give you money for your journey

668
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,830
to the city to take the exam?

669
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,719
My father said

670
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,139
my family lost and we don't have money.

671
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,679
He asked me to quit studying

672
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,639
and go back to the countryside

673
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,060
to farm the land with them.

674
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:16,949
I don't want to live like that.

675
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:18,550
So I ran away from home.

676
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,570
I wanted to travel with Wang,

677
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,590
but he left me behind.

678
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,260
How about this? Young Master Ling,

679
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,010
you saved my life.

680
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,620
I should thank you, right?

681
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,750
I'll take you to Furong City.

682
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
What do you think?

683
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,360
Great, Fuding.

684
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:38,030
From now on, you'll be my elder brother.

685
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,310
Brother Ling.

686
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,620
Let's go now.

687
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,030
They'll wake up soon.

688
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,730
Hurry up.

689
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,770
I need to take something.

690
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,380
How dare you kick me!

691
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,780
Henan, right?

692
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,110
Henan!

693
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,290
[Suburban Posthouse]

694
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,950
Why didn't your lover

695
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,300
come with you?

696
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,460
What... lover?

697
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,350
Listen,

698
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,270
don't talk nonsense

699
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:24,000
to ruin Ping'er's reputation.

700
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:32,930
Ping'er

701
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,120
should be in Furong City now.

702
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,480
I didn't want to tell you.

703
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,070
But for the sake of your deep affection for her,

704
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,620
I'll tell you.

705
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,710
I saw Ping'er today.

706
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,180
Ping'er?

707
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,230
Where did you see her?

708
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,210
At the corner of the street

709
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,500
across the posthouse.

710
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,020
She asked me to tell you

711
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,520
she would stay somewhere near that place.

712
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,340
Aren't you going to take a look?

713
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,190
It's not easy to find an inn now.

714
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,650
Maybe she still hasn't found a place to stay.

715
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,030
I strongly believe that you are still lying to me,

716
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,280
but I don't have any proof.

717
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,080
Believe it or not.

718
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,540
Just go sleep on the floor.

719
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,750
Wang Zhujue,

720
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:12,900
still, I'm smarter than you.

721
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,450
There really is a donkey.

722
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,550
Bro,

723
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,010
don't be afraid.

724
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm here for Ping'er.

725
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,760
There are all kinds of people in the suburbs.

726
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,820
It's so dangerous.

727
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,180
Ping'er is a girl.

728
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Xu Zilu and Ling Se

729
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,160
are unreliable.

730
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,470
I think

731
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,840
she still needs me.

732
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,810
Right?

733
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,390
Be good.

734
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,960
Donkey, be good.

735
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,900
One, two, three.

736
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,480
It would be great if you were a white horse.

737
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,340
Then I'd be running towards Ping'er

738
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,520
on a white horse

739
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,450
when she sees me.

740
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,050
How wonderful that would be!

741
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,230
So this is the place

742
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,710
mentioned by Wang Zixuan.

743
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,450
Come, Donkey.

744
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,010
When Ping'er arrives here later,

745
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,410
I'll show her this first.

746
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,830
She will be very happy.

747
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,790
Sir, two sweet potatoes.

748
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,630
Five coins each.

749
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,110
Okay.

750
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,680
Where exactly did Ping'er go?

751
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,580
Could it be that she already left

752
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,850
because I was late?

753
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,500
No.

754
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,420
Ping'er will wait for me.

755
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,530
I'll wait a little longer.

756
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,700
This is for Ping'er,

757
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,900
not you.

758
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,340
The sweet potatoes are getting cold.
