00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:36,000
[Debit Queen]

3
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,910
[Episode 5]

4
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,630
Who did this? Who stole even this thing?

5
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,590
I did.

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,150
Xu Zilu.

7
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,110
Stealing someone’s wealth is the same as killing their parents.

8
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,039
What are you doing with my jar? Using it for foot baths?

9
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,470
You're lucky today.

10
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,750
This is something I won fairly.

11
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,640
Don’t even think about getting it back.

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,550
You and the shopkeeper were in cahoots

13
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,680
to cheat Miss Tao.

14
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,120
Is that considered fair?

15
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,330
How did he find out?

16
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,139
You can’t blame

17
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,780
Ling Se entirely for this.

18
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,580
Miss Tao

19
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,410
was being a bit too overbearing.

20
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,520
Listen to this.

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,710
The voice of the public.

22
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,640
Stop quibbling.

23
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,790
Go back and copy "The Encyclopedia of Fragrance"

24
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,390
and "Business Strategies".

25
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,600
After you finish copying, I’ll return your stuff.

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,730
If you don’t finish,

27
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,710
don’t even think about leaving.

28
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,790
Writing?

29
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:35,700
I won’t do it.

30
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,840
I hate writing.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,290
My head starts to ache as soon as I start writing.

32
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,110
Your trick is too underhanded.

33
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,530
I’m going to ask Mother for justice.

34
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,790
I've already told her.

35
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,329
She fully supported it.

36
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,470
She said everyone in the Xu household

37
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,130
could recite those two books by heart.

38
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,790
Go ahead.

39
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,460
See how many times she’ll make you copy.

40
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,150
You...

41
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,570
My Lord.

42
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,970
The officials are urging.

43
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,960
Zilu

44
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:13,990
has caused

45
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,670
such a mess at the last moment.

46
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,320
It’s going to be troublesome.

47
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,780
Zilu

48
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,550
is not a simple character.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,740
If it weren’t for the flooding

50
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,870
of the Xihuai River,

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,829
we wouldn’t have needed

52
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:33,630
to consider the Xu family route.

53
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,760
Have the arrangements

54
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,810
been made?

55
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,530
My Lord.

56
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,870
Rest assured.

57
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,310
Everything is arranged.

58
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,000
Good.

59
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:45,270
Also,

60
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,950
find something for Zilu to do.

61
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,550
Don’t give him time

62
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,510
to meddle in other people’s business.

63
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,750
Yes, My Lord.

64
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,620
Good grief.

65
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,769
I’ve read almost half of this book,

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,590
and you haven’t written a single word?

67
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,430
I am

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,310
someone who relies on my looks for a living.

69
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,510
What talent do I need?

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,810
Se.

71
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,080
In the future,

72
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,880
you will have to manage the business.

73
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,640
You can’t be

74
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,420
completely illiterate, can you?

75
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,700
Look at Manager Liu.

76
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,990
At least she can

77
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,540
write the menu herself.

78
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,540
Liu Yeniang?

79
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,440
She’s just a bit

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,480
better than me.

81
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,510
Her writing

82
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,770
is done by Da for her.

83
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,520
I have you, and that’s enough.

84
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,750
Anyway, I can’t argue with you.

85
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,800
Why don’t you

86
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,510
go and beg the Old Madam?

87
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,180
I’ve been there already.

88
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,320
I don't know

89
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,100
what Xu Zilu told the Old Madam.

90
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,290
I even brought her a bracelet

91
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,670
and spoke good words.

92
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,850
I worked all morning

93
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,750
with no result.

94
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,560
That darn old fox.

95
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,150
I’ll make him

96
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,580
see my power eventually.

97
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,150
Who is the darn one?

98
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,940
Liu Yeniang.

99
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,060
Let me tell you.

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,300
Xu Zilu, the jerk,

101
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,870
is making me copy books.

102
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,160
I can’t leave until I finish copying.

103
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,990
Mr. Xu

104
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,860
really knows how to hit the mark.

105
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,510
Why don't you hurry up and copy it?

106
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,830
How...

107
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,940
How can I finish copying all these books?

108
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,740
I’ve only copied this little bit after a long time.

109
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,670
The handwriting

110
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,010
is really good.

111
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:48,630
It’s direct

112
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,350
and powerful.

113
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,590
Our Miss’s writing

114
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,870
isn’t called writing.

115
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,140
It’s called doodles.

116
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,250
Here’s the plan.

117
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,640
Tomorrow I’ll put

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,430
this piece

119
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,600
on the Xu Mansion’s gate

120
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,470
as a talisman.

121
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,510
You two

122
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,850
keep fighting each other.

123
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,780
Isn’t it boring?

124
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,190
How could it be boring?

125
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,850
Don’t you find it sweet?

126
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,430
The interactions between them

127
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,030
are called relationship dynamics.

128
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,760
It’s a standard romantic plot.

129
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,430
According to the following storyline,

130
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,480
they’ll soon

131
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,700
go from mutual dislike

132
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,090
to mutual attraction.

133
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,000
Finally, it will develop into

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,490
a passionate

135
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,110
and touching fateful romance.

136
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,270
Them?

137
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,450
Liu Yeniang.

138
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,730
Can you please shut up?

139
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,740
Have you been reading too many scripts

140
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,150
and lost your mind?

141
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,880
Romance?

142
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,270
Right now, I just want Xu Zilu

143
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,730
to kneel and beg for mercy.

144
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,350
I think

145
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,140
you’re just being stubborn.

146
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,230
Now,

147
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,840
aren’t you being completely

148
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,100
suppressed by Xu Zilu?

149
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,940
That’s because I’m holding back my big move.

150
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,000
I can’t be bothered to argue with you.

151
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,580
Wait.

152
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,640
What are you doing here?

153
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,980
I forgot about the main issue.

154
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,930
My cook

155
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,660
resigned due to some family issues.

156
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,520
The replacement won’t arrive for another three days.

157
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,770
I was thinking of asking you

158
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,620
to help out in the kitchen tomorrow,

159
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,550
and I’d split the profits with you.

160
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,410
But now,

161
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,890
I need to come up with another plan.

162
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,590
We'll split the profits?

163
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,000
What other plan do you have?

164
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,870
Can you really find

165
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,250
someone more suitable than me?

166
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:24,840
Listen.

167
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,070
I’ll handle it.

168
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,250
But you can’t

169
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,070
leave right away, can you?

170
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,020
It’s just copying books, right?

171
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,770
I’ll tell you,

172
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,680
even if I don’t sleep today,

173
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,140
I’ll finish copying them.

174
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,600
Nothing can stop me

175
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,659
from making money.

176
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
See you tomorrow.

177
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,300
How did the brush get dried?

178
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,870
Mr. Ma said

179
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,520
he doesn’t have any pepper available either.

180
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,650
Before we could ask,

181
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,150
someone had already bought up

182
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,010
all the pepper.

183
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,550
Who?

184
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,670
Mr. Tao.

185
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,980
It seems he was prepared in advance.

186
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,360
Such things are scarce.

187
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,350
Only places with many merchants

188
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,280
like Furong, Linchun, and Cunzhou

189
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,320
have them for sale.

190
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,110
Now Mr. Tao is causing trouble.

191
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,370
Furong and Linchun

192
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,170
are too close.

193
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,300
And the supply channels are the same.

194
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,270
It must be hard to find any there as well.

195
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,590
Mr. Ma introduced me

196
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,800
a black market dealer.

197
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,190
He doesn’t have any stock on hand

198
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,100
and can only source it from outside the border.

199
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,730
The cost

200
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,370
has increased twentyfold.

201
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,710
I don’t dare make a decision on my own.

202
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,390
I can only ask

203
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,870
for your decision, Young Master.

204
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,799
So, this would be

205
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,630
even more expensive than the penalty fee.

206
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,990
Yes.

207
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,190
I'll discuss it with Third Uncle.

208
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,050
Let’s keep this

209
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,170
from Mother.

210
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,890
Alright.

211
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,390
What is it that I’m not supposed to know?

212
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,990
Old Madam.

213
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,010
You may leave.

214
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,310
Yes.

215
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,070
Mother.

216
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,110
It's late.

217
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,330
Why are you here?

218
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,840
I’m old

219
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,730
but not senile.

220
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,010
How could I not know

221
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,880
about such a major event

222
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,940
happening at home?

223
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,320
My son.

224
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,730
Integrity

225
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,140
is the most important thing in business.

226
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,250
If we can’t deliver

227
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,790
this goods on time,

228
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,160
we must inform the Prince Xian's Mansion in advance.

229
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,980
We should compensate as needed.

230
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,860
We can’t delay their business.

231
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,150
Mother, don't worry.

232
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,440
I have a plan.

233
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,220
The Imperial Merchants Conference is in a few days.

234
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,120
This matter

235
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,120
must be handled discreetly

236
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,300
to avoid others making a fuss about it.

237
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:33,600
Alright.

238
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,990
I was even thinking

239
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,030
of having his daughter

240
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,360
as my daughter-in-law.

241
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,850
Mom. Do you think

242
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,740
if I had married

243
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,000
Tao Meili at that time,

244
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,950
we wouldn’t have these issues?

245
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,400
What are you talking about?

246
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,730
Am I that kind of person?

247
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,990
Meili is a nice girl,

248
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:53,750
but I like

249
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,240
Se more.

250
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,060
Speaking of her,

251
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,520
let me show you something.

252
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,360
Look.

253
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:00,930
Here’s a pearl bracelet Se bought for me.

254
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,860
Isn't it pretty?

255
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:02,910
It goes perfectly

256
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,110
with my green bangle.

257
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,430
Red and green together look so nice.

258
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,470
Next time I play cards,

259
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,070
I’ll definitely show it off.

260
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,810
Ancient people loved

261
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,800
using all sorts of complicated characters.

262
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,960
Let me simplify them for you.

263
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,180
[Xu Mansion]

264
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,060
Gosh.

265
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,930
Have you been writing all night?

266
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,880
Don't talk to me.

267
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,550
I'm going to throw up.

268
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
I'm done copying.

269
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,710
Wait.

270
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,830
Now what?

271
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,120
Where are you going?

272
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,430
None of your business.

273
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,780
Rewrite it.

274
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,840
Say that again.

275
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,430
I said rewrite it.

276
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,750
You want me to redo it

277
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,200
without even looking at it?

278
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,090
I don’t need to look

279
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,750
to know you were slacking off.

280
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,090
What’s in this?

281
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,760
Did you even understand it?

282
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,890
How about I test you?

283
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,310
I stayed up all night

284
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,640
to finish copying this.

285
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,520
I can barely lift my arms now.

286
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,490
And with one word, you want me to redo it?

287
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,080
Xu Zilu.

288
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,790
Are you even a man?

289
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,190
You don’t keep your word.

290
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,670
Think what you want.

291
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,270
But if you don’t finish rewriting it today,

292
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,730
you won't be able to go out.

293
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,710
Fuding.

294
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,470
Get some servants to keep an eye on her.

295
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,530
Make sure she doesn’t try any tricks.

296
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,940
I’m leaving whether you allow me or not.

297
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,290
Break my legs if you can.

298
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,130
300 steps away from here

299
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,440
is the main gate of the Xu Mansion.

300
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,240
Try it.

301
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,110
Fine.

302
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,600
If I leave, I’m never coming back.

303
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,530
Don't regret it.

304
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,230
Young Madam!

305
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,850
Young Madam!

306
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,580
Young Master didn't mean that.

307
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,650
Young Madam, listen to me.

308
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,140
Young Madam, please don’t be upset.

309
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,430
Young Master has been under a lot of stress lately.

310
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,050
After all, tomorrow is

311
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,190
the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference.

312
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,730
Young Madam,

313
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,650
just bear with him for a couple more days.

314
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,560
He will

315
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,410
surely leave you alone afterward.

316
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,480
What does the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference

317
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,120
have to do with me?

318
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,670
Why should I have to tolerate him for two more days?

319
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,010
You're on Xu Zilu's side.

320
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,260
None of you is good.

321
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,130
I'm not on Young Master's side.

322
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,730
I’ll help you with Old Madam…

323
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Why am I always the one getting hurt?

324
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,090
Young Master.

325
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,220
You've gone too far.

326
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,400
How?

327
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,630
You’re so clever and cunning.

328
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,850
It’s only natural

329
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,890
that Young Madam doesn’t trust you.

330
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,790
Young Master, don't stare at me like that.

331
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,920
Even if you stare at me, I have to say it.

332
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,720
You can’t keep someone

333
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,230
by force like this.

334
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,910
House arrest won’t work.

335
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,170
You need to win her over with actions.

336
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,340
You need to use love.

337
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,680
You think you know everything.

338
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,270
I'm keeping her inside

339
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,200
for her own good.

340
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,860
The Tao family never forgets a grudge.

341
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,170
Who knows what Tao Meili

342
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,620
might do to get revenge on her?

343
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,010
If I let her go out and she gets into a fight,

344
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,980
what will happen if something goes wrong?

345
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,440
Well...

346
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:47,480
If you’re worried about

347
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,320
Young Madam's safety,

348
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,270
then tell her.

349
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,120
Otherwise,

350
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,160
what will you do when you end up with nothing?

351
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,100
Enough.

352
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,380
Did I...

353
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
really go too far?

354
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,910
Then teach me

355
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,110
what to do.

356
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,290
Young Master.

357
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,370
When it comes to a woman,

358
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,640
just comfort her,

359
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,900
say a few nice things, and she’ll be fine.

360
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,410
Young Master.

361
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,400
Young Master?

362
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,110
What's wrong?

363
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,110
Young Master.

364
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,840
Third Master sent a message.

365
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,650
He said there’s something urgent.

366
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,590
He’ll be back in Furong City

367
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,430
later today.

368
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:35,840
Let’s go.

369
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,750
Hurry.

370
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,060
Ping'er.

371
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,920
Be careful.

372
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,890
I'll go up first.

373
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,410
You’re not as agile as I am.

374
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,850
I’ve climbed the walls

375
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,180
at home many times.

376
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,600
Be careful.

377
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,870
Then

378
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,870
grab here.

379
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,100
Step here.

380
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,230
And then climb over.

381
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,150
Come on.

382
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,230
Ping'er?

383
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:05,760
Ping'er?

384
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,390
Ping'er?

385
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,790
Se.

386
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,870
I'm here.

387
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,040
How did you get there?

388
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,590
I used the back door.

389
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,390
Young Master Xu doesn't allow you to go out.

390
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,390
He didn't say he wouldn't let me out.

391
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,670
That darn fox.

392
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,640
Today, I'll let him know

393
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,270
what regret means.

394
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:25,630
Come on.

395
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,880
[Xu's Perfume Shop]

396
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,520
It's good.

397
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,590
Take a look.

398
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,460
Didn't you say you were going to Fulai Inn?

399
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,070
How can you risk getting yourself caught?

400
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,050
Tomorrow is the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference.

401
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,940
He must be very busy.

402
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,670
He doesn't have time to come here.

403
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,740
Without firsthand information,

404
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,340
the people won’t believe it.

405
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,100
What do you want?

406
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,940
You'll know when we get in.

407
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,470
Let’s go.

408
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,950
Take a look.

409
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,300
Welcome, Young Madam.

410
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,480
What can I do for you?

411
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,300
Manager Liu.

412
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,110
Get all the guests out.

413
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,990
Close the door.

414
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,580
Everyone, come in.

415
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,070
Actually,

416
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,780
I have some questions

417
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,320
for you.

418
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,370
I’ve just

419
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,730
married into the Xu family,

420
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,600
and there’s still a lot I don’t understand.

421
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,200
I want to learn

422
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,800
more about the Young Master,

423
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,430
so I can

424
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,690
become a good wife to him

425
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,820
as soon as possible.

426
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,820
We will certainly speak openly

427
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,620
and honestly.

428
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,990
The Xu family needs

429
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,590
pillars of society like you.

430
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,400
Ping'er.

431
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,870
Write down

432
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,710
every word.

433
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,650
Let’s start from when the Young Master

434
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,390
was born.

435
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,790
Tell me things that no one else knows.

436
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,270
Liu.

437
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,170
You know the most.

438
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,510
You tell the Young Madam.

439
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,350
Young Master

440
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,890
was weaned off early,

441
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,610
so he developed slowly.

442
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,290
He didn't have much strength.

443
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,350
The Master and Madam

444
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,200
had him eat chicken liver and lamb’s penis at every meal

445
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,400
to give him strength.

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,600
He was physically weak, huh?

447
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,150
This is useful.

448
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:55,990
I’ll make sure

449
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,550
to brew more tonic soup

450
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,950
for him in the future.

451
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,080
Write it down.

452
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,210
Anything else?

453
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:00,810
I know more.

454
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,610
I know more.

455
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,260
I heard that

456
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,030
Young Master was afraid of his tutor when he was young.

457
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,790
He needed to use the restroom but didn’t dare to say anything,

458
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,440
so he wet his pants.

459
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,050
The Young Master

460
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,829
already had a bed-wetting problem.

461
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,359
Wan.

462
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,140
Do you remember how old he was

463
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,319
when he stopped wetting the bed?

464
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,920
Eight years old, right?

465
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,650
No.

466
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,760
Twelve years old!

467
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,680
Young Master loved sweets as a child.

468
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,660
When Madam wouldn’t buy them,

469
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,480
he insisted on

470
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,450
going after a wasp nest himself.

471
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:22,970
In the end,

472
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,130
he got stung so badly that even Madam

473
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,530
couldn’t recognize him.

474
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,070
Please.

475
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,190
Take care, Young Madam.

476
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,540
Take care, Young Madam.

477
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,200
Se.

478
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,350
Why are you digging up

479
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,260
so much dirt

480
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,290
on Young Master Xu?

481
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,550
You don’t understand.

482
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,960
I’m going to show him

483
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,390
how skilled Eighth Master Hong of the Hong Sect is

484
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,590
at spreading rumors.

485
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,240
In a few days,

486
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,350
he’ll be on his knees

487
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,790
begging me.

488
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,680
Then, won’t the contract be mine?

489
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,310
But isn’t this

490
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,260
a bit too much?

491
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,070
Ping'er,

492
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,920
you are too naive.

493
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,920
Showing mercy to the enemy

494
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,450
is being cruel to yourself.

495
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,390
Miss Wang.

496
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,810
I'm sorry.

497
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,670
The shop is incredibly

498
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,480
busy today.

499
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,210
Go on, then.

500
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,070
I’ve never seen

501
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,550
a maid as lazy as you.

502
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,430
Since when does a lady work in the kitchen

503
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,210
while the maid

504
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,610
sits around eating?

505
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,110
The lady is making money,

506
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,930
but I’m not.

507
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,530
The food’s not bad, right, everyone?

508
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,310
Bosslady.

509
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
They are all here.

510
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,230
Ping'er.

511
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,590
Stop eating.

512
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,680
Help me run an errand.

513
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Take this to the academy’s teacher.

514
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,510
I'll go.

515
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,870
There you go, ordering my maid around again.

516
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,870
You better pay up.

517
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,300
Then you should first compensate me

518
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,500
for what she’s eaten.

519
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,060
Ping'er, hurry back.

520
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,630
Hurry up.

521
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:06,600
Wang.

522
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,230
The provincial exams are coming up.

523
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,890
Are you taking them this year?

524
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,240
Do you even need to ask?

525
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,180
I’ve already filled out the application.

526
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,950
-You’re something else.
-Wang Zhujue.

527
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,080
What I admire most about you

528
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,260
is your thick skin.

529
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,180
Your father is a dignified governor,

530
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,960
yet he has a son

531
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,650
who’s such an embarrassment?

532
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,570
Well, what can I do?

533
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,010
Your father wanted to be a governor

534
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,110
but didn’t have the skills.

535
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,470
He’s always trying to undermine my father,

536
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,580
and he only managed to become a county magistrate.

537
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,140
Anyway, I’m used to being a disgrace.

538
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,350
It’s nothing new.

539
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,460
If I don’t pass, it’s no surprise.

540
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,510
But if you

541
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,030
don’t pass,

542
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,760
now that would be news.

543
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,950
Wang.

544
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,910
Wang.

545
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,880
Ping'er.

546
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,250
What are you doing here?

547
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:50,950
Wang.

548
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,630
Ping'er.

549
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,250
Are you alright?

550
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,910
I'm fine.

551
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,480
Wang Zixuan!

552
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,690
How dare you hit me?

553
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,760
What are you looking at? Come on!

554
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,720
Stop it!

555
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,420
-Master.
-Master.

556
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,970
You are beyond redemption.

557
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,950
Even a three-year-old knows

558
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,590
not to fight

559
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,690
in a place of sages.

560
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,040
How old are you?

561
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,130
This is utterly disgraceful.

562
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,520
I now punish all of you to copying

563
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,750
The Guidelines for Early Childhood Behavior

564
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,440
ten times.

565
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,750
Master.

566
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,600
We are no longer

567
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,280
at the early childhood stage.

568
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
You talk too much.

569
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,950
You should copy it

570
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,300
ten more times.

571
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,950
What...

572
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,800
What smells so good?

573
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,450
What is this?

574
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,630
This is the food you ordered

575
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,690
from the Fulai Inn.

576
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,030
I’ve brought it to you.

577
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,750
Look at her.

578
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,630
She even remembers to bring something good for the teacher.

579
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,290
You all just know how to fight and cause trouble.

580
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,610
Xu Qiuhe.

581
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,310
Help me with the copying.

582
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:11,910
Okay.

583
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,260
So, he can help with the copying as well?

584
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,590
Wang.

585
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,770
Then I’ll help you write it too.

586
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,450
Let's go.

587
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,190
Ping'er.

588
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,730
The same little tiger as the Young Madam Xu's.

589
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,190
Don't miss it.

590
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,270
The same little flower umbrella as the Young Madam Xu's.

591
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,480
Little flower umbrella.

592
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,530
Come and have a look.

593
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,450
Miss Tao, look here.

594
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,140
This hairpin was bought

595
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,290
by Young Madam Xu from me yesterday.

596
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,170
Look how beautiful it is.

597
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,030
Take a look.

598
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,600
Miss Tao, would you like a sachet?

599
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,260
No.

600
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,530
Young Madam Xu bought

601
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,240
so many things from me.

602
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,690
Aren't you going to get anything?

603
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,290
Go away!

604
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,690
It's okay if you don't want it.

605
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:46,720
But why are you so fierce?

606
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,830
You scared me.

607
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,060
My Lady, calm down.

608
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,780
Next time I see

609
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,000
Young Madam Xu again,

610
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,800
I will teach her a lesson for you.

611
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,550
How about you take it out on me

612
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,330
as if I were Young Madam Xu today?

613
00:21:59,330 --> 00:21:59,730
I...

614
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,430
Sibing.

615
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,690
You're smart today.

616
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,080
I should personally

617
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,820
teach that country girl a lesson.

618
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,190
You.

619
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,140
Go find me two

620
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,440
sharp-witted people.

621
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,460
Then head back to the residence

622
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,710
and make sure to stop my father.

623
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,990
Tell him not to meddle.

624
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,630
I’ll take care of my own revenge.

625
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,540
Stingy Girl.

626
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,870
Let’s settle both new

627
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,600
and old scores today.

628
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,030
Then spread these revelations

629
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,700
about him.

630
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,580
This is what we’re talking about.

631
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,830
No problem.

632
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,980
Leave it to me.

633
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,410
Make sure you provide with plenty of information.

634
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,110
Stir up the situation as much as possible.

635
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,840
Don't worry.

636
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,200
I'm Nosy Parker

637
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,870
who will get things done.

638
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,030
But...

639
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,680
-As for the promotional fee…
-I see.

640
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:57,890
Is this all?

641
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,320
I’ve given you everything.

642
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,110
After all, you’re now

643
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,680
Young Madam Xu.

644
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,670
Am I supposed to give the entire Xu family to you?

645
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,600
No need for that.

646
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,910
You can use this first.

647
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,550
If it’s not enough after the job is done, I’ll give you more.

648
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,410
Why does it feel like you’re extending credit here?

649
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,470
Fine.

650
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,850
Consider it as taking care of an old client.

651
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,580
Wait and see.

652
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,740
Xu Zilu.

653
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,700
I’ll see how long you can keep

654
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,940
that annoying face of yours smiling.

655
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,380
I'll piss you off!

656
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,680
[Yingchun Gate]

657
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,150
Third Uncle.

658
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,940
Are you still upset with me?

659
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,800
How could I be angry with you?

660
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,340
I was just too impatient that day.

661
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,480
But now that

662
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,090
we have a black market channel,

663
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,690
the issue has been resolved.

664
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,630
If it means earning a bit less, so be it.

665
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,150
It’s just

666
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,330
that using black market prices

667
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,570
will likely result in significant losses.

668
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,770
In Mother's opinion,

669
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,750
Third Uncle,

670
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,150
please let Prince Xian know and ask him

671
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,080
to give the order

672
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,340
to another business.

673
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,920
We’ll cover the losses.

674
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,390
That’s not acceptable.

675
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,820
Prince Xian is not someone

676
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,180
you can afford to offend.

677
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,840
You can't back out as you wish.

678
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,520
If it’s about the price,

679
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,010
I have a few friends

680
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,110
with connections to Beiyun.

681
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,040
We should be able

682
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,210
to get pepper at a lower cost...

683
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:24,940
Third Uncle.

684
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,640
You can't say that.

685
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,300
There’s friction at the border

686
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,610
between Daqing and Beiyun.

687
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,250
Trade between the two sides

688
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,250
has been banned.

689
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,590
If others find out,

690
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,610
they might use it

691
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:36,410
against us.

692
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,260
Look at me.

693
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,580
I was just too hasty and confused.

694
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,120
I’m worried that the Xu family

695
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,580
might offend Prince Xian,

696
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,610
which could be detrimental to our future in the imperial merchant elections.

697
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,050
This is a critical moment.

698
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,580
It’s better to be cautious.

699
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,800
Third Uncle, you're right.

700
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,070
I’ll think of other solutions.

701
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,570
We should still have time.

702
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,170
There are many things to handle

703
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,020
for the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference this time,

704
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,360
and I’ll need to trouble you further.

705
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,070
Thank you

706
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:03,890
in advance.

707
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,940
We're family.

708
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,800
What are you talking about?

709
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,890
I’ve already arranged

710
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,590
everything that needed arranging.

711
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,320
Don't worry.

712
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:12,710
Zilu.

713
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,770
I have to go.

714
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,680
I wish you success in winning the competition tomorrow.

715
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,010
Thank you, Third Uncle.

716
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,480
Let's go.

717
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,630
Make way!

718
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,070
Make way!

719
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,960
Move!

720
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,020
Move!

721
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,630
Get out of the way!

722
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,190
Tao Meili.

723
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,750
Why did you tie me up?

724
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,650
Tao Meili, why did you tie me up?

725
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,710
Why did I tie you up?

726
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,060
From the day

727
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,750
you started going against me,

728
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:06,870
you should have known

729
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:07,690
that you'd end up like this

730
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,620
sooner or later.

731
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,890
Who’s going against you?

732
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,950
It’s clearly you who misunderstood.

733
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,590
I was wrong.

734
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,290
I was talking nonsense.

735
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,520
You blocked my way,

736
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,420
stole my man,

737
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,790
and made me the laughingstock of the entire city.

738
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,240
My relationship with Xu Zilu

739
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,680
is purely

740
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,160
a financial transaction.

741
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,940
Zilu already said

742
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,440
he would only marry you.

743
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,850
Why are you still making up

744
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,480
such nonsense to deceive me?

745
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:40,630
No...

746
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,510
Do you really think I can’t tell

747
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,910
you’re just showing off?

748
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,430
Today, I’m going to make you

749
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,340
see your place.

750
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,240
Miss Tao, we’ve arrived.

751
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,420
Come down.

752
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,340
Why did you

753
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,380
bring us here?

754
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,870
My Lady.

755
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,330
Didn't you say you wanted to teach her a lesson?

756
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,190
We found a secluded place

757
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:10,910
for that.

758
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,460
I wanted to compete with her in skills.

759
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,690
To shame her properly

760
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,090
by beating her.

761
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,390
You brought us to this

762
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,520
godforsaken place.

763
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,730
Who will see if I win?

764
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,510
It’s just a skill competition, right?

765
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,780
That’s easy. Consider it your win.

766
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,960
I wouldn’t win anyway.

767
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,160
Do you look down on me?

768
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,500
Whatever the competition is,

769
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,100
you have to untie me first.

770
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:31,970
How can I compete with you

771
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:32,820
if you’re tying me up?

772
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,480
Untie her.

773
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
My hands are sore.

774
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,180
Let me think about what to compete in.

775
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:49,830
Then let’s see

776
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,610
who can run faster.

777
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,190
Stop!

778
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,770
My Lady, take it slow.

779
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,500
My Lady.

780
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,530
Why are you pulling my hair?

781
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,800
I barely have any hair and you’re still pulling it.

782
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,390
Stop!

783
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,590
Today is a duel between the two of us.

784
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,960
-No one is allowed to help.
-My Lady.

785
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,430
My Lady!

786
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:03,910
Stop!

787
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,990
This is a matter between us.

788
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,920
Don't come over.

789
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,220
Don't come over.

790
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:10,910
Don't.

791
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,690
-You don’t dare to compete?
-Yes.

792
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,150
Stop!

793
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,590
Let go of me!

794
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,260
Let go of me! It hurts!

795
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,600
Why are you even pinching my nose?

796
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,790
I just want to do it.

797
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,470
You’re pulling my ears.

798
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,670
I just want to do it.

799
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,270
I’ll push against you.

800
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,190
Can’t I push against you?

801
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,850
Is your head harder than mine?

802
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,450
I’ll push you.

803
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,630
Quickly protect the employer.

804
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,560
Don't come over!

805
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,430
This is a battle between us.

806
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,030
Don't come over.

807
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,310
Hang in there.

808
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,940
I don't believe I can't win against you.

809
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,790
I’ll push you!

810
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,940
Why is there women's voice?

811
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,650
Let's go.

812
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,830
Let's take a look.

813
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,590
Ladies,

814
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,250
the fight you’re having is chaotic

815
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,220
and messy.

816
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,900
It’s quite unsophisticated.

817
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,910
Sir.

818
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,360
Nice knife.

819
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,530
Where did you come from?

820
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,070
How dare you do this to me?

821
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,730
Aren’t you afraid my father will skin you alive?

822
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,430
Are you seeking death?

823
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,690
Would I fear

824
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,370
such a dirty and smelly thing?

825
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,480
What about those two useless ones from earlier?

826
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,740
Still not coming over?

827
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,310
Bro.

828
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,330
These two girls are not bad.

829
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,950
Let me and Qiang have some fun.

830
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,430
Bro.

831
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,230
What nonsense!

832
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,900
Don’t you know

833
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,720
that used women are worthless?

834
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,030
Throw them

835
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,930
into the carriage

836
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,800
and take them away.

837
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,680
Sell them in the brothel.

838
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,330
Making money is important.

839
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,130
Alright, Bro.

840
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,670
Go.

841
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,460
Let me go!

842
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:06,690
Young Master.

843
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,250
Aren’t you going to have dinner with the Old Madam?

844
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,650
I’m going to find Ling Se.

845
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,660
It’s not that I’m trying to coax her.

846
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,000
I’m worried she might cause trouble tomorrow.

847
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,330
So I’m personally inviting her to dinner.

848
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,980
Alright, Young Master is coming around.

849
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,530
Young Madam!

850
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,590
Young Madam!

851
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,800
Young Master is here to apologize to you.

852
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,530
Young Madam.

853
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,810
Young Madam.

854
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:30,540
Young...

855
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,600
Where is she?

856
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,280
Go get her.

857
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,450
Alright.

858
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,180
Young Madam.

859
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,310
Young Madam.

860
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,870
Young Madam!

861
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,800
Are your hands sore?

862
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,150
Have dinner with me

863
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,630
and Mother today.

864
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,360
I heard you behaved well today.

865
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,590
Join us for dinner with Mother.

866
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,160
[Xu Zi... Bad...]

867
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,170
Young Madam!

868
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,310
Young Madam!

869
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,650
Young Master.

870
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,340
The Young Madam is not in the mansion.

871
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,220
Didn’t I tell you to keep an eye on her?

872
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,340
I did, and

873
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,560
the Young Madam didn’t leave through the main gate.

874
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,020
Does she have to leave through the main gate?

875
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,710
Young Master.

876
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,770
The Young Madam said she’s leaving today.

877
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:58,900
She wouldn’t really leave, would she?

878
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,330
Only one of us

879
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,380
can escape later.

880
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,140
I’ll hold them off. You run quickly.

881
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,470
Why aren't you leaving?

882
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,910
If I leave,

883
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,430
do you think you can hold them off

884
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,630
for more than two hours?

885
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:18,230
Why not?

886
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,850
You underestimate me again.

887
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,530
I'm not looking down on you.

888
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,640
My Lady.

889
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,480
I'm begging you.

890
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,970
I’m putting my life

891
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,320
in your hands right now.

892
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,680
Quickly go find Xu Zilu

893
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,880
to save my cheap life.

894
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,340
Gentlemen,

895
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,760
it’s really inconvenient

896
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,660
to go to the loo while being tied up.

897
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,090
Could you please untie me?

898
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,110
So troublesome.

899
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:57,910
Annoying.

900
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:58,830
Hurry up.

901
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,550
Thank you.

902
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,480
My luck hasn’t been good lately.

903
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,150
Really.

904
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,110
Meili.

905
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,060
I’ll hold them off.

906
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,590
You hide here for now.

907
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,860
After we’re far enough away,

908
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,000
you can come out and go back to the city to report.

909
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,460
Can you manage on your own?

910
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,900
I haven’t settled the score with you yet.

911
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,880
You mustn’t die.

912
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,240
Don’t worry. What could happen to me?

913
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,240
Alright.

914
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,460
Stop hesitating.

915
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,570
Go quickly.

916
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:30,430
Otherwise, I’ll look down on you.

917
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:32,730
Go.

918
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,150
Be careful.

919
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,190
Hide quickly.

920
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,340
Help!

921
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,240
Oh, no. They’ve escaped.

922
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,570
Split up and chase them.

923
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,870
Stop!

924
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,480
Help!

925
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,100
Where did those damned women run off to?

926
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,850
Stop right there!

927
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:22,770
Still running?

928
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,120
Where are you going?

929
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,350
Bro.

930
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:40,909
Bro.

931
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,429
You’re back.

932
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,850
What about the other girl?

933
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,590
She ran away.

934
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,510
Ran away?

935
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,820
How did she escape?

936
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,840
The forest is too dense.

937
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,090
She said she needed to go to the loo.

938
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,719
In the blink of an eye,

939
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,000
we couldn’t see her anymore.

940
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,050
We’ve searched around several times.

941
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,980
You’re useless.

942
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,340
You can’t even keep an eye on a girl.

943
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,800
Take these two on the road.

944
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,270
Sell her off as soon as possible.

945
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,410
Use the money to buy some drinks.

946
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,410
Bro. You are wise.

947
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:05,430
Wait!

948
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,280
-Sit down.
-Knife...

949
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,830
Knife Sir.

950
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:10,990
Well...

951
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,000
Look.

952
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,320
I know you’re eager to make money,

953
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,190
but…

954
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,110
But if that girl reports to the authorities,

955
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,850
it will expose your whereabouts.

956
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,470
Right?

957
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,990
That makes sense.

958
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,600
What are you standing around for?

959
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,860
Hurry up and chase her.

960
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,750
Go on.

961
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,580
Go after her!

962
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,790
Yes, Bro.

963
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,420
Useless.

964
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,910
Alive or dead,

965
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,140
I need to see her.

966
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,430
Yes, Bro.

967
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,310
You

968
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,020
and that bearded man

969
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,250
better stay put.

970
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,800
Do you hear me?

971
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,240
What are you staring at?

972
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,230
Stop staring!

973
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,910
This soup is cold.

974
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,040
Wait for Se.

975
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,240
We’ll eat together when she arrives.

976
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,730
Mother, she

977
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,150
is not feeling well.

978
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,590
She said she won’t be coming to eat.

979
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,430
She's sick?

980
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,560
Then I need to go check on her.

981
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,020
She’s already gone to bed.

982
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,200
If you go,

983
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,060
you'll wake her up.

984
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,870
She'll be fine.

985
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,900
What’s wrong

986
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:28,970
with this child?

987
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,460
How did she get sick?

988
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,060
No wonder my eyelids

989
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,270
have been twitching

990
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,090
non-stop this morning.

991
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,490
And I’ve been unsettled.

992
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,150
By the way,

993
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,810
how are you preparing

994
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,380
for the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference tomorrow?

995
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,180
Make sure there are no mistakes.

996
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,390
Don’t worry, Mother.

997
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,590
I’m all set.

998
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,110
Even though tomorrow

999
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,730
is not the final selection,

1000
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,030
it’s still our first step

1001
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,290
towards becoming an Imperial Merchant.

1002
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,510
Your father’s wish

1003
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,120
is about to come true.

1004
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,630
Sometimes I think,

1005
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,620
if your father were still alive

1006
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,230
and saw you handling things on your own,

1007
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,570
grown up

1008
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,830
and getting married,

1009
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,990
he would be so pleased.

1010
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,270
Mother.

1011
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,290
I’ll stop talking now.

1012
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,270
Let's eat.

1013
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,220
Let's eat.

1014
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,450
Leave some for Se.

1015
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:23,950
Okay.

1016
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,770
You eat first, Mother.

1017
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,970
I’m old and talk too much.

1018
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,110
Son. Eat up.

1019
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,730
Go and check over there.

1020
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,030
I heard a sound.

1021
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,550
I heard it.

1022
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,470
Let's go.

1023
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,420
Ling Se, you Stingy Girl.

1024
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,930
If I had escaped,

1025
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,200
I wouldn’t have come back to save you.
