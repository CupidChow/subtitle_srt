00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,030
[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,870
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,690
Your Highness.

4
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,979
You found something new?

5
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,690
I found this in Xu Mansion.

6
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,190
[Agreement]

7
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,180
Sister, Brother-in-law,

8
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,010
I'm back.

9
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,890
How did it go?

10
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,600
How do you feel about the exam?

11
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,730
I think

12
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,370
the discourse on politics is a bit difficult.

13
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,210
But it's not difficult for me.

14
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,870
I answered all the questions.

15
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,350
Se,

16
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,910
I'm so hungry.

17
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,460
I could only eat pancakes there

18
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,520
every day.

19
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,970
Your sister bought you a lot of ingredients

20
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,320
early in the morning.

21
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,240
I promise you'll have a lot to eat.

22
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,160
Thank you, Se.

23
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,730
By the way, where is Wang Zhujue?

24
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,000
He was with me just now.

25
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,650
Look, he's there.

26
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,470
It's okay.

27
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,890
We all know

28
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,440
you've done your best.

29
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,300
Try harder next time.

30
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,950
I was just pretending!

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,420
I didn't expect myself

32
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,060
to be

33
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,530
full of inspiration.

34
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,400
I think after this,

35
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,200
I can be one step closer to Ping'er.

36
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,270
That's good.

37
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,420
I prepared a feast for you

38
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,200
in the Joy Game Shop.

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:06,900
Let's celebrate

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,760
the return of our two exam takers.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,470
Great!

42
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,380
Se, let's go.

43
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:10,900
Let's go.

44
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,360
Let's go.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,340
How did you perform in the exam?

46
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,870
Of course I performed well.

47
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,130
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

48
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,770
Thank you.

49
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,990
The second toast

50
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,420
is for Mr. Xu.

51
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,300
He'll participate in the competition of incense sticks for praying

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,500
at the sacrificial ceremony.

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,190
I hope he can win His Majesty's favor instantly

54
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,400
and have a promising future.

55
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,780
Thank you, Darling.

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,850
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

57
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,630
-Congratulations, Young Master.
-Cheers.

58
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,329
Bottoms up.

59
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,130
You drink as much as you like.

60
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,860
Drink more.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,300
Since everyone is here today,

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,540
why don't we play mahjong

63
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,240
after finishing the meal?

64
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,210
Sure.

65
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,790
Mr. Wu.

66
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,980
Why are you here?

67
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,580
I was just passing by.

68
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,400
I saw a sign of "Closed"

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,330
on the door.

70
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,660
I thought something happened,

71
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,060
so I came in to take a look.

72
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,660
Indeed, there is something.

73
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,970
Do you want to play mahjong? We still need one player.

74
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,500
Yes.

75
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,090
Okay, wait for me.

76
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,230
I'll play with you

77
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,970
after talking to Mr. Xu.

78
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,970
Come back soon.

79
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,490
Mr. Xu, you still have the mood

80
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,900
to play mahjong?

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,510
Just get to the point.

82
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,020
Looks like you still don't know.

83
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,890
The third master of the Xu family

84
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,460
accidentally fell into the water last night.

85
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,320
When they found him this morning,

86
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,750
his body was swollen.

87
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,200
Accidentally fell into the water?

88
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,540
How is that possible?

89
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,940
I just heard it from others.

90
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,390
I came to deliver my condolences.

91
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,920
I don't know anything else.

92
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,390
My condolences, Mr. Xu.

93
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,330
Young Master Xu, please.

94
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,460
Young Master Xu,

95
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,650
Old Master died so suddenly.

96
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,470
Look,

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,370
the whole mansion

98
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,780
is a mess.

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,950
Why don't you

100
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,080
sit here for a while?

101
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,850
I'm going to make you some tea.

102
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,450
I'm afraid

103
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,740
our service can't live up to your expectations.

104
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,340
It's okay.

105
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,740
Thank you.

106
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,990
Come! Search there!

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,700
He really hid it.

108
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,780
Have you taken care of the fire lances

109
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,140
in the warehouse?

110
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,500
Yes.

111
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,350
This old man

112
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,090
was so stupid.

113
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,030
I wanted to leave him a house

114
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,570
for the sake of his dignity.

115
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,700
But he played a trick first.

116
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,800
Burn it to ashes.

117
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,430
Yes.

118
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,190
Someone

119
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,000
came to this room before us.

120
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,059
Excuse me.

121
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,450
Y-Your Highness.

122
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,750
Didn't I ask you to guard the door?

123
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,230
It suddenly occurred to me

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,050
that there is something you want

125
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,490
in Third Master's room.

126
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,430
Are you sure?

127
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,640
I dare not lie to you.

128
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,280
Good.

129
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,110
I prefer

130
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,540
a loyal servant like you.

131
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,690
Lead the way.

132
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:02,970
Yes.

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,330
Please.

134
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,980
What's wrong?

135
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,470
Why do you look so pale?

136
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,150
Nothing.

137
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,530
I just feel a little dizzy.

138
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,460
If you feel dizzy,

139
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,620
go back and rest now.

140
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,950
Don't stand in the wind.

141
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,920
Promise me

142
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,150
not to go out these days, okay?

143
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,190
Why?

144
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,780
You've found a clue

145
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,640
about the guy who hurt you before?

146
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,300
No.

147
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,960
What's wrong with you today?

148
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,440
Nothing.

149
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,880
Why are you outside

150
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,520
at this hour?

151
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,440
I'm hungry, so I came out to get some food.

152
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,370
Okay. Well...

153
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,590
Go back to sleep as soon as you finish eating.

154
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,260
You rest early too.

155
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,520
Liufeng.

156
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,960
Your Highness.

157
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,540
Go find out

158
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,220
who visited

159
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,770
Xu Yushan's house tonight.

160
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,500
Yes.

161
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,980
Zilu,

162
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,630
stay away.

163
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,630
Let her go.

164
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,120
Stay away.

165
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,040
Let her go.

166
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,830
Zilu, stay away.

167
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,240
Stay away!

168
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,390
Ling Se.

169
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,950
Ling Se!

170
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,200
Ling Se!

171
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,640
Ling Se.

172
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,480
Ling Se.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,730
Young Madam!

174
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
Young Madam!

175
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,160
Young Madam!

176
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,890
Ling Se!

177
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,280
Ling Se!

178
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,710
Young Madam!

179
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,340
-Young Madam!
-Ling Se!

180
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,250
Young Master!

181
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,050
Young Master!

182
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,100
Young Master.

183
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,260
I've searched everywhere in Xu Mansion.

184
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,460
I didn't see Young Madam.

185
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,440
Neither did I.

186
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,140
I also searched Young Madam's shop.

187
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,860
The lights are off. No one is there.

188
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,540
Brother-in-law,

189
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,860
I also looked for her, but I couldn't find her.

190
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,410
You're useless!

191
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,380
Keep looking!

192
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,820
What's wrong?

193
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,370
You're all here at this hour.

194
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:10,740
What are you looking for?

195
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,470
Young Madam.

196
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,820
Se, where did you go?

197
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,220
Everyone was so worried.

198
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,770
Look how worried

199
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,180
my brother-in-law is.

200
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,760
Where did you go?

201
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,070
You looked unhappy,

202
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,150
so I went out to buy something for you.

203
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,220
Do you like it?

204
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,530
You left the mansion

205
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,340
on your own

206
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,480
just for this?

207
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,810
What's wrong?

208
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,830
Do you know how worried I was?

209
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,540
I just went out to buy something.

210
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,990
What's there to worry about?

211
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,980
What if

212
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,980
you were kidnapped?

213
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,800
What if

214
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,660
you ran into a bad guy?

215
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,580
What if

216
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,110
something happened to you?

217
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,780
What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,980
Why are you so fierce?

219
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,090
I went out to buy you flowers

220
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,550
because you were unhappy.

221
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,350
How could you treat me like this?

222
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,940
Se, don't be angry.

223
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,310
He acted like that

224
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,170
because he was worried about you.

225
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,850
Brother-in-law,

226
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,830
don't be angry.

227
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,590
Se did everything

228
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,940
for you.

229
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,810
Since she's back,

230
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,910
you can go back to sleep.

231
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,390
Yes, Young Master.

232
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,350
Yes.

233
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,380
I didn't expect this.

234
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,770
Mr. Xu actually asked me out today.

235
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,180
Is it because...

236
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,590
I saved you last time?

237
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,410
Of course not.

238
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,730
Look what this is.

239
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,570
Where did you get this drawing?

240
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,910
Tell me what it is.

241
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,930
This is a fire lance,

242
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,050
Qing State's secret weapon.

243
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,020
Ordinary people have no way of knowing about it.

244
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,220
Where exactly did you

245
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,810
get this drawing?

246
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,630
I drew it.

247
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,360
I saw it before.

248
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,730
Then...

249
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,510
Prince Xian took it away.

250
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,320
Prince Xian?

251
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,720
Did you see it clearly?

252
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,400
I'm 100% sure.

253
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,700
But I don't know

254
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,420
what Prince Xian has to do

255
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,410
with fire lances.

256
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:42,920
Lord Lyu,

257
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,680
this matter is very important.

258
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,040
You must investigate it thoroughly.

259
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,410
Don't

260
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:50,860
tell anyone else

261
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,560
about this.

262
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,410
Just pretend you don't know.

263
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,270
Mr. Xu, please.

264
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,080
Your Highness.

265
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,560
Mr. Xu.

266
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,390
Come and have a seat.

267
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,420
The incense I've been using these days

268
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,220
was all delivered from Linchun.

269
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,390
I'm quite satisfied.

270
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,420
Although there's no one playing qin today,

271
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,300
the incense

272
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,560
and the winter tea from Lingnan

273
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
are also a perfect match.

274
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:41,680
Here, try it.

275
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,360
Thank you, Your Highness.

276
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,690
Nice tea.

277
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,890
If you like it,

278
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,560
I'll deliver more to you some other day.

279
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,050
We have similar taste.

280
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,010
We should be on the same side.

281
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,000
After I marry the princess,

282
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,230
you and I

283
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,380
will be like family.

284
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,130
Would you like to do something different

285
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,430
with me in the future?

286
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,570
I'm just

287
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,710
a businessman

288
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,370
who does business honestly.

289
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,710
Mr. Xu, don't answer me so quickly.

290
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,990
Go back and think about it for a few more days.

291
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,560
I'll wait for your good news.

292
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:44,970
By the way,

293
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,960
I just heard

294
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,990
Yushan

295
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,940
passed away.

296
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,340
Mr. Xu,

297
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,750
don't be too sad.

298
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,500
I wonder

299
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,760
if you have visited his mansion

300
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,089
to mourn him.

301
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,210
It happened suddenly.

302
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,569
I haven't visited his mansion yet.

303
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,390
When you go there,

304
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,540
light an incense stick for him on my behalf

305
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,070
to express my condolences.

306
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,750
You're back.

307
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,470
Have you eaten?

308
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,460
I need to focus on making

309
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,060
incense sticks for praying these days.

310
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,120
So don't ask me to have meals with you.

311
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,650
Suit yourself.

312
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,730
Xu Zilu,

313
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,650
you stinky man.

314
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,000
If you don't want to eat, fine.

315
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,140
Listen,

316
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,670
I won't talk to you anymore.

317
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,710
Young Madam.

318
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,830
Young Madam,

319
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,670
you didn't eat anything for lunch.

320
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,800
You can't let yourself starve, right?

321
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,420
You've always been

322
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
with your young master, right?

323
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,020
Why did you suddenly come to deliver food to me?

324
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,190
Young Master wouldn't eat, drink,

325
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,560
or see anyone now.

326
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,600
He doesn't need me to serve him.

327
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,420
So I came here

328
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,690
to serve you.

329
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,900
Stop pretending to be miserable.

330
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,480
Listen,

331
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,260
he ignored me first.

332
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,660
That's why I ignored him.

333
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,700
Unless he comes

334
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,660
to apologize to me.

335
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,390
Otherwise, I won't talk to him.

336
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,230
Young Master is not in the mood.

337
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,300
He's worried about a lot of things now.

338
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:55,940
Since Third Master

339
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,960
was killed,

340
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,690
the Xu family's business

341
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,740
has got worse.

342
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,300
Wait.

343
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,790
What did you say? Third Uncle is dead?

344
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:03,830
No.

345
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,540
When did that happen?

346
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,740
Why didn't he tell me?

347
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,620
Young Madam,

348
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,890
Young Master didn't tell you

349
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,360
because he didn't want you to worry about him.

350
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,620
It's not Young Master's fault,

351
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,350
Young Madam.

352
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:18,970
I...

353
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:19,900
I...

354
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,260
Young Madam.

355
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,320
Young Master is in a bad mood now.

356
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,150
I saw him crying secretly.

357
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,530
But he is really worried

358
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,590
about your safety.

359
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,020
With all due respect,

360
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,080
Young Madam,

361
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,210
please don't be angry with Young Master anymore.

362
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,830
Go comfort him.

363
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,080
After all,

364
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,540
you're the only one

365
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,920
Young Master really cares about now.

366
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,320
Don't worry. I know.

367
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,690
Mr. Xu, why did you ask me here

368
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,450
at this hour?

369
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,760
I want to talk to you about something.

370
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,520
I think you've guessed it.

371
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,640
The sudden death of my third uncle

372
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,100
is Prince Xian's doing.

373
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,850
I heard a little about it.

374
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,000
But in my opinion,

375
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,950
this is the Xu family's business.

376
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,550
It has nothing to do with me.

377
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,450
Mr. Xu,

378
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,740
is this why

379
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,230
you asked me here?

380
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,710
I'll be frank with you.

381
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,790
In Third Uncle's mansion,

382
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,160
I saw a fire lance with my own eyes.

383
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,620
It was in the incense box

384
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,550
of the Xu family.

385
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,490
I think

386
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,260
Third Uncle was killed by Prince Xian

387
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,220
because he didn't want

388
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,350
to do the munition smuggling business

389
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,750
with Beiyun State.

390
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:37,900
So,

391
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,580
I want to fight against Prince Xian.

392
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,330
I wonder

393
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,970
if you are willing to help me.

394
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,710
Mr. Xu,

395
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,970
as you know,

396
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,970
I've always been a carefree man.

397
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,140
I don't want to get involved in these matters.

398
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,240
At this point,

399
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,770
I don't think

400
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,660
you can easily stay out of this.

401
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,640
Prince Xian needs a caravan

402
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,190
to cover up for smuggling munitions.

403
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,840
Now that Third Uncle is dead,

404
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,190
only the Wu family

405
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,720
can do the smuggling business

406
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,880
with Prince Xian

407
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,540
except the Xu family.

408
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,310
Mr. Xu, how do you know

409
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,510
I won't cooperate with Prince Xian?

410
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
The Wu family has taken root

411
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,500
in Furong City for years,

412
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,180
but Prince Xian used

413
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,610
Third Uncle's caravan to smuggle munitions.

414
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,400
I guess you don't want

415
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,300
to commit treason either, right?

416
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,640
You don't need

417
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,710
to flatter me.

418
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,130
A wise man submits to fate.

419
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,380
I have my own plan.

420
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,060
Since we've known

421
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,740
each other for so long,

422
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,440
let me remind you.

423
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,100
Prince Xian already knows you visited

424
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,900
Xu Yushan's mansion that night.

425
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,570
Wise up.

426
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,120
If I refuse

427
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,740
to collude with Prince Xian,

428
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,620
Prince Xian will never let me go easily.

429
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,730
Besides, he already knows

430
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,590
I visited Third Uncle's mansion.

431
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,140
This matter will definitely implicate the Xu family.

432
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,380
I can't let Ling Se

433
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,660
take the risk with me.

434
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,060
Zilu,

435
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,140
I made you nutritious soup.

436
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,250
Drink it while it's hot.

437
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,830
I'll... stay here with you for a while.

438
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,670
Don't worry.

439
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,120
I won't disturb you.

440
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,420
But do you want

441
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,350
-to drink the soup first?
-Ling Se.

442
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,660
You should go back to Linchun tomorrow.

443
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,290
I've asked Fuding to prepare a carriage.

444
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,170
He will send you back tomorrow.

445
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,300
Why?

446
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,620
Didn't we agree

447
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,750
to go back together?

448
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,420
Because I'm very busy.

449
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,180
I'm busy with the sacrificial ceremony

450
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,390
and the competition of incense sticks for praying.

451
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,340
I also need to deal with those officials.

452
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,350
You can't help me.

453
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,740
You'll only cause me trouble.

454
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,500
It's better that you go back in advance.

455
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,340
I've been busy

456
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
with the Joy Game Shop's matters.

457
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,470
I don't have time to cause you trouble.

458
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,660
So many people went to look for you yesterday.

459
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,790
Don't you think you caused us trouble?

460
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,570
You're driving me away

461
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,930
just because of what happened yesterday?

462
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
I'll ask someone

463
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,880
to take care of the Joy Game Shop.

464
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,280
You'll get your revenue.

465
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,800
Rest assured and go back.

466
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,340
Xu Zilu,

467
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,060
are you not thinking straight

468
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,320
because of what happened to Third Uncle?

469
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,100
I advise you to mind your words.

470
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,760
What's wrong with you lately?

471
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,700
We always discussed with each other

472
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,700
no matter what happened in the past.

473
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,930
It's fine that you didn't tell me about Third Uncle's death.

474
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,100
Now you even want to drive me away.

475
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,780
Do you treat me

476
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,660
as your wife?

477
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,670
No.

478
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,390
Xu Zilu, what did you say?

479
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,660
I said no.

480
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,100
You can't help me.

481
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,730
You'll only cause me trouble.

482
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,000
Just go back.

483
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,020
Spare some dignity

484
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,930
for both of us,

485
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,730
okay?

486
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:30,870
I won't leave.

487
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,540
You're not the Xu Zilu I know.

488
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,860
You're angry now.

489
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,180
I won't listen to you.

490
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:40,860
Fine.

491
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,140
You won't leave, right?

492
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,300
Choose between a consensual divorce or a repudiation letter.

493
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,720
From now on,

494
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,270
we are even.

495
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,570
No matter where you want to go,

496
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,520
it has nothing to do with me.

497
00:24:58,570 --> 00:24:59,830
A consensual divorce?

498
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,080
A repudiation letter?

499
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,200
Yes.

500
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,710
Xu Zilu,

501
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,300
you said you would spend the rest of your life with me

502
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,860
and wouldn't make me wronged anymore.

503
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,700
Do you want to break your promise?

504
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,540
Just let it go.

505
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:23,700
Fine.

506
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,110
You don't need to write a repudiation letter.

507
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,100
I'll leave myself.

508
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,760
Fuding.

509
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,460
Young Master.

510
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,380
Send someone to protect her.

511
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,830
Don't let her get hurt.

512
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,700
Yes.

513
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,530
I've never seen

514
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,870
Young Madam so sad like now.

515
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,510
The winter solstice sacrificial ceremony

516
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,510
will take place in a few days, right?

517
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,610
Mr. Wu, have you signed up

518
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,490
for the competition

519
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,220
of incense sticks for praying?

520
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,020
Yes.

521
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,110
The Wu family is a famous incense merchant

522
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,130
in Furong City.

523
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,060
It has also been an Imperial Merchant for generations.

524
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,990
I'm sure

525
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,840
you will win this time.

526
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,030
There have been many talents among the Imperial Merchants in recent years.

527
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,240
We don't know who will win.

528
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,500
Many talents?

529
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,420
I also found one.

530
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,430
Xu Zilu from Linchun City.

531
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,790
He is indeed talented

532
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:03,480
in making incense.

533
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,050
But what a pity.

534
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,810
What do you mean?

535
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,780
To become an Imperial Merchant,

536
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,810
[Agreement]

537
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,110
he actually played such a trick.

538
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,350
The crime of deceiving His Majesty

539
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,580
is not a child's play.

540
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,230
I'm afraid he'll be beheaded.

541
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,060
I heard that you have

542
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,740
business interactions with him.

543
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,860
I value your talent.

544
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,260
So I advise you

545
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,150
to cooperate with

546
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,510
someone else reliable.

547
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,780
Don't get implicated

548
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,860
or go astray.

549
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,130
Thank you for your advice, Your Highness.

550
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,010
Mr. Wu,

551
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,110
why are you here?

552
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,690
Since I left Linchun,

553
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,690
I've never had a chance

554
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,720
to drink your Aromatic Tea.

555
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,690
I wonder if I can

556
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,290
have another cup

557
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,990
of Everything You Want today.

558
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,630
Thank you for remembering.

559
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,610
Right.

560
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,230
Without this cup of tea,

561
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,380
we wouldn't have opened a shop together.

562
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,120
Gao Fushuai.

563
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,860
Bosslady.

564
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,940
Make a cup

565
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,050
of Everything You Want for Mr. Wu.

566
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,980
Okay, Bosslady.

567
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,340
Ms. Ling,

568
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,780
why do you look so sad?

569
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:51,860
I'm not.

570
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,310
I just...

571
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,710
miss

572
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,390
the days when I was in Linchun.

573
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,330
Without this shop,

574
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,090
I'm afraid I really would have gone back.

575
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,220
Why do you suddenly

576
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,710
want to go back to Linchun?

577
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,660
Did Xu Zilu quarrel with you?

578
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,960
Maybe he's not

579
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:14,980
in a good mood

580
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,730
because he's been busy with the incense

581
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,460
for the sacrificial ceremony.

582
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,760
How about this?

583
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,430
Let me send you home today.

584
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,130
Xu Zilu is a jealous man.

585
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,330
I'm sure he can't stand it.

586
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,130
After I leave,

587
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,070
he'll immediately beg you.

588
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,430
We'd better not.

589
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,340
Considering his temper,

590
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,890
I'm afraid he'll really get angry.

591
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,020
I dare not anger him.

592
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,160
You are still

593
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,780
thinking for him just like you did.

594
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,520
Yeah.

595
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,180
I really can't believe myself.

596
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,460
He treated me like that.

597
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,660
I've already cursed him

598
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,370
numerous times in my heart.

599
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:51,890
But I still can't help

600
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,910
thinking

601
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,210
of him.

602
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,020
Why did he

603
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,600
change suddenly?

604
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,890
If he really has changed,

605
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,040
I will give up.

606
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,820
I've been used to being alone

607
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,790
since I was a kid.

608
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,820
I don't believe I can't live

609
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,090
without him.

610
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,180
But I just don't understand.

611
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,710
I feel

612
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,020
that shouldn't be the way

613
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,950
he treats me.

614
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,770
Young Madam Xu,

615
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,460
you should go home now.

616
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,390
Xu Zilu drove you away

617
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,310
to protect you.

618
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,530
He has been targeted by Prince Xian.

619
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,330
But if Prince Xian wants to do it,

620
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,910
Xu Zilu won't have a chance to fight back.

621
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,190
He'll only die.

622
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,350
Why would Prince Xian do this?

623
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,450
After I returned to Linchun,

624
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,300
I secretly investigated Prince Xian

625
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,580
and learned something.

626
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,940
The third master of the Xu family

627
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,460
did smuggling business with Beiyun

628
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,190
under the order of Prince Xian.

629
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,780
Prince Xian is powerful.

630
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,910
He also came to me.

631
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,580
But

632
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,010
I'm just an unimportant Imperial Merchant.

633
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,640
I can't fight against him.

634
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,020
So I could only make excuses to fob him off.

635
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,000
Xu Zilu is an upright man.

636
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,180
He won't collude with Prince Xian.

637
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,120
I guess

638
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,000
Prince Xian has something on him.

639
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,600
Mr. Wu,

640
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,240
thank you for telling me this.

641
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,440
I'm going home first.

642
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:12,290
Interesting.

643
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:15,700
A marriage of convenience.

644
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,490
Tell us.

645
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,370
Who visited

646
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,730
Xu Yushan's study that night?

647
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,190
Tell us!

648
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,610
No one.

649
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,020
How many lives do you have?

650
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,190
How dare you lie to His Highness!

651
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:36,650
Tell us!

652
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,300
No one!

653
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,750
Your name is Ah You, right?

654
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,170
I'm impressed.

655
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,260
You're indeed a loyal servant.

656
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,020
You killed my master.

657
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:55,980
What do you expect me

658
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,120
to tell you?

659
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,490
I won't say anything even if you kill me!

660
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,670
Ah You,

661
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,390
don't worry.

662
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,950
After you die,

663
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,100
I will

664
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,230
take good care of your family members.

665
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,220
But I have one condition.

666
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,660
You have to tell me

667
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,400
if Xu Zilu

668
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,390
entered that room that night.

669
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,860
No.

670
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,230
Okay, I see.

671
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:34,680
Mr. Xu,

672
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,840
my patience is limited.

673
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,050
I sincerely

674
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,540
want to cooperate with you

675
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,790
because I think highly of you.

676
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:47,360
I understand.

677
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,810
But I want to know

678
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,940
what you want to

679
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,270
collaborate on with me.

680
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,860
You already visited

681
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,890
your third uncle's mansion, right?

682
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,140
I have a question.

683
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,100
What is the punishment of doing smuggling business with Beiyun State?

684
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,600
Punishment?

685
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,200
You want to threaten me?

686
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:25,930
You know what I mean.

687
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,880
So you mean

688
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,310
you don't want to work for me.

689
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,310
Am I right?

690
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,370
Xu Zilu,

691
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:38,460
do you know

692
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,350
you're giving up great wealth?

693
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,120
The way to true prosperity

694
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,000
is to value righteousness

695
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,630
over mere profits.

696
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:47,740
Currently, Qing

697
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,320
is at war with Beiyun State.

698
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,140
If I agree to cooperate with you,

699
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,800
everything I transport

700
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:53,900
will become weapons

701
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,710
used to hurt our own people.

702
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,660
I will never agree.

703
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,700
What a pity.

704
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,070
What a pity.

705
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,620
You are so smart,

706
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,200
but you can't be one of us.

707
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,440
Then we can only

708
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,429
be enemies.

709
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:13,210
As you know,

710
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,040
I'm an Imperial Merchant appointed by His Majesty.

711
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,040
It's not that easy to get rid of me

712
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,020
under the nose of His Majesty,

713
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,010
right?

714
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,489
Then let's wait and see.

715
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,730
I will make you realize

716
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,630
your cleverness

717
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,920
is nothing more than misguided self-confidence.

718
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,040
Xu Zilu!

719
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,280
Madam Xu.

720
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,260
Your Highness, you are here too.

721
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,010
I'm sorry.

722
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,429
I've said everything I should say.

723
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,989
Mr. Xu, think about it.

724
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,130
Goodbye.

725
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,230
Why did you come back?

726
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,880
Xu Zilu, quit acting tough.

727
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,460
What kind of person do you think I am?

728
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,990
You hid everything from me.

729
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,980
Aren't we husband and wife?

730
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,300
We should work together

731
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,750
and share weal and woe.

732
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,510
You know everything?

733
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,080
Mr. Wu told me everything.

734
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,720
This is a serious matter.

735
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,790
You might even lose your life.

736
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,290
You'll be in greater danger if you're with me.

737
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,160
Do you know that?

738
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,220
Aren't you afraid?

739
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,540
I am afraid.

740
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,170
But I'm more worried something might happen to you.

741
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:30,940
If anything happens to you,

742
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,670
how am I supposed to live alone?

743
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,860
So why don't we

744
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,480
face it together?

745
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,940
Xu Zilu,

746
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,180
you're the person I've chosen

747
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,770
for this life.

748
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,480
Even if it's a fire pit ahead,

749
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,480
I'm willing to jump into it with you.

750
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,500
So don't abandon me again.

751
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,680
Do you hear me?

752
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,600
Sorry.

753
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,320
Mr. Wu,

754
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,150
you're finally here.

755
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,310
I've been waiting for you.

756
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,200
Why did you

757
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,580
ask me here at this hour?

758
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,290
You tell him.

759
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,090
Here's the thing.

760
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:26,800
The competition

761
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,520
of incense sticks for praying

762
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,000
will take place tomorrow, right?

763
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,340
I don't think Prince Xian

764
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,890
will let the Xu family

765
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,610
win easily.

766
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,140
So we want to ask you for a favor.

767
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,260
What favor?

768
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:40,700
Here.

769
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,600
This

770
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,360
is the Xu family's incense.

771
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,580
Please help us

772
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,030
take it there tomorrow.

773
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,880
Ms. Ling,

774
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,160
you two

775
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,960
really don't treat me as an outsider.

776
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,850
We are good friends.

777
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,980
Fine.

778
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,410
Then you should do me a favor too.

779
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,340
What favor?

780
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,840
Make me a cup of Everything You Want.

781
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,360
I thought it was something else.

782
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,600
Mr. Wu, don't worry.

783
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,250
All your Aromatic Tea

784
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,210
will be on me from now on.

785
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,010
I'm going to make you one cup now.

786
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,200
Take a look

787
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,540
at my top-quality wine.

788
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,170
Nice wine.

789
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,660
Hot steamed buns.

790
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:34,920
Be careful!

791
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,090
My stall!

792
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,420
Zilu!

793
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,720
Take them down!

794
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:58,820
Hurry!

795
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,680
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

796
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,530
Se, leave now!

797
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:10,970
Okay.

798
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,300
We'll leave them to you.

799
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,280
Stay away!

800
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,510
Flying radishes!

801
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,490
No matter how cunning Prince Xian is,

802
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,090
he won't realize

803
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,550
that we have another plan.

804
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,910
Darling, you're smart.

805
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,350
Wait.

806
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,840
Who are you?

807
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,470
Sir,

808
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,970
we are here to participate

809
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:45,220
in the competition of incense sticks for praying.

810
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,630
Where is your incense?

811
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,260
Please wait a moment.

812
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,010
It will be delivered here soon.

813
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,940
He's here.

814
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,650
Sir.

815
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:57,610
This is the Wu family's incense.

816
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,070
What about our incense?

817
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,860
What incense?

818
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:07,890
You...

819
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,460
You promised to help us.

820
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,200
You want me to help you?

821
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,080
You guys are so naive.

822
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,190
How could you break your promise?

823
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,810
We are rivals.

824
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,760
Why would I promise to help you?

825
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:26,370
Come on. Let's go back to get the incense.

826
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,530
Wait.

827
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,010
Sir,

828
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,860
I have something important to report.

829
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,210
What is it?

830
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,660
To become an Imperial Merchant,

831
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,930
Xu Zilu signed a marriage agreement with Ling Se.

832
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,060
It's unforgivable.

833
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,950
Please investigate it.

834
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,300
[Agreement]
