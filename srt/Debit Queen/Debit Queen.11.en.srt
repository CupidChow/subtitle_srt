00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,030
[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,910
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,200
Yeniang!

4
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,150
It's you, Young Madam Xu.

5
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,190
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,150
Chef Hua.

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,600
I'm sorry too.

8
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,230
I mistook you as Liu Yeniang.

9
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,430
Well,

10
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,470
you're quite skilled in kung fu.

11
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,160
Well,

12
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,790
I'll go find Liu Yeniang now.

13
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,940
Get the carriage ready.

14
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,060
There's a fair at the East Market today.

15
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,920
Let's take a detour.

16
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,829
Don't miss the time.

17
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:25,890
Yes, Young Master.

18
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
Are you not sleeping at home again tonight?

19
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,130
Are you

20
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,090
staying with Bosslady again?

21
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,640
How many days will you be gone?

22
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,430
I don't know.

23
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,020
Are you upset?

24
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,330
No, I'm very happy.

25
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,020
I've asked someone

26
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,870
to help with Ping'er's matter.

27
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,470
I've already found someone

28
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,670
to help me with Ping'er's matter.

29
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,600
Don't you bother, Young Master Xu.

30
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,300
I have something to do.

31
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,870
Bye.

32
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,410
What are you doing?

33
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,500
Move. Let me out.

34
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,910
Hey, what do you mean?

35
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,320
Magistrate Wang told me

36
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,000
you've been

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,550
staking out the government office

38
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,350
at the gate every day these days.

39
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,670
It's none of your business.

40
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,470
It's not that I want to meddle in your business.

41
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,110
It's just Magistrate Wang said that

42
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,100
if you keep doing this,

43
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,210
you'll get arrested

44
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,340
for obstruction of justice.

45
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,590
That'll actually be nice.

46
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,630
That way, I can go keep Ping'er company

47
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,360
behind bars.

48
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,640
Have you ever thought that

49
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,240
you're actually doing Ping'er harm this way?

50
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,030
I'm already dealing with

51
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,220
Ping'er's matter.

52
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,830
Stop messing around.

53
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,320
Mess around?

54
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,530
I really can't get through to you!

55
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,300
Move!

56
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,150
You...

57
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,690
Step aside!

58
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,290
Xu Zilu!

59
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,070
Take Young Madam back to her room.

60
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,470
Yes.

61
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,290
You... You...

62
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,240
Don't...

63
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,170
Xu Zilu!

64
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,990
You know what? You're a bastard!

65
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:27,550
Don't you know

66
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,230
he's harboring a criminal in his house?

67
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,950
-Let's not come here. It's bad luck.
-Young Master.

68
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,630
Let's go. Let's go.

69
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,430
Young Master.

70
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,630
You're finally here.

71
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:34,790
Since yesterday,

72
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,390
we haven't sold any sachets.

73
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,360
Early this morning,

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,390
many people even came to return what they bought from us.

75
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,250
If this goes on,

76
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:40,920
this batch of sachets

77
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,990
will be unsalable.

78
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,270
Miss Ping'er

79
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,280
was only caught by the government for interrogation.

80
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,970
She's not convicted of anything yet.

81
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:48,990
Besides, the government

82
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,320
wouldn't disclose the merits of the case.

83
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,470
So who's been spreading the rumor

84
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,380
that Miss Ping'er is the murderer?

85
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,580
It should be the one who gave Ping'er up.

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,200
All right.

87
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,880
Go back to the mansion and keep an eye on Ling Se.

88
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,010
I'll go see someone.

89
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,720
Who?

90
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,280
Eighth Master Hong.

91
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,190
Young Master.

92
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,400
Eighth Master Hong is a street bully.

93
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,710
They say he's 3 meters tall

94
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,510
and fierce-looking.

95
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,930
He's not easy to deal with.

96
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,700
I heard

97
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,740
he's the best-informed man

98
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
in Linchun City.

99
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,280
As for the fugitive,

100
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,530
I should be able to

101
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,330
get some information from him.

102
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,130
Young Master.

103
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,310
That sounds dangerous to me.

104
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,570
How about I go with you?

105
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,120
Besides,

106
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,190
there are many servants

107
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,110
watching Young Madam.

108
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,790
I think there should be no problem.

109
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,790
Not necessarily.

110
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,320
Let's go.

111
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,590
Bosslady.

112
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,690
These buns were sent by Young Madam Xu.

113
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,409
She said the stuffing is very special,

114
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,470
and you must try it.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,810
Got it. Get back to work.

116
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,680
The stuffing is very special?

117
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,680
Let me see how special it is.

118
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,180
It's nothing special.

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,910
My stomach hurts.

120
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,310
I need to go to the toilet.

121
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,440
Young Madam.

122
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,770
You went to the toilet just 15 minutes ago.

123
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,590
Really?

124
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,080
I'll hold it in then.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Darling, you're back.

126
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,300
-Young Master?
-Young Master?

127
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,200
Young Madam.

128
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,510
You're making things difficult for us.

129
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,860
I was

130
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,760
testing

131
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,110
the responsiveness of the servants of the Xu Mansion just now.

132
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,710
You guys all did pretty well.

133
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,470
Keep it up.

134
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,630
Not bad.

135
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,530
I'm going to sleep.

136
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,370
You may leave.

137
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,470
Young Madam.

138
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,430
Young Master asked us

139
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,230
to keep you

140
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,030
in our sight

141
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,830
for 24 hours.

142
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,720
How can I sleep if you keep watching me like this?

143
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,080
Come here.

144
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,190
Go

145
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,230
clean up

146
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,030
the doorway later.

147
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,510
And there.

148
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,190
There too.

149
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:48,790
Yes.

150
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,190
Wait.

151
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,230
Didn't I ask you

152
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,890
to wait at Young Madam's door?

153
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,870
I need to go to the toilet.

154
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,390
Go.

155
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,070
Hurry back.

156
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,200
Let's go.

157
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,680
And there.

158
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,540
Well, well, well. Xu Zilu.

159
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,050
I'm telling you,

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,460
old dogs hunt the best.

161
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,540
You want to box me in just with a few servants?

162
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,470
Not a chance.

163
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,930
Young Madam.

164
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:29,100
While the devil climbs a post, the priest climbs ten.

165
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,570
Fuding.

166
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,650
How about I give you some tolls?

167
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,260
Young Madam.

168
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,870
This time, it can't be solved

169
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,010
with 5 copper coins.

170
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,450
If I let you go,

171
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
Young Master will definitely not let me go,

172
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,480
right?

173
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,140
Yeniang!

174
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,270
How did you think of that?

175
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,000
You put a note in one of the buns.

176
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,720
If I

177
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,590
gulped them down one after another,

178
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,850
how would I have known?

179
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,610
I knew

180
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,590
my dear Liu is smart.

181
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,990
I knew you'd understand what I meant.

182
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,430
Cut it out.

183
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,830
Why do you keep getting

184
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,550
locked up by your husband?

185
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,330
What kind of fetish

186
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,560
is that?

187
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,910
I'm not in the mood

188
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,340
to do anything with him, okay?

189
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,140
Ping'er has been

190
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,390
thrown in jail.

191
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,250
What's the use of being anxious?

192
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,650
She's already in prison.

193
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,020
You can't be

194
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,120
planning a jailbreak, right?

195
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,550
Even if I want to,

196
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,160
I need more men.

197
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,390
What do you mean?

198
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,630
I have to go see Eighth Master Hong

199
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,230
and borrow some men from him.

200
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,490
Eighth Master Hong?

201
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,050
Do you want to die?

202
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,540
Don't worry.

203
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,700
I'm an acquaintance

204
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,370
of Eighth Master Hong.

205
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,770
There won't be a problem.

206
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,990
Liu.

207
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,060
I have to go to your restaurant

208
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,990
and get changed.

209
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,110
Okay.

210
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,500
Then...

211
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,160
About him...

212
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,370
Get some sun.

213
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,380
Look at you.

214
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,790
I only asked you to do one thing, and you failed.

215
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,940
It's not like that, Young Master.

216
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,630
Young Madam has no martial ethics.

217
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,760
She sneaked up on me.

218
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,530
Young Master, you need to do me justice.

219
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,480
Why are you scolding me instead?

220
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,200
Enough.

221
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,880
Would Eighth Master Hong

222
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,310
really be in a place like this?

223
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:33,590
Yes.

224
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,410
I've already asked his relatives

225
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,210
about this.

226
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,630
Although this old man

227
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,350
is elusive,

228
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,110
he comes to this place

229
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,840
quite often.

230
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,710
We can definitely find him there.

231
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,240
Let's go.

232
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,040
Young Master, we're here.

233
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,640
It's here.

234
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,290
Here?

235
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,810
Yes, here.

236
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,450
This is it?

237
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,270
This is it.

238
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,590
It's been so long, yet you still didn't find anything.

239
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,420
Stop calling yourself

240
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,250
a member of the Hong Sect.

241
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,220
I, Eighth Master Hong, am  ashamed of you.

242
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,950
I've searched the whole city.

243
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,820
There's really no news whatsoever.

244
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,800
What about outside the city?

245
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,250
Use your brain.

246
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,820
I'm asking you, what about outside the city? Say something!

247
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,950
Eighth Master Hong?

248
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,470
What!

249
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,300
So

250
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,450
you're Eighth Master Hong?

251
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,460
Yes.

252
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,010
That's him.

253
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,660
So what brings you here,

254
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,620
Darling?

255
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,450
I'm here to get some news.

256
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,300
He said there's no news.

257
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
I'm leaving then.

258
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,760
Please, cut me a break.

259
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,510
When did your strategy of

260
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,670
"Fleeing is the best stratagem"

261
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,560
ever work?

262
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,130
I need to borrow Eighth Master Hong.

263
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,630
Okay.

264
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,370
Eighth Master Hong.

265
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,160
Young Madam?

266
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,590
I've been searching for a while.

267
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,010
I didn't expect that

268
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,190
the reputed Eighth Master Hong

269
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,450
is right in my mansion.

270
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,310
That's called talents in obscurity, right?

271
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,950
Well, I would say it's a bit exaggerated.

272
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,580
You know Nosy Parker.

273
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,650
He just likes

274
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,610
bluffing

275
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,630
and exaggerating.

276
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,220
So how did you

277
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,750
become Eighth Master Hong?

278
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,310
To be honest,

279
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,010
Eighth Master Hong

280
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,270
is just a vanity title.

281
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,990
The Hong Sect is actually

282
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,160
made up of

283
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,390
beggars and orphans.

284
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,470
I saw them begging

285
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,590
on the street.

286
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,550
Not only could they not get anything to eat,

287
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,710
but they also got beaten up.

288
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,890
I felt sorry for them.

289
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,820
That's why I founded the Hong Sect.

290
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,310
But why do I hear that

291
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,910
the Hong Sect has been

292
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,150
collecting protection fees everywhere?

293
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,720
That's nonsense.

294
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,790
What I've been collecting is the management fee,

295
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,190
and it was us stall vendors

296
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,590
who chipped in.

297
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,030
We're using part of it

298
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,710
to raise these orphans.

299
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,750
And the rest of it

300
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,190
is given to those beggars.

301
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,950
They wouldn't cause trouble

302
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,080
once they get money.

303
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,700
Instead,

304
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,630
they can chase away

305
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,630
those real thugs.

306
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,840
It does sound like something you'd do.

307
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,450
What about you? Why are you here?

308
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,450
To save Ping'er.

309
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,950
I heard that

310
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,990
Eighth Master Hong is well-informed,

311
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,390
so I thought I'd come and ask

312
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,030
if he knows something

313
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,630
about the real murderer.

314
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,850
So you really want to help me.

315
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,830
I misunderstood you before.

316
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,060
The way I expressed it before

317
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,250
was wrong.

318
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,180
I promised you

319
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,030
I wouldn't stand by and watch Ping'er suffer.

320
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,630
Trust me.

321
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,550
I trust you.

322
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,970
But what should we do now?

323
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,020
You came to ask Eighth Master Hong for information,

324
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,240
but this Eighth Master Hong in front of you

325
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,300
doesn't even know anything herself.

326
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,050
Let's go back first.

327
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,840
We need to take our time thinking about it.

328
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,830
Mr. Tao.

329
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,610
I’ve thought about it.

330
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,380
You and I are more compatible in business concept, Mr. Tao.

331
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,050
Therefore,

332
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,630
I think I should work with you

333
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,750
in sachet business, Mr. Tao.

334
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,650
That’s more like it.

335
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,530
From what I can see in your eyes,

336
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,970
you're the right person.

337
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,010
This is all for making money.

338
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,110
Mr. Tao, you are absolutely right.

339
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,240
Let’s do as we agreed

340
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,950
and split our profits 50/50, right?

341
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,790
Well, you didn't give me

342
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,050
a clear answer before,

343
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,030
so I talked to another cloth merchant.

344
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,150
What we agreed on is

345
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,430
we'll split it 30/70, and I'll get the 70.

346
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,270
No... But...

347
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,240
Only 30%?

348
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,600
Mr. Tao.

349
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,890
That's too little, don't you think?

350
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,340
But

351
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,680
I need a proper reason

352
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,030
to turn him down, right?

353
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,800
If you think

354
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,090
this is not a good deal,

355
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,430
then forget it.

356
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,740
After all, nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

357
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,300
Wait.

358
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,560
Fine.

359
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:21,800
I'll do it.

360
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,320
30/70 it is.

361
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,280
I knew you are magnanimous, Ling.

362
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,310
All right,

363
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,510
it's a deal.

364
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,120
[Announcement]

365
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,830
Let's go.

366
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,760
What does it say?

367
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,280
It says that the government

368
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,930
is prohibiting the people from leaving the city.

369
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,860
That means

370
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,810
the real murderer must still be here in Linchun.

371
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,150
It's actually good news

372
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,110
for us.

373
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,490
Chef Hua.

374
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,560
Young Madam Xu.

375
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,890
This must be Young Master Xu.

376
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,210
Are you going grocery shopping?

377
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,230
Yes.

378
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,230
I have to go.

379
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,190
See you.

380
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,470
Okay.

381
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,250
What's wrong?

382
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:14,860
Nothing.

383
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,630
Let's go.

384
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,150
[Fulai Inn]

385
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,380
I've asked Lord Wang.

386
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,070
The reason why Ping'er

387
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,330
is the most suspicious person now is that

388
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,510
she can't explain

389
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:32,990
her background clearly.

390
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,520
Besides,

391
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,120
she came to Linchun in July.

392
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,020
It happened to be the time of the crime.

393
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,880
Also, Lord Wang

394
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,590
has investigated

395
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,200
all the female out-of-towners who came here in July and August,

396
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,930
but he didn't find any suspect.

397
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,380
Not only that.

398
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,320
Counselor and some officers

399
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,590
came here to eat just now.

400
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,230
He said that he has interrogated

401
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,470
all the out-of-towners registered

402
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,390
this year.

403
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,740
He even

404
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,680
investigated everyone in

405
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,100
Wanhua House today,

406
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,630
despite the complexity of the flow of people there.

407
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,190
Look.

408
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,090
Lord Wang has been trying so hard,

409
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,370
but he still couldn't find the murderer.

410
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,820
How should we find him?

411
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,349
Stop worrying.

412
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,770
You still have to eat first.

413
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,190
Da.

414
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,599
Two bowls of shrimp wontons for this table.

415
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,200
All right.

416
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,619
Let's fill our bellies before getting down to business.

417
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,220
By the way,

418
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,440
the shrimp wontons here

419
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,069
are really delicious.

420
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,109
You haven't tried them, have you?

421
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,640
Chef Hua made them himself.

422
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,670
Hua has resigned and left.

423
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,310
He left?

424
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,819
It's all your fault.

425
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,280
If you hadn't mistaken him for me,

426
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,540
he wouldn't have left.

427
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,670
Young Master Xu, there's something you don't know.

428
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,950
Your dear wife

429
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,900
mistook the chef here

430
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,310
as me.

431
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,370
She made a fool of herself.

432
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,190
That night...

433
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,680
It was so dark that night,

434
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,490
and Chef Hua is so thin.

435
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,510
Besides, he wore his hair down.

436
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,150
I couldn't see clearly what he was wearing.

437
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,820
That's why I mistook him as you.

438
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,010
Besides, you two really look alike.

439
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,630
You also saw

440
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,690
Chef Hua today, right?

441
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,950
Don't they look alike?

442
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,630
-Boss!
-Young Master!

443
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,830
-Bad news!
-Bad news!

444
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,690
My news is more important.

445
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,420
You go first.

446
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,220
Zhu went to find Elder Liu,

447
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,260
but he got into a fight

448
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,260
with Tao's staff.

449
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,520
They got into a fight?

450
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Here's the thing.

451
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:10,810
Elder Liu set up a stall

452
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,530
in front of Tao's,

453
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,190
and he only blocked

454
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,370
their door by 0.33 meter.

455
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,150
However, Tao's staff overturned

456
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,510
Elder Liu's stall.

457
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,090
They even asked them for compensation.

458
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,190
Zhu couldn't stand it,

459
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,590
so he got into a fight with them.

460
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,040
They're still in front of that restaurant.

461
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,170
Let's go have a look.

462
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,380
Let's go, Boss.

463
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,390
Why are you going?

464
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,570
Something happened to us too.

465
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,170
What is it?

466
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,930
Manager Liu has something urgent to talk to you about.

467
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:32,060
Let's go.

468
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,420
You're a bunch of bullies.

469
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,250
Grandpa Liu has already apologized

470
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,830
to you.

471
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,400
He occupied Tao's territory.

472
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,350
Do you think a simple apology

473
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,610
can solve the problem?

474
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,580
Move! Move!

475
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,740
Are you okay?

476
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,360
We're okay.

477
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,870
You...

478
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,120
You guys are so insidious.

479
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,930
You guys are

480
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,860
bullying an old man.

481
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,260
What kind of people are you?

482
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:50,990
Cut the crap.

483
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:51,720
Attack them!

484
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,600
Attack them!

485
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,130
I'll beat you up!

486
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,060
Bao, beat them up!

487
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,950
Beat him!

488
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Beat him to death!

489
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,820
Which one of you is Eighth Master Hong?

490
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,750
How dare you make a scene in my territory!

491
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,290
Run!

492
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,530
Bao! Bao!

493
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,450
Come on!

494
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,880
Their boss is here. Run!

495
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,100
Do you want to die?

496
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,630
Where's Eighth Master Hong?

497
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,890
Eighth Master Hong...

498
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,880
She escaped.

499
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,670
Get up, servants!

500
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,290
Get up! Get up!

501
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,590
Go report this case to the government office with me.

502
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,810
-Let's go.
-Go away!

503
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,200
Young Master.

504
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,350
Master Ling sent someone here

505
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,960
to deliver the agreement of rescission,

506
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,630
saying the Xu family shall take full responsibility

507
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,600
for the termination of cooperation.

508
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,020
But I sent someone to ask about it.

509
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,310
Master Ling went to

510
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,100
see Mr. Tao right after that

511
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,100
to work with him in sachet business.

512
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,460
Let him be.

513
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,140
There are terms of compensation

514
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,890
in the agreement of rescission.

515
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,300
How could Master Ling

516
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,030
kick down the ladder like this?

517
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,060
How much does he want?

518
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,110
Just give him the compensation he wants.

519
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,190
But that request of compensation

520
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,170
is unreasonable even at first glance.

521
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,630
This will be the only time.

522
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,700
There's absolutely no way

523
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,100
we'll cooperate with him in the future

524
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,090
even if they want to.

525
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,030
Understood.

526
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,510
Young Master.

527
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,620
I've arranged everything.

528
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,410
Got it.

529
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,390
Go back and tell Mother that

530
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,940
I'm not coming back for dinner.

531
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,790
Okay.

532
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:29,420
Here.

533
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,830
Look at you.

534
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,790
I was busy saving Ping'er,

535
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,710
but you kept

536
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,430
causing me trouble.

537
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,490
You even got into a fight with others.

538
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,810
Now you're all independent and capable, aren't you?

539
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,420
If we hadn't escaped in time,

540
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,620
you would have all been arrested.

541
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,370
And you, Zhu.

542
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,750
Boss.

543
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,420
I'm sorry.

544
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,430
I caused trouble again.

545
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,350
Forget it.

546
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,110
I won't blame you

547
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,270
since you did it

548
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,170
for the sake of loyalty to your friends.

549
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,710
Eat up.

550
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:53,870
Boss!

551
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,750
Boss!

552
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,950
Boss!

553
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,030
Bad news!

554
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,030
Bad news!

555
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:58,970
Are you a crow?

556
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,050
You're always yelling "Bad news".

557
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,390
Has there ever been any good news from you?

558
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:01,850
Well...

559
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,140
It's really bad news this time.

560
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,160
That Tao Ziran

561
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,300
went to report this

562
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,280
to Magistrate Wang.

563
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,250
I heard from the government office that

564
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,990
after they finish dealing with the murderers,

565
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,790
they'll exterminate the Hong Sect.

566
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,000
How could Tao Ziran

567
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,100
play the victim and make us the villain?

568
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,430
Boss, what should we do?

569
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,890
How about we run away?

570
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,560
Why should we run away?

571
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,920
We didn't do anything wrong.

572
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,930
I have an idea.

573
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:23,910
Tao Ziran

574
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,750
wants to exterminate the Hong Sect, right?

575
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,520
We can beat him at his own game.

576
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,350
We can make use of his rage

577
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,950
and Magistrate Wang's men

578
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,590
to give him a taste of his own medicine.

579
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:44,030
[Midnight tomorrow at the corner of Xisi Street. You hit my men, and I'll take their revenge.]

580
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,230
"I'll take their revenge."

581
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,270
My Lord!

582
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,950
My Lord!

583
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:54,910
My Lord!

584
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,710
Sibing, you came at the right time.

585
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,910
Send this to the Ling Mansion.

586
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,370
My Lord.

587
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,570
Take a look at this first.

588
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,270
This is the letter of fight appointment

589
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,800
sent by Eighth Master Hong.

590
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,590
Midnight tomorrow at the corner of Xisi Street.

591
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,750
If you don't come...

592
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,290
You're a scoundrel.

593
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,140
Go inform Magistrate Wang about this,

594
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,350
and ask him to bring some men there

595
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,550
to take them all down.

596
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,450
Got it.

597
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,970
"You're a dog if you don't come."

598
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,070
"You're a dog if you don't come!"

599
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,870
"You're a dog if you don't come!"

600
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,830
I, Tao Ziran, has come as promised!

601
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,120
Eighth Master Hong!

602
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,290
You're a dog if you don't come!

603
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,470
Let’s see how much longer you can be so elated.

604
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,310
Mr. Tao.

605
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,560
How's it going?

606
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,910
They're showing the tail yet hiding the head.

607
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,440
Wait until I shout it again.

608
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,350
I, Tao Ziran, am here!

609
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,020
Bring it on if you don't admit defeat!

610
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,290
They're there!

611
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,640
Go after them!

612
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,900
Go after them!

613
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,370
Get ready.

614
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,430
Come on. Get ready.

615
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,780
Go after them!

616
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,170
Hurry!

617
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:33,970
Go after them!

618
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,510
Go after them!

619
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,860
Those bastards.

620
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,830
Look how dirty their tricks are.

621
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,430
Don't you let those bastards go.

622
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,150
Governor. My Lord.

623
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,120
We need more men.

624
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,150
You need more men?

625
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:57,670
Yes.

626
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,380
Over there!

627
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,000
Go after them!

628
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,110
Go after them!

629
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,590
Are you sure the murderer

630
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,130
will come back and steal the order to leave the city?

631
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,660
This is what you don't know.

632
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,450
The government is usually heavily guarded.

633
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,290
But recently,

634
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,560
the Tao Mansion and the Hong Sect

635
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,820
have been in conflict.

636
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,270
They'll definitely send someone out of town.

637
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,750
Tonight

638
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,670
is the best timing for him.

639
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,520
I asked Fuding

640
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,670
to arrange many servants

641
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,670
to patrol around.

642
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,450
Only this wall is not guarded.

643
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,850
Let's give him a taste of his own medicine.

644
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,560
Will it work?

645
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,700
Will he come?

646
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,930
He's coming!

647
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,980
You're amazing!

648
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,040
Let's go.

649
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,180
He's coming.

650
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,210
In a while...

651
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:22,620
You're Eighth Master Hong. How can you be like this?

652
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,640
I'm scared.

653
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,430
That's just a little thief. There's nothing to be scared of.

654
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,920
Perfect timing.

655
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:30,990
Be careful!

656
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,370
Zilu, are you okay?

657
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,630
How dare you hit him?

658
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,740
I'll kill you!

659
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,470
I'll kill you!

660
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,280
I'll beat you...

661
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,510
Don't run!

662
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,560
Are you okay?

663
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,350
I'm okay.

664
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,910
Are you okay?

665
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,500
I'm all right.

666
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,840
If you didn't pull me,

667
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,540
I would have beaten him to the ground with two punches.

668
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,200
Stop there!

669
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,920
Stop!

670
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,210
Stop! Don't run!

671
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,180
Stop!

672
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,230
Are you two okay?

673
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:10,890
We're okay.

674
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,690
What did that thief steal?

675
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,630
We haven't found out about it yet.

676
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,580
When we noticed it,

677
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,290
he just left the Archival Repository.

678
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,090
I have to go. Be careful, you two.

679
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,320
The Archival Repository?

680
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,730
What should we do now?

681
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,610
What else can we do?

682
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,090
Let's go back and wait.

683
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,860
But then all our efforts will be in vain, right?

684
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,360
Don't worry.

685
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,380
There's a fool

686
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,090
who comes in handy.

687
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,660
Just get to the point.

688
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,700
I have a class to attend.

689
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,870
Actually,

690
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,550
it's nothing.

691
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,450
Then why do you want to see me?

692
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,580
I'm afraid this does not bode well

693
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,100
for Miss Ping'er.

694
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,560
What happened to Ping'er?

695
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,920
Your father is convinced that

696
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,580
Ping'er is the real murderer,

697
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,320
and he's about to send her to the Ministry of Justice.

698
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,670
I'm afraid

699
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:08,870
Miss Ping'er

700
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,870
won't be able to bear the Ministry of Justice's punishments.

701
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,670
These days,

702
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,820
I've been so anxious that I almost went bald.

703
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,870
I've been going to the government office every day

704
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,100
to get the latest news.

705
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,880
I've been telling him

706
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,390
Ping'er is not the murderer,

707
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,740
but my father wouldn't believe it.

708
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
What should we do?

709
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,780
Actually, I have a plan

710
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,080
that may help us

711
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,540
save Miss Ping'er

712
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,840
and find the real murderer.

713
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,770
Tell me already.

714
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,410
That makes sense.

715
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,670
Right.

716
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,200
That's what I should do.

717
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,500
[Tao's Fragrance Shop]

718
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,040
It's you, Young Master Xu.

719
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,180
Business is bad,

720
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,820
and there's a mess in your household.

721
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,060
Yet you're still in the mood to hang out here?

722
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,390
You are so open-minded.

723
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,030
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Tao.

724
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,190
Your business is thriving,

725
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,390
but you still have time to care about me?

726
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,760
That's what I should do.

727
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,230
I've been busy these days,

728
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,640
and I haven't got the time.

729
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,350
Otherwise,

730
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,900
I would have thought of some solution for you.

731
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,120
Actually, I should thank you, Mr. Xu.

732
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,210
If the Xu family

733
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,290
didn't harbor the major criminal of that government case,

734
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,690
I wouldn't have got

735
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,410
so many orders.

736
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,250
It's almost the end of the year.

737
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:33,950
This...

738
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,030
This is almost more than I can handle.

739
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,480
Then I should

740
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,500
congratulate you, Mr. Tao.

741
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,170
Same to you.

742
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,220
Well,

743
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,520
it's almost the three-month deadline.

744
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,720
You should step it up.

745
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,980
If you lose,

746
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,170
it will be embarrassing.

747
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,900
Don't worry.

748
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,100
I always keep my word.

749
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,840
Even if I lose, I'm open and aboveboard.

750
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,210
But I'm almost afraid to ask

751
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,730
if you can win with peace of mind, Mr. Tao.

752
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,630
What do you mean?

753
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,310
Walls have ears.

754
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,920
Behave yourself.

755
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,080
Why did you run away right after bluffing?

756
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,060
What a poser.

757
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,520
You are the one who should behave yourself.

758
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,450
You and your whole family should behave yourselves!

759
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,160
Young Master, why are you here?

760
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,150
Counselor.

761
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,150
You've been working hard

762
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,850
with my father on all kinds of business lately,

763
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,260
so I brought you some snacks

764
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,520
for better nutrition.

765
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,480
It's so considerate of you, Young Master.

766
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
Thank you so much.

767
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,090
They say favors are a two-way street.

768
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:44,840
Since I'm so nice to you,

769
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,200
don't you think you should do something for me too?

770
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,950
Young Master Wang.

771
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,680
So this is what you meant.

772
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,830
Take these back.

773
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,670
I really can't tell you

774
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,070
about Miss Ping'er's matter.

775
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,790
No, no, no.

776
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,240
That's not what I meant.

777
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,030
I'm really not here

778
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,170
for Ping'er.

779
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,690
I'm here for my father.

780
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,520
My father has been so busy every day.

781
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,720
He must be exhausted.

782
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,270
I was wondering

783
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,440
if there's any way

784
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,120
I could help share his burden.

785
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,660
Lord Wang

786
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,760
has really been worried.

787
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,180
So many things went wrong lately.

788
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,190
You see,

789
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,510
some files in the Archival Repository

790
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,650
got stolen a few days ago.

791
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,750
Someone stole files from the Archival Repository?

792
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,220
Yes.

793
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,340
You wrote every letter in those files

794
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,420
by yourself, Counselor.

795
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,210
If caught, they must be severely punished.

796
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,910
Yes! They must be severely punished.

797
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,640
Young Master, you have no idea.

798
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,790
These days,

799
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:35,990
I can't even lift my arms

800
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,520
because of all the writing.

801
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,900
So which books did they steal?

802
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,650
The other books are not that important,

803
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:42,690
but among them,

804
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,200
there's a personnel record of Wanhua House.

805
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,080
A few days ago,

806
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,620
I just went to Wanhua House for interrogation.

807
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,250
A personnel record of Wanhua House?

808
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,870
Counselor.

809
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,030
Was there any girl

810
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,160
that impressed you?

811
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,830
They were indeed pretty.

812
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,630
Counselor.

813
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,760
I meant,

814
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,680
was there any young female out-of-towner

815
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,570
who came here in July or August?

816
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:06,980
A young female out-of-towner

817
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,250
who came here in July or August?

818
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,010
No.

819
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,850
Well, there was a cook

820
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,390
from Furong City.

821
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,300
But that cook is a man.

822
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,860
It can't be.

823
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:18,890
By the way,

824
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,840
Young Master,

825
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:21,440
why do you ask?

826
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,460
I'm just curious.

827
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,900
Are you trying to

828
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,850
meddle in Miss Ping'er's matter again?

829
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,750
His Lordship

830
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,200
warned you repeatedly

831
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,700
to stay out of it.

832
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,200
I can't tell you

833
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,880
anything more about it.

834
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,480
I almost fell into your trap.

835
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,010
Counselor.

836
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,990
You've already told me so much.

837
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,670
Just tell me one more thing.

838
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,330
No, I won't.

839
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,960
Counselor did tell me a lot,

840
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,110
but I didn't get the answer

841
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,480
for the most important question.

842
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,550
Now I only know

843
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,700
there's no female out-of-towner

844
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,130
in Wanhua House.

845
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,820
Since Young Master Wang found out that

846
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,940
what went missing was

847
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,900
a personnel record of Wanhua House,

848
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,950
I've been taking my men

849
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,210
to watch Wanhua House,

850
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,060
but I didn't spot

851
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,560
any suspicious girl.

852
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,190
Maybe

853
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,510
you missed something.

854
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,550
What's that?

855
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,510
Let's change our perspective.

856
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,170
What if that person's a man dressed like a woman?

857
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,100
A man dressed like a woman?

858
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,680
That's a bit ridiculous, don't you think?

859
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,410
Their figure and appearance would be different.

860
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,610
It's quite possible.

861
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,540
What Zilu said is very likely to be true.

862
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,750
Yesterday, we ran into a man

863
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,560
in front of the government office yesterday.

864
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,780
Now that I think about it,

865
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,780
his body shape

866
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,960
is indeed narrower than ordinary men.

867
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,470
Hey, don't you think

868
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,150
you're a bit too imaginative?

869
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,750
But Counselor did tell me

870
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,870
there was a chef in Wanhua House

871
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,950
from Furong City.

872
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,400
Liu Yeniang.

873
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,530
Has Chef Hua ever been to Wanhua House?

874
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,230
Yes.

875
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,920
You want to ask him about it?

876
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,520
You also suspect him?

877
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:48,530
Actually,

878
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,830
I started to suspect him last night.

879
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,950
His figure is one thing.

880
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,930
The other thing is that

881
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,100
there was a strong smell

882
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,960
of rouge on him.

883
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,290
That rouge fragrance

884
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,620
is exclusively provided for Wanhua House

885
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,830
by the Xu family.

886
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,350
Hold on. Hold on.

887
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,480
I still can't accept it.

888
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,050
That Hua Ruluan is a man?

889
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:09,270
I saw the portrait the Ministry of Justice of Furong City

890
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,370
gave my father with my own eyes.

891
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,770
It was obviously a woman.

892
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,930
That's why I said that's a man dressed like a woman.

893
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,240
I see.

894
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,510
No wonder I mistook him

895
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,410
as Liu Yeniang back in the inn.

896
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,570
He strangled

897
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,570
my throat at one go.

898
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,760
I wondered at that time

899
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,370
how could a cook

900
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,760
be so good at kung fu.

901
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,880
He must have been given away.

902
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:30,710
That's why

903
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,510
he stole Wanhua House's roster.

904
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,280
I saw him

905
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,550
at Liangyuan Pier today.

906
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,150
I thought he was weird.

907
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,200
Oh no.

908
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,180
Isn't there a cargo ship

909
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,050
leaving the city tonight from the pier?

910
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:43,630
Yes.

911
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,050
Judging by the time,

912
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,680
it's about to depart.

913
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:49,930
Let's go.

914
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,190
Wait.

915
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,480
Let me get this straight.

916
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,300
Chef Hua

917
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,640
disguised himself as a woman.

918
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,250
After Ling Se found out about it,

919
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,580
he went to Wanhua House,

920
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,840
and then stole the roster.

921
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:10,130
It turns out the direction of investigation was wrong.

922
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:13,060
No wonder my father couldn't find the real murderer.

923
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,780
Where are they?

924
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,940
They left a while ago.

925
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,780
They're gone?

926
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,750
Wait for me!

927
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,239
Luckily, we made it in time.

928
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,010
Let's not alert him.

929
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,520
Let's split into three groups

930
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,860
and encircle him.

931
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,550
Then...

932
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:42,670
Hua Ruluan!

933
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,630
What are you waiting for?

934
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,360
Go after him!

935
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,040
Whose friend is that?

936
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:56,340
Forget it.

937
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,139
Outflank him!

938
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:57,600
Okay.

939
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,470
Don't run!

940
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,870
Move!

941
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,330
What are you doing? Are you blind?

942
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,390
What are you doing?

943
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,230
Hua Ruluan, stop!

944
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,030
Don't run!

945
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,360
Hua Ruluan!

946
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,030
What are you doing?

947
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,510
Who are you

948
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,940
to catch me?

949
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,260
You... Don't run!

950
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,870
Stop!

951
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,200
Stop there!

952
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,750
Stop!

953
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,310
Stop!

954
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,200
Stop there!

955
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,510
That big brother can fly!

956
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,940
What's so great about being able to fly?

957
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,150
I'm even better.

958
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,670
That's my slingshot!
