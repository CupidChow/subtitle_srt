00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,009
[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,890
[Episode 20]

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,320
[Xu Mansion]

4
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,770
Welcome, Your Highness.

5
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,570
Please forgive me for not greeting you in advance.

6
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:48,789
Mr. Xu.

7
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,550
I didn't expect

8
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,160
we'd meet again so soon.

9
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,390
Your Highness.

10
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,080
There's no need to be overly courteous, Your Grace.

11
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,870
These are

12
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,950
my friends in Linchun City

13
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,140
that I talked to you about yesterday.

14
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,590
So you are the ones

15
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,830
who took care of Her Grace in Linchun City.

16
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,630
I hereby

17
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,430
express my gratitude to you.

18
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,970
After Her Grace went missing,

19
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,300
I've been worried about her day and night.

20
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,870
Now, Her Grace came back to me

21
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,950
safe and sound.

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,430
It's all thanks to you.

23
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:26,930
Your Grace.

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,120
You haven't told them

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,240
about our engagement, have you?

26
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,270
I...

27
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,320
I haven't even told them

28
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,450
that I'm a princess.

29
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,540
Of course I wouldn't tell them that.

30
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,340
You're thoughtful, Your Grace.

31
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,860
Actually, to be honest with you,

32
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,150
Her Grace and I

33
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,160
have been engaged for a long time.

34
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,190
Ping'er.

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,960
You are already engaged?

36
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,340
I...

37
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,680
Who's this?

38
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,070
This is a friend of mine from Linchun,

39
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,800
Wang Zhujue.

40
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,950
He's here for the exam.

41
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,580
It seems Mr. Wang here

42
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,350
doesn't know the rules.

43
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,830
How can you call Her Grace

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,590
by her maiden name?

45
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,290
I'm used to it.

46
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,240
Your Highness.

47
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,070
It's because I asked them to call me that.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,660
Your Highness.

49
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,380
Why don't you sit down

50
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,079
and have some tea first?

51
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,030
No need.

52
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm only here to pick Her Grace up

53
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,590
and take her back to the Marquis Mansion.

54
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,610
I still have something important

55
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,800
to discuss with Marquis Wei later.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,610
I'll come visit you another day.

57
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,790
Your Grace.

58
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,980
I'll go back today.

59
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,240
See you, Your Highness.

60
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,890
Greetings, Your Highness.

61
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,750
Your Lordship.

62
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,240
Please have a seat, Your Highness.

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,730
Please.

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,570
Please.

65
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,040
I was discussing the sacrificial ceremony

66
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,370
with Grand Commandant,

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,710
so I'm back a bit late.

68
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,510
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

69
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,110
It's okay.

70
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,340
I just arrived too.

71
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,269
I also picked Her Grace up on the way.

72
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,279
I thought since we were going to discuss the marriage,

73
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,680
Her Grace should be here.

74
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,589
Yes.

75
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,680
I ordered a fortune-teller to do another reading.

76
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,450
After the sacrificial ceremony,

77
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,340
it's an auspicious day.

78
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,380
You're really thoughtful, Your Highness.

79
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,560
But since marriage is such an important life event,

80
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,330
of course we should take it seriously.

81
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,170
As for the wedding date, I think

82
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,470
we should wait

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,130
until I go back and

84
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,680
set a date with her mother and uncle

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,880
through discussion.

86
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,710
After that, I'll come to...

87
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,710
What do you think?

88
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,670
Discussion...

89
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,260
Of course that's necessary.

90
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,860
However, Your Lordship,

91
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,230
my love for Her Grace

92
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,810
is sincere and clear.

93
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,940
Therefore, I'll forgive and forget

94
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,350
that Her Grace bailed on me at our wedding before.

95
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,570
But if

96
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,310
anything goes wrong again this time...

97
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,200
No, it won't.

98
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,830
At that time,

99
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,800
Ping'er was young and immature.

100
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,080
Please don't take it to heart, Your Highness.

101
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,310
Don't worry, Your Lordship.

102
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Her Grace was young and playful.

103
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,750
How could I blame her?

104
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,720
Is it sweet?

105
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,630
It's sour.

106
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,900
Then eat all of it.

107
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,790
I was lying. It's sweet.

108
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,610
Try it.

109
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,800
Can't you two

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,909
be a bit observant?

111
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,860
Why do you have to rub salt into my wound?

112
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,050
I... I...

113
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,550
I can't watch it anymore.

114
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,440
Weren't you quite confident this afternoon?

115
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,260
"It's just Prince Xian. What's to be afraid of?"

116
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,920
Didn't you say that yourself?

117
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,790
I was just bluffing.

118
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,520
What do you think I should do?

119
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,280
Will I never

120
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,370
see Ping'er again?

121
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,710
Ping'er only went home. It's not like she became a nun.

122
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,710
If you want to see her,

123
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,630
just go see her.

124
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,390
Or,

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,030
you can ask her to come see you at the Xu Mansion.

126
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,950
Right.

127
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,530
I can go see her.

128
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,180
I won't stay here

129
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,320
and watch you two being lovey-dovey any longer.

130
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,580
I'll go back and study.

131
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,220
If I fall behind in my studies,

132
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,480
Ping'er will be angry.

133
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,150
I'll go see her first thing tomorrow morning.

134
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,330
Look at him.

135
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,159
He's quite pitiful.

136
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,730
What should we do

137
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,010
about Ping'er and him?

138
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,390
Wu Qi talked to me

139
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,890
about the situation in Furong.

140
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,570
It was all about Prince Xian.

141
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,420
After spending time with

142
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,750
Prince Xian these days,

143
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,730
I finally realized the ramifications of it.

144
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,270
If Prince Xian doesn't budge,

145
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,330
it's almost impossible for Ping'er

146
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,460
to break off the engagement with him.

147
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,530
But even if he is Prince Xian,

148
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,440
Ping'er is a princess herself.

149
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,040
It's exactly because they're well-matched

150
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,110
that this matter

151
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,790
is even harder to deal with.

152
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,500
So... What should we do?

153
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,909
[Marquis Wei's Mansion]

154
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,490
Did Her Grace agree to see me?

155
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,310
Young Master.

156
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,870
Please go back.

157
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,190
His Lordship said

158
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,270
Her Grace is waiting to be wedded.

159
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,070
She doesn't know any young master out there.

160
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,270
How is that possible?

161
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:49,200
Her Grace and I know each other.

162
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,930
We are... We're friends.

163
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,970
If His Lordship says she doesn't know you,

164
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,430
then she must not know you.

165
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,840
You might have mistaken her for someone else.

166
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,640
His Lordship is magnanimous.

167
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,000
He won't pursue this matter any further.

168
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,960
But if you come trouble us again,

169
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,290
we'll report it to the government office.

170
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,450
Why don't you let me in?

171
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,150
I'm really friends with her.

172
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,380
[Xu Mansion]

173
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,450
Ping'er.

174
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,470
Ping'er.

175
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,549
Why is it you?

176
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,070
Wang.

177
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,390
Eat something.

178
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,950
I haven't seen Ping'er for two days.

179
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,010
I have no appetite.

180
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,530
You still have to eat something.

181
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,150
Get up.

182
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,430
It's not like when you were in Linchun,

183
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,300
you could see her

184
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,090
every day.

185
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,000
That's different.

186
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,530
When I went to the Wei Mansion today,

187
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,130
they wouldn't even let me in.

188
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,430
They said

189
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,780
we don't know each other at all.

190
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,480
We've known each other for so long.

191
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,910
How could they

192
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,730
identify us as strangers just like that?

193
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,630
Did they really say that?

194
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,050
What should you do?

195
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,550
I can only miss her by looking at this for now.

196
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,590
Wang.

197
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,200
Act normal, please.

198
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,160
Eat first.

199
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,630
Come on.

200
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,120
After dinner,

201
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,760
I have some good news for you.

202
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,310
Good news?

203
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,590
Good news.

204
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,320
Se said

205
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,330
she’s going to see Ping’er in the next couple of days.

206
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,500
Even if you can't see her,

207
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,360
you can ask Se

208
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,550
to help you give her a message.

209
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,280
Ling Se is going to see Ping'er?

210
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,970
I'll go see her now.

211
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,420
Wang.

212
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,920
Wang, have some more.

213
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,030
[Marquis Wei's Mansion]

214
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,240
Ping'er.

215
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,630
I didn't expect you

216
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,420
to be so good at playing games.

217
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,640
I almost lost.

218
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,210
Why aren't you smiling?

219
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,630
Se.

220
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,720
Be careful

221
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,680
on your way back.

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,190
Your dear Wang

223
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,340
asked me to say hello to you.

224
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,940
I couldn't tell you in there.

225
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,710
Also,

226
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,460
he has a lot to say to you.

227
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,910
I found it too cheesy,

228
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,340
so I asked him to write it down.

229
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,600
I can't read it anyway.

230
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,750
Thank you, Se.

231
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,030
Please tell Wang that

232
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,030
I've received it.

233
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,470
Actually,

234
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,720
I prepared a note

235
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,530
for Wang too.

236
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,830
I've been waiting to give it to you

237
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,630
when you come.

238
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,020
Rest assured.

239
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,420
I'll make sure he gets it.

240
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,460
You have no idea.

241
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,140
He's been so depressed these days.

242
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,130
This note

243
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,820
will definitely cheer him up.

244
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,670
But you guys can't

245
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,750
keep passing notes to each other

246
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,590
like this.

247
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,470
You still have to meet in person.

248
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,110
Se.

249
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,540
It's not my grandfather

250
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,340
who forbids me from seeing Wang.

251
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,630
It's Prince Xian.

252
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,690
He has many people

253
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,850
watching me at the gate of our mansion.

254
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,590
I can still see you,

255
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,880
but I'm afraid it'll be very hard

256
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,510
for me to see Wang.

257
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,800
Don't worry.

258
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,280
From now on,

259
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,830
I'll pass notes for you two.

260
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,620
How about this?

261
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,190
Ling Se.

262
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,250
I can't wait any longer.

263
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,280
Just tell me

264
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,120
whether I can

265
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,210
see Ping'er or not.

266
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,550
Should I put this here...

267
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,830
Just tell me.

268
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,960
I asked you

269
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,350
to wait for news at home.

270
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,320
Now that you came to my shop,

271
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,050
you need to give me some advice.

272
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,070
On what?

273
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,460
Help me think

274
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,360
what I should sell

275
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,750
in my shop.

276
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,920
I'm not in the mood to think about this.

277
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,600
How about

278
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,040
you tell me

279
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,970
Ping'er's news first?

280
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,550
And then,

281
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,110
I'll help you think about it carefully.

282
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,790
Okay?

283
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,390
Fine. Fine.

284
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,790
It's only because you look pitiful.

285
00:11:59,230 --> 00:11:59,750
Look.

286
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,100
What is this?

287
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,350
Is this

288
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,150
from Ping'er?

289
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,900
Don't worry.

290
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,570
Ping'er is doing well.

291
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,010
It's just that

292
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,770
it's inconvenient for her to see you now that she's living in the mansion.

293
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,190
From now on, if you have something to say to her,

294
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,020
just write it down and give it to me.

295
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,220
I'll pass it to her for you.

296
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,910
Okay.

297
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,590
As long as Ping'er is doing well,

298
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,150
and as long as she still thinks about me,

299
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,550
everything will be fine.

300
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,960
Alright, Young Master Wang.

301
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,920
In a few days,

302
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,870
I'll find an excuse

303
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,930
to ask Ping'er out.

304
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,000
Then you two can meet at home.

305
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,150
Really?

306
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,590
That's great.

307
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,670
Ling Se.

308
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,110
You're doing me such a big favor.

309
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,240
Let me kowtow to you.

310
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,670
Don't do that. I can't accept it.

311
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,060
If you want to thank me,

312
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,190
help me think

313
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,200
what I should sell here in this shop.

314
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,990
But

315
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,270
I've never opened a shop before.

316
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,670
I really don't know anything about it.

317
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,310
But

318
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,410
there are many students

319
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,210
coming and going on this street.

320
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,840
As for bookstores alone, there are two.

321
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,870
Let me think.

322
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,680
Other than studying,

323
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,740
all students care about is eating and drinking.

324
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,140
But there's already enough catering service on this street.

325
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,270
If Ping'er and I

326
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,050
could have somewhere to go to play games,

327
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,180
that would be great.

328
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,260
Play games?

329
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,300
That's a great idea.

330
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,150
[Yushan Perfume Shop]

331
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,260
Miss, please pay your bill here.

332
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,030
Okay.

333
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,640
Young Master, are you here to buy incense?

334
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,470
Please have a look.

335
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,550
The seasonal incenses in our shop

336
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,940
are Auspicious Snow Incense and Refreshing Incense.

337
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,200
They've both come out.

338
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,600
You look like an extraordinary man, Young Master.

339
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,430
The Spirit-worshipping Incense and White-admiring Incense

340
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,430
suit you so well that it's like they're

341
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,560
customized for you.

342
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,090
If you're buying for a girl,

343
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,700
I recommend the Lotus Incense and the Jade Incense.

344
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,630
Girls love the smell of them.

345
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,370
How much is the incense?

346
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,290
Two taels of silver per box.

347
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,550
Two taels?

348
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,820
Are you selling incense or robbing money?

349
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,080
This is the level

350
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
of business we do.

351
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,460
If you think it's too expensive,

352
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,200
there are many stalls that sell incense for 3 or 5 coins

353
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,340
on the street.

354
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,840
What's with the arguing?

355
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,310
Young Master.

356
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,080
Mr. Luo.

357
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,010
It's been a year since we last met.

358
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,420
You truly look radiant.

359
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,560
Young Master is here.

360
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,080
Why didn't you inform me?

361
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,230
I... I didn't recognize him.

362
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,690
Third Uncle changed the name of the shop

363
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,650
to his name.

364
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,570
Isn't it understandable that

365
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,280
the shop boys don't know me?

366
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,450
Young Master, don't say that.

367
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,380
We're living off the Xu family,

368
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,770
and of course, the shop we're managing belongs to the Xu family.

369
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,650
You're the owner of the Xu family's shop.

370
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,620
Even if we are as blind as a bat,

371
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,550
we would recognize you.

372
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,390
Did Manager Wan tell you

373
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,590
when he came here that

374
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,890
Third Uncle is no longer a member of the Xu family?

375
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,160
He... He did.

376
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,890
So why didn't you cooperate

377
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,040
when he came to claim the shop?

378
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,510
Young Master.

379
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,630
Third Master

380
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,480
was right here in the shop at that time.

381
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,830
We wanted to cooperate,

382
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,110
but we didn't dare go against him.

383
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,910
My heart

384
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,810
is loyal to the Xu family.

385
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,310
Loyal to the Xu family?

386
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,530
How can you prove that?

387
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Young Master, please wait a moment.

388
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,240
Here are the title deed, ledger,

389
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:44,750
and inventory details of the incense shop.

390
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,880
Everything is here.

391
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,340
Please take them all, Young Master.

392
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,370
You could have done this earlier.

393
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,160
Do I have to

394
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,320
come here in person?

395
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:06,260
[Xu's Incense Shop]

396
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:14,990
Young Master,

397
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,990
why don't you go in and have some tea?

398
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,600
I'll ask the kitchen

399
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,130
to cook some dishes for you.

400
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,340
Mr. Luo.

401
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,640
I have something else to do.

402
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,280
Okay.

403
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,830
If you have the time,

404
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,640
you might as well teach your subordinates

405
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,360
how to do service work right.

406
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,830
Yes.

407
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,410
You're absolutely right, Young Master.

408
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,080
Smell it.

409
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,190
This incense smells familiar.

410
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,790
It smells like Xu's incense,

411
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,380
but meanwhile, it smells a bit strange.

412
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,090
After smelling it for a while, it's a bit astringent.

413
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,950
Xu's

414
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,790
can never formulate such an incense.

415
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,310
Young Master.

416
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,550
You mean

417
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,070
there's something fishier in here?

418
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,070
This incense used

419
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,770
a total of 10 ingredients.

420
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,680
Nine of them

421
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,970
are in Xu's inventory.

422
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,609
But the last one

423
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,800
can't be found in the entire territory of Qing.

424
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,750
Young Master.

425
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,730
You mean...

426
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,630
I wonder

427
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,270
where Third Uncle got

428
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,079
this ingredient that only grows in Beiyun.

429
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,270
Go and check

430
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,510
who Third Uncle

431
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,190
has been friendly with recently.

432
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,670
Okay, I'm on it.

433
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,730
My Lord.

434
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,380
There's a message from Prince Xian,

435
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,420
asking you to hurry up and deliver the goods

436
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,480
to the other party.

437
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,310
This batch of goods needs urgent shipment.

438
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,710
I'm afraid we're short-handed.

439
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,990
Recruit more men

440
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,110
for the warehouse first.

441
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,590
Yes.

442
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,900
[Xu Mansion]

443
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,290
We agreed to meet here at this time.

444
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,550
Why isn't she here yet?

445
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,770
Ping'er!

446
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,350
Your Highness, Your Grace. Greetings.

447
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,610
No need to be overly courteous.

448
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,010
I happen to be free today,

449
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,070
so I thought I'd get some fresh air

450
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,400
out here with Her Grace.

451
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,910
We didn't have the chance to get to know each other better last time.

452
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,550
Today,

453
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,610
I brought some gifts.

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,040
Think of it as me making up for the welcome gifts last time.

455
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

456
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,610
Please come in.

457
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,340
Okay.

458
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,690
Your Grace.

459
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,290
Why is Prince Xian here too?

460
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,420
He has been following me.

461
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,110
We didn't know you'd come today,

462
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,970
Your Highness,

463
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,190
so the family banquet was prepared a bit hastily.

464
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,390
Your Highness, please take no offense.

465
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,970
You're too kind, Mr. Xu.

466
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,370
This table of delicacies is good enough.

467
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,770
I only get to enjoy this kind of cuisine

468
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,300
since I came with Her Grace.

469
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,670
As long as Her Grace is happy,

470
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,650
I'm happy.

471
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,770
I heard a lot about Madam Xu from Her Grace,

472
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,680
saying you are as close as sisters.

473
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,250
So why don't you change seats with him

474
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,600
and sit next to Her Grace

475
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,670
so that you can talk to her better?

476
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,190
Your Highness, there's something you don't know.

477
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,200
My husband and I love each other very much.

478
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,810
If we don't sit together

479
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,720
at dinner,

480
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,280
I'll lose my appetite.

481
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,950
You two

482
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,920
really love each other deeply.

483
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,980
I wonder what ranking

484
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,790
Candidate Wang got in this Provincial Examination.

485
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,430
I...

486
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,020
I was

487
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
supposed to fail.

488
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,780
I barely made the list

489
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,090
and only took last place

490
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,350
because I got guidance

491
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,500
from a master before the exam.

492
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,520
But being the last on the list now

493
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,180
doesn't necessarily mean

494
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,510
I'll always be the last.

495
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,380
By the time of the Metropolitan Examination,

496
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,580
perhaps my ranking

497
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,740
will be really high.

498
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,440
Even the person who gets first place in the Provincial Examination

499
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,570
may not be able to get a government job.

500
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,220
You are quite confident

501
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,820
as the last one.

502
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,920
I admire you.

503
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,610
Your Highness.

504
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,430
The early bird catches the worm, and diligence can make up for lack of intelligence.

505
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,950
With such ambition,

506
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,450
Wang's dream may actually come true,

507
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,340
right?

508
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,110
Then I wish you

509
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:55,230
pass the exam with a high ranking, Candidate Wang.

510
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,190
Thank you, Your Highness.

511
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,120
You're welcome.

512
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,480
You're Her Grace's friend.

513
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,150
I'm supposed to be nice to you.

514
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,050
How about this?

515
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,620
When Candidate Wang

516
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,270
becomes the Number One Scholar,

517
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,400
I will arrange a good marriage for you.

518
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,540
I remember Assistant Minister Liu

519
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,630
has a daughter who's not yet married.

520
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
She's a good match

521
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,480
for you, Candidate Wang.

522
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,430
Your Highness, you flatter me.

523
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,140
My biggest strength

524
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,070
is that I know my place.

525
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,070
I won't make

526
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,000
the Number One Scholar.

527
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,110
And some assistant minister's daughter

528
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,370
is way out of my league.

529
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,190
Besides,

530
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,540
I already have someone in my heart.

531
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,680
You haven't achieved anything in your career,

532
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,080
yet you already have someone in your heart.

533
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,430
Candidate Wang.

534
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,260
So what you care about is not career,

535
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,460
but romance.

536
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,750
I wonder which family

537
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,200
that charming girl comes from.

538
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,900
We were too busy talking.

539
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,230
The dishes are getting cold.

540
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,680
Please, Your Highness.

541
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,590
Please.

542
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
Here, Your Grace.

543
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,730
Thank you, Your Highness.

544
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,090
This shrimp was for Her Grace.

545
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:18,970
Sorry.

546
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,710
I've been studying too much lately.

547
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,970
I've got bad eyesight.

548
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,540
I really thought it was for me, Your Highness.

549
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,790
How dare you!

550
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,920
Please forgive him, Your Highness.

551
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,360
Wang didn't mean it.

552
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,280
Please don't blame him, Your Highness.

553
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,320
We're in the middle of eating.

554
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,230
Why did you all stand up?

555
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,150
Come on. Sit down.

556
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,910
Sit.

557
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,890
But

558
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,100
I do have something to make clear.

559
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,000
Back when you were in Linchun,

560
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,360
you didn't know Her Grace's identity.

561
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,910
No matter how you treated each other,

562
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,590
as the saying goes, those who don't know are innocent.

563
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,980
So, whatever happened will not be pursued.

564
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,190
But now, we're in Furong City,

565
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,170
and Her Grace is Marquis Wei's granddaughter.

566
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,090
She will also be my wife, Princess Xian, in the future.

567
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,820
So, please remember

568
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,950
your etiquette.

569
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,030
I won't pursue it

570
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,170
because I have a big heart.

571
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,800
But if this gets out,

572
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,990
it'll be embarrassing.

573
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,510
You're right, Your Highness.

574
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,190
We all got that.

575
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,880
It's an honor for the Xu Mansion

576
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,010
to have you here today, Your Highness.

577
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,240
I heard that you're good at

578
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,650
all the Four Arts, namely zither, Go, calligraphy, and painting, Your Highness.

579
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,490
I wonder

580
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,120
if I may have the honor to see that today.

581
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,120
Yes.

582
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,800
I've heard it before in Linchun

583
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,190
about how talented you are, Your Highness.

584
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,320
I really want to see it with my own eyes.

585
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,150
Did Her Grace mention this to you

586
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,900
yesterday?

587
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:04,980
Yes...

588
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,710
Yes.

589
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,020
In that case,

590
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,080
I won't let

591
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,050
Her Grace down,

592
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,440
and I won't let Her Grace lose face.

593
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,300
How about this? Let's eat first.

594
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,420
I'll play a song after dinner.

595
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,170
It's indeed my honor

596
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,450
to be able to hear a song

597
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,210
played by you, Your Highness.

598
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,550
Come on, Mr. Xu, Madam Xu.

599
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,610
To you, Your Highness.

600
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

601
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
Find a way

602
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,010
to let Ping'er

603
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,290
see Wang Zhujue alone.

604
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,050
You're really good at giving me challenges.

605
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,980
This family banquet was supposed to be

606
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,080
a chance for them to see each other.

607
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
Who knew Prince Xian would come?

608
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,380
Okay, I'll figure something out.

609
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,270
I did my best.

610
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,990
It was so good.

611
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,690
You're too modest, Your Highness.

612
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,740
I usually

613
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,400
make friends through incense,

614
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,650
and sometimes, I play the zither with my friends.

615
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,380
But today,

616
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,760
after hearing the song you played,

617
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,790
I feel that

618
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,460
all those I heard are unbearable to hear now.

619
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,390
I also like burning incense

620
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,650
to entertain myself when I play the zither.

621
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,330
It seems that the two of us

622
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,980
share the same interest.

623
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:55,820
Your Highness.

624
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,330
I developed a new incense recently.

625
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,690
It goes the best

626
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,250
with books and the zither.

627
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,730
I'm trying it out in my study right now.

628
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,320
Judging by the time,

629
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,710
the incense

630
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,060
should be best burned now.

631
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,640
Your Highness.

632
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,900
Do you want to come with me and take a look?

633
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,670
In that case,

634
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,430
I'm willing to be

635
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,920
the first one to eat crabs.

636
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,680
Mr. Xu.

637
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,430
Please lead the way.

638
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,040
I won't go with you

639
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,300
to my husband's study.

640
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,930
It so happens that Her Grace and I

641
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,130
have something intimate to talk about.

642
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,590
I'd like to invite Her Grace

643
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,970
to come to my room to catch up.

644
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,030
I also prepared

645
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,000
her favorite food and playthings.

646
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,030
Okay.

647
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,550
Go.

648
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

649
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,330
Your Highness, please.

650
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,230
Let's go.

651
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,430
Ping'er.

652
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,970
Wait here.

653
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,930
Wang Zhujue will be here in a minute.

654
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,790
Take your time to talk.

655
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,190
I'll keep watch outside.

656
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,340
Xu Zilu will find a way

657
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,540
to stall Prince Xian.

658
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,820
Okay.

659
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,470
Thank you so much, Se.

660
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,340
Mr. Xu's study

661
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,630
is so nicely arranged.

662
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,960
It's both spacious and elegant.

663
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,910
If I didn't know

664
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,140
you were a businessman,

665
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,110
I would think

666
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,700
I've entered a scholar's study.

667
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,660
Thank you for your compliment, Your Highness.

668
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,500
Are these all your works?

669
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,630
Yes.

670
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,650
Furong doesn't have as many ingredients

671
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,670
as Linchun.

672
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,890
Your Highness, if you have time,

673
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,150
please visit Linchun.

674
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,030
I'll take you to

675
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:40,670
Xu's and show you

676
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,350
the ancient incense-making technique passed down in the Xu family.

677
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,630
Linchun is a great city.

678
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,870
I will definitely go there if I have a chance.

679
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,470
Okay.

680
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,200
Actually, I'm usually quite bored

681
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,730
in Furong City.

682
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,190
I only get to do the Four Arts

683
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,520
on a superficial level.

684
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,530
A few months ago,

685
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,460
I went to Lingnan

686
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,770
and collected a few sets of Four Treasures of the Study.

687
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,770
Next time we meet,

688
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,420
I will give you a set as a gift.

689
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,340
The Ink Pavilion in Lingnan

690
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,400
is indeed the best.

691
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,910
I wonder if you've been there, Your Highness.

692
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,350
That's exactly where I went.

693
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,120
Their inkstone is second to none

694
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,240
in the Qing State.

695
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,760
I heard that the orders

696
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,880
have been lined up to the year after next.

697
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,080
I had to take full advantage

698
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,780
of my status

699
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,050
to cut the queue and got three sets.

700
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,230
I've also heard a lot of nice things about Ink Pavilion.

701
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,080
But last month when I was there in Lingnan,

702
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,450
I didn't get a chance to visit it.

703
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,510
It's really a pity.

704
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,350
Last month?

705
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,010
I remember

706
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,050
there was a freeze disaster in Lingnan last month.

707
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,850
The road conditions were tough.

708
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,070
Mr. Xu.

709
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,000
Why did you go there at such a time?

710
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,710
Xu's has a Laurel Garden

711
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,460
in Lingnan.

712
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,500
It was severely affected by the disaster this year.

713
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,430
I was there to comfort the victims.

714
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,230
I wanted to go to Ink Pavilion

715
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,670
after I finished my work,

716
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,320
but I didn't expect that

717
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,370
I'd have an accident along the way.

718
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:53,870
Accident?

719
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes.

720
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,150
There was an emergency at home.

721
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,600
On my way back,

722
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,520
I ran into a bunch of bandits.

723
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,490
I almost died.

724
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,490
There has been no report of bandits in Lingnan for years.

725
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,040
How come there were bandits out of the blue?

726
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,580
I also found it strange.

727
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,500
Those bandits were really fierce that day.

728
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,780
One of my companions was killed.

729
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,260
I was lucky

730
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,940
to have survived.

731
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:25,990
Someone got killed?

732
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,330
So what happened then?

733
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,420
Did you report it to the government office?

734
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,820
How did the government office deal with it?

735
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,310
I was saved by the villagers.

736
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,410
After I woke up, I went to report it to the government office.

737
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,660
But I was in a hurry to return to Linchun,

738
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,850
so I didn't pursue the outcome.

739
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,420
There have been many disasters in the south this year.

740
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,580
If natural disasters are met with man-made disasters,

741
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,650
the people will have

742
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,770
a even harder time.

743
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,530
Yes.

744
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,670
If the bandits are rampant,

745
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,270
I must report this to His Majesty

746
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,580
to pacify the bandits.

747
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,790
Mr. Xu.

748
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,810
Do you remember

749
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,890
the victim's name?

750
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,660
And where was that person from?

751
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,040
Go after them!

752
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,790
Young Master!

753
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,450
A bunch of people are after us!

754
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,980
Dear Young Master.

755
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,470
The stuff inside this parcel

756
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,530
is very important.

757
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,920
If anything happens to me,

758
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,330
please take it

759
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,600
to Furong City.

760
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,550
Furong City?

761
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,630
Well,

762
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,580
I don't know about that.

763
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,450
But

764
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,780
that person seemed to be

765
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,820
from Furong City.

766
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,200
Furong City?

767
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,800
Let's not talk about this.

768
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,010
After this ordeal,

769
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,110
you'll definitely have great luck

770
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
and have a bright future, Mr. Xu.

771
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,220
Thank you for your kind words, Your Highness.

772
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,920
Ping'er.

773
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,160
I saw that

774
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,390
you didn't eat much today,

775
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,210
so I brought some chicken drumsticks

776
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,210
from the kitchen.

777
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,230
Have some.

778
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,300
Wang.

779
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,560
How have you been these days?

780
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,310
I'm all right.

781
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,560
Everything is fine.

782
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,020
It's not that I didn't want to see you,

783
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,880
but my family...

784
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,020
Ping'er, you don't have to explain.

785
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,150
I understand.

786
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,400
We can figure something out together.

787
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,530
No matter how powerful Prince Xian is,

788
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,280
as long as you don't want to marry him,

789
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,070
we'll find a way to get you out of it.

790
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,130
There must be a way.

791
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,300
I only escaped back then

792
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:42,320
because I didn't want to marry him.

793
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,250
That's why I escaped from Furong City to Linchun.

794
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,890
I didn't even want to marry him back then,

795
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,950
not to mention now.

796
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,640
Wang,

797
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,710
will you wait for me?

798
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,630
I will.

799
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,650
No matter how long it takes,

800
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:01,670
I'll wait for you.

801
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,660
But Prince Xian

802
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,680
is nice on the outside and indifferent on the inside.

803
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,110
He's very cunning.

804
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,040
Wang.

805
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,470
Promise me.

806
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,960
Don't

807
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,430
provoke him again.

808
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,300
And pretend to be a coward?

809
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,000
That's what I'm best at.

810
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,710
At worst,

811
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,980
I'll avoid him from now on.

812
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,990
I won't let him

813
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,190
have anything on you.

814
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,320
From now on, I'll stay in the mansion and study.

815
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,450
I won't go anywhere.

816
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:38,950
I won't provoke him.

817
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,160
Okay.

818
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,730
I'm relieved then.

819
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,270
Ping'er.

820
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,630
Take good care of yourself.

821
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,950
Eat well.

822
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,050
I've understood

823
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,920
all the learning techniques you taught me.

824
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,200
I will work hard.

825
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,670
I'll pass the Metropolitan Examination.

826
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,660
I promise I won't let you down.

827
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,830
Wang.

828
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,980
Take good care of yourself too.

829
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,630
Eat well.

830
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,510
Ping'er.

831
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,440
It's a deal then.

832
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,570
Okay.

833
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,430
It's a deal.

834
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,610
Deal.

835
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,580
Young Master.

836
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,780
You don't know that person's name

837
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,870
or his facial characteristics.

838
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,660
There's no clue whatsoever.

839
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,190
How should I investigate it?

840
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,630
Isn't this a clue?

841
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,460
But isn't this

842
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,940
just a dark little box?

843
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,429
This is not an antique.

844
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,330
But the craftsmanship is quite delicate.

845
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,440
There's no logo

846
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,360
or pattern on it either.

847
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,480
This is obviously

848
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,210
from a rich family for home use.

849
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,820
Just follow this line of thought

850
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,960
and investigate.

851
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,590
Young Master, there are

852
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,469
countless families

853
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,330
that can afford this in Furong City.

854
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:28,980
If I were

855
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,940
that capable,

856
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,400
would I still be working here?

857
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,400
I would've been an official in the government office.

858
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,010
Chen Bin.

859
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,739
Young Master.

860
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,449
Investigate this item

861
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,290
for me.

862
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,130
Leave it to me, Young Master.

863
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,540
Not to mention you have this,

864
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,469
even without it,

865
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,120
I can

866
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,300
find out the truth.

867
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,580
Come here.

868
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:56,270
Put it down.

869
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,110
Didn't you ask me to investigate it?

870
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,870
Why do you have to take this with you

871
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:01,860
for investigation?

872
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,790
You're clumsy. What if you lose it?

873
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,800
I can do it without taking it with me.

874
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,960
Because I've seen

875
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,060
all the details.

876
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,180
Liufeng.

877
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,030
Yes, Your Highness. Any order?

878
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,840
Have you found Yetian and Mu?

879
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,110
Not yet.

880
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,510
So,

881
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,510
you haven't found that thing either?

882
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I'm incompetent.

883
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,990
Go investigate Xu Zilu.

884
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,030
I want to know

885
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,790
if it's possible that

886
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,980
he has that thing.

887
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,200
Are you suspecting

888
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,880
Xu Zilu has something to do

889
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,780
with the spy sent by the Ministry of Justice, Your Highness?

890
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,670
During the freeze disaster in Lingnan last month,

891
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,070
Xu Zilu made a trip there.

892
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,170
I want to know

893
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,520
if he knows something.

894
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,270
Do we need to silence him?

895
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,190
Silence him?

896
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,540
What good would that do me

897
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,450
if we silence him now?

898
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,890
Killing him is not a big deal.

899
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,900
But what if you

900
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,770
ruin my plan because of it?

901
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,870
I was wrong.

902
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,310
Use your brain

903
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,850
when you work.

904
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,470
Follow him for the time being.

905
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:42,270
We'll make a plan after finding out what he's up to.

906
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,870
Yes.

907
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,950
Young Master.

908
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,750
Prince Xian sent someone to Lingnan.

909
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,310
Lingnan?

910
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,320
Why did he think of Lingnan all of a sudden?

911
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,580
I also find it strange.

912
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,330
This never happened before.

913
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:01,910
So what has he been doing these days?

914
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,060
Just as usual.

915
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,510
He's still been visiting the same shops.

916
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,740
Yesterday, Prince Xian went to the mansion of Imperial Merchant

917
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,860
Xu Zilu.

918
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,100
Mr. Xu is really something.

919
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,520
He's only been here a few days,

920
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,980
yet he got Prince Xian to visit him in person.

921
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,590
Did Xu Zilu

922
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,780
go to Lingnan last month?

923
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,980
Yes, he actually did.

924
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,400
All right.

925
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:22,950
Ask your men

926
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,250
to keep watching Prince Xian.

927
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,780
Empty the private room upstairs.

928
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,640
I have a guest to meet there.

929
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,120
Yes.

930
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,950
It's quite busy here.

931
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:43,880
Pardon me,

932
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,800
you two.

933
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,140
We have quite a lot of guests today.

934
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,040
You may have to wait

935
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,100
for two more hours.

936
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:48,940
We are friends of Wu Qi,

937
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,900
Mr. Wu.

938
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,110
He's booked a private room upstairs.

939
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,940
I see.

940
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,970
This way, please.

941
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,030
Thank you.

942
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,920
I prepared a simple meal

943
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,580
to welcome you to the capital.

944
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,710
You call this a simple meal?

945
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,400
Mr. Wu.

946
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,160
You gifted me a shop,

947
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:06,880
and now you're treating us

948
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,240
to dinner at such a nice place.

949
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,440
It must have cost you dear.

950
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,640
Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Wu.

951
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,260
I will

952
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,880
treat you to dinner in turn another day.

953
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,050
It's a great time

954
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,500
to eat silver carp now.

955
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,420
One of the reasons why I invited you two here today

956
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,430
is to enjoy delicious food together.

957
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,280
The other reason is that

958
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,680
I'm really curious about

959
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,260
how the preparation

960
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,020
of Young Madam Xu's shop has been going.

961
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,150
I've thought about it.

962
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,140
Your shop

963
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,820
is quite close to the academies.

964
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,150
The students there have nowhere to go for fun

965
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,430
after school.

966
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,670
So I decided to

967
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,700
open a game shop.

968
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,250
Young Madam Xu.

969
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,810
You're even more imaginative

970
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:40,690
than before.

971
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,350
You flatter me, Mr. Wu.

972
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,750
But

973
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,490
the gaming equipment

974
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,840
will cost a lot of money.

975
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:48,950
Mr. Wu.

976
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,690
Are you interested in

977
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,980
making an investment?

978
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,860
Okay.

979
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,990
I'll pay for

980
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,320
all the gaming equipment

981
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,080
in the shop.

982
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,300
Thank you in advance then, Mr. Wu.

983
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:58,900
Here.

984
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,700
I look forward to working with you.

985
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:01,830
Happy cooperation.

986
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,000
Congratulations,

987
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:11,900
you three.

988
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,040
Your ordered

989
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,630
our signature set meal today.

990
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,060
So,

991
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,370
you got a lucky draw.

992
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,760
Besides, the winning rate is 100%.

993
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,730
You can send a representative

994
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,330
to try your luck downstairs.

995
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,320
Darling.

996
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,050
Go.

997
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,930
I'm not usually lucky.

998
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,060
Okay.

999
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,980
I'll go then.

1000
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,560
Please.

1001
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,500
I've already

1002
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:46,930
sent my wife away for you.

1003
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:47,880
Go ahead.

1004
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,030
What is it?

1005
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:50,770
Has Prince Xian

1006
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:52,500
been to your mansion recently?

1007
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:53,560
Did you arrange someone

1008
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,090
to keep watch at my mansion?

1009
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,830
Why do you know everything?

1010
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,520
Given my relationship

1011
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,290
with you two,

1012
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,900
I don't need to arrange anyone there.

1013
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,300
I could ask you directly.

1014
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,320
I'm just curious about

1015
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,210
why Prince Xian went to your mansion.

1016
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,620
I think I can tell you.

1017
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,400
Prince Xian

1018
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,990
has some connections

1019
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,120
with Ping'er, who's in my mansion.

1020
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,920
Ping'er?

1021
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,320
Just Ping'er?

1022
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,740
Prince Xian didn't mention Lingnan?

1023
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:27,480
You've been talking to me about Prince Xian the last couple of times we met.

1024
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,820
Why is that?

1025
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,270
Mr. Xu.

1026
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,570
Given your connections with Prince Xian,

1027
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,100
of course you'll take to business like a duck to water.

1028
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,630
It's just that in business,

1029
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,070
besides making money,

1030
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,060
safety is the most important thing.

1031
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,250
I wonder

1032
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,020
if you think so too, Mr. Xu?

1033
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,710
Yes.

1034
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,180
My family's safety

1035
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,280
and happiness

1036
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,860
come first.

1037
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,840
May

1038
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,370
our wishes come true then.
