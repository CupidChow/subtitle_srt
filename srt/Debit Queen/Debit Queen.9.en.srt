[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,910
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,120
It's alright. It's okay.

4
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,470
Cheer up.

5
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,090
Winning and losing are both part of life.

6
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,990
It's okay.

7
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,280
If you ask me,

8
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:49,860
it's all that Half-Immortal Liu's fault.

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,130
It's no darn use at all

10
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,340
to wear bright red or bright purple.

11
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,210
His prediction is completely off.

12
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,050
I'm screwed.

13
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,560
I'm screwed.

14
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,870
The allowance my father gave me for next month

15
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,750
is all gone.

16
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,730
I'm afraid

17
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,520
my father will break my leg.

18
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,750
It's okay, Wang.

19
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,970
I got you.

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,220
I just

21
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,400
won a small prize

22
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,240
with a little bit of money.

23
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,620
I'll lend it to you to help you get by.

24
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,310
I'll go back and get you more

25
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,370
if it's not enough.

26
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,350
Ping'er,

27
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,610
one can help those who are starving,
but not those who are simply poor.

28
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,350
Besides,

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,340
your little money

30
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,770
is not enough for him to pay his debt, right?

31
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,970
I've finally come to a realization.

32
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,010
You can't

33
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,220
make money

34
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,350
by taking shortcuts.

35
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,630
We need to think of a proper business

36
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,910
and work together to make money.

37
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,400
Let's

38
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,430
discuss it later.

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,740
I'm going to buy some tasty food.

40
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,170
Ping'er. Ping'er.

41
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,000
Ping'er.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,790
How could Liu Yeniang do this?

43
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,040
She even wants to charge us for storing something in her inn.

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,690
Yeah.

45
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,350
Fuding!

46
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,320
Young Madam?

47
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,270
You can go back to work.

48
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,710
Yes.

49
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,160
What's wrong?

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,090
What did you say about Liu Yeniang?

51
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,430
We just want to store some damp tea

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,310
in her inn,

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,170
and she's insisting on charging us for it.

54
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,770
Young Madam,

55
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,500
aren't you very close

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,080
to her?

57
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,870
Could you please help me...

58
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,200
Wait.

59
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,190
Then, can you still

60
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,410
use that batch of tea?

61
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,560
Of course not.

62
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,590
We're very particular about the tea

63
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,079
we use to make perfume.

64
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,170
Although we can still drink the tea

65
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,230
after it has dried,

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,110
it can't be used to make perfume.

67
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,280
Then, what are you going to do

68
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,440
with it?

69
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,630
That I don't know. You have to ask Young Master.

70
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,130
W-W-Where are you taking it?

71
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,800
To bring it to Young Master.

72
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,130
He hasn't eaten all day.

73
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,650
I'll send it to him.

74
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,200
Are you still working?

75
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,630
Young Master Xu, you must be tired.

76
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,750
Didn't you run away pretty quickly?

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,550
You still know to come back home?

78
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,510
So, I'm here to offer my sincere apologies

79
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,790
for this.

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,190
I made this dessert especially for you.

81
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,670
Try it.

82
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,730
I went shopping with you,

83
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,760
but you abandoned me and the things I bought for you

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,670
at the shop.

85
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,950
You think some snacks will make up for it?

86
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,070
Yes, I still have my jewelry and accessories.

87
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,000
What do you mean?

88
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,290
You want to sell them right after I buy them for you,

89
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,690
right?

90
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,950
No way.

91
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,310
It's the first time you have bought me jewelry.

92
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,710
I'll properly cherish them.

93
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,240
How can I sell them?

94
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,180
Try some.

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,410
Did you really make them yourself?

96
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,560
Isn't it good?

97
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,930
Isn't this the dessert that my maid made?

98
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,320
You can tell?

99
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,680
Then, I'll

100
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,040
make some for you later.

101
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,390
Make them now.

102
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,060
Tell me. What is it?

103
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,040
Nothing.

104
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,020
Fine, then I'm leaving.

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,840
No. Don't.

106
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,860
Wait, wait, wait!

107
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,880
Sell me

108
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,750
the batch of damp tea

109
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,550
stored at the Fulai Inn, please.

110
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,390
No.

111
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,630
Why?

112
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,760
Even if it's damp,

113
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,210
it can still be sold.

114
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,870
I can also give you money.

115
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,970
I can earn 50 taels

116
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,150
by selling it to others.

117
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,650
You can't match that price.

118
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,090
We are so close.

119
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,070
Could you give me a discount,

120
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,530
perhaps a friend's price?

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,340
How much do you want to pay?

122
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,620
Acting cute won't help.

123
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,470
Don't go.

124
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,760
This is all

125
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,710
the money I have.

126
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,570
How about this?

127
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:44,040
Give me the tea first.

128
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,220
I'll give you a cut after I sell it.

129
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,470
It's hard to sell.

130
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,990
Of course,

131
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,030
it's hard to sell it as damp tea leaves.

132
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,260
But I can definitely sell it for a good price

133
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,850
after I deal with it

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,340
with my magical touch.

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,360
Please sell it to me.

136
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,140
You really want it?

137
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,450
Let me think about it.

138
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,600
Please.

139
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,470
Sell it to me.

140
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,340
I know.

141
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,450
Young Master Xu, you are the best.

142
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,850
Please.

143
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,430
Alright.

144
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,150
Thank you. Thank you.

145
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,300
I've found

146
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,710
that you're becoming nicer and nicer.

147
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,040
Then be a good man all the way...

148
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,590
For free.

149
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:32,310
What?

150
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,409
I am giving it to you for free.

151
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,340
Are you stunned?

152
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,590
No.

153
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
I was so surprised

154
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,830
that I thought it was a bit of an anomaly.

155
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,920
You don't

156
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,240
have any tricks that you'll use on me later?

157
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
Just assume

158
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,150
I've lost my mind.

159
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,260
So, is he going to give it to me?

160
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:00,990
Se.

161
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,600
With this much tea,

162
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,990
are you sure it doesn't need to be sun-dried a little longer?

163
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,520
No need. The weather's been so good recently.

164
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,940
They were sun-dried all day yesterday

165
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,740
and are already completely dry.

166
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,740
So much tea,

167
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,890
and Young Master Xu

168
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:14,780
really gave it all to you for free?

169
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,270
Yeah.

170
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,390
He's quite generous this time.

171
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,300
I think so too.

172
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,790
This is not like him.

173
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,470
But since he gave it to me for free,

174
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,070
there's no way I'd refuse it.

175
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm just afraid that he may have something up his sleeve,

176
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,370
waiting for me.

177
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,520
Don't overthink it.

178
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,260
I think

179
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,820
maybe Young Master Xu

180
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,980
wants to please you.

181
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,920
After all,

182
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,140
you two have helped each other

183
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,470
and done so many things.

184
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,420
You're right.

185
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,480
I also think he's a lot nicer

186
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,540
than he was before.

187
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,280
If he

188
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,470
continues to be so nice,

189
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,320
maybe

190
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,570
I'll consider being friends with him

191
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,150
after I leave his house.

192
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,690
Why are you sighing?

193
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,290
Some people

194
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,060
want to be friends with him

195
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,360
just because they get something from him.

196
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,210
Who knows

197
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,960
what will happen in the future?

198
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,470
Love

199
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,750
doesn't disappear;

200
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,350
it just transfers to others.

201
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,430
What are you talking about?

202
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,290
He and I are just

203
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,600
ordinary friends at best.

204
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,160
You and I

205
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,630
are much closer than mere friends.

206
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,410
How close?

207
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,460
Like sisters.

208
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,650
Se isn't home for dinner again.

209
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,789
What has she been doing lately?

210
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,049
A few days ago, Young Madam

211
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,380
cleaned out our kitchen

212
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,940
and brought a lot of tea.

213
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,820
She said that she was going to develop some new types of tea.

214
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,390
Tea?

215
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,600
What else can we do about it

216
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,650
besides drinking it?

217
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,010
It's the last batch of tea

218
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,340
that got damp in the inn.

219
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,310
She thought it was a shame to simply discard it.

220
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,940
So,

221
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,870
she is thinking of some new ideas to do with it

222
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,530
and selling it for some money.

223
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,150
I see.

224
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,920
My daughter-in-law is truly one of a kind.

225
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,870
Who else would

226
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
think about such things these days?

227
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,670
You have to help her when you have free time.

228
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,130
Pay more attention to her.

229
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,590
I understand what you mean, Mother.

230
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,480
I just think

231
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,620
it's not good for her growth

232
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,750
to do things for her.

233
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,660
I've also prepared a surprise for her.

234
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,590
She will like it.

235
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,910
You have a surprise for her?

236
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,480
Fine.

237
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,690
Quickly pack up this delicious food...

238
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,040
You...

239
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,610
send it to my daughter-in-law,

240
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,030
okay?

241
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,770
You two can eat in your room.

242
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,670
See?

243
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,590
What did I say?

244
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,110
My silly son has started to get it.

245
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,250
Old Madam, you have such keen insight.

246
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,150
Of course.

247
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,150
It's time for dinner.

248
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
What's wrong?

249
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,450
I feel dizzy.

250
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,780
Sit down first.

251
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,360
What happened?

252
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,490
Perhaps I've drunk too much tea.

253
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,890
I have spent the entire day

254
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,200
trying hundreds of recipes,

255
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,270
either boiling or brewing.

256
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,350
Now, even when I drink water,

257
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,370
I can taste tea in it.

258
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,090
Are you stupid?

259
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,470
You can get drunk on tea if you drink too much.

260
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,530
You're tea-drunk.

261
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,950
I can hold my liquor.

262
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,530
I thought

263
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,240
I could also hold the tea.

264
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Wait a minute.

265
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,020
Come on. Drink this.

266
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,070
It's milk with honey.

267
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,850
It's for your tea hangover.

268
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,910
How do you feel?

269
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,950
Much better.

270
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,770
Haste makes waste.

271
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,890
It's not like you can develop a new product

272
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,130
in just a day or two.

273
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,280
I'll help you

274
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,560
when I finish my work.

275
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,810
Have a pot of milk with you

276
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,300
when you try new recipes.

277
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,320
Don't get yourself  intoxicated by tea again.

278
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,180
Yes, sir.

279
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,570
You're so sloppy.

280
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,380
Don't forget to eat.

281
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,430
Thank you.

282
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,650
[Official Document]

283
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,500
Young Master, let me tell you.

284
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:21,950
I saw

285
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,150
something really funny that day,

286
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,350
really interesting.

287
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,510
Stop!

288
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,680
Father!

289
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,430
My Lord.

290
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,010
Come here. Come here.

291
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,540
Has my father found out

292
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,570
that I lost money?

293
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,630
No way.

294
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,550
Give me the gadget that makes Father happy.

295
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,750
What are you mumbling about over there?

296
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,830
What...

297
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,510
What's that you've got there?

298
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,780
This is the legendary

299
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,660
Scalp Soothing Massager.

300
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,390
It combines

301
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,870
ancient Japanese methods

302
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,860
with our thousand-year

303
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,460
acupuncture technique.

304
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,730
And I made it

305
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,640
with unique dark steel from Japan.

306
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,120
It specializes in treating headaches.

307
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,630
Come on.

308
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,340
Using it daily will make you feel as refreshed as a deity.

309
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,570
Stop! Stop!

310
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,120
This thing

311
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,910
looks like a murder weapon,

312
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,700
and it's supposed to make me feel as refreshed as a deity?

313
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,600
Do you think

314
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,720
I've lived for too long?

315
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,310
Dad,

316
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,150
you need to be open to trying new things.

317
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,730
Come on!

318
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,140
Stop!

319
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,320
My head hurts because

320
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm trying to figure out how to catch the suspect

321
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,320
so that I can report to my leader...

322
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,270
I don't really have a head...

323
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,230
headache...

324
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,610
Magistrate Wang!

325
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,710
Go. Go.

326
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Magistrate Wang?

327
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,230
Lord Wang.

328
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,990
Mr. Tao,

329
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,710
you came just in time.

330
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,580
Come on. Let's talk over there.

331
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,360
Come with me.

332
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,600
-Mr. Tao.
-Let's go.

333
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,420
Is it really that bad?

334
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,210
What brings you here

335
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,460
today?

336
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,270
I've heard that the South is having a bad year.

337
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,710
There is an increasing number of refugees.

338
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,620
I'm thinking of

339
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,880
asking the Chamber of Commerce to make a charity donation

340
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,160
to donate some grains

341
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,190
and cloth

342
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,720
to help the government.

343
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,050
After all, with greater ability comes greater responsibility,

344
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,550
right?

345
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,540
That's all

346
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,900
I want to discuss with you.

347
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,480
Mr. Tao.

348
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,060
The citizens of Linchun City

349
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,750
can only live and work in peace

350
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,820
because of

351
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,910
some rich businessmen like you.

352
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,120
Don't worry.

353
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,760
I will definitely help you with it.

354
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
You flatter me.

355
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,950
It is our luck

356
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,820
to have

357
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,390
an official

358
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,830
like you.

359
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,480
You must deal with many important matters daily.

360
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,160
I just overheard

361
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,730
that you had to catch a thief.

362
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,550
Since when

363
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,750
do you have to care about such trivial matters?

364
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,510
Well, isn't that just a simple order

365
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,790
from the higher-ups?

366
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,020
As the local magistrate,

367
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,950
it is our duty.

368
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,460
But this case

369
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,910
involves delicate matters,

370
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,110
so we have been handling it discreetly.

371
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,200
Well, it's been so long,

372
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,040
and now they're asking us to find

373
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,180
a runaway maid.

374
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,420
Isn't this like looking for a needle in a haystack?

375
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,590
I

376
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,190
can't help you with that.

377
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,190
However,

378
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,940
I can help you

379
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,850
look for someone to draw a portrait

380
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,250
so you can put up notices.

381
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,590
Here.

382
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,530
You're grinding the tea so well.

383
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,190
You truly are from a family of perfume makers.

384
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,790
The tea powder is so fine.

385
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:52,970
Keep grinding.

386
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,140
You're not interested in shopping,

387
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,470
but you certainly know how to give orders.

388
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,660
This one.

389
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,190
Here.

390
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,500
This...

391
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,730
This is pepper.

392
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,510
I know.

393
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,400
Luodi gave it to me earlier.

394
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,660
He said that it could enhance the flavor.

395
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:15,060
Is it still tea with all this pepper?

396
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,220
It could be

397
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,430
a special combination.

398
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,290
Keep grinding.

399
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,980
Don't put too much into it.

400
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,860
Let me try it first.

401
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,630
How is it?

402
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,110
It's so spicy.

403
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,730
It's not good?

404
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,890
-Water.
-I'll try it.

405
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,470
Get me some water.

406
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,260
Water.

407
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,190
Here.

408
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:06,730
Hurry.

409
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,430
Is it not good? Let me try.

410
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,339
Don't try to drink it!

411
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:16,990
I think that you better

412
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,050
keep making proper tea in the future.

413
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,210
No way.

414
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,359
The legendary farmer, Shennong, tasted hundreds of herbs.

415
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,020
Failure is the mom of success.

416
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,369
Even if it tastes bad,

417
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,410
I need to try it

418
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,829
to know how to improve it.

419
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,410
Your tongue will be ruined

420
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,190
before you create a new recipe.

421
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,250
What's wrong with your tongue?

422
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,250
What do you think?

423
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,910
It feels completely numb.

424
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,090
Why did you pour it into the tea?

425
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,020
To throw it away.

426
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,830
Wait.

427
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,430
How can I use the pepper

428
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,490
after you put it all in the tea powder?

429
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,510
My milk!

430
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,180
What should I do?

431
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,960
Stop drinking.

432
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,730
I haven't tried the version with milk yet.

433
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,540
It's not bad.

434
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,310
You try it.

435
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,020
It's really not bad.

436
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,810
Try it.

437
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,470
It is good.

438
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,820
It's just that the smell of pepper

439
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,940
is a bit overpowering, masking the taste of the tea.

440
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,740
Otherwise, it'll taste better.

441
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,390
We've made it.

442
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,530
Bosslady! Bosslady!

443
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,120
I'm here.

444
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,650
I've brought you something good.

445
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,510
What are these?

446
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,750
Aromatic Tea.

447
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,680
Aromatic Tea?

448
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,940
What kind of nonsense

449
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,320
is this?

450
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,970
Are you sure it's drinkable?

451
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,570
Of course, and it's so good.

452
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,080
So I brought you some

453
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,880
so that you could taste it for me.

454
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,810
You don't want me to taste it.

455
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,910
You're here to use my customers

456
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,040
as your guinea pigs.

457
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,700
Of course not.

458
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,060
I've asked many people to try it.

459
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,480
They all said it was delicious.

460
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,060
Even the picky Xu Zilu

461
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,850
said it was delicious.

462
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:48,510
Try it.

463
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,980
Da!

464
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:50,830
Come on!

465
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,990
Share these with the customers

466
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,740
and distribute them to everyone.

467
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,810
-It's free!
-Okay.

468
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,630
Come on.

469
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,920
Try it.

470
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,310
Try it.

471
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,410
What's this taste?

472
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,660
I've never had it.

473
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,810
The tea is strong and rich in milk.

474
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,080
It's so good.

475
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
It's good, right?

476
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,960
This is the Aromatic Tea my best friend made.

477
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,670
It's complementary.

478
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:19,930
Everyone, drink more.

479
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,780
Okay.

480
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,850
Drink more.

481
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,820
It's good.

482
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,260
Bosslady, any more?

483
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,390
So, I can bring some back

484
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,310
for my children.

485
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:27,830
Yes.

486
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,680
This bottle of tea you're having is free.

487
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,910
It's 10 coins per bottle if you want more.

488
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,700
Ten coins per bottle.

489
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,230
Ten coins per bottle.

490
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,900
I'd like two more bottles.

491
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,030
I'd like five more.

492
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,870
I'd like three.

493
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm counting it. There is plenty of it.

494
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,450
You clever girl.

495
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,640
You're good with numbers.

496
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
You've come to my shop to make money.

497
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,280
My dear sister.

498
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,460
I'm not here to earn money.

499
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,070
I just think

500
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,770
we can make money together.

501
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,660
How about this?

502
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,510
You can invest some money in my shop

503
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,590
and become a shareholder.

504
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,110
Let's make the business big

505
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,250
and expand it.

506
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,970
By then, you can just sit here and watch the money roll in.

507
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,300
Wouldn't that be great?

508
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,670
Your little mind

509
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,030
is always busy thinking

510
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,490
of ways to trick me, right?

511
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,160
If you don't invest now,

512
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,190
don't say later

513
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,230
that I didn't bring you along

514
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,560
when my store really starts making money.

515
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,870
Let me think about it.

516
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,110
One more bottle for me.

517
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,690
Young Master!

518
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,500
Thank you.

519
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,900
The Young Master brought

520
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,560
tea and dessert for everyone.

521
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,750
Thank you, Young Master.

522
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,180
Thank you, Young Master.

523
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,750
Come on.

524
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,520
I have a word with you.

525
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:32,880
Okay.

526
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,000
This way.

527
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,730
There's dessert for everyone.

528
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,710
It smells so good.

529
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:37,070
Yeah.

530
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,750
It's yours.

531
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,650
These days,

532
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,510
you sort out all the orders

533
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,590
from Furong City

534
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,720
for the past twelve months.

535
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,270
Young Master, are you in a hurry for this?

536
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,200
Because

537
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,520
the sachet business is good these days.

538
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,180
Many clients have placed orders.

539
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,910
So, we are currently very busy.

540
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,260
It's not that urgent.

541
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,830
However,

542
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,700
you have to do it quickly.

543
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,760
Yes, Young Master.

544
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,590
Is there any problem in the city?

545
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,440
No.

546
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,470
I'm just looking around.

547
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,810
I hope I'm just overthinking this.

548
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,200
Go on with your work.

549
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,610
Okay.

550
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,110
I heard

551
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,610
that you sold some

552
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,510
at Liu Yeniang's inn.

553
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,110
How is it?

554
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,750
It's a big hit.

555
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,010
Some customers

556
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,480
even requested a second drink after finishing the first.

557
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,340
Then, what do you think?

558
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,800
I'm considering selling some first at a stall

559
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,000
I'll set up tomorrow.

560
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,310
But I haven't decided

561
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,410
where to set up the stall yet.

562
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,310
There are already two tea shops

563
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,630
in East Market.

564
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,380
There are not many customers in the West Market.

565
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,910
So, the price can't be high.

566
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,210
I need to check the market tomorrow.

567
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,260
Have you ever thought about selling it in the shop?

568
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,930
For example, you might sell a bracelet

569
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,930
for only 30 coins

570
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,830
at a stall,

571
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,640
but in a shop, you could sell it for 100 coins.

572
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,570
The same goes for the Aromatic Tea.

573
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,250
I know what you mean.

574
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,320
But if I'm going to sell it in a shop,

575
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,440
I have to give the shop owner a share,

576
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,520
at least 40%.

577
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,780
What if it were your own shop?

578
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,900
Think about it.

579
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,850
A small stall won't last long.

580
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,830
You've put so much effort

581
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,060
into creating the Aromatic Tea recipe.

582
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,320
Surely you don't want it to be just a one-time thing, right?

583
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,740
You have a point.

584
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,030
But where can I

585
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,110
find a shop to rent?

586
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,120
I will discuss it with Ping'er.

587
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,700
You... keep an eye on the fire for me.

588
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,160
Thank you for your advice.

589
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,180
Well...

590
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,670
The Young Madam is really something.

591
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,510
She really

592
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,870
makes use of the wet tea.

593
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,640
Young Master,

594
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,300
why are you looking at the title deed?

595
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,030
She said she wanted to open a shop.

596
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,890
Could it be

597
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,350
that you want to give this title deed

598
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,670
to the Young Madam?

599
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,750
Young Master,

600
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,710
I think

601
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,030
that you should give the title deed

602
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,430
to Young Madam now.

603
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,270
In case

604
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,380
Young Madam's Aromatic Tea is sold out

605
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,240
and she hasn't had the title deed.

606
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,650
Then, you give it to her for me.

607
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,690
I can't do it.

608
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,050
This is a gift from you.

609
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,150
If you don't give it to the Young Madam yourself,

610
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,830
how will she know

611
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
that you like her?

612
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,250
Don't get me wrong.

613
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,460
I'm doing this

614
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,440
because she helped me last time with the pepper,

615
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,600
so I owe her a favor.

616
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,230
I'm just returning the favor.

617
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,070
You gave her tea first

618
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,150
and now you're giving her a shop.

619
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,710
Young Master, you're so generous.

620
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,050
Is there a problem with that?

621
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,890
Is there no problem with that?

622
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,070
Is there?

623
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,680
I'm just exploring this question.

624
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,640
Is there really no problem?

625
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,090
I'm telling you, it's absolutely delicious.

626
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:03,950
I want some too.

627
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,390
Mr. Xu.

628
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,920
You didn't go out today?

629
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,860
I'll leave you to it.

630
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,380
It is a title deed.

631
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,020
Young Master, did you forget?

632
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,320
The Young Madam is illiterate.

633
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,100
The title deed!

634
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
It's not my fault.

635
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,590
You didn't give her a hint!

636
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,280
I even know how to do it.

637
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,190
"Hello."

638
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,090
"I have a title deed for you."

639
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,020
"Do you want it?"

640
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,130
"Thank you, Young Master."

641
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,200
Everyone can...

642
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,140
Why are you blaming me?

643
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,700
I was just wondering why Ping'er

644
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,640
was so anxious and in a hurry

645
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,620
to ask me out for a meal.

646
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,220
Turns out that it was for you!

647
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,730
Young Master Wang,

648
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,070
are you

649
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,260
truly in such dire straits

650
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,410
that you can't even afford a meal

651
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:21,110
and have to

652
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,390
mooch off me?

653
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,230
Says who?

654
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,760
Ping'er is the one

655
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,490
treating me.

656
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,990
Ping'er is my girl.

657
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,730
What's the big deal about you buying me a meal?

658
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,590
We're friends.

659
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,320
No wonder Tao Meili calls you "Stingy Girl."

660
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,140
Then don't eat it.

661
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,950
No. No.

662
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,590
I was wrong, okay?

663
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,940
From now on,

664
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,840
I'll only move my mouth to eat.

665
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,730
You girls talk.

666
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,220
You still want my drumsticks?

667
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,630
Se,

668
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,440
I think

669
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,330
we should just set up a stall.

670
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,210
There are so many things to consider when opening a store.

671
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,270
Most importantly,

672
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,990
we don't know whether we will make money or not.

673
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,640
I think so too, actually.

674
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:01,810
But

675
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,980
I think Xu Zilu's words

676
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,860
make sense.

677
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:04,910
We can't run a stall

678
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,460
for the rest of our lives, can we?

679
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,380
We need to

680
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,640
make our business big and expand it.

681
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,100
So, we have to open a store.

682
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,520
But, come to think of it,

683
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,800
where can we find a shop to rent?

684
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,350
Shop?

685
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,740
Are you looking for a shop?

686
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,110
I have a shop,

687
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,790
but it's not located in a good place.

688
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,460
If it weren't for Xu Zilu,

689
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,910
I wouldn't have spent

690
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,810
my father's entire secret hoard

691
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,070
to buy a corner store.

692
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,850
That darn Xu Zilu!

693
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,390
Come on,

694
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,760
Young Master Wang.

695
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,520
We are friends. Have more.

696
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,250
You have a shop, right?

697
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:37,990
Lend it to me.

698
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,010
Think about it.

699
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,360
You are currently

700
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,370
in debt to the Bosslady, right?

701
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,830
You must be short on money.

702
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,410
Yeah.

703
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,510
Well, it's

704
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,640
not in use anywhere.

705
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,590
Well,

706
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,580
how much rent can you offer?

707
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,930
What rent?

708
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,170
Think about it.

709
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,910
You provide me with a shop,

710
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,390
and I'll use it to do business.

711
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,210
That makes us partners.

712
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,520
When my Aromatic Tea Shop

713
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,380
makes money,

714
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,740
I'll give you a share of the profits.

715
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,730
Isn't this much better than my paying you rent?

716
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,750
Yeah.

717
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,060
Why didn't I think of that?

718
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,850
How many dividends can you give me?

719
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,550
How much do you want?

720
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,290
50 percent

721
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,440
is a definite no-no.

722
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,390
I'll give you five percent at most.

723
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:29,310
Think about it.

724
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,940
You're just providing a shop.

725
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,900
I have to cover the costs, right?

726
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,250
I have to buy ingredients, don't I?

727
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,340
You're just sitting at home,

728
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,570
waiting for money to drop into your lap.

729
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,960
Is there really such a good thing?

730
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,620
The 5% it is.

731
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:45,170
Mr. Wang, you're straightforward.

732
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:45,950
I just like

733
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,120
doing business

734
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:47,950
with smart people like you.

735
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,280
Come on. Wish us happy cooperation.

736
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,410
Happy cooperation.

737
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,280
By the way,

738
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,740
my father has the title deed.

739
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,310
He's afraid that I would cause trouble with it,

740
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,970
so he hid it.

741
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,170
Then, stop eating.

742
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,250
Go back and find it.

743
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,040
Those of us who aim to achieve great things

744
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,620
can't be trapped by a bowl of noodles.

745
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,650
Hurry up. Go home and find it.

746
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,180
I'll be waiting for you. Go.

747
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,870
Hurry!

748
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,800
Mr. Wang

749
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,260
is quite gullible.

750
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,630
Ping'er.

751
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,950
How could you say that

752
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,810
about Mr. Wang?

753
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,670
It's not that he is a fool.

754
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,700
It's me

755
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,100
who is too smart.

756
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,110
Eat more.

757
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,680
Knowing my father's personality,

758
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,650
he must still be hiding

759
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,270
his secret stash here.

760
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,760
Found it.

761
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,310
Young Master,

762
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,060
I think you should just

763
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,400
give it to the Young Madam.

764
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,030
As men,

765
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,450
we can be more proactive,

766
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:34,890
right?

767
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,080
After all, the sooner you return her favor,

768
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,010
the sooner you'll be even with her.

769
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,530
That makes sense.

770
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,110
That's right.

771
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
I'll go by myself.

772
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,180
Some of them have crosses on them.

773
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,180
Look, it's open after being peeled like this.

774
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,440
It's peeled like this.

775
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,920
Isn't this Mr. Xu?

776
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,960
What are you doing in my house?

777
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:14,400
Do you want some chestnuts?

778
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,860
Wang Zhujue brought them.

779
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:16,880
No need.

780
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,230
Ling Se,

781
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,130
I have good news for you.

782
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,080
Yes, I also have good news

783
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,870
to tell you.

784
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,100
The advice you gave me yesterday

785
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,340
made perfect sense to me.

786
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,130
So, I've decided

787
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,860
to open a shop

788
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,860
with Wang Zhujue.

789
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,230
What?

790
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,350
See?

791
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
This is the shop I bought

792
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,240
because you set me up.

793
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,940
All thanks to Ling Se.

794
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,920
Now, I have a way to pay my debt.

795
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,120
We're all brothers. Don't mention it.

796
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,620
We plan to open

797
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,780
a new-style tea shop.

798
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,780
What do you think?

799
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,890
Pretty good.

800
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:55,930
Ling Se,

801
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,880
how about we go check out the shop tomorrow?

802
00:31:59,170 --> 00:31:59,830
Yes.

803
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:00,630
Deal.

804
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,050
Three, two, one.

805
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,440
You guys talk.

806
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,480
Why did he leave?

807
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,720
I still have something to ask him.

808
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,240
That's how he is.

809
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,140
Ignore him.

810
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,860
With your skills,

811
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,930
you'll make money without him.

812
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,310
You're right.

813
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,510
Young Master,

814
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,840
why are you back so soon?

815
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,360
You didn't fail to give her the deed again, did you?

816
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,750
No.

817
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,250
Why did you get the title deed back,

818
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,050
Young Master?

819
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,170
Wang Zhujue gave her a shop.

820
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:47,100
It saves me trouble.

821
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,850
It must be

822
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,200
the Young Madam's loss

823
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,370
to miss your shop.

824
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
But Young Master,

825
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,380
Wang Zhujue has helped

826
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,710
the Young Madam several times.

827
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,040
Aren't you worried about that?

828
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:02,830
Why should I?

829
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,930
What does it have to do with me?

830
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,460
As the saying goes, "The early bird catches the worm."

831
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,320
Think about it.

832
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,110
Why does he

833
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,370
come to see the Young Madam every day?

834
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,190
Enough.

835
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,530
Young Master!

836
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,980
Young Master.

837
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,550
How is it?

838
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,940
I've checked the ledger

839
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,800
you asked me to.

840
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,230
I don't see any problems.

841
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,150
Got it.

842
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,270
Then,

843
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,400
is there anything else I should do?

844
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,190
You go...

845
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,010
and do the last thing

846
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,340
that I've told you to do.

847
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,040
Yes.

848
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,880
We'll find out tomorrow

849
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,120
if there's anything wrong with the shipment.

850
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,600
Good morning.

851
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,110
Let's go shopping.

852
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,410
Why do you always ask me to go shopping

853
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,140
when I've got something to do?

854
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,740
I really can't make it today.

855
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,340
Next time.

856
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,030
I'll go shopping with you until you're sick of it next time,

857
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,590
okay?

858
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,570
I'll buy you anything you want.

859
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,310
Jewelry or rare delicacies.

860
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,360
I'll buy you anything.

861
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,070
But I really

862
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,590
have something important to do.

863
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,719
I need to check out Wang Zhujue's shop.

864
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,230
Is he really that important to you?

865
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,050
You think about it again.

866
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,790
No, no.

867
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,409
I can't think about it anymore.

868
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:23,139
I can't help going shopping with you if I continue to think about it.

869
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,880
[Xu Mansion]

870
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,250
Didn't I tell you

871
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,989
that I can't go shopping with you?

872
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:47,760
Yes.

873
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,420
Then...

874
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,389
Then why are you following me?

875
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,770
You go about your business. Don't mind me.

876
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,510
What does it say? I don't know.

877
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,570
Young Master!

878
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,470
Young Master!

879
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,670
We got news from Manager Wan.

880
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,000
He went to Wanhua House.

881
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,350
Let's go.

882
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:20,960
Is he alone?

883
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:21,590
Yes.

884
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,960
Manager Wan said that he was alone.

885
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,420
He should be making a move.

886
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,030
He took the bait.

887
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,790
Let's split up and flank him.

888
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,120
This time, we must catch him red-handed.

889
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,560
Okay.

890
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,900
I said, "Split up."

891
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,420
What darn map

892
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,690
did Wang Zhujue give me?

893
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,220
I can't make any sense of it.

894
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,850
Why is Xu Zilu

895
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,920
everywhere?

896
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,270
Xu Zilu!

897
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,920
Who has been stalking you?

898
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,050
What are you shushing for?

899
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,980
Who stalked you?

900
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,380
I'm on serious business.

901
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,360
What business?

902
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,200
Isn't that one of the staff members

903
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,230
from your perfume shop?

904
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,050
Why is he here?

905
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,150
He...

906
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,290
You'll find out later.

907
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,450
Didn't you say

908
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,520
we shouldn't meet unless it's important?

909
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,670
Young Master Xu has begun to suspect

910
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,620
that there's something wrong with this ledger.

911
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,820
How is that possible?

912
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,080
These accounts

913
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,440
have been clearly done.

914
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,830
Let me see.

915
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,470
This...

916
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,120
Oh no!

917
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,040
What's wrong?

918
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
We've been set up.

919
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,420
There's no problem with the accounts.

920
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,880
Then...

921
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,040
Let's get out of here now.

922
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,320
Where are you going?

923
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,750
Mr. Fuding,

924
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,590
you are all here.

925
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,280
Misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding.

926
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,140
It's all a misunderstanding.

927
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,280
Let's talk about it when we see the Young Master.

928
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,770
Take them down!

929
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,380
Wait!

930
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,510
I have something to say.

931
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,930
Don't hit my face!

932
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,310
Stop!

933
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,930
-He ran away!
-Don't move.

934
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,650
Stop!

935
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,840
-Stop!
-Stop!
