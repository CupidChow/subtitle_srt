1
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,039
[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,900
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,180
Eunuch,

4
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,720
don't just listen to his side of the story.

5
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,440
If this agreement were truly

6
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,840
written by my wife and me,

7
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,210
why would he possess it?

8
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,640
It was Ling Se who dropped it accidentally

9
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,100
when she came to the store.

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,550
And it's all clearly written

11
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,100
on the paper.

12
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,960
You still want to deny it?

13
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,479
You went to all that trouble to get close to us,

14
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,070
and this was your true purpose all along.

15
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,840
Wu Qi, you are so vicious.

16
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,610
Business is business.

17
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,520
I really

18
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,580
wanted to cooperate with you before.

19
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,790
However, I've discovered your crimes.

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,440
As an honest and upright

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,900
citizen of the Qing State,

22
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,070
I really can't be complicit

23
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,600
in any wrongdoing with you.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,080
You?

25
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,720
Guards!

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,250
Take them down!

27
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,450
Wait!

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,860
Regarding the agreement,

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,490
my wife knew nothing about it

30
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,510
from start to finish.

31
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,570
It was all my doing.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,320
Please let my wife go.

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Xu Zilu.

34
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,310
Both of your names are written

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,100
on the agreement.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,020
Of course, both of you are guilty!

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,100
Well...

38
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,220
Her Majesty has arrived!

39
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,390
Aunt?

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,860
What's all this commotion? What's going on?

41
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,070
Your Majesty,

42
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,040
today is the selection day for the Imperial Merchant of line incense.

43
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,940
Someone has reported

44
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,400
that Xu Zilu, a perfume materials merchant from Linchun City,

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,690
and his wife

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,020
pretended to be a couple

47
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,720
in order to qualify as the Imperial Merchant.

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,910
I was about to take them down

49
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,510
and interrogate them.

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,510
This is their

51
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,880
fake couple agreement.

52
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,720
If they are truly a fake couple,

53
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,820
how should we deal with them?

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,200
If this agreement is true,

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,090
Xu's Shop from Linchun City

56
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,160
will be disqualified as the Imperial Commercial Firm.

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,250
Both of them

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,270
also face severe punishment.

59
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,460
Mr. Xu, right?

60
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,920
I've used your incense.

61
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,050
I like it very much.

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,550
I can show you mercy today

63
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,510
and allow you to maintain your qualification as an Imperial Merchant.

64
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,220
However,

65
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,470
you two must divorce.

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,820
I can also grant each of you

67
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,710
a good marriage, respectively.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
What do you think?

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,960
Your Majesty, your grace is boundless.

70
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I... am willing to

71
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,440
relinquish the qualification as an Imperial Merchant.

72
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,900
I would rather go bankrupt

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,160
and be imprisoned

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,529
than lose Ling Se.

75
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,330
I will marry no other woman

76
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,480
in my life but her.

77
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,110
Madam Xu,

78
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,720
if the agreement is true,

79
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:41,550
you two will have committed the crime of deceiving the king.

80
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,550
If you divorce,

81
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,830
I can guarantee your safety.

82
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,460
I'll only marry

83
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,580
Xu Zilu in my lifetime.

84
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,650
Through life and death,

85
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,090
we'll share weal and woe together.

86
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,900
Through life and death,

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,040
you'll share weal and woe together. Good.

88
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,720
Even when true couples face a great disaster,

89
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,310
they often go their separate ways.

90
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,550
If they're just a fake couple

91
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,140
bound by a contract,

92
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,120
how can they disregard their lives

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,350
during a time of crisis?

94
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,970
The agreement may be fake,

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,740
but true love can't be faked.

96
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,710
All of you, rise.

97
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,730
Thank you, Your Majesty.

98
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,760
Come on.

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,840
What about our line incense?

100
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,000
It will begin

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,730
in one hour.

102
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,810
Even if we went back to get it, it would be too late.

103
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,400
Let them use the swift horse

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,790
from the palace to get it.

105
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,380
Yes.

106
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,580
Your Highness.

107
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,420
How is it?

108
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,000
Xu Zilu's incense

109
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,270
has been selected.

110
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,530
How could this happen?

111
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,510
Did Wu Qi

112
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,080
not do as I said?

113
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,680
Wu Qi did

114
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,640
do as you ordered

115
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,410
and submitted the agreement

116
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,140
you gave him.

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,570
But unexpectedly,

118
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,030
it was stopped by

119
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,920
the sudden appearance of the Empress.

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,650
The Empress?

121
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,590
Yes.

122
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,080
Her Majesty saved

123
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,210
Xu Zilu and Ling Se

124
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,070
and lent him a swift horse

125
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,930
from the palace

126
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,260
to get new incense.

127
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,190
That's why

128
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,990
Xu Zilu could make it in time.

129
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,409
Well, that's... surprising.

130
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,440
Since when did they have

131
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,770
such a powerful backer?

132
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,180
Ping'er...

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,190
Your Highness,

134
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,730
we also have news from Beiyun.

135
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,530
They said that they need a batch of goods urgently.

136
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,130
Got it.

137
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,520
Looks like we really can't

138
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,960
let Xu Zilu live anymore.

139
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,680
I have to find a better reason

140
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,990
to take care of him.

141
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,880
I was so scared just now.

142
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,080
You weren't delayed, right?

143
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,280
No.

144
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,590
How is our incense?

145
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,980
If it weren't for Her Majesty,

146
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,710
he wouldn't have the chance.

147
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,720
Wu Qi!

148
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,340
You scumbag! Bastard!

149
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,300
-Don’t go! I’ll kill you!
-Ling Se.

150
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,720
Calm down.

151
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,040
I think it was Prince Xian

152
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,140
who asked him to do it.

153
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,050
You mean he's siding with Prince Xian?

154
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,120
He has Prince Xian to support him.

155
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,970
We can't afford to mess with him.

156
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,320
I don't care whom he's siding with.

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,750
Anyway, I can't stand the fact

158
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,880
that he betrayed us.

159
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,159
What do you want to do?

160
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,480
I dare not provoke

161
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,400
Prince Xian,

162
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,659
but I can certainly deal with Wu Qi.

163
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,680
How would you like to do it? I'm with you in this.

164
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,210
Let's go.

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,440
Hurry.

166
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,690
Are you sure we need to paste that much?

167
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,450
Yes.

168
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,260
Turn around. Turn around.

169
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,929
One, two, three, go.

170
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,040
What about the cart?

171
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,770
Push it away.

172
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,650
You do it.

173
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:47,570
You...

174
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,070
Wait for me.

175
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,500
Wait for me.

176
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,560
Arrogant bastard.

177
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:57,860
And then?

178
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,760
And then,

179
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,030
Her Majesty appeared out of nowhere

180
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,030
and helped us out.

181
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,580
Her Majesty even lent us a horse

182
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,320
so that we could come back to get the incense in time.

183
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,240
Her Majesty?

184
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,560
You all don't know that, do you?

185
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,120
It's all thanks to Ping'er.

186
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,490
Wang Zhujue,

187
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,520
let me tell you.

188
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,910
Ping'er's aunt is the Empress.

189
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,510
Then, am I not good enough for her?

190
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,810
Indeed.

191
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,120
I didn't expect Mr. Wu

192
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,790
to be such a cowardly

193
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,800
and vain person.

194
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,730
Don't worry, guys.

195
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,130
I've already gotten back at him about this.

196
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,640
Ling Se,

197
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,080
let's not mess with him anymore.

198
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,320
After all, he has the support of Prince Xian.

199
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,970
I know.

200
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,050
The most important thing now

201
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,470
is the sacrificial ceremony.

202
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,080
It's the most significant event

203
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,390
since our shop became the Imperial Commercial Firm.

204
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,450
We can't afford to make any mistakes.

205
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,510
Young Master, you've worked all night in the incense shop.

206
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,150
How about I make some ginseng soup for you

207
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,780
when I get back?

208
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,700
This...

209
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,120
This...

210
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,720
Who did this?

211
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,050
Did you see who did this?

212
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,710
Did you see

213
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,550
who did this?

214
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,200
Xu Zilu.

215
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,730
Ling Se.

216
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,980
You're really something.

217
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,530
[Big Liar]

218
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,810
[Despicable; Shameless; Nasty]

219
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,810
What happened

220
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,910
to make you so angry?

221
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,510
The dishes are getting cold.

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,290
I was screwed by Ling Se and Xu Zilu.

223
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,680
What...

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
did they do to you?

225
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:55,380
They... actually

226
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,910
dumped a bunch of garbage in front of my house.

227
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,520
I didn't

228
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,390
see that coming.

229
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,160
This must be Ling Se's idea.

230
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,030
As the saying goes, women are the most vicious.

231
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,070
I don't know where they

232
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,080
got that garbage.

233
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,120
The servants have been

234
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,300
cleaning until now,

235
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,560
but it still stinks.

236
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,520
They won't last long.

237
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,780
Your Highness,

238
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,260
do you have any plans?

239
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,330
How could I let my own men

240
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,180
suffer?

241
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,680
Don't worry.

242
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,050
I have my own plans.

243
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

244
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,720
If you need anything

245
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,920
in the future, Your Highness,

246
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,050
just give the order.

247
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,970
If I can get that from you,

248
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,950
it's worth all the effort I have invested in you.

249
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:49,490
Let's eat.

250
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,500
Enjoy yourselves.

251
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,020
Come on. You're almost there.

252
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,970
Officers, officers.

253
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,580
What...

254
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,740
can I do for you?

255
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,750
I've been ordered to shut down this place.

256
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,620
Why?

257
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,670
I don't know either.

258
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,280
Go!

259
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,800
Go find Se.

260
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,700
I'll stay here and watch this place.

261
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,850
Go!

262
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,760
Something bad happened!

263
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,680
Just now, a group of soldiers

264
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,040
rushed into the Joy Game Shop,

265
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
saying that we were deceiving customers for money

266
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,520
under the pretense of games

267
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,050
and wanted to shut down our shop!

268
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,710
We opened the shop

269
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,950
with an official license.

270
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,210
How could they do that?

271
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,330
I guess this was Prince Xian's way

272
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,930
of taking revenge for Wu Qi.

273
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,260
Darn Wu Qi.

274
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,460
Seriously?

275
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
He even had my shop shut down.

276
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,710
He even has a stake

277
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,640
in my shop.

278
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,740
It's all your fault.

279
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,730
You didn't even try to stop me yesterday.

280
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,800
I was impulsive.

281
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,100
Anyway, let's just endure it for now.

282
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,080
Let it be, as the Joy Game Shop is already closed.

283
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,550
We can't afford to mess with Prince Xian.

284
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,910
You'd better behave

285
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,320
and don't cause any more trouble these days.

286
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,240
Xu Zilu,

287
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,500
what's wrong with you?

288
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,560
Why are you so cautious and timid

289
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,100
when you're here?

290
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,090
And Prince Xian.

291
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,500
Isn't he just a prince?

292
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,470
Why does he always meddle in others' business?

293
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,190
Exactly.

294
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,560
He first separated

295
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,170
Wang Zhujue and Ping'er.

296
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,590
Now he has my shop closed.

297
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,330
Now, we're sworn enemies.

298
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,310
Sworn enemies.

299
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,490
We can't let that old man off easily.

300
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,130
Then,

301
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,150
what should we do?

302
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Since Prince Xian has made his move,

303
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,010
we'll be targeted

304
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,280
whether we act or not.

305
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,070
The only way we can protect ourselves

306
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,690
is

307
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,640
to fight back.

308
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,380
Fight back.

309
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,010
Then, how do we fight back?

310
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,570
To...

311
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,760
throw trash at the gate of Prince Xian's mansion.

312
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,690
Xu Zilu!

313
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,770
Meili,

314
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,500
ignore him.

315
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,120
Let's go to Wang Zhujue

316
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,990
to discuss it.

317
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,730
Let's go.

318
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,440
I don't believe that Prince Xian

319
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,870
can have everything his way.

320
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,400
Exactly.

321
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,070
I'd give up my life

322
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,000
for Ping'er.

323
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,280
There's no way I'll let her

324
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,600
marry that old bastard!

325
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,030
Right?

326
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:55,790
Yes.

327
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,240
For Wang,

328
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,220
for our sister,

329
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,530
and for our shop.

330
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,100
Isn't he just a prince?

331
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,440
We're not afraid of him.

332
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,630
Right, Se.

333
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,590
Prince Xian has really gone too far.

334
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,000
Se, let me help too.

335
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:07,890
Okay!

336
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,970
Wang!

337
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,490
Ping'er?

338
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,600
Ping'er?

339
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,010
Good, you're all here.

340
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,720
Ping'er.

341
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,150
Why are you out?

342
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,160
Prince Xian has come again to force me to marry him.

343
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,710
My grandfather really couldn't bear it,

344
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,890
so he let me leave.

345
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,540
Your Lordship.

346
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,430
Your Lordship,

347
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,620
Prince Xian has sent a message

348
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,860
saying that he and Her Grace

349
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,400
have set a date for their marriage:

350
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,000
the eighth day of next month.

351
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:36,880
Yes.

352
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:43,840
My girl,

353
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,510
listen to me.

354
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,190
Go now.

355
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,530
Grandpa,

356
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,330
what did you say?

357
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,520
Go find

358
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
that rascal.

359
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,250
Go out of the city together

360
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,310
and leave here.

361
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,310
Find a place

362
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,860
where no one can find you,

363
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,350
and never come back!

364
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,470
I can't leave you here alone.

365
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,560
Don't worry about me.

366
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,240
My girl,

367
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,960
you are my beloved granddaughter, whom I raised.

368
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,200
I can't bear to see you

369
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,290
cry every day.

370
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,510
If you have made up your mind,

371
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,200
leave now.

372
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,330
Then...

373
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,490
What about Prince Xian?

374
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,380
Kid,

375
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,010
don't worry.

376
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,010
Even if the sky were to fall,

377
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,770
Grandpa is here for you.

378
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
Grandpa.

379
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,650
My granddaughter.

380
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,250
Ping'er,

381
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
since you're out,

382
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,840
how about this?

383
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,500
You go with Wang Zhujue first.

384
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,740
Go back to Linchun.

385
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,390
Leave Prince Xian to us.

386
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:45,790
Yes.

387
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,260
Yes.

388
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:47,860
Se,

389
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,840
calm down.

390
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,730
Let me finish.

391
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,860
I just got some news.

392
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,370
For years, Prince Xian

393
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,030
has been making illegal deals

394
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,180
with Beiyun State.

395
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,550
If we can

396
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,760
find evidence of Prince Xian's smuggling activities,

397
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,640
we can really

398
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,550
bring him down.

399
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
And I don't have to hide anymore.

400
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,400
Smuggling? Really?

401
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,920
That's a serious offense that could cost your life.

402
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,530
It's true.

403
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,650
Ling Se.

404
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,940
Stop leading everyone into trouble.

405
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,310
I'm not.

406
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,320
Didn't you hear what Ping'er said?

407
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,950
Prince Xian has been smuggling.

408
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,350
He has committed a crime.

409
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,470
As long as we can find evidence against him,

410
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,200
Ping'er and Wang Zhujue

411
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,980
will be free,

412
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,610
and my shop can be reopened.

413
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,160
It's not as simple

414
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,430
as you think.

415
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,510
Do you know

416
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,040
what he has been smuggling?

417
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,980
What?

418
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,070
Fire lances.

419
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,550
What are those?

420
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,160
A special firearm from Qing state.

421
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,640
Beiyun and Qing

422
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,090
are now at war.

423
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,390
The fire lances are the most important

424
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,250
military equipment of our state.

425
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,430
Prince Xian is, indeed, an old bastard.

426
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,140
Isn't smuggling guns

427
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,310
a form of indirectly

428
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,970
killing our fellow citizens?

429
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,310
Xu Zilu,

430
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,150
how did you come to

431
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,030
know this?

432
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,420
Prince Xian

433
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,240
was using

434
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,300
my Third Uncle's caravan to smuggle.

435
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,390
After my uncle found out about it,

436
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,119
he was killed by Prince Xian.

437
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,660
It was Prince Xian who killed him.

438
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:17,760
How could you hide such a big thing

439
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,720
from me?

440
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,190
Because I wanted to keep you out of danger.

441
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,839
Then how can you

442
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,900
face danger alone?

443
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,000
Xu Zilu, we've talked about it.

444
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,920
Come what may,

445
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,430
we'll work together and share weal and woe.

446
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,830
Are you trying to leave me out of this again?

447
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,050
Enough.

448
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,730
Enough.

449
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,160
It's not merely

450
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,080
a personal grudge.

451
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,240
The most important thing now

452
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,030
is to find evidence

453
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,760
of Prince Xian smuggling and colluding with the enemy.

454
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,470
-Yes.
-Yes.

455
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,440
It's fine

456
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,920
if we know nothing about this.

457
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,110
Now that we know about it,

458
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,480
we must find a way to stop him.

459
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,310
We mustn't be afraid of

460
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,160
Prince Xian.

461
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,270
That's right.

462
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,900
He's just a prince.

463
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,270
He's nothing!

464
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,090
Exactly.

465
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,600
If we allow him

466
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,680
to continue smuggling munitions,

467
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,300
won't

468
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,820
all our fellow citizens suffer?

469
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,110
Yes!

470
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,190
Xu Zilu,

471
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,040
let us do this with you.

472
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,320
I promise.

473
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,670
I'll listen to you.

474
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,440
Looks like

475
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,480
I can't talk you out of it.

476
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,950
Okay.

477
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:19,820
We can take action about it,

478
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,710
but we must follow the plan.

479
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,010
I've just

480
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,890
got some news too.

481
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,990
Beiyun is in a state of emergency.

482
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,760
It's very likely

483
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,820
that they'll have another deal soon.

484
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,790
So, our target

485
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:35,570
this time

486
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,670
[Missing Person]

487
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,780
is him.

488
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,160
The foreman of the Third Master's Chamber of Commerce.

489
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,030
He is fat

490
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,120
and speaks with a strong accent.

491
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,040
But we've investigated him.

492
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,080
He is actually

493
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:46,720
a mole planted around the Third Master

494
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,970
by Prince Xian.

495
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,710
Ever since the Third Master

496
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,050
was killed by Prince Xian,

497
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,800
he has also disappeared without a trace.

498
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,810
So, we believe

499
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,680
that as long as we can find him

500
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,390
and keep an eye on him,

501
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,200
we will find evidence

502
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,660
of Prince Xian smuggling.

503
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,700
Fat

504
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,170
and speaks with a strong accent.

505
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,540
But Furong City is so big.

506
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,840
Where can we find him?

507
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,170
I'm good at finding people.

508
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:09,800
How about this?

509
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Tomorrow,

510
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,470
we'll look for him in four areas:

511
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,370
the eastern, western, southern, and northern parts of the city.

512
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,400
See if

513
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
he has passed by some places.

514
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,310
Be careful, everyone.

515
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,210
Report back to me if you learn anything.

516
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,820
Ling Se.

517
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,740
Take it.

518
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,300
Especially you.

519
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,380
You're nagging like an old man.

520
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:32,870
I know.

521
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,540
I will protect myself.

522
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,040
Okay.

523
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,940
Let me take another look.

524
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,480
Well.

525
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,960
Your Highness,

526
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,480
we have received news from Beiyun.

527
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,360
They hope that we can

528
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,950
deliver the goods as soon as possible.

529
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,610
Otherwise,

530
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,600
they will withdraw

531
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,800
the 30,000 elite soldiers that were sent to reinforce us.

532
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,930
Give it to them.

533
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,860
I'll deal with them

534
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,440
once I've achieved my goals.

535
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,700
Yes.

536
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,020
Have the arrangements for Xu Zilu

537
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,030
been made?

538
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,790
I've given the potassium nitrate to Foreman Wang

539
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,290
and asked him to find a chance

540
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,500
to add it to the line incense for the sacrificial ceremony.

541
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,250
Good.

542
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,930
Let's see how he can fight against me now.

543
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,920
Why do they get to

544
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,770
go out to search for the foreman

545
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,520
while we're stuck here

546
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,380
overseeing the incense-making?

547
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,130
After all, my brother-in-law is an Imperial Merchant.

548
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,550
The sacrificial ceremony is coming.

549
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,190
If anything goes wrong

550
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,170
with the incense,

551
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,680
we'll all face execution.

552
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,650
So,

553
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,700
our mission

554
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,890
is more important.

555
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,620
It better be.

556
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,120
Good morning.

557
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,990
You've seen Ping'er now.

558
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,250
Look how happy you are.

559
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,240
Of course.

560
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,940
If you're going to keep grinning like that,

561
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,710
you might as well move out and stay at an inn.

562
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,160
I've found a lead.

563
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,440
How can you treat a hero like this?

564
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,320
What lead?

565
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,960
Greetings, Master and Madam.

566
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,000
Yesterday, inspired

567
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,330
by your prank on Xu Zilu,

568
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,680
I had the beggars search for that man.

569
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,650
I didn't expect it to be this effective.

570
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,570
Within a day,

571
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:12,830
they found

572
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,630
the whereabouts of the foreman.

573
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,120
What are we waiting for?

574
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,390
Hurry up. Let's go find him.

575
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:17,840
Let's go.

576
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,600
Let's go.

577
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,360
Why does this road

578
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,930
seem more and more familiar?

579
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,610
That is the place.

580
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,490
[Xu's Incense Shop]

581
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,020
Isn't this your incense shop?

582
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Are you sure this is the right place?

583
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,220
One of my men

584
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,240
spotted him nearby

585
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
just moments ago.

586
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,540
Grind it carefully.

587
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,950
I'll take over when I'm back.

588
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:43,730
Make way.

589
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,490
Well, Miss Tao,

590
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,900
would you mind watching over this place for me?

591
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,460
I... I need to use the restroom.

592
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,200
Go ahead.

593
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,610
Okay.

594
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,470
Fine, I could use some exercise anyway.

595
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,130
I'm sorry.

596
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,330
I'm sorry.

597
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,400
Go back to work.

598
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,220
Are you okay?

599
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm fine. Just read your book.

600
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,480
What is this ingredient?

601
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,640
Why don't I remember that we need to use this

602
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,570
to make incense?

603
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,730
I'm sorry.

604
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,060
No.

605
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,270
He's that foreman!

606
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,000
Go after him!

607
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,120
I-I-It's him.

608
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,850
Let's go.

609
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,690
Let's go.

610
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,450
That foreman

611
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,030
put something in your incense!

612
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,430
Yes!

613
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,520
You stay here and watch.

614
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,580
We'll go after him.

615
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,830
You've done your job.

616
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,740
I've completed the task

617
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,800
that His Highness ordered.

618
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Well done.

619
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,520
Tomorrow's sacrificial ceremony

620
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,920
will mark the end for Xu Zilu and the others.

621
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,990
His Highness said

622
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,470
that tomorrow's transaction with Beiyun at the dilapidated temple

623
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,820
on the eastern side of the city

624
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,000
must succeed; failure is not an option.

625
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,970
Let His Highness rest assured.

626
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,000
I will do my utmost

627
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,350
to carry out his orders.

628
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,420
Tao Meili,

629
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,990
you are really amazing.

630
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,480
We owe our thanks to Miss Tao

631
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,430
for discovering the tainted incense.

632
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,160
If

633
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,980
that incense had been used during the ceremony,

634
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,430
the consequences would have been catastrophic.

635
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,340
Of course.

636
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,390
Let's see

637
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,670
who dares to underestimate me in the future.

638
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,330
Yes.

639
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,440
Actually,

640
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,750
it's mostly my fault.

641
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,480
My ill-timed bathroom break

642
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,810
almost led to disaster.

643
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,460
But...

644
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:36,170
thanks to the leadership of

645
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,800
the beautiful, gorgeous, and fairy-like

646
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,200
Miss Tao,

647
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,600
we were able to avert this disaster.

648
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,550
She's simply

649
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,920
the modern female version of Di Renjie.

650
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,520
Awesome.

651
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,890
Tomorrow, the foreman

652
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,990
will conduct a trade with Beiyun

653
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,600
at the dilapidated temple on the eastern side of the city.

654
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,050
If we can catch them

655
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,630
and get

656
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,270
Prince Xian's secret letter,

657
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,080
we might be able to expose

658
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,410
his scheme to the world.

659
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,120
Let's

660
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,510
cheer for tomorrow's plans.

661
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,840
Okay.

662
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,650
For Xu's Shop!

663
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,900
For Ping'er!

664
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,300
For the people!

665
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,410
For the masses!

666
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,490
For Qing!

667
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,510
Let's do it!

668
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,720
Eunuch,

669
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,640
the line incense for the sacrificial ceremony

670
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,340
is all here.

671
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,870
Okay.

672
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,120
I'll take it with me.

673
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,500
Take care, Eunuch.

674
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,280
Let's go and get that foreman.

675
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,140
Let's prepare.

676
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,430
Young Master.

677
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,910
Why aren't they here yet?

678
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,690
Be patient.

679
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,820
The information should be correct.

680
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,210
They're coming.

681
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,990
This is the place.

682
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,820
Only three people?

683
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,690
That's easy.

684
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,640
Later, follow my instructions.

685
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,170
I'll distract them first,

686
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,520
and then, you circle behind and surround them.

687
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,720
No, that's too risky.

688
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,270
I've got a plan for it.

689
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,240
Be careful.

690
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
-Let’s go.
-Okay.

691
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,820
Here.

692
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,080
How long do we have to wait?

693
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,540
Yeah.

694
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,220
When will they come?

695
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:29,800
One.

696
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:31,980
Two.

697
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,370
Three.

698
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,950
They all

699
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,030
look fierce.

700
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,960
They definitely can't be someone good.

701
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,570
Ling Shuo.

702
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,160
Did you see them?

703
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,550
Yes. Yes.

704
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,560
Which one is in charge?

705
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,110
Come out!

706
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,040
I am.

707
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,570
May I help you, miss?

708
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,150
I planted these trees.

709
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,360
I made this road.

710
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,020
If you want to use this road,

711
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,140
you must pay a toll.

712
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,100
Toll?

713
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,290
We always take this route.

714
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,550
Why is there a toll now?

715
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,840
Because you've met

716
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,160
me!

717
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,150
My eyes!

718
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,150
Don't move!

719
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,750
Fuding, keep an eye on them.

720
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,180
Okay!

721
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,910
I'll kill anyone who moves!

722
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,870
How is it, Xu Zilu?

723
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,980
We've caught them.

724
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
Should we just wait for

725
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,230
the envoys from Beiyun State to come?

726
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,430
Why do I have a feeling this was too easy?

727
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,180
Don't you find it strange too?

728
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,430
No.

729
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,450
It's easy because

730
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,740
I have chili pepper.

731
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,010
Fuding, keep an eye on them!

732
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,080
Stop!

733
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,870
Don't get up!

734
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,510
What is this?

735
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,240
Oh no.

736
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,460
It's a signal bomb!

737
00:27:59,030 --> 00:27:59,780
Stop!

738
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,250
Let's go!

739
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:02,740
Go!

740
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,970
Let's go after them!

741
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,890
Stop!

742
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,520
Why do you flee at the sight of me?

743
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,020
Stop!

744
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,450
Why are you chasing me?

745
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,740
Why are you running?

746
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,200
You're chasing me, leaving me no choice but to run!

747
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,000
Stop running!

748
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,930
Stop chasing me!

749
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,910
Stop chasing me!

750
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,860
The goods are fine.

751
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,760
Boss Wu,

752
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,880
be careful.

753
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,000
Xu Zilu and the others

754
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,050
won't find me out, right?

755
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,780
Don't worry.

756
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,160
His Highness has a brilliant plan.

757
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,000
They are

758
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,950
still chasing Foreman Wang.

759
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,730
What a feint!

760
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,100
His Highness is so wise.

761
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,300
But how did His Highness find out

762
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,670
Xu Zilu's plan?

763
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,930
That foreman

764
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,340
put something in your incense.

765
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,640
Yes!

766
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,280
You stay here and watch.

767
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,000
We'll go after them.

768
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,260
You have done your job.

769
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,100
Idiot.

770
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,340
See the men you used.

771
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,970
He didn't even know he was being followed.

772
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,300
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

773
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,950
I'll get rid of Foreman Wang now.

774
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,420
Wait.

775
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,250
Let them go after him first.

776
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,880
They will not discover that I have already replaced the goods

777
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,270
until they catch up with him.

778
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,140
Let's take our time

779
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,490
to enjoy the good show.

780
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,690
Your Highness is wise.

781
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,140
Xu Zilu,

782
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,060
do you really think

783
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,460
you're one step ahead of me?

784
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,680
So childish.

785
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,310
Where do you think you can run?

786
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,490
Run if you dare!

787
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,740
I have no grudge against you.

788
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,510
You... You chased me and detained my workers.

789
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
I'm going to report this to the police!

790
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,330
You still dare to report it?

791
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,410
Help me up!

792
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,440
When we find the secret letter,

793
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,040
we'll send you to the police!

794
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,030
Hand over the secret letter.

795
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,460
Search me.

796
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,060
I don't have it.

797
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,050
Go!

798
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,370
Hurry up!

799
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,930
Hurry up!

800
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,510
Go!

801
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:19,680
Get down!

802
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:20,990
How is it?

803
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:21,870
I've asked.

804
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,950
None of them are from Beiyun.

805
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,690
Oh no.

806
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,780
You're Xu Zilu?

807
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:35,630
Yes.

808
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,490
What's the matter?

809
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,720
Arrest him!

810
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,320
Wait.

811
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,310
You've got the wrong person.

812
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,530
They are the ones you should arrest.

813
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,590
The Ministry of Justice has issued an order.

814
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,670
There is something wrong with the incense

815
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,630
used in the sacrificial ceremony.

816
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,550
So we need to arrest Xu Zilu

817
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,300
and bring him back for interrogation.

818
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,240
It must be a misunderstanding.

819
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,440
Have you made a mistake?

820
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,830
No matter what the truth is,

821
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,090
Xu Zilu, the man in charge,

822
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,800
must be put into prison for interrogation.

823
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,280
No.

824
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,620
You can't arrest him.

825
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,670
This is not up to you.

826
00:30:59,150 --> 00:30:59,880
Let go of him!

827
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,710
Fine.

828
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,680
I'll go back with you.

829
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,490
Zilu.

830
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,480
It's okay.

831
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,850
Wait for me.

832
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,860
I'll find a way.

833
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,670
You must protect yourself.

834
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,180
Got it?

835
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,030
Take him away.

836
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,370
Yes.

837
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,440
Let's go.

838
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,370
Don't touch her!

839
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:21,820
Go!

840
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:22,990
Hurry up!

841
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,470
Wang.

842
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,030
Wang.

843
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,630
Hurry back and take Ping'er away.

844
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,860
Go as far away as you can.

845
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,720
-Okay.
-Hurry.

846
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,270
Wang.

847
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:48,200
You

848
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,260
come back so early.

849
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Your Grace, have you heard

850
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,170
the news from the palace?

851
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,040
The incense used in the sacrificial ceremony

852
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,440
exploded.

853
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,910
Now, Xu Zilu

854
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,280
is as well dead.

855
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,990
How is that possible?

856
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,950
Yesterday...

857
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,660
This is the end of this matter.

858
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,650
Ping'er,

859
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,140
you've had your fun.

860
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,080
It's time to go back with me.

861
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,090
I can't go back with you.

862
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,770
I didn't mean

863
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,400
to make things difficult for you on purpose.

864
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,580
But you should know

865
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,680
that no matter how long you stay,

866
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,230
the result will be the same,

867
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,030
right?

868
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,470
Now, the Xu family

869
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,600
has such a big event.

870
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,410
I have something to tell Se.

871
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,240
I have something to discuss with her.

872
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,840
Please go back first, Your Highness.

873
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,370
I'll go back home tomorrow.

874
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,730
I know what you're thinking.

875
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,160
Ping'er.

876
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,490
At this point,

877
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,560
where can you escape to?

878
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,020
Who else

879
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,530
can take you away?

880
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,270
If you don't want me

881
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,910
to make things difficult for your grandpa,

882
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,510
just listen to me, okay?

883
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,480
Okay.

884
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,760
But please

885
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,300
let me stay here a little longer.

886
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,560
Okay.

887
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,170
I'll grant your wish

888
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,810
to have a proper goodbye to him.

889
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,880
Ping'er.

890
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,450
Pack up and come with me.

891
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,480
Wang,

892
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:27,910
are you alright?

893
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,350
Yes.

894
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,710
Where do you want to go?

895
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,430
Why is he here?

896
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,800
Ping'er won't

897
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
go with you today.

898
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,690
Ping'er.

899
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,290
Now that you've seen him,

900
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,610
we should go back.

901
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,960
You wish!

902
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,560
Ping'er, don't be afraid.

903
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,500
Even if I were to die today,

904
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,490
I wouldn't let you take Ping'er away.

905
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,220
Wang Zhujue, don't be so arrogant.

906
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:57,650
Later,

907
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,960
you will cry and beg me.

908
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,310
I beg you?

909
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,320
Nonsense!

910
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,130
Bring him over!

911
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,179
On your knees!

912
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,230
Look.

913
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,710
What did I say?

914
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,340
Dad!

915
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,790
Jue! Don't come over!

916
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,350
-Dad!
-Don't move!

917
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,280
Don't come over!

918
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,040
Let him go!

919
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,570
On what grounds can you arrest my father?

920
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,480
Because... he is a primary suspect

921
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,639
in colluding with

922
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,920
the merchant, Xu Zilu.

923
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,949
Nonsense!

924
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,590
My father is clean.

925
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,790
How is that possible?

926
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,469
I said he is,

927
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,320
and then he is.

928
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,070
I'll kill you!

929
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,960
Wang.

930
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,930
Jue!

931
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Kill me first if you want to kill him!

932
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,100
Out of my way!

933
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,760
-Ping'er.
-Wang.

934
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,720
Ping'er.

935
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,980
This is all part of your trap.

936
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,420
Isn't it you who are

937
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,120
determined to challenge me?

938
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,820
You are so despicable!

939
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,880
I've warned you a long time ago.

940
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,310
It's you who are dreaming of taking down the bear.

941
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,370
You're overestimating yourselves.

942
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,850
Now, everyone's life

943
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,300
is in my hands.

944
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,560
Wang!

945
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,100
Ping'er.

946
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,250
I'll give you one last chance.

947
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,390
Will you marry me or not?

948
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:15,470
Fine.

949
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,470
I'll marry you,

950
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,320
but you have to

951
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,370
let my friends go.

952
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,370
As long as

953
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,630
even one of my friends is hurt,

954
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,470
I will never let you go, even when I'm dead.

955
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,060
Ping'er!

956
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,300
Wang Zhujue.

957
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,290
Okay.

958
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,860
I'll comply with all of your wishes.

959
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,390
Our wedding is near anyway.

960
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,420
You can

961
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,240
stay at my mansion now.

962
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,290
As for the Marquis,

963
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,450
I'll tell him about it in person later.

964
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,170
Take Her Highness back.

965
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,220
Yes! Take him away!

966
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:51,610
Go!

967
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,420
Father.

968
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,500
Don't worry.

969
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,460
I'm fine, Jue.

970
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,360
Move.

971
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,310
Wang.

972
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,230
I'll leave Wang Zhujue

973
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,550
in your care.

974
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,950
Ping'er!

975
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,380
Wang.

976
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,210
Wang.

977
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,970
Ping'er!

978
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:45,710
Wang.
