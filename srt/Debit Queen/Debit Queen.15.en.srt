00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,039
[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,870
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,750
This is quite delicious.

4
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:41,440
Yes. It's pretty good.

5
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,700
They are even having pastries together.

6
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,660
Young Master.

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,660
Young... Young Madam.

8
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,009
Why are you here?

9
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,350
I wanted to ask you

10
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,810
the same question.

11
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,290
Moreover, why are you here with him?

12
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,820
I heard that Mr. Wu

13
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,060
knows quite a lot about dessert.

14
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,470
So I specially invited him to go up the mountain with me

15
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,600
to do some research,

16
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,660
and see what dessert

17
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,120
is the best in this season.

18
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,580
Mr. Xu, we met again.

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,440
It seems that

20
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,660
we really have some sort of connection.

21
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,360
What about you?

22
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,710
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,770
Young Master is here to see the wood used to make incense.

24
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,710
So are you on your way to do that,

25
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,060
or are you heading home?

26
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,600
We haven't started yet.

27
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,280
A meeting by chance is better than an appointment agreed upon.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,930
I wanted to walk with you, Mr. Xu.

29
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,440
But since you're busy with something, Mr. Xu,

30
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,360
then forget it.

31
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,010
It's okay.

32
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,870
We're going the same way.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,800
Let's walk together.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,829
Boss.

35
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,320
Help me find

36
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,520
that carpenter we need.

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,180
No problem.

38
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,070
Leave it to me.

39
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,250
It's so hot climbing mountains in winter.

40
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,060
I'm sweating.

41
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,200
Have another bowl of water.

42
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:00,870
Wipe it.

43
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,740
Use mine.

44
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,090
It's the same,

45
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,370
using either of yours.

46
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,070
After all, my wife used it.

47
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,870
If you don't mind, Mr. Wu,

48
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,730
I'll ask Fuding

49
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,470
to wash it before giving it back to you.

50
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,310
I don't mind.

51
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,310
After all, the original intention of both of us

52
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,470
was to prevent Ms. Ling

53
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,070
from catching a cold, right?

54
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,770
I'm not that delicate.

55
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,829
I'm in good health.

56
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,470
Ms. Ling.

57
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,160
I saw there's a house in front

58
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,560
with corn silk hanging on the roof.

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
Let's go check it out.

60
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,550
Okay.

61
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,230
Ping'er.

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,940
Isn't that mountain beautiful?

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,460
Yes.

64
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,329
That mountain is huge.

65
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,260
-It’s also pretty over there.
-Se!

66
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,210
Se, why are you here?

67
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,250
Ping'er, why are you here?

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,150
So this is why

69
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,810
you borrowed clothes from me.

70
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,810
The academy is on holiday today,

71
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,630
so we thought we could go mountain climbing together.

72
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,980
Now that we've met,

73
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,829
let's go hiking together.

74
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,400
I brought a tent.

75
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,270
How about we

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,050
camp here tonight

77
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,910
and not go back?

78
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,430
Okay.

79
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,210
I saw a farmhouse

80
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,280
on the roadside just now.

81
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,390
It's already noon. Ping'er must be hungry.

82
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,790
How about we go eat there?

83
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,470
By the way,

84
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,680
this is Wu Qi, Mr. Wu.

85
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,470
Well, Mr. Wu,

86
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,310
how about we skip the house with corn silk

87
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,370
for now?

88
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,110
Okay.

89
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,269
This doesn't happen every day.

90
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,130
Of course, the priority is for everyone to have fun.

91
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,990
Let's go.

92
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,340
Ma'am.

93
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,020
Ma'am.

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,720
We want to buy

95
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,780
some ingredients from you.

96
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,230
Hope it's not too much trouble for you.

97
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,290
You need to buy a lot of ingredients,

98
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,820
and there are so many of you.

99
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,440
You'll have to pay me

100
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,010
at least 10 taels of silver.

101
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Ten taels?

102
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,380
Ma'am.

103
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,760
This is too expensive.

104
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,820
Give us a discount.

105
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,400
Five taels then,

106
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,720
but you'll have to cook by yourselves.

107
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,120
I won't put in labor then.

108
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,900
Ten taels of silver is not expensive.

109
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,230
It's not cheap either.

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,020
Okay. Five taels it is.

111
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,440
We'll cook by ourselves.

112
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,470
Pay her.

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,140
On our way here,

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,390
I saw a pond over there.

115
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,180
Let's go wash vegetables there later.

116
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:19,960
It's only fun to cook by ourselves

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,100
since we're out here having fun.

118
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,650
Okay.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,670
We'll go wash the vegetables.

120
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,380
Let's go.

121
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:24,920
Let's go.

122
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
How interesting.

123
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,540
The chicken is good.

124
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,810
The onions are quite pungent.

125
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,659
Let me help you with them.

126
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,260
Thank you.

127
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,350
How can we ask a guest to help?

128
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,990
Mr. Wu.

129
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,690
Go find a place to rest.

130
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,790
We're all on this trip together.

131
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,280
Don't treat me as a guest.

132
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,040
I paid the five taels,

133
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,950
so of course I am the host.

134
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,140
You can be my guest.

135
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,460
What you're holding

136
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,850
smells so good, Mr. Xu.

137
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,810
This is popcorn, right?

138
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,750
Try it.

139
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,050
I'm in the middle of garlic peeling.

140
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,360
It's delicious.

141
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,760
Isn't this better

142
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,080
than some corn silk?

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,230
Mastering the doneness of popcorn

144
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,310
is very difficult.

145
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,630
It sure is.

146
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,150
But for me,

147
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,760
it's simple.

148
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,340
It's okay. It's okay.

149
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,070
Wang.

150
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,760
How about I catch it?

151
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,770
No, no.

152
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,670
Let me do

153
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
such petty stuff.

154
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,260
Don't come near me!

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,170
Don't come over!

156
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,170
I didn't offend you.

157
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,100
Don't come over!

158
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,250
No! No!

159
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,400
Don't come near me!

160
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,550
Don't come near me!

161
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,220
Help!

162
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,550
Be good. You're the chosen one.

163
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,630
Help me!

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,800
What's wrong?

165
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,240
It's only dew.

166
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,630
Stop peeling it.

167
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,750
Go wipe your tears.

168
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,600
Your hands are dirty too.

169
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,530
Go wash your hands and then wipe it.

170
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,500
Come on.

171
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,900
Over there.

172
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,190
There.

173
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,990
Look at him. He can't do it,

174
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,440
yet he's acting tough.

175
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,650
Coming up.

176
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,960
Here comes the chicken stew.

177
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,010
You must be hungry.

178
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,460
Eat it while it's warm.

179
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,630
Ping'er.

180
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,220
This is your favorite.

181
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:01,850
Eat more.

182
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,470
Put it back.

183
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,960
They are all watching.

184
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,150
So what?

185
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,070
There are so many dishes here.

186
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,190
This is the chicken you...

187
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,140
This is the chicken we caught together.

188
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,270
It's okay. Eat more.

189
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,790
Ms. Ling.

190
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,400
You've worked hard.

191
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,260
Here, eat more.

192
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:18,870
Thank you.

193
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,790
You too.

194
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,960
Here.

195
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,789
Let's eat.

196
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:36,940
Thank you.

197
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,450
Here.

198
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,789
It's okay, I can do it myself.

199
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,830
Ling Se.

200
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,170
You must be tired from cooking.

201
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:47,740
Here.

202
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,870
Thank you.

203
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,670
Have one more.

204
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,510
It's okay.

205
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,510
I'll help you if you can't finish it.

206
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,680
Is it pretty?

207
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,990
Wang.

208
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,420
You're so dexterous.

209
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,690
Be careful. Watch your steps.

210
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,780
I'm okay.

211
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,680
I'm holding it tight.

212
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,210
Se.

213
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,510
Ping'er.

214
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,120
Is it pretty?

215
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,740
Where did you get this?

216
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,860
Wang made it for me.

217
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,710
He's quite dexterous.

218
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,800
It's pretty.

219
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,380
Shut up!

220
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,100
Wang.

221
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,050
Let's go.

222
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:41,940
I'm a little scared.

223
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,540
Don't be scared. Be careful.

224
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,280
Slow down.

225
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,790
Ling Se.

226
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,080
Here you are.

227
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,660
You made one too?

228
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,540
Is it pretty?

229
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,230
Yes.

230
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,030
So much delicious food.

231
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,070
Mr. Wu.

232
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,770
You are so well-prepared.

233
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,090
No matter how well-prepared I am,

234
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:13,930
no food here is as delicious

235
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,840
as the popcorn Mr. Xu made this noon.

236
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,410
Mr. Xu.

237
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,780
Why don't you show us your cooking skills

238
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,180
and make some more for us?

239
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,950
You know how to make popcorn?

240
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,020
Yes.

241
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,950
Not only does he know how to cook it,

242
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,860
but he also makes it very delicious.

243
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,610
How about you make some more

244
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:27,610
for us?

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,860
I also want to learn how to make it.

246
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,610
Well,

247
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,890
making popcorn is very troublesome.

248
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,600
It requires a lot of ingredients.

249
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,080
I can't make it today.

250
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,340
Why not?

251
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:41,880
I haven't had

252
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,300
anything you cooked yet.

253
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,090
Besides,

254
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,190
we don't have much to do today.

255
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,150
You can take your time.

256
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,070
You're really making yourself at home.

257
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,600
Of course. We're such

258
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,860
good friends.

259
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,770
Mr. Xu.

260
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,070
I've got

261
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,830
all the ingredients you need ready for you.

262
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,170
There are really a lot of them.

263
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,450
You actually got them all.

264
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,650
I'll go get some wood.

265
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,630
Look.

266
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,380
Thank you for your effort, Mr. Wu.

267
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,040
Well, then.

268
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
It seems I have to show you what I got.

269
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,120
Are you sure about putting sugar in before anything else?

270
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,370
Why do you need so many seasonings?

271
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,830
It's my secret recipe.

272
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,150
Wang.

273
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,630
Is this the right way to make popcorn?

274
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,220
Shouldn't he add oil

275
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,700
to fry the popcorn?

276
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,480
This is what you don't know.

277
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,030
I'm only putting in oil

278
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,780
to fry the burnt aroma out of it.

279
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,630
Mr. Xu.

280
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,250
I suddenly remembered

281
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,230
I'll need the oil for barbecue later.

282
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,230
How about you make it some other day?

283
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,550
You should have said it earlier.

284
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,900
It seems I can't taste your cooking today.

285
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,340
What's so good about popcorn?

286
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,470
I'm going to eat grilled meat.

287
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,400
Right, Ping'er.

288
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,910
Let's go grill some meat.

289
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,610
If he finished this,

290
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,000
it might have tasted quite special.

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,540
I don't know whether it'd have been delicious though.

292
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,540
I'll remember it.

293
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,790
Mr. Xu.

294
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,070
Remember to make it for me next time.

295
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,650
Well,

296
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,750
since I paid

297
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,280
for today's dinner,

298
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,560
now I'm the host, and you're the guest.

299
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,150
I don't know how to make popcorn,

300
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,040
but I can grill the meat myself.

301
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:26,810
Mr. Xu, eat more.

302
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,910
I don't like meat.

303
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:30,900
Ping'er.

304
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,190
Have a rest. I'll do it.

305
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,150
Here you are. Grill this.

306
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,910
Okay.

307
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,510
You don't know how to make

308
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,630
popcorn at all,

309
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,260
right?

310
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:42,270
I...

311
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,630
Of course... I do.

312
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,630
All right, don't act tough.

313
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,550
You should thank Mr. Wu.

314
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
If he didn't help you,

315
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,350
you would have embarrassed yourself

316
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,830
in front of everyone.

317
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:54,370
Come on.

318
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,800
Have some grilled meat.

319
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,920
I'll put these vegetables on the sticks.

320
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,320
Let me help you, Ping'er.

321
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,920
It's almost done.

322
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,680
Almost done.

323
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,070
Give me two more sticks.

324
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,230
Here.

325
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,260
Try it.

326
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,690
The rabbit is done.

327
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,520
It's done?

328
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,470
Yes.

329
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,910
Come on. It smells so good.

330
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:20,830
Try it, Ping'er.

331
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,670
No hurry.

332
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,170
I'll split it. Everyone will have a share.

333
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,280
Okay. Okay.

334
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,430
The rabbit smells so good.

335
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,830
Ping'er, be careful.

336
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,140
Mr. Xu.

337
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,620
The rabbit is ready.

338
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,610
Take it away. I don't want it.

339
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,420
The mushroom I'm grilling

340
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,510
is much better than this rabbit.

341
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,590
Mr. Xu.

342
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,600
We're out here to have fun.

343
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Don't be so petty.

344
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,730
Be careful.

345
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:21,740
You guys eat first.

346
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll bring some meat over to Zilu.

347
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,370
Okay.

348
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,050
Try this, Wang.

349
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,130
Okay, Ping'er.

350
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,390
Come on.

351
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:34,440
Have some grilled rabbit meat.

352
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,790
How can you eat bunny meat?

353
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,480
It's fine if you don't want to eat it,

354
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,010
but why are you acting cute?

355
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,950
Try the mushrooms.

356
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,100
Where did you get these mushrooms?

357
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,890
I picked them myself.

358
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,490
You picked them yourself?

359
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,000
Are they even edible?

360
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,970
It tastes weird.

361
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,430
Why did you drink so much wine?

362
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,030
Don't get poisoned

363
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,980
by having wine with this mushroom.

364
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,670
Try it.

365
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,790
No, it's weird.

366
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,010
Why did you throw my mushroom away?

367
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,790
Mr. Xu.

368
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,920
Are you okay?

369
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,030
I'm not.

370
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,540
He's okay.

371
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,310
He's fine.

372
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,070
I think he might be

373
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:31,750
a bit drunk.

374
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
I'll take him to sober up.

375
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,890
Let's go.

376
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,110
You...

377
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,990
Aren't you taking me to eat mushrooms?

378
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,390
Let's go pick mushrooms.

379
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,970
Okay. Let's go pick mushrooms.

380
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,720
Let's go.

381
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,880
Pick mushrooms.

382
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,660
Xu Zilu.

383
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,580
Wait for me.

384
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,690
Who's calling me?

385
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,140
Me.

386
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,200
It's me.

387
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:58,960
Be careful.

388
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,400
Let's go back, okay?

389
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,600
No.

390
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,930
We agreed we'd look for mushrooms.

391
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,780
Look, little mushrooms.

392
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,520
Where?

393
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,109
Where are the mushrooms?

394
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,490
There's no mushroom.

395
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,000
My mushroom is gone.

396
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,120
Where's my mushroom?

397
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,740
Forget it.

398
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,050
I won't bother

399
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,310
being serious with

400
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:42,460
someone who ate poisonous mushrooms.

401
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,860
Where's my mushroom?

402
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,830
Why isn't Se back yet?

403
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,620
This won't do.

404
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,750
I'll go look for her.

405
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,280
The two of them finally

406
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,120
got a chance to be alone.

407
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,380
If you go look for them,

408
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,420
you'll ruin it.

409
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,830
But...

410
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,190
But what?

411
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,550
Go to bed now.

412
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,700
You may grow taller if you sleep early.

413
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,250
I went around the woods a few times,

414
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,870
but I couldn't find them.

415
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,670
What should we do?

416
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:07,590
How about

417
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
we go look for them together?

418
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,830
Why should we look for them?

419
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,470
Can't you just

420
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,800
mind your own business?

421
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,230
I'll go to bed.

422
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:14,910
Listen.

423
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,460
Keep your voice down.

424
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,190
I can be very angry when I get up.

425
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,710
I'm going to bed too.

426
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,550
Let's go.

427
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,080
Let's go.

428
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,990
All of you are in pairs.

429
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,050
I am the only one who's alone.

430
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,620
Wang.

431
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,010
You make it sound so tragic.

432
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,170
Why don't we pair up?

433
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,320
Mom!

434
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,440
Wake up.

435
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,890
Wake up.

436
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,180
Let's have a few more drinks.

437
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,950
Here.

438
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,540
No more.

439
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,450
Bro.

440
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,820
Do you know

441
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,510
I have a wife named Ling Se?

442
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,260
She's

443
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,350
never let me

444
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,990
have peace of mind for even a day.

445
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,850
She's always causing me trouble.

446
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,920
She's so annoying.

447
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,150
But

448
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,530
she's quite cute sometimes.

449
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,080
Why does she have

450
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,480
so many tricks?

451
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,750
I let her out of my sight once...

452
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,150
I poured it out too early.

453
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,450
I let her out of my sight twice,

454
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
she opened a shop.

455
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:44,040
If I let her out of my sight for the third time,

456
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,500
it'll probably be a shock.

457
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,170
But there are still more pleasant surprises than bad ones.

458
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,280
Say something.

459
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,870
Bro.

460
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,670
If you hate her so much,

461
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,830
why don't you have a peaceful divorce with her?

462
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,160
Also, give her the 500 taels.

463
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,060
No, I won't.

464
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,070
Why not?

465
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,110
Because...

466
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,080
I won't tell you.

467
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,390
Because

468
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,480
I don't want her to leave.

469
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,310
I don't want that.

470
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,390
You said you don't want her to leave.

471
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,410
Why is that?

472
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,870
Xu Zilu?

473
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,240
Xu Zilu.

474
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,760
Mr. Wu.

475
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,050
I’ve been waiting for you.

476
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:17,950
I thought

477
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,570
you should be somewhere else

478
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,480
even if you're not in Furong City,

479
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,840
but I didn't expect you to be so elusive that

480
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,470
you actually came back to Linchun, Mr. Xu.

481
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,440
Mr. Wu, you're free and unrestrained.

482
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,700
You wander around the world carefreely.

483
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,790
The noble higher-up is busy.

484
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,580
He knew you are here,

485
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,590
so he asked me

486
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,950
to bring you this message.

487
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,760
Have you figured out

488
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,780
how to do the business you negotiated before?

489
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,090
Business is business.

490
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,650
Traveling is traveling.

491
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,570
I only do things

492
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,770
out of interest.

493
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,150
I'm afraid

494
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,000
the higher-up

495
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,640
has to wait for a while longer.

496
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,440
Let me give you a piece of advice.

497
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,440
Although the pie of Linchun is big,

498
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,010
it's hard if you want to swallow it in one bite.

499
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,200
Although that noble person's business is good,

500
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,950
he waits for no man.

501
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,890
Thank you for your advice, Mr. Xu.

502
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,040
You're awake.

503
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,960
Are you all right now?

504
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,310
Do you still want to look for mushrooms?

505
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,350
Sorry.

506
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,680
As long as you're okay.

507
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,870
By the way,

508
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,210
do you remember

509
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,670
what happened last night?

510
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,360
A little.

511
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,920
But

512
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,030
I forgot what happened next.

513
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,160
It's good that you forgot.

514
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,920
I was worried that you'd remember everything.

515
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,530
If so,

516
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,600
you should have hung yourself by now.

517
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,270
Actually,

518
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,730
I'm hungry.

519
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,120
Do you want some more mushrooms?

520
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:58,870
All right. All right.

521
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,400
Let's go.

522
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,630
Let's head back.

523
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,010
I guess they are also

524
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,230
waiting for us.

525
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,910
What's wrong?

526
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,990
Are you okay?

527
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm okay.

528
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,560
Are you getting old

529
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:18,520
and having difficulty in walking?

530
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,100
What nonsense are you talking about?

531
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,430
I'll show you how I walk.

532
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,470
All right. All right.

533
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,090
Se!

534
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,110
They are a loving couple.

535
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,910
The husband sprained his ankle, and the wife is taking care of him.

536
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,380
Se!

537
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,610
Ping'er.

538
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,400
You didn't come back all night.

539
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,330
I was so worried.

540
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,430
What happened?

541
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,080
Nothing.

542
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,280
We got lost,

543
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,880
and he sprained his ankle.

544
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,870
So it took us all night,

545
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,270
and we only came back now.

546
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Let's pack up our things and go back.

547
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,130
I'll go then.

548
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,480
Go ahead.

549
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:57,810
Okay.

550
00:26:58,790 --> 00:26:59,400
Wang.

551
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,280
Let me help you.

552
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,480
Why didn't you tell her the truth?

553
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,070
How?

554
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,450
You want me to tell her that you went crazy because you ate poisonous mushrooms?

555
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,890
I have to save your face.

556
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:12,280
Thanks a lot.

557
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:13,100
It's okay.

558
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,850
Why do I feel so thirsty?

559
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,000
It feels like I drank water yesterday,

560
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,730
and I didn't actually drink it.

561
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,140
You didn't drink water all night.

562
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
You should be thirsty.

563
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,270
I'll go get you some.

564
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,650
[Xu Mansion]

565
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,230
Do you really not need to

566
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,400
see a doctor?

567
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,760
What if you get

568
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,590
poisonous mushroom syndrome?

569
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,250
I'm fine.

570
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,170
As long as somebody

571
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,340
gets out of my face.

572
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,120
Why do you

573
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,800
dislike Wu Qi so much?

574
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,220
He never offended you.

575
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,920
It's just because...

576
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,190
I know.

577
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,820
It's just a dough figurine.

578
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,430
Think of it this way.

579
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,430
He spent 1,000 taels

580
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,630
on something

581
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,440
that's only worth two copper coins.

582
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,690
Doesn't that make him a fool?

583
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,460
By the way,

584
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,060
where's the dough figurine

585
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,180
you promised to make me?

586
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,710
I've been waiting for days.

587
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:26,930
How much longer

588
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,860
do I have to wait?

589
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,750
It takes time to make it.

590
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,050
It's not that fast.

591
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,680
Are you trying to cheat?

592
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,060
I'll make it as soon as I get home today.

593
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,660
Young Master, news arrived.

594
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,240
Ask Fuding to go get ready.

595
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,050
Okay.

596
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,160
What's going on?

597
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,190
Nothing.

598
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,350
As expected from a family of incense making.

599
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,680
The longer the time, the better the smell.

600
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,300
It's indeed extraordinary.

601
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,810
This is a new incense

602
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,470
the Xu family developed this year.

603
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,870
It's called Harmony Incense.

604
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:32,690
It'll come out

605
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,040
by the end of next month.

606
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,910
Mr. Qi.

607
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,860
You must seize the moment.

608
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,490
How much stock do you have?

609
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,790
620kg.

610
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,510
It's enough for you to sell for half a month.

611
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,880
Only 620kg?

612
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,700
Every year's special incense

613
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,830
has always been limited.

614
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,230
It’s already good enough

615
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,510
to have 620kg.

616
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,390
Mr. Xu.

617
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,130
How much do you want to charge?

618
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,050
At least...

619
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,280
At least 500 taels.

620
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:02,960
Mr. Xu.

621
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,100
After taking this batch of incense back,

622
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,310
I still have to do the marking and packaging all over again.

623
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,920
The cost is quite big.

624
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,780
Mr. Qi.

625
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,600
How many people

626
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,640
do you think want this batch of incense,

627
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,440
but they may not be able to get it?

628
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,270
I'm only doing this

629
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,030
for the sake of your sincerity, Mr. Qi.

630
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,690
Otherwise,

631
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,960
I wouldn't even bother negotiating with you.

632
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,750
Okay.

633
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,850
500 taels for 620kg.

634
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:29,790
I’ll ask someone to draft the contract right away.

635
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,450
It's pleasant to do business with you, Mr. Qi.

636
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,340
But I need this batch of goods urgently.

637
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,120
Let's trade tonight,

638
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,150
and I'll pay upon delivery.

639
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,400
Okay.

640
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,750
See you

641
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,030
in the East Bamboo Forest tonight.

642
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:44,550
Okay.

643
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,770
Please.

644
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,520
Please.

645
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,010
This...

646
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,060
Why is he

647
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,480
like a bad penny?

648
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,630
Mr. Wu

649
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,870
wants to have an incense competition with you again?

650
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,870
Who else could it be?

651
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,910
So idle every day.

652
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,120
But doesn't Mr. Wu

653
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,030
like Young Madam?

654
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,320
I mean, doesn't Mr. Wu

655
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,990
like the food

656
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,270
cooked by Young Madam?

657
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,050
He goes to the tea shop a lot...

658
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,170
To deliver ingredients.

659
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,210
Why did he suddenly

660
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:15,930
come to you?

661
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,190
If you're so curious,

662
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,700
go ask him yourself.

663
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,500
No. No.

664
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,460
Well...

665
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,690
Young Master, are you going?

666
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,690
No, it's a waste of time.

667
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,480
You're right.

668
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,810
But I wonder if Mr. Wu

669
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,180
will ask Young Madam out

670
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,300
if he can't see you?

671
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,100
Prepare the carriage.

672
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,490
Bosslady.

673
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:49,850
There's a very handsome young master

674
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:51,180
in the private room now.

675
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,490
Do you want to check him out?

676
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,300
I took a glance at him when I came in.

677
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,020
He had such a fake smile.

678
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,280
He's not my type.

679
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,890
Besides,

680
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,580
he's been occupying my best room and wouldn't leave.

681
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,840
I turned down many orders because of him.

682
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,870
I'm afraid

683
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,950
I would jump up and hit him if I see him.

684
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:08,680
Why are you slacking off?

685
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,800
Go back to work.

686
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,170
Mr. Xu, why are you here?

687
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,050
Have a seat.

688
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,930
I'm here to see Mr. Wu.

689
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,000
He's in the private room.

690
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,230
Looks like my private room

691
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,810
won't be available

692
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,810
any time soon.

693
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,850
Mr. Xu, you're really a busy man.

694
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,190
It's so hard to ask you out for dinner.

695
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,770
I didn't expect the one who invited me here

696
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,410
is the head of the Wu Family in Lingnan,

697
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,100
Mr. Wu.

698
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,650
Why do you want to see me?

699
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,380
Since you already know who I am,

700
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,120
I won't beat around the bush.

701
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,760
I came here for no other purpose

702
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,350
but to have an incense competition with you.

703
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,790
I'd like to know which family is the best at incense making

704
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,150
in Daqing,

705
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,420
the Xu family or the Wu family?

706
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,630
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, Mr. Wu.

707
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,260
I said many years ago

708
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,190
that I won't participate in any kind of incense competition.

709
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,180
I have

710
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,710
a long-lost ancient incense-making formula.

711
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,590
If I lose,

712
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,830
I'll give it to you willingly with both hands.

713
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,630
Mr. Xu.

714
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,420
I think you know

715
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,020
the rules of incense competition in Linchun.

716
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,070
Avoiding it means admitting defeat.

717
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,930
You don't want to lose, I suppose.

718
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,270
It doesn't matter if I lose.

719
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,240
I don’t care.

720
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,830
Mr. Wu.

721
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,310
If there's nothing else,

722
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,370
I'll take my leave.

723
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,510
Interesting.

724
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,810
I must have this

725
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,610
incense competition with you.

726
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,620
Ah You.

727
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,580
Go check

728
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,240
why Mr. Qi is still not here.

729
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:01,920
Third Uncle.

730
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,480
There's no need to wait.

731
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,530
They won't come.

732
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:08,790
Fuding.

733
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,110
Yes, Young Master.

734
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,090
Young Master.

735
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,179
[Harmony Incense]

736
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,370
Why is the Harmony Incense

737
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,940
that shouldn't come out until next month

738
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,710
be here?

739
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,010
Third Uncle.

740
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,790
Explain it.

741
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,719
Third Uncle.

742
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,070
You secretly sold

743
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,870
the Xu family's Harmony Incense that hasn't come out

744
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,270
at a high price.

745
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:46,989
Do you admit that?

746
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,880
It's indeed my fault this time.

747
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,590
The limited editions of the Xu family's incense

748
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,449
have always been in short supply.

749
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,139
Every year, many merchants

750
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,199
come to me for them.

751
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,860
I've always declined them.

752
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,240
I only got confused this time

753
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,240
and lost my mind.

754
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,590
Luckily, you came in time, Zilu.

755
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,480
This kind of thing

756
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,550
will never happen again.

757
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,230
Third Uncle.

758
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,700
Are you going to continue lying to me?

759
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,930
You transferred goods without permission to fill your own pockets

760
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:17,330
and altered the ledger to make it look like nothing's wrong.

761
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:18,420
Do you really think

762
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,780
I know nothing about it?

763
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,270
Zilu.

764
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,850
You can't slander me

765
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,830
like this

766
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,460
just because of this one mistake I made, right?

767
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,710
I've been pulling strings

768
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,110
for the family business.

769
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,980
Of course it involves transferring goods and making arrangements.

770
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,020
Sometimes I'd forget about the transfer lists,

771
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,880
but I'd always submit them later.

772
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,770
There's no mistake or error in it whatsoever.

773
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,750
Good.

774
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,780
Fuding.

775
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,420
Young Master, Third Master.

776
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:54,930
Tell us what you know.

777
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,190
Yes.

778
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,610
Third Master sent me a message before,

779
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,700
asking me to avoid our family members

780
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,740
and ship the goods from Xu's.

781
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,140
Some of those goods

782
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,890
were used by Third Master

783
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,550
to maintain his connections,

784
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,800
and some have been sold at a high price

785
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,970
to balance the books.

786
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,370
The last big sum of money

787
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:15,550
went into Third Master's pocket.

788
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,040
You're slandering me.

789
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:19,480
Zilu.

790
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,180
You wouldn't believe

791
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,180
what such a servant said, would you?

792
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,680
The reason why Third Master came back this time

793
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,670
is that Young Master's checking the ledger.

794
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,400
Third Master

795
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,810
wants to make up for the shortfalls

796
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:29,770
in the ledger.

797
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,420
When did I ever ask you to do these things?

798
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,910
And who told you

799
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,460
I'm back

800
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,680
to balance the books?

801
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,750
Third Uncle.

802
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,230
Don't be mad.

803
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,400
You should be able to recognize

804
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:58,130
your own handwriting, right?

805
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,180
These

806
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,150
are the letters

807
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,550
between you and Chen Yun.

808
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:04,270
Do you know

809
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,420
how I got them?
