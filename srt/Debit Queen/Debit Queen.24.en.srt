00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,020
[Debit Queen]

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,940
[Episode 24]

3
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,550
How can you not even

4
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,000
manage to feed her medicine?

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,470
The imperial physician said

6
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,990
Ping'er is only suffering from excessive worry,

7
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,990
nothing serious.

8
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,580
You can’t even handle basic care.

9
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,200
Get lost.

10
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,370
I'll do it myself.

11
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,360
Give it to me.

12
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,700
Get out!

13
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,630
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

14
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,360
Ping'er.

15
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,450
Here, take your medicine.

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,460
It seems a little cold.

17
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,329
I'll

18
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,430
heat it up for you.

19
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,520
Ping'er.

20
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,100
You must take good care of yourself.

21
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,590
I've prepared

22
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,040
a grand wedding for you.

23
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,829
You will be

24
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:40,829
the most radiant bride

25
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,320
in all of Furong City.

26
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:47,980
Alright.

27
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,520
Don't be sad.

28
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,829
You'll understand in the future

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,170
that what I can give you

30
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,690
is far better

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,160
than what you want now.

32
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,640
Forget it.

33
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,400
What you’re offering,

34
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,930
I can’t accept.

35
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,700
When I say you can,

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,730
then you must.

37
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,220
Fine.

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,750
For now,

39
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,390
rest well.

40
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,079
Make sure your blanket is properly tucked.

41
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,140
Don't catch a cold.

42
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,530
[Xu Mansion]

43
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,230
What are you doing?

44
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,760
Leave.

45
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,850
What are you doing?

46
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,370
[Seal]

47
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,350
Who gives you the right to do this?

48
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,950
Leave now,

49
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,390
or we won’t be so polite.

50
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,130
You watchdogs of Prince Xian!

51
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,990
Wang, Wang Zhujue.

52
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,210
Wang Zhujue.

53
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,600
Calm down.

54
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,579
Young Madam.

55
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,600
Young Madam.

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,430
Young Madam, bad news.

57
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,390
Our shops

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,960
have suddenly been sealed.

59
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,120
The shops have been sealed too?

60
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,350
Sister.

61
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,450
What should we do?

62
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,220
Wang Zhujue, don't be like this.

63
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,580
Wang.

64
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,460
Calm down.

65
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,080
Mr. Wang.

66
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,740
Butler Chen.

67
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,830
Take this money

68
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,830
and find us

69
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,790
a place to stay.

70
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,150
Then find a doctor

71
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,080
for Wang Zhujue.

72
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,670
Alright.

73
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,920
Ling Se!

74
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,890
Wanrong.

75
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:19,529
I heard rumors, so I rushed over.

76
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,140
It's okay.

77
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,079
Come with me.

78
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,300
No, Wanrong.

79
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,420
We can't drag you down any further.

80
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,500
I’ll be angry if you say that.

81
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,700
Aren't we friends?

82
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,750
When a friend is in trouble,

83
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,510
how can I stand by and do nothing?

84
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,120
Besides,

85
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,510
Qingfeng is working for the royal family.

86
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,570
They won’t dare do anything drastic.

87
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,120
Young Madam.

88
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,740
Perhaps

89
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,909
it’s best to go to Mrs. Lyu’s place for now.

90
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:41,370
It seems

91
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,900
that Mr. Wang’s health

92
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,960
isn’t fit for traveling much longer.

93
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,950
Yes.

94
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
You shouldn’t hesitate.

95
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,630
If the soldiers get anxious later,

96
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,030
we won’t be able to leave.

97
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,710
Then thank you, Wanrong.

98
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,070
You go first. I’ll come shortly.

99
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,800
Alright.

100
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,560
Alright.

101
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,909
Everyone, follow me.

102
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,310
Hurry!

103
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,020
Hurry up.

104
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,510
Be careful.

105
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,830
Let's go.

106
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,230
Hurry.

107
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,130
Fuding.

108
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,830
Young Madam.

109
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,490
Be careful.

110
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,310
Go to the prison right now

111
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,270
and find out

112
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,660
what’s going on with Zilu.

113
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,460
No matter what news you get,

114
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,550
inform me immediately.

115
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,920
Okay.

116
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,220
Even if there was an issue with the incense

117
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,060
at the sacrificial ceremony,

118
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,870
it shouldn’t be Prince Xian's men

119
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,090
who come to seal us up.

120
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,850
There must be something suspicious going on.

121
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,250
Young Madam, I’ll go now.

122
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,990
Zilu.

123
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,300
I must find a way

124
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,650
to get you out of there.

125
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,570
Your Highness.

126
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,190
The workers involved

127
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,750
in making the incense for the sacrificial ceremony

128
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,950
have been dealt with.

129
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,540
Go visit Xu Zilu

130
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,200
in the prison.

131
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,610
You know what to do, right?

132
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,790
Keep it clean.

133
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,220
Don't leave any trouble.

134
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,030
Don't worry, Your Highness.

135
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,090
Your Highness.

136
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,750
Madam Xu wants to see you.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,620
Daring to visit my masion at night without invitation,

138
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,480
she really isn’t afraid of death.

139
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,260
It's too late.

140
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,470
I’m not seeing any visitors.

141
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,330
Drive her away.

142
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:09,490
Your Highness.

143
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,180
She’s been causing a commotion

144
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,590
outside for quite a while.

145
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,240
I'm afraid

146
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,030
it will disturb Her Grace.

147
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,280
Just tell her that I...

148
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,570
Bring Madam Xu inside.

149
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,260
Your Grace.

150
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,300
Your Highness is willing to see her.

151
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,770
Ping'er,

152
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,430
why are you…

153
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,190
Your Highness, if you agree

154
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,850
to talk to Madam Xu,

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,280
I’ll take the medicine.

156
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,550
That way, on your wedding day,

157
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,630
you’ll have a living bride.

158
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,640
Ping'er.

159
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,680
What are you saying?

160
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,170
Fine.

161
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,220
I’ll see her

162
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,480
for your sake.

163
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,600
Is that alright?

164
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,150
Why are you standing there?

165
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,610
Go invite her in, quickly.

166
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,780
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,159
Come.

168
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,900
I’ll take you back to rest.

169
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,680
No need.

170
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,630
Make sure the Princess takes her medicine.

171
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,760
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,410
One sheet of paper

173
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,710
is for you to honestly confess

174
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,150
everything you know.

175
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,460
The other

176
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,460
is for your written confession of guilt.

177
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,900
Once you’re done, I’ll see you off.

178
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,880
I have nothing to write.

179
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,340
I suggest you be honest.

180
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,080
Either way, you’re as good as dead.

181
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,870
If you don’t want your family

182
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,400
to be buried alongside you,

183
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,630
you’d better do as I say.

184
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,230
Madam Xu.

185
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:43,810
Please.

186
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,950
Madam Xu, your visit at this time

187
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,750
is truly unexpected.

188
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,430
I’ve come today

189
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,650
to propose a deal with Your Highness.

190
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,140
Now that Mr. Xu is imprisoned,

191
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,110
you still have the leisure

192
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,870
to discuss business with me?

193
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,750
The Xu's Incense Shop

194
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,660
has been painstakingly managed for three generations.

195
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,860
Everyone in our household is innocent.

196
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,900
Even though my husband

197
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,930
is in a dire situation,

198
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,300
the workshop will not collapse.

199
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,750
Why wouldn’t I

200
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,410
be able to discuss business with Your Highness?

201
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,590
Good.

202
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,070
I admire people

203
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,410
with your kind of resolve.

204
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,669
I’ve expressed my appreciation

205
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,230
for Xu's Incense Shop

206
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,900
many times before.

207
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,120
Unfortunately,

208
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,909
Xu Zilu didn’t reciprocate.

209
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,580
If it had been you,

210
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,860
dealing with me

211
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,990
from the beginning,

212
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,070
wouldn’t we

213
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,210
all be happy now?

214
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,020
Now that Mr. Xu is absent,

215
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,660
does that mean

216
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,950
all of the Xu family’s business

217
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,280
is under your control?

218
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,550
As the matriarch of the Xu family,

219
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,430
it’s only natural

220
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,390
that I make decisions

221
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,790
in my husband’s absence.

222
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,460
In that case,

223
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,930
very well.

224
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,430
Does that mean the business deal

225
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,110
that couldn’t be settled with Mr. Xu

226
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,390
can now be concluded

227
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,470
with you?

228
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,710
As long as the terms are right,

229
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,160
it can certainly be done.

230
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,020
Good.

231
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,010
Let’s hear your terms.

232
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:24,930
Please show mercy

233
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,110
to my husband.

234
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,290
Madam Xu,

235
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,570
I thought you were a smart woman.

236
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,030
Why are you still hoping

237
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,670
I’ll spare his life at this point?

238
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,640
Your Highness misunderstands.

239
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,050
That’s not what I’m asking for.

240
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,790
It’s just that,

241
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,570
as Xu Zilu’s wife,

242
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,710
if he must eventually face the execution ground,

243
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,170
I ask Your Highness to allow me to see him off.

244
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,560
If I do not see him die with my own eyes,

245
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:58,040
I’m afraid I won’t be able to answer to the Xu family.

246
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,660
So, Madam Xu,

247
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,860
you’re worried

248
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,990
that I might secretly have him killed?

249
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,360
I wouldn’t dare.

250
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,800
I’m just afraid

251
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,110
that if the Xu family falls into chaos,

252
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,320
it might interfere with Your Highness’s business.

253
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,020
If I want someone dead,

254
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
there’s no chance of them escaping.

255
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,370
The evidence

256
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,800
will be solid.

257
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
No need to rush.

258
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,510
I’ll make sure

259
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,110
his death is well-publicized.

260
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,880
Madam Xu,

261
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,990
rest assured.

262
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,880
The day after tomorrow, when he’s brought to trial,

263
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,540
I’ll make sure Xu Zilu’s death

264
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,860
is clear and undeniable.

265
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

266
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,250
I’ll take my leave.

267
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,910
Xu Zilu,

268
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,750
I gave you time,

269
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,740
but

270
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,720
you didn't cherish it.

271
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,830
Now

272
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,730
I’ll send you on your way.

273
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,320
Lord Liufeng!

274
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,120
His Highness...

275
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,440
Clean this place up.

276
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,170
Keep a close watch on him.

277
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,570
Yes.

278
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,550
Are you the Mr. Wu

279
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:54,150
that Prince Xian mentioned?

280
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,490
Yes, that’s me.

281
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,900
I want to check the goods.

282
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,020
Do me a favor.

283
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
I’m just bringing him some food.

284
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,570
Your wife

285
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,310
even asked me to bring you

286
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,150
some pastries

287
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,150
she made herself.

288
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,160
What happened?

289
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,300
She went to Prince Xian's Mansion.

290
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,840
Is she okay?

291
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,530
She was afraid you’d be secretly harmed by Prince Xian,

292
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,910
so she made a deal with him

293
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,180
to ensure that you’ll

294
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,470
be tried and convicted properly,

295
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,350
so you can die with clarity.

296
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,500
Thanks to my wife.

297
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,640
Yesterday, Prince Xian

298
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,580
tried to force me to sign a confession

299
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,010
and wanted me dead in prison.

300
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,030
If it weren’t for my wife,

301
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,450
I might be dead by now.

302
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,100
She mustn’t

303
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,210
find out about this.

304
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,910
I’m afraid she’ll worry.

305
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:10,720
And

306
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,510
make sure she’s closely watched.

307
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,660
She’s impulsive.

308
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,600
You must ensure her safety.

309
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,320
The Ministry of Justice

310
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,990
has been investigating Prince Xian for some time.

311
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,740
But they lacked leads.

312
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,580
They’re investigating Prince Xian too?

313
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,110
It’s said

314
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,810
that two secret agents from the Ministry of Justice

315
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,970
were killed while investigating Prince Xian in Lingnan.

316
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,430
Their bodies haven’t been found to this day.

317
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,140
Just ahead.

318
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:44,820
Chase them.

319
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,730
Catch up with them.

320
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,190
There's a carriage ahead.

321
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,560
Fuding.

322
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,570
What's going on?

323
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,270
Young Master.

324
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,000
There are several people chasing us from behind.

325
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,250
So that’s it.

326
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,340
What’s happening?

327
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,660
I’ve seen them before.

328
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,120
Sir.

329
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,430
The items in this package

330
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,940
are extremely important.

331
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,120
If something happens to me,

332
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,580
please make sure to take it

333
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,140
to Furong City.

334
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:13,910
Furong City?

335
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,790
It seems now

336
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,670
that he was killed by Prince Xian’s men.

337
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,140
But I looked inside that box,

338
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,670
and there was nothing in it.

339
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,400
That box

340
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,270
might be

341
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,360
the only clue left.

342
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,520
Where did you put it?

343
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,470
In my mansion.

344
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,830
My Lord,

345
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,830
I want to write a letter to my family.

346
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,620
Please

347
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,100
deliver it to my wife.

348
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,050
Such a hassle.

349
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,600
You can write it.

350
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,270
We’ve received news.

351
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,680
Lord Lyu.

352
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,980
How is Zilu?

353
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,200
Zilu gave it to me.

354
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,730
He asked me to make sure you receive it.

355
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,410
[Evidence of Prince Xian Smuggling]

356
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,370
Evidence of Prince Xian Smuggling?

357
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,360
But isn't it just a wooden box?

358
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,070
I feel like I’ve seen this wooden box

359
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,390
somewhere before.

360
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,810
It should still be at the Xu Mansion.

361
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,220
No.

362
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,450
I have to go back to the Xu Mansion

363
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,750
and retrieve it.

364
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,760
But the Xu Mansion

365
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,510
is completely surrounded by soldiers.

366
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,840
How do you plan to get in?

367
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:47,560
Whatever.

368
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,900
I’ll figure it out when I get there.

369
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,630
I need to find

370
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,940
Tao Meili and Liu Yeniang.

371
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,670
I'll set out tomorrow morning.

372
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,450
Your Highness.

373
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,310
After the Xu Mansion was sealed up,

374
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,310
I sent someone to investigate again.

375
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,390
Rest assured, Your Highness.

376
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,720
It's not in the mansion.

377
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,770
It doesn't matter.

378
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,560
Whether it’s found or not,

379
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,830
by tomorrow afternoon,

380
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,620
Xu Zilu will be dead.

381
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,630
I want to

382
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,640
interrogate Xu Zilu now.

383
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,390
Prepare the carriage.

384
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:25,690
Yes.

385
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,150
Didn’t knock him out.

386
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,740
Nonsense.

387
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,980
Can a slingshot knock someone out?

388
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:55,970
It’s okay.

389
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,900
We’ll think of another way.

390
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,120
Then I’ll run over and draw them away.

391
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
You focus on finding it.

392
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,650
Alright.

393
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,840
Be careful.

394
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:03,800
Alright.

395
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,640
Are you okay?

396
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,829
Kill him!

397
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,780
Stop!

398
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,800
Stop!

399
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,650
Stop!

400
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,500
Why are you chasing me?

401
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,070
I’m going over there now.

402
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,780
Wait for me here.

403
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,280
Alright.

404
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,000
Be careful.

405
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,640
Alright.

406
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,680
As expected, there’s nothing here.

407
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,540
It's you.

408
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,790
Xu Zilu wouldn’t have had me

409
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,070
look for an empty box.

410
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,280
Take him away.

411
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,720
What are you doing?

412
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,390
My Lord.

413
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,370
Prince Xian has ordered the interrogation of Xu Zilu.

414
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,150
Minister Li from the Ministry of Justice

415
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,950
is already waiting in the court.

416
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,310
Let's go.

417
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,670
Hurry!

418
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,200
Hurry up.

419
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,700
Young Madam.

420
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,260
Did you find it?

421
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,120
Is this the one?

422
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:57,960
Yes.

423
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,540
This is exactly what the young master was talking about.

424
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,270
That’s great!

425
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,730
Well...

426
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,880
But Young Madam,

427
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,320
how are we going to get out of here?

428
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,960
Se.

429
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,310
How did you get in here?

430
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,120
Liu Yeniang and I

431
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,430
saw that you hadn’t come out for a long time.

432
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,870
But what’s the use of you coming in?

433
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,470
There are so many soldiers

434
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,430
both inside and outside the mansion.

435
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,350
You’ve just added one more person

436
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,350
who can’t get out.

437
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:15,800
This...

438
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,140
Do something. What should we do?

439
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,140
What should we do?

440
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,160
I’ve got an idea.

441
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,340
Stop!

442
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,430
What are you doing?

443
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,070
Officers,

444
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,960
I’ve come to fetch something for my master.

445
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,810
Fetch something?

446
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,390
What else is left in the Xu family worth fetching?

447
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,060
Chase them!

448
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,480
Stop there!

449
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,320
Stop there!

450
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,710
Stop!

451
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:44,580
Stop there!

452
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,460
Stop! Stop!

453
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,040
Fuding.

454
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,610
Hurry up!

455
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,410
Xu Zilu!

456
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,340
You dared to tamper

457
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,870
with the incense for the sacrificial ceremony.

458
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,730
It’s a good thing Prince Xian discovered it in time,

459
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,970
or the grand ceremony would have been desecrated.

460
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,100
The tainted incense

461
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,820
has been kept as evidence.

462
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,150
Do you realize the enormity

463
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,010
of your crime?

464
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,830
My Lord,

465
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,430
I'm innocent.

466
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,910
The incense for the Heaven sacrificial ceremony was

467
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,260
thoroughly inspected

468
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,990
at the time of delivery.

469
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,280
There were no issues.

470
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,020
The evidence you hold

471
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,960
must have been tampered with by someone else.

472
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,340
I knew you wouldn't

473
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,120
confess easily.

474
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,790
Guards!

475
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,340
Bring in the witness.

476
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,240
Bring the witness.

477
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,990
My Lord.

478
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,090
Mr. Xu instructed us to replace

479
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,940
some of the good incense ingredients

480
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,910
with inferior ones

481
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,830
to save money,

482
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,290
which resulted in too many impurities in the incense,

483
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,960
making it prone to exploding when lit.

484
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,760
That's right.

485
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,550
We did it

486
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,770
as Mr. Xu ordered.

487
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,290
Witnesses, step back.

488
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:04,660
Yes.

489
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,110
My Lord.

490
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,300
I don't even know

491
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,380
these two people.

492
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,950
How can they serve as witnesses?

493
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,750
Lord Li.

494
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,470
We have both testimony and physical evidence now.

495
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,390
Let’s not waste

496
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,480
my time any longer.

497
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:16,300
Yes.

498
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,490
Your Highness.

499
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,110
Xu Zilu.

500
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,190
With the evidence and witnesses against you,

501
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,310
you should stop trying to defend yourself.

502
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:24,920
My Lord.

503
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,970
Please hear me out.

504
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,130
I know who framed me.

505
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,110
Your Highness.

506
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,940
It's okay.

507
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,430
Let him speak.

508
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,980
Two months ago,

509
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,230
I encountered a group of bandits

510
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,800
in Lingnan.

511
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,750
But upon investigation,

512
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,820
I found they were not bandits,

513
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,800
but assassins sent by Prince Xian

514
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,410
to eliminate the secret agents of the Ministry of Justice.

515
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,770
After Prince Xian learned

516
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,670
of my connection

517
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,950
with one of these agents,

518
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,700
he has been hunting me down ever since.

519
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,630
This sacrificial ceremony is also

520
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,440
part of his conspiracy.

521
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,570
Then go ahead and tell us

522
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,520
what conspiracy you think I have.

523
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,010
You are smuggling arms with the Beiyun State,

524
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,140
intending to rebel.

525
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,920
So, the prince is planning to rebel.

526
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,100
This...

527
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,850
How dare you!

528
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,210
Why are they not here yet?

529
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:12,790
Xu Zilu.

530
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,000
Think carefully before you speak.

531
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,600
The crime of tampering with the incense

532
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,770
is already enough to cost you your life.

533
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,630
If you continue to

534
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,260
falsely accuse Prince Xian,

535
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,500
you’ll be guilty of a crime that could wipe out your entire family.

536
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,830
What I’m saying is the absolute truth.

537
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,560
In Changqing Alley,

538
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,220
diagonally across from Xilin Street,

539
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,420
there is a warehouse.

540
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,430
It was rented by my third uncle, Xu Yushan,

541
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,690
before he passed away.

542
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,290
Prince Xian

543
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,340
once hid fire lances there.

544
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,650
My third uncle was on good terms with Prince Xian when he was alive.

545
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,510
You can check the inns he visited.

546
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:46,600
Also,

547
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,790
many of my Third Uncle’s shops,

548
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,800
including that warehouse,

549
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,870
have Prince Xian's investment.

550
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,570
The Chamber of Commerce can verify this.

551
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,650
All I’m accusing you of

552
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,120
is substituting incense ingredients,

553
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,320
yet you dare to slander me so viciously.

554
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,580
How malicious.

555
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:08,760
Lord Li,

556
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,560
I have never done

557
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,160
what he is accusing me of.

558
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,090
If you don't believe me, feel free to investigate.

559
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,800
I have a clear conscience.

560
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,480
However, it is alarming

561
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,750
that someone dares to

562
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,370
to so brazenly ignore the law

563
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,880
and falsely accuse a prince of the Qing.

564
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,730
As a high-ranking official of the court,

565
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,310
surely you cannot let this go unpunished, right?

566
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,170
Your Highness.

567
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,810
Okay.

568
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,410
Xu Zilu,

569
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,190
stop quibbling.

570
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:36,390
I am

571
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,640
going to strip you

572
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,980
of your Imperial Merchant status

573
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,440
and sentence you to death.

574
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,090
Guards!

575
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,700
My Lord.

576
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:42,910
Take him away.

577
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,550
Wait.

578
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,660
I have something to say.

579
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,580
My Lord.

580
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Are you all right?

581
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,040
I had to crawl through a dog hole twice.

582
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,660
If something happened to you, you’d be in serious trouble.

583
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,540
It won’t happen.

584
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,670
They are over there.

585
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,570
Chase them!

586
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,230
Run!

587
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,750
Stop!

588
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,120
Stop! Stop!

589
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:11,780
Why are they still chasing us?

590
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,620
Stop!

591
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,220
Hurry!

592
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,070
Hurry!

593
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,730
Stop!

594
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,590
Let's split up into three groups.

595
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,940
Okay.

596
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,540
Stop!

597
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,350
Chase them separately!

598
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:21,870
Yes.

599
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,190
Stop!

600
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,320
Just run away.

601
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,070
Bro.

602
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,210
I was wrong.

603
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,980
I won't run away anymore.

604
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,270
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t run away?

605
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:39,730
Get her!

606
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,040
Ling Se, run!

607
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,950
Meili.

608
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,770
Run!

609
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,670
Let go!

610
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,710
Run!

611
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,390
Let go of me!

612
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,140
Meili.

613
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,800
-Run!
-Let go of me!

614
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,860
She's amazing.

615
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,270
I can prove

616
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,930
that what Xu Zilu said is true.

617
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,010
How can you prove it?

618
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,020
Kneel!

619
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,020
Kneel!

620
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,730
Who are these people you’ve captured?

621
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:28,440
My Lord.

622
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,740
These individuals

623
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,000
are envoys from Beiyun

624
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,800
and subordinates of Prince Xian.

625
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,780
Prince Xian has been using

626
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,840
the guise of trade caravans

627
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,700
to smuggle military arms to Beiyun.

628
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,520
In return, he imports spices

629
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,850
from Beiyun to the Qing,

630
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,050
disrupting the market

631
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,110
and harboring ulterior motives.

632
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,580
These

633
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,060
are the ironclad proofs found on the carriage.

634
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,070
A simple investigation will reveal the truth.

635
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,000
How did you come to know all of this?

636
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,820
Prince Xian threatened my family

637
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,390
to coerce me

638
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,490
into assisting with the smuggling of arms.

639
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,020
For the safety of my family,

640
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,710
I have to promise Prince Xian

641
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,910
to gain his trust.

642
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:01,550
That’s

643
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,480
how I obtained this evidence.

644
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,960
Prince Xian.

645
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,470
Is what they say true?

646
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,140
They’ve conspired together

647
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,500
to frame me.

648
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,340
Lord Li. Do you really believe this nonsense?

649
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,610
Now that the evidence and witnesses are all here,

650
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,850
Prince Xian has committed heinous acts,

651
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,100
killed my third uncle,

652
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,500
and dares to be so brazen.

653
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:20,190
My Lord.

654
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,790
You must seek justice

655
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,620
for me.

656
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
If this traitorous prince is not eliminated, the law will never be upheld.

657
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,570
My Lord. I hope you will enforce the law

658
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:28,430
and rid the people of this menace.

659
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,720
Prince Xian.

660
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,780
This is a serious matter.

661
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,640
If you cannot explain yourself,

662
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,880
I will have no choice

663
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,170
but to ask His Majesty to make a ruling.

664
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,770
How dare you!

665
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,660
You’ve committed murder

666
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,180
in the courtroom.

667
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,230
How do you explain yourself now?

668
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,500
It was all

669
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,000
orchestrated by me, Xu Zilu,

670
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,190
and Wu Qi.

671
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,000
His Highness was unaware.

672
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,050
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

673
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,220
Don't let him die.

674
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,420
This...

675
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,580
Did everyone hear that?

676
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,900
Lord Li,

677
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,920
Liufeng has confessed

678
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:35,910
that they conspired together

679
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,920
to frame me.

680
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,010
None of them will escape.

681
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,830
Arrest them all!

682
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:41,880
Yes.

683
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,460
There's an ongoing case inside.

684
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,820
Unauthorized persons are not allowed to enter.

685
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,070
I’m involved in this case.

686
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,740
I have important evidence to present.

687
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,550
Please let me in.

688
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,510
His Highness has ordered

689
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,160
that no one is allowed inside.

690
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,200
You must not trespass in a courtroom.

691
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,870
If you continue like this,

692
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,780
I won’t be polite.

693
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,150
Even if you’re not polite, I must go in.

694
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,280
-Arrest her!
-Zilu!

695
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,750
Who dares?

696
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,830
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

697
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,100
Your Majesty.

698
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,580
Come with me inside.

699
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,860
Lord Li.

700
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,680
The evidence is now clear.

701
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,570
They conspired together

702
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,750
to swap the line incense for the sacrificial ceremony,

703
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,750
smuggle arms,

704
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:33,970
and frame me.

705
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:39,060
The nature of their crimes is extremely serious.

706
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,810
With multiple crimes combined,

707
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,580
what does the law prescribe?

708
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,660
The law prescribes

709
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,310
death.

710
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,220
So be it.

711
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:50,640
Guards!

712
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,650
Take them away.

713
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,710
-Yes.
-Yes.

714
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,740
Here comes Her Majesty.

715
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,620
Your Majesty.

716
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,410
Rise.

717
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,660
I’m just here to observe.

718
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,130
Proceed with the trial as you see fit.

719
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,770
Your Majesty,

720
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,530
this case has already been concluded by Lord Li.

721
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,270
They

722
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,860
bribed my guards

723
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,270
to smuggle arms

724
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,470
with malicious intent.

725
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,440
Even on the brink of death,

726
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,300
they still attempted to frame me.

727
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,290
Please, Your Majesty, grant me justice

728
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,550
and clear my name.

729
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,870
You destroyed the evidence

730
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,610
yourself.

731
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,880
Stop spewing nonsense!

732
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:37,830
At this point,

733
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,470
what evidence do you have

734
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,400
that could prove this was my doing?

735
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,320
I have it.

736
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,120
This is the secret correspondence

737
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,900
between Prince Xian and Beiyun.

738
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,740
It contains the Prince’s handwritten letters

739
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,580
and seals.

740
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,190
8,000 fire lances

741
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,650
that I promised to give the Beiyun royal family

742
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,180
have been prepared

743
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,020
and will be delivered before the Lantern Festival.

744
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,550
Payment has been received.

745
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,380
Your Majesty, please prepare the provisions and soldiers

746
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,870
as previously agreed upon,

747
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,020
pledging mutual support

748
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,040
for a grand plan.

749
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,560
You’ve memorized it well.

750
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,630
I spent a long time memorizing it.

751
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:51,990
Prince Xian,

752
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,040
the evidence you kept asking for

753
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,460
is right here.

754
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,760
Lord Li.

755
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,430
If this doesn’t make things clear…

756
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:09,660
Guards!

757
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,430
Take Prince Xian away.

758
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,120
-Yes.
-Yes.

759
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:21,820
Go.

760
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,820
Go.

761
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,290
Thankfully,

762
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,910
I made it just in time.

763
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,510
Thank you.

764
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,230
Good thing we managed to pull through.

765
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,170
I almost lost my life

766
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,130
in the process.

767
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,180
We owe you this time.

768
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,340
I’ll treat you to a drink another day.

769
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,270
Wait a minute.

770
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,290
You two...

771
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,160
Who are you really helping?

772
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,530
Earlier, you mentioned

773
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,430
that the person with whom

774
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,620
you have a connection

775
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,880
is Prince Xian, right?

776
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,230
I also went to Linchun

777
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,330
to see if you,

778
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,840
whether you, as the head of the Xu family,

779
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,470
were colluding

780
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,360
with Prince Xian in treason.

781
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,510
I see.

782
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,120
Mr. Xu,

783
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,700
Tell me your plan.

784
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,760
I pretended to defect

785
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,700
and infiltrated Prince Xian

786
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,000
to collect evidence of his smuggling.

787
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,710
Now that Prince Xian knows

788
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,170
I’ve seen the fire lances,

789
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,110
he won’t fully trust me.

790
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
This task can only

791
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,930
be handled by you.

792
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,670
Mr. Xu, how can you be sure

793
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,280
Prince Xian will trust me?

794
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,220
As long as you present me

795
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,490
and show your loyalty,

796
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,440
he will certainly entrust you

797
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,100
with the smuggling business.

798
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:53,930
Mr. Xu,

799
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,750
I’m currently being cursed by the world.

800
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,410
How will you repay this favor?

801
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,900
Then I’ll give my entire life

802
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,040
to you.

803
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,700
Is that acceptable?

804
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,350
But that won’t be necessary.

805
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:08,590
I must have owed you

806
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,190
and your wife in my past life.

807
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,460
Prince Xian is up to no good.

808
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,730
You must be careful.

809
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,110
Ping'er!

810
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:46,890
Wang.

811
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,360
Am I dreaming?

812
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,020
You really came to pick me up.

813
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,970
It's not a dream.

814
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:51,720
Ping'er.

815
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,810
It's okay now.

816
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,170
My father has been released.

817
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,300
Everything is over.

818
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,060
Who is this?

819
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:06,020
What did he do?

820
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,630
Stay away.

821
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,659
People like this, who have committed heinous crimes,

822
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,929
deserve such a fate.

823
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,710
Ping'er.

824
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,469
You two are here

825
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,820
being all lovey-dovey.

826
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,100
You are not alone.

827
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,580
Grandpa.

828
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,239
I think

829
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,400
you’re a bit silly.

830
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,170
Ping'er.

831
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,239
You must teach him some manners.

832
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,940
Otherwise, he’ll make a fool of himself every day

833
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,090
in our mansion.

834
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:56,080
What?

835
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,340
You’re unhappy

836
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,570
about joining our family?

837
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,800
Joining the family?

838
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,960
I’m willing.

839
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,690
As long as I can be with Ping'er,

840
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,220
I’m willing to do anything.

841
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,400
Grandpa.

842
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,190
Thank you.

843
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,170
What are you calling me?

844
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,490
Who is your grandpa?

845
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,580
Grandpa.

846
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,910
You're so nice.

847
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,720
The weather is nice.

848
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,090
Let me get some sun.

849
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:28,960
Darling.

850
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,780
Look what this is.

851
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,960
[Agreement]

852
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,380
This is our agreement?

853
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,790
That's not right.

854
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,070
Wasn’t Her Majesty

855
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:40,940
supposed to take

856
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,800
this document?

857
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,390
The document Her Majesty consort took

858
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,700
was a fake.

859
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,240
This one is the real one.

860
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,120
Xu Zilu.

861
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,600
What’s going on?

862
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,950
That day, after Prince Xian

863
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,630
stole the agreement

864
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,040
from my mansion,

865
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:54,920
he handed it to Wu Qi.

866
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,320
Why Wu Qi again?

867
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,780
This is what Prince Xian gave me.

868
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,370
How could such an important item

869
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,740
be left lying around?

870
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:11,670
It seems Prince Xian

871
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,710
is planning to take action against me.

872
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,170
We should turn the tables.

873
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,990
Tomorrow, at the line incense conference,

874
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,400
present it publicly

875
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,880
and accuse me of not meeting the qualifications

876
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,480
to be an Imperial Merchantt.

877
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,310
Prince Xian is also testing you.

878
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,920
You take this opportunity

879
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,310
to gain his trust.

880
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,710
But

881
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,790
I have a more interesting plan.

882
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,460
What is it?

883
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,870
This is a special paper

884
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,540
with hidden patterns from Prince Xian's Mansion.

885
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,340
In my opinion,

886
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,000
why not let Prince Xian

887
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,350
take the blame for this false accusation?

888
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,990
That way, you can fulfill

889
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,760
your roles as a loving couple.

890
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,630
So you and Wu Qi

891
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,130
worked together

892
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,780
to create

893
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,530
an identical fake agreement.

894
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,110
Unfortunately,

895
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,060
despite all the effort we put in,

896
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,900
the fake agreement

897
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,300
was torn up by Her Majesty

898
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,320
before it even reached the palace.

899
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,050
Well, Xu Zilu,

900
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,420
it turns out you already had a plan

901
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,390
to deal with Prince Xian.

902
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,190
And you kept it from me all along,

903
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,060
making me worry.

904
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:31,790
Darling.

905
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,170
This matter was too dangerous.

906
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,010
It was very risky.

907
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,610
I didn’t want to involve you.

908
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,050
But wait,

909
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,920
when I

910
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:44,190
went to Wu Qi’s place to throw out the trash,

911
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,550
you were with me,

912
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,400
looking so happy.

913
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,010
Wasn’t that just part of the act?

914
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,980
Besides,

915
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,430
he was pestering you

916
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,430
the whole time

917
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,520
in Linchun.

918
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,590
Xu Zilu,

919
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,160
your role as a jealous person

920
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,330
never stopped.

921
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:04,940
Darling.

922
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,490
I have something serious to tell you.

923
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,210
We married

924
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,950
due to an agreement.

925
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,680
Now that we genuinely love each other,

926
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,660
I want to

927
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,540
give you a grand wedding.

928
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,210
What do you think?

929
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:19,940
Sure.

930
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,990
Let’s quickly bring Mother

931
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,990
to Furong City.

932
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,190
And we need to schedule a time

933
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,730
with Ping'er and Wang Zhujue.

934
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,360
We should also inform

935
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,220
Wu Qi, Tao Meili, and Ling Shuo...

936
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,070
Did I agree too quickly?

937
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,060
Bride and Groom.

938
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,550
Bow to heaven and earth.

939
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,030
Bow to your parents.

940
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:25,060
Bow to each other as husband and wife.

941
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,610
Bride and Groom.

942
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,100
Serve tea.

943
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:50,580
Mother.

944
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:53,750
Good boy.

945
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,980
Here.

946
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,660
I'll give you a big red envelope.

947
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,440
Thank you, Mother.

948
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,910
Mother, have some tea.

949
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,940
Good girl.

950
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,290
Smells good.

951
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:19,040
Here’s another

952
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,320
red envelope for you.

953
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,420
It may look thin,

954
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,170
it's full of banknotes.

955
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,260
Thank you, Mother.

956
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,420
Se.

957
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,070
I’ve had this tea twice already.

958
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,150
When will I get to

959
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,320
have a grandchild?

960
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,840
I think

961
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,460
you should hurry.

962
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,610
The ceremony is complete.

963
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,800
Proceed to the bridal chamber.

964
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,560
Great!

965
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,570
Congratulations, Young Master and Young Madam.

966
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,450
Should we

967
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,360
do something now?

968
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,130
I'm thirsty.

969
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:23,900
Me too.

970
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,380
I'll go get some water.

971
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,460
Here.

972
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,560
Why is there only half a cup?

973
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,700
I was so happy

974
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,860
that I spilled some.

975
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,430
Should we toast?

976
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,110
A cup exchange?

977
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,120
This time feels

978
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,070
a bit different

979
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,680
from the first.

980
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,470
After all,

981
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,630
the first time was due to an agreement.

982
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,450
You’re still carrying this?

983
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,240
It's my treasure.

984
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,320
Although

985
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,170
it’s now void,

986
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,530
I’m still quite grateful.

987
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,290
Gratitude is important.

988
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,600
But we need to keep things clear.

989
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,590
Even married couples should be clear about finances, right?

990
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,430
You promised

991
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,580
to give me 500 taels a year

992
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,510
and a shop.

993
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:51,790
Although

994
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,120
it’s only been eight months and five days,

995
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,160
I'll give you a discount since we are a couple.

996
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,690
I’ll count it as six months.

997
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,370
So give me half the money.

998
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,890
That’s 375 taels.

999
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,130
But should I also

1000
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,280
share the wedding expenses with you?

1001
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,480
With my attire

1002
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,290
and all the extras,

1003
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,860
it’s not less than a few hundred taels.

1004
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,500
I don't have enough money.

1005
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,500
I still have to cover the shortfall.

1006
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,780
You money-grubber.

1007
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,040
Stop calculating.
