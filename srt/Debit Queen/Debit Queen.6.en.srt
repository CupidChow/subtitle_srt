[Debit Queen]

3
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,780
[Episode 6]

4
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,310
Ping'er.

5
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,020
Although I can't really understand it,

6
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,530
I just feel it’s amazing.

7
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,840
Are you really just a maid?

8
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,789
A maid?

9
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,700
Do you look down on maids?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,070
We maids can be

11
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,130
cultured too.

12
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,500
Of course, I don't look down on maids.

13
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,420
I just think

14
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,710
this is definitely better written than

15
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,910
what Wang Zixuan wrote.

16
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,320
The teacher will surely

17
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,830
praise me tomorrow.

18
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,770
It’s my fault that I forgot the time.

19
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,570
I’ll go get you something to eat.

20
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,310
Okay.

21
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,110
Okay.

22
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,570
Come on, let’s go have a drink.

23
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,190
Let's go.

24
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,800
Let’s go.

25
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,820
Young Master.

26
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,270
Young Master.

27
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,230
Something big has happened.

28
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,100
Speak.

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,710
Although you said not to go

30
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,350
looking for the Young Madam today,

31
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,820
I still asked someone

32
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,710
to inquire.

33
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,350
The Young Madam went to

34
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,110
the Fulai Inn today

35
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,550
and was helping out there.

36
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,210
But she left in the afternoon,

37
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,720
and her maid

38
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,079
still hasn’t returned.

39
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,930
I'm afraid...

40
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,630
I'm afraid she’s run away, Young Master.

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,670
What should we do?

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,590
Tomorrow is

43
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,950
the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference.

44
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,990
Where are we going

45
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,810
to find another Young Madam now?

46
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,700
If I leave, I’ll never come back.

47
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,630
Don't regret it.

48
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,270
Young Madam.

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,700
Young Madam, the Young Master didn’t mean it that way.

50
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,170
Young Master.

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,140
You shouldn’t worry too much.

52
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,140
I think with the Young Madam’s personality,

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,860
she might have just been

54
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,150
delayed by something.

55
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,270
Should I go

56
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,350
ask around again

57
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
to see if anything really happened?

58
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,770
What could have happened to her?

59
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,280
Let’s not spread this around for now.

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,680
We’ll deal with it after tomorrow’s event.

61
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,710
Yes, Young Master.

62
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,210
Have you packed everything?

63
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:04,600
Yes.

64
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,350
Don't lose

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,510
anything valuable.

66
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,820
Got it.

67
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,670
This is bad.

68
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,190
Bro.

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,100
The lamb chops are ready?

70
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,190
What are you talking about?

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,640
I need to think of a way

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
to stall for time.

73
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,510
What?

74
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,430
Sorry about this.

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,250
Why are you yelling?

76
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,750
Knife Sir, he's hungry.

77
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,210
He howls when he’s hungry.

78
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,090
I'm hungry too.

79
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:30,930
Do I howl?

80
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,830
Bro, I'm hungry too.

81
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,659
We’ve finished all the food.

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,060
I’m starving to the point of losing weight.

83
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,659
Where are you losing weight?

84
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,420
Look.

85
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,860
Your flesh.

86
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,130
I’m thinner than I was yesterday.

87
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,170
Don’t the hostages

88
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,740
have all sorts of things in their bag?

89
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,270
But I don’t know how to cook.

90
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,580
Knife Sir.

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,790
I can.

92
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,920
I can cook.

93
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,950
I’m a great cook.

94
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,260
Here comes the delicious food.

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,290
You go first.

96
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,690
This is actually pretty good.

97
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,610
Eat more.

98
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,500
Bro, shouldn’t we save some of this good food

99
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,780
for Qiang and the others?

100
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,460
Save what?

101
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,380
They’ve been chasing one girl for so long,

102
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,440
delaying my plans.

103
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,300
True.

104
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,670
Knife Sir.

105
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,100
Since we're just waiting around,

106
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,170
how about I entertain you

107
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,130
with something?

108
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,180
Sure.

109
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,690
Sure?

110
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,010
Do you think I'm that kind of person?

111
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,620
Are you trying to seduce me?

112
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,870
Not a chance.

113
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:19,990
No.

114
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,680
You've misunderstood.

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,850
What I meant is

116
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,390
that I’ll join that friend from the Western Regions

117
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,210
to play a game with you two,

118
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,550
"Ascension."

119
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,790
Ascension?

120
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,640
First round, designate the main card.

121
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,480
Club Two.

122
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,390
Shuffle the cards.

123
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,380
Dealer plays.

124
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:56,950
Two twos.

125
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,340
Two tens.

126
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,730
The opponents score.

127
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,610
Tao Meili, hurry up.

128
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,550
I can’t stall much longer.

129
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,750
Come on.

130
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,430
I can't.

131
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,290
I can't run anymore.

132
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,220
Ling Se, you wretched girl.

133
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,810
Is your life really worth that much?

134
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,720
Is it worth me risking my life?

135
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,640
I’m begging you.

136
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,220
I’ve put my life

137
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,250
in your hands now.

138
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,010
You’d better hurry and find Xu Zilu

139
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,470
to save my worthless life.

140
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,840
If you dare die,

141
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,290
you're really dead.

142
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,600
Young Master.

143
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,860
You didn’t sleep all night, did you?

144
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,860
Young Master.

145
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,630
Ping'er!

146
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,360
Didn’t you run away

147
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,560
with the Young Madam?

148
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,480
Run away?

149
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,540
Why would I run away?

150
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,560
Last night, at the academy,

151
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,670
I accidentally...

152
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,340
Is there

153
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,620
any breakfast at home?

154
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,770
I’m really hungry.

155
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,030
Where is she?

156
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,390
She’s not home?

157
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,309
No.

158
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,200
The Young Madam didn’t return all night.

159
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,980
And you weren’t here either.

160
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,620
We all thought

161
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,820
she ran away with you.

162
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
How could that be?

163
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,970
If she wanted to run away,

164
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,070
she wouldn’t have spent all night copying texts.

165
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,260
She told me before,

166
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,250
even if it's just for the sake of the Old Madam,

167
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:44,790
she wouldn't

168
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,520
leave at such a crucial moment.

169
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,790
How could you think

170
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,910
so poorly of my lady?

171
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,400
My lady

172
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,470
is very loyal.

173
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,590
Fuding.

174
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,110
Go and send people to find her, quickly.

175
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,470
Yes.

176
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,390
She didn't come back all night.

177
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,260
So why are you just now

178
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,430
thinking of going to find her?

179
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,320
Could you stop fooling around, please?

180
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,380
I don't have time for that.

181
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,050
Xu Zi...

182
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,750
Zilu.

183
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,270
Go and save that wretched girl.

184
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,610
If you're any later, it’ll be too late.

185
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,180
Wretched girl?

186
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,870
Are you talking about my lady?

187
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,590
Yes.

188
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,350
What exactly happened?

189
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,450
Last night, the two of us were kidnapped by a man

190
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,760
with a beard

191
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,790
all over his face.

192
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,190
She told me to escape and get help as quickly as possible.

193
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,320
I left markers along the way.

194
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,050
Hurry and go.

195
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,270
You’re going to save her, right?

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,800
Young Master.

197
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,040
What about the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference?

198
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,900
If you leave, doesn’t that mean you're forfeiting?

199
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:53,870
Oh no.

200
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,280
I really wasn’t thinking straight.

201
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,650
Isn’t the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference today?

202
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,670
I’m doomed.

203
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,630
Bro!

204
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,670
Bro!

205
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,880
Bro!

206
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,600
Bro!

207
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,390
Bro!

208
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,400
What happened to you guys?

209
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,420
Where is she?

210
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,130
We couldn’t find her.

211
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,940
We searched

212
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,950
the forest all night.

213
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,830
Look, I even

214
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,900
hurt my arm.

215
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,390
This is really from a fall.

216
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,110
You.

217
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,200
Tao Meili, you’re back!

218
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,790
Hurry.

219
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,530
Who told you to untie her?

220
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,080
Bro.

221
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,280
I didn’t know.

222
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,390
Bro.

223
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,210
You asked me to untie her.

224
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,710
Cut the crap.

225
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,710
Chase her!

226
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,150
Stop! Stop!

227
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,590
Where's your backup?

228
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,740
He got held up and couldn't come.

229
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,830
We need to run away ourselves.

230
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,310
Stop!

231
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,630
Go and check

232
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,000
if Xu Zilu has arrived.

233
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:02,870
Yes, My Lord.

234
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,850
Governor.

235
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,350
The time for the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference

236
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,810
was decided

237
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,070
jointly by the government

238
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,720
and our Chamber of Commerce.

239
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,950
It's already an hour past the appointed time.

240
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,110
Why hasn't it started yet?

241
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,290
We're still waiting on someone.

242
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,550
Something came up.

243
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,870
Maybe there's a traffic jam.

244
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,830
We can wait a bit longer, can’t we?

245
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,590
When has there ever been a traffic jam

246
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,090
in Lichun

247
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,950
that lasts an hour like in Furong?

248
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,670
Everyone,

249
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,600
even though the Xu family

250
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,630
is the wealthiest in Lichun,

251
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,590
they shouldn't

252
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,290
keep us, the seniors,

253
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,840
waiting for so long. Right?

254
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,900
Yes.

255
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,240
It’s quite improper.

256
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,950
Indeed.

257
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,250
How can someone so unpunctual

258
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,620
be trusted?

259
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,560
Exactly.

260
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,880
How can he be worthy

261
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,620
of the title of Imperial Merchant?

262
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,530
That's right.

263
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,540
Linchun

264
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,990
has more than just the Xu family

265
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,920
to represent it.

266
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,560
I recommend the Tao family

267
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,730
to represent Lichun

268
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
in the Imperial Merchant selection.

269
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,810
Oh, I wouldn’t dare.

270
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,040
If the Xu family doesn’t show up,

271
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,330
it can be considered an automatic withdrawal.

272
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,660
I think there’s no need to wait any longer.

273
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,550
The Xu family has arrived.

274
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,460
Everyone, my apologies

275
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,860
for keeping you waiting.

276
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,880
My son may not be worth waiting

277
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,550
an hour for,

278
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,730
but I wonder if I

279
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,200
am worth waiting

280
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,630
just a little longer for?

281
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,160
Madam Xu.

282
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,840
Madam Xu.

283
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:52,880
Madam Xu.

284
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,030
Madam Xu.

285
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,520
-My Lord.
-Madam Xu, have a seat.

286
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,030
Okay.

287
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,750
Madam Xu, long time no see.

288
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,290
Why is everyone still standing?

289
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,390
We're all old acquaintances.

290
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,520
Please, take a seat.

291
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,020
Alright.

292
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Let’s sit.

293
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,090
Madam Xu, are you here to take the lead

294
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,760
in the Xu family's bid for the Imperial Merchant position?

295
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,960
My son has important matters to attend to today,

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,220
so he couldn't make it.

297
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,510
What?

298
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,150
Do I

299
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,850
not have the right to represent the Xu family?

300
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,920
Of course, you do.

301
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,270
With Madam Xu speaking,

302
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,540
how could we

303
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,570
dare to disagree?

304
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,570
Mr. Song, there's no need

305
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,840
for sarcastic remarks.

306
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,990
A few days ago,

307
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,890
the Tao family suddenly decided to compete for the Imperial Merchant position,

308
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,130
without considering whether the timing was appropriate

309
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,130
for self-recommendation.

310
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,740
None of us stopped them.

311
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,910
However, competing for the Imperial Merchant title is a serious matter,

312
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,240
requiring genuine skill and competence.

313
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,440
If you think that being late is enough

314
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,150
to force the Xu family to step aside,

315
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,900
then you’re being overly naive.

316
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,700
That wouldn’t convince anyone.

317
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,200
Yes, no one would be convinced.

318
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,480
Definitely not.

319
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,010
Since Madam Xu has spoken,

320
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,630
how about we

321
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,230
set a three-month deadline?

322
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,000
Whichever family earns

323
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,650
more profit by then

324
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,380
will become the final candidate

325
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,580
for the Imperial Merchant position.

326
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,240
Madam Xu, you don't have any objections, do you?

327
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,210
What objections could I have?

328
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,460
As long as you have the ability to do so.

329
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,030
That's great.

330
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:35,990
Okay.

331
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,070
Then it’s settled.

332
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,470
Go!

333
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,630
Stop!

334
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,650
Stop! You can't escape.

335
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,610
I won't run anymore.

336
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,640
Stop! Stop!

337
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,670
Stop! Stop!

338
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,530
Hurry, Luodi.

339
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,590
I can't run anymore.

340
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,930
Hang in there. We're almost there.

341
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:55,560
I can't keep going.

342
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,490
I'll help you up.

343
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,660
-Just a little more.
-Stop running.

344
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,140
Why did you run so fast?

345
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:06,900
Knife Sir.

346
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,390
Good thing you guys got here in time.

347
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,920
I couldn’t catch up to them.

348
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,960
You sure put on quite a show.

349
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,240
The act just goes on and on, doesn’t it?

350
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,310
Knife Sir.

351
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,980
It was my fault.

352
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,760
We'll go back with you.

353
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,590
Please forgive us.

354
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,710
I’ve figured it out.

355
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,910
There’s a world of difference between our trades.

356
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,140
We can’t handle this business

357
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,050
of human trafficking.

358
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,670
We'll just stick to being bandits.

359
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,710
You two don't need to be afraid.

360
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,170
On the road to the afterlife, at least you'll have each other for company,

361
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,370
so it won’t be lonely.

362
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,510
Knife Sir.

363
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,790
I was wrong.

364
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,210
Please don't kill me.

365
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,330
Go to hell!

366
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,190
Bro!

367
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:03,990
Bro!

368
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,950
Xu Zilu!

369
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,800
Bro, are you okay?

370
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,000
Let me finish him off!

371
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:09,450
Move aside, I’ll handle this myself.

372
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,040
I’ll show you

373
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,670
what real strength is.

374
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,230
Xu Zilu, watch out!

375
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,460
You backed into it yourself.

376
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,900
I didn’t do it on purpose, you know.

377
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,480
You think you can save the damsel in distress

378
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
with such little skill?

379
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,770
I can't beat you guys,

380
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,580
but I brought backup.

381
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,510
Hurry.

382
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,110
Hurry!

383
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:44,890
Hurry!

384
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,560
Don't move!

385
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,130
Don't move!

386
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,710
Freeze!

387
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,800
Put the knife down.

388
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,410
Don't move!

389
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,070
Put the knife down!

390
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,000
Bro! Bro!

391
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,080
Put the knife down.

392
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,160
Don't move!

393
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,820
Don't move.

394
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,010
Behave yourself. Let's go.

395
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,830
Xu Zilu,

396
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,170
if you were any later, you'd be a widower by now.

397
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,540
Good thing you're alright.

398
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,460
Let's go.

399
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,980
It's good that you're okay.

400
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,690
Why are you trying to act cool?

401
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,069
Xu Zilu.

402
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,720
Were you

403
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,180
worried about me just now?

404
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:12,470
Does that mean I don't have to

405
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,800
copy the texts anymore?

406
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,630
You wish.

407
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,349
You wish.

408
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,119
[Prefecture Office]

409
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,369
Zilu, I have to

410
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,160
thank you for his help this time.

411
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,720
You’ve helped me crack

412
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,750
a major case.

413
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,230
Miss Tao and Young Madam Xu,

414
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,430
truly are as capable as any man.

415
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,740
I’ll be sure

416
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,250
to give them both

417
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,740
high praise

418
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,910
in my report.

419
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,750
Maybe...

420
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,960
-The court will even grant...
-The court...

421
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,890
a commendation to Linchun.

422
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,430
A commendation?

423
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,800
With money involved?

424
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,140
Stingy Girl, have you fallen into a pit of money?

425
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,920
I still need to interrogate this petty criminal.

426
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,980
I won’t see you off.

427
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,430
Tao Meili,

428
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,530
thank you for this.

429
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,340
For what?

430
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,990
On my way back,

431
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,830
I thought about leaving you

432
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,490
to fend for yourself in the mountains.

433
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,020
But I was too kind-hearted.

434
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,090
Now, I’m a bit regretful.

435
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,270
If you

436
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,420
could stop

437
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,740
being so stubborn,

438
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,430
maybe I'd

439
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,710
like you a little more.

440
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,050
Why would I need you to like me?

441
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,300
Tao Meili has quite a temper.

442
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,450
But she’s not a bad person.

443
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,930
You’ve got some nerve talking about others.

444
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:33,830
Do you even realize

445
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,430
how much trouble you caused?

446
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,020
What are you looking at?

447
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,000
Let’s go home.

448
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,910
I got kidnapped.

449
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,030
What did I say?

450
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,460
Why are you yelling at me?

451
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,140
It hurts.

452
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,220
My Lady, it hurts.

453
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,890
My Lady, you are finally back.

454
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,460
I...

455
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,070
He and I were worried sick.

456
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,390
Worried sick?

457
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,480
Worried sick,

458
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,820
but you didn’t come to find me?

459
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,080
If you had come sooner,

460
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,690
would I have been in such a sorry state?

461
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,940
But you told me

462
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,630
to stay home and keep an eye on Master,

463
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,690
so he wouldn’t find out.

464
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,470
Don't worry.

465
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,380
I remembered that.

466
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,150
Master still

467
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:07,700
hasn’t noticed anything.

468
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,780
How dare you say that?

469
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,330
Do you believe

470
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,170
I will twist your ear off?

471
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:10,670
I won’t dare anymore.

472
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,760
Next time something like this happens,

473
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,920
I’ll rush to save you

474
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,300
first thing.

475
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,110
That's more like it.

476
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,040
It hurts so much.

477
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,030
My Lady.

478
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,250
You must’ve been scared, right?

479
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,430
How about I get you something to eat?

480
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,950
I’ll tell the kitchen to prepare it.

481
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,080
And if you want to go somewhere tomorrow,

482
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,690
I’ll make arrangements.

483
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,390
Meili.

484
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,140
Meili.

485
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,710
My good little precious Meili.

486
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,310
Let me see.

487
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,110
That wretched girl

488
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:30,950
didn’t do anything to you, did she?

489
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,420
No, Dad.

490
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,210
I kidnapped her.

491
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,590
What could she do to me?

492
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,540
I hold you in my hands,

493
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,140
afraid to drop you,

494
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,090
and in my mouth, afraid you’ll melt.

495
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:41,860
That wretched girl

496
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,060
dared to make you cry.

497
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,310
I’ll make her cry.

498
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,040
I’ll make her whole family cry.

499
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,090
Dad.

500
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,820
But we shouldn’t stoop to her level.

501
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,880
That wretched girl

502
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,650
isn’t even worthy to carry my shoes.

503
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,020
If we stoop to her level,

504
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,710
aren’t we just elevating her?

505
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,390
Let’s just forget about it.

506
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,840
This can’t just be forgotten.

507
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,670
That wretched girl

508
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:03,800
is getting too bold.

509
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,940
She thinks

510
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,160
that just because she’s married into the Xu family,

511
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,890
she can treat

512
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,830
my good little precious Meili

513
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,470
like this.

514
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,210
That means she doesn’t

515
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,210
respect me at all.

516
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,660
And that Xu Zilu,

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,780
is there something wrong

518
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,720
with his brain?

519
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,850
What part of my Tao family’s daughter

520
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,680
isn’t good enough for him?

521
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,070
Dad.

522
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,680
I really

523
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,240
don’t like Xu Zilu anymore.

524
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,350
Next time, I’ll find

525
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,770
someone even more handsome.

526
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,370
Let’s just let it go.

527
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,930
We can't just let it go.

528
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,040
We've been under

529
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,310
the Xu family's thumb for years.

530
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,500
I've already been unhappy about it,

531
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,270
and now this happens.

532
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,630
I have to find a way

533
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,290
to make sure the Xu family

534
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,800
doesn't become the Imperial Merchant.

535
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,590
Dad, just let it go.

536
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,430
This matter

537
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,830
is truly over for me.

538
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,020
As for business,

539
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,350
do whatever you want.

540
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,190
Sibing.

541
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,860
Should I be heading to school now?

542
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,760
Prepare the carriage.

543
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,320
Right away.

544
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,090
Wait, Meili, you just got back.

545
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,330
You haven't even rested properly.

546
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,010
How can your body handle it?

547
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,180
Forget about school today.

548
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,150
Dad will get you a leave of absence.

549
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,510
No.

550
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,830
I can't miss the Master's lessons.

551
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,030
Dad, I'm leaving now.

552
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,630
Meili.

553
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,780
Meili.

554
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,050
My good little precious Meili

555
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,760
has grown up.

556
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,290
She knows to study hard now.

557
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,820
Have a bowl of chicken soup before you go.

558
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,230
Where did you get this from?

559
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,240
It looks like poison.

560
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,570
Why do you care so much?

561
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,520
It's just a small wound.

562
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,320
Hurry up and apply the medicine.

563
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,060
No.

564
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,920
My Lady.

565
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,960
I faint at the sight of blood.

566
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,070
You should do it yourself.

567
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,180
Am I the lady here, or are you?

568
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,640
How can you be afraid of something like this?

569
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,430
I'll do it.

570
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,590
Young Master Xu.

571
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,490
I'll leave you to it.

572
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,550
I'll leave now.

573
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,590
Ping'er.

574
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,870
Ping'er!

575
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,930
Young Master.

576
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,620
I'm already injured.

577
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,460
Don't give me any more trouble.

578
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,030
What's wrong?

579
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,880
What are you doing?

580
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,570
You're using a burn ointment.

581
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,830
You need to wipe it off.

582
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,030
Wouldn't your hands be...

583
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,280
I'm not going to touch you.

584
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,480
As long as you don't touch me, it's fine.

585
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,390
By the way,

586
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,400
did the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference

587
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,460
get delayed because of this?

588
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,720
None of your business.

589
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,590
When you're not talking, you're actually quite nice.

590
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,390
But as soon as you start speaking, it feels like...

591
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,380
Alright, it's done.

592
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,430
Well...

593
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,880
Young Master.

594
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,600
About this... well... um...

595
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,050
I've already seen your great work.

596
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,390
Well.

597
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,950
Young Master Xu.

598
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,430
Look.

599
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,650
I've already walked through

600
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,650
the gates of hell

601
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,770
and even hurt my hand.

602
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,340
Can I skip copying the books now?

603
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,500
You also stole my cart and rice jar.

604
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,970
Let’s call it even.

605
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,210
I've already

606
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,610
sent someone to repair your cart.

607
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,380
It'll be fixed in a couple of days.

608
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,910
And here,

609
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,360
this is the agreement you wanted earlier.

610
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,690
I've drafted it for you.

611
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,430
Why are you suddenly giving me the agreement?

612
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,830
There’s no trick, right?

613
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,510
I didn’t give it to you before

614
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,030
because the Imperial Merchant Recommendation Conference

615
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,270
is a significant matter.

616
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:01,920
If people

617
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,030
find out that we’re

618
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,440
in a contractual marriage,

619
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,300
it could be considered a crime against the emperor,

620
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,280
punishable by the execution of our entire families.

621
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,270
That serious?

622
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,510
Now you understand.

623
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,550
So, it’s still not too late to back out.

624
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,530
Forget it.

625
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,260
If there's money to be made, I won’t pass it up.

626
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,480
We’re like brothers.

627
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,550
If you had troubles,

628
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,650
you should have told me earlier.

629
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,050
I would have understood.

630
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,420
Don't worry, Bro.

631
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,210
I’m a person

632
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,670
who can keep a secret.

633
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:39,630
To be honest,

634
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,970
we should thank Tao Meili.

635
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,190
If she hadn’t kidnapped me,

636
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,000
you wouldn’t have known

637
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,200
how honest

638
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,830
and trustworthy I am, right?

639
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,110
Why is it that you’ve thanked everyone

640
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,440
but haven’t thanked me?

641
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,300
I was the one who saved you from the knife.

642
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,300
Of course, I should thank you.

643
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,040
Thank you.

644
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,490
How about this?

645
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,660
I'll splurge today.

646
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,520
My treat.

647
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,070
I’ll take you to World's Best Noodles.

648
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,310
How does that sound?

649
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,730
Alright.

650
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,820
Let's go.

651
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,140
[Prince Xian's Mansion]

652
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,010
Your Highness.

653
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,150
Eunuch Zhou

654
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,580
should have already arrived in Linchun.

655
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,310
Did you make sure he understood

656
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,260
all the instructions?

657
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,920
Yes, everything was explained clearly.

658
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,340
But I’m a bit concerned.

659
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,620
Eunuch Zhou

660
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,010
has always been greedy for small gains.

661
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:31,870
I’m worried

662
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,430
he might mess up your plans.

663
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,000
As long as he has any sense,

664
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,070
he wouldn’t dare

665
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,300
play any tricks on me.

666
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,880
You don’t need to worry about this.

667
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,610
Understood.

668
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,500
Are you saying that Prince Xian

669
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,630
has sent someone to Linchun?

670
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,130
Yes.

671
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,790
That person went to the Xu family after nightfall.

672
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,330
Could it be that

673
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,150
the Xu family is in trouble?

674
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,410
I don't think so.

675
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,360
We received word

676
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,850
from our shipping contacts

677
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,910
that the Xu family is transporting a shipment of pepper

678
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,910
via the waterways to South Fujian.

679
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,570
It should arrive at the port in the next few days.

680
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,600
No wonder they

681
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,340
so readily agreed

682
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,830
to compete on the three-month revenue.

683
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,150
So, they’ve resolved

684
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,470
the pepper issue.

685
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,230
My Lord.

686
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:35,840
We’ve always

687
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,570
been slightly behind the Xu family.

688
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,950
Now that Xu Zilu

689
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,250
has managed to resolve this crisis,

690
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,030
how

691
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,570
can we possibly

692
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,670
surpass them

693
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,510
in just three months?

694
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,320
Why panic?

695
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,610
The shipment hasn’t arrived yet, right?

696
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,470
Use your brain.

697
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,310
Find a way.

698
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,320
Prevent them from getting that shipment.

699
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,910
Right.

700
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,240
Wait a minute.

701
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,830
My Lord.

702
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,710
Find out

703
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,040
where Prince Xian’s envoy

704
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,910
is staying.

705
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,110
Tomorrow, I’ll pay my respects.

706
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,950
Understood.

707
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,130
Eunuch Zhou, you’ve come to Linchun

708
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,440
without any prior notice.

709
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,870
I apologize for not welcoming you properly.

710
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,400
How can you say that, Mr. Xu?

711
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,650
I’m simply carrying out

712
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,490
a task for the prince

713
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,740
in the south.

714
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,860
I happened to pass through Linchun,

715
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,810
so I decided to stop by

716
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,560
and check on the orders from the Prince's Mansion.

717
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,760
It’s nothing urgent.

718
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,330
Perhaps

719
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,410
tomorrow, I could take you

720
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,530
to the incense workshop for a visit?

721
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:32,930
That won’t be necessary.

722
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,030
Mr. Xu, your reputation precedes you.

723
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,340
I trust the quality

724
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,140
of Jiuzhongtian’s products.

725
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,350
However,

726
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,120
I must remind you

727
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,270
that this incense is for sacrificial use.

728
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,310
The timing

729
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,960
must not be delayed.

730
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,250
Rest assured, Eunuch.

731
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,430
The delivery

732
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,310
will be on time.

733
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,850
And we won't delay the prince’s

734
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:53,980
important matters.

735
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,550
Here’s a small token.

736
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,010
It might come in handy during your travels.

737
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,470
If you need anything else,

738
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,160
don’t hesitate to ask.

739
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,350
How could I accept such a generous gift

740
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,990
from you?

741
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,670
But if you insist,

742
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,090
I’ll graciously accept.

743
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,440
It’s getting late,

744
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,250
so I’ll take my leave now.

745
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,840
Butler Tang, see the Eunuch out.

746
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,500
Of course.

747
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,130
Sir, this way, please.

748
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,170
Why did Prince Xian's man

749
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,970
suddenly come to rush the order?

750
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:37,790
Could it be that he knows

751
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,790
about our shortage of ingredients?

752
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,730
I think this eunuch

753
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,530
is probably just short on money.

754
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,360
Problems that can be solved with money

755
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,620
are not real problems.

756
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,600
[Agreement]

757
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,810
Don't worry, Se.

758
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,720
This time, there’s absolutely

759
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,320
no issue with the agreement.

760
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,900
But I have to say,

761
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,610
Xu Zilu’s writing skills

762
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,240
are indeed impressive.

763
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,310
If he were to take the imperial exam,

764
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,690
he might even become the top scholar.

765
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,490
By the way, Se,

766
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,930
does that mean the tricks you planned earlier

767
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,130
are now unnecessary?

768
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,410
What's wrong?

769
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,750
Ping'er.

770
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,090
Didn’t we gather

771
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,550
some dirt on Xu Zilu

772
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,710
yesterday?

773
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,630
Yes.

774
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
And we even discussed

775
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,530
spending a lot of money

776
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,030
to spread it far and wide.

777
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,620
What about it?

778
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,780
You forgot you hired Nosy Parker?

779
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,420
Don’t you think

780
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,790
the dirt we collected,

781
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,170
like him being weak

782
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,140
or unable to lift heavy things,

783
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,080
isn't too big

784
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,490
of a deal?

785
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,980
Of course.

786
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,610
Who would care about that?

787
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,650
But I think

788
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,190
you might have wasted your effort again.

789
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,980
You could’ve

790
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,420
spent that money on some good food instead.

791
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,740
You’re right.

792
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,150
Now I’m relieved.

793
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,200
Let's tidy

794
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,480
this up

795
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,340
and go to bed.

796
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,970
Let me tell you,

797
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,640
when I was younger,

798
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,460
I dreamed of marrying Mr. Xu.

799
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,000
Mr. Xu? That Xu Zilu?

800
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,000
Yes, but now that I think about it,

801
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,140
I'm glad he didn’t

802
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,510
choose me back then.

803
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,850
Isn’t he

804
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,720
rich and handsome?

805
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,050
Yes, but I heard

806
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,740
he's so weak and can’t even lift anything heavy.

807
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,770
Why would you despise him for that?

808
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,050
Can’t lift anything?

809
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,800
You didn’t know?

810
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,850
There’s even a satirical poem about it

811
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,710
making the rounds in the streets.

812
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,010
Tell me more!

813
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,670
I didn't expect that he...

814
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,440
The whole city knows.

815
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,240
Such a handsome man, what a pity.

816
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,070
Fortune.

817
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,110
By the way, Madam Xu,

818
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,140
there's a folk song circulating

819
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,730
in the streets.

820
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:48,730
Have you heard it?

821
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,180
I haven't heard it.

822
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,380
The richest man in Linchun, Xu Zilu,

823
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,980
kills enemies bare-handed, truly powerful.

824
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,390
4 of Circles.

825
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,590
The richest man in Linchun, Xu Zilu,

826
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,550
kills enemies bare-handed, truly powerful.

827
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,490
Strong on the outside, weak on the inside.

828
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,450
What a pity.

829
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,100
What did you say?

830
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,160
Say it again!

831
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,720
Zilu, you're back.

832
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:15,600
Come here quickly.

833
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,000
Greet the three doctors.

834
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,820
This is

835
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,530
Doctor Wang from Huichun Hall.

836
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,920
This is Doctor Liu from Yuqing Hall.

837
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:27,680
Young Master Xu.

838
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,300
And this is Doctor Tian from Shengshou Hall.

839
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,430
These three

840
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,750
are the top physicians

841
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,040
in our city.

842
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,170
Today,

843
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,310
I specially

844
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,590
invited them to the house

845
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,560
for a consultation.

846
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,520
I'm sure they'll find the cause of your ailment

847
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,380
and provide the right treatment.

848
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
That’s not necessary. I’m not sick.

849
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,870
Excuse me.

850
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,270
Come with me.

851
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,850
I’m really not sick.

852
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,640
I've already taken care of

853
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,950
these people with money.

854
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,180
They won’t spread anything

855
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,030
that happens here today.

856
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,440
This illness of yours

857
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,900
concerns the future of our Xu family.

858
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,510
You need to take it seriously, do you understand?

859
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,840
What are you talking about?

860
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,420
You still want to deceive me?

861
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,020
You still want to deceive me?

862
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:14,910
This satirical poem

863
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,470
has spread all over town.

864
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,430
I...

865
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,580
Mother.

866
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,310
How can you believe in rumors?

867
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,090
How is it a rumor?

868
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,790
Come back!

869
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,750
And you still have the nerve to visit Se.

870
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,950
You’d better get this illness treated.

871
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,230
Doctors,

872
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,010
how should we treat

873
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,370
my son's condition?

874
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,370
Touching

875
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,110
can directly determine the strength of his ability.

876
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,360
That’s not appropriate.

877
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,490
In my opinion,

878
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,150
he needs to take medicine to suppress the yin and boost the qi.

879
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,620
Use mental diversion,

880
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,010
combined with nourishing yin and dietary supplements.

881
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,910
Inspection by looking, listening, questioning, and feeling the pulse

882
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,380
can detect the body fluids.

883
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,540
Touching.

884
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,480
Inspection by looking, listening, questioning, and feeling the pulse.

885
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,610
-Touching.
-Dietary supplements.

886
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,390
Looking, listening, questioning, and feeling the pulse.

887
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,450
Massage and touch.

888
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,250
Looking, listening, questioning, and feeling the pulse.

889
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:02,690
Fine.

890
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:04,960
Do I have to

891
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,750
undress here

892
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,830
so you can all observe and diagnose me?

893
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,180
Young Master Xu.

894
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,010
It’s not that we want to see,

895
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,900
it’s just our duty.

896
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,310
Don’t mind him.

897
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,740
Hurry up and examine him.

898
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,100
Let me handle this.

899
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,350
Doctors,

900
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,850
I actually have a similar condition.

901
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,910
I know that dietary supplements work particularly well.

902
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,910
What should I eat?

903
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:26,990
Do you think I should...

904
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,830
You...

905
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,790
Fuding, what does this have to do with you?

906
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,370
Young Master Xu.

907
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:30,950
Xu Zilu!

908
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,610
Young Master Xu.

909
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,310
Come back!

910
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:32,950
Don't go.

911
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,060
Young Master Xu.

912
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,900
Luckily we didn't meet.

913
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,270
You actually came back.

914
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,110
My condition of impotence

915
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:58,450
has become known throughout the city.

916
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,850
I really owe it all to you.

917
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,550
Young Master Xu, what are you saying?

918
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,630
You are my savior.

919
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,240
I’m deeply grateful to you.

920
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,969
How could it be me spreading rumors?

921
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:09,920
It was not me.

922
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:10,610
You still know

923
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,540
I’m your savior?

924
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,650
Is this how you speak of me?

925
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:14,540
I dare not.

926
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,840
I truly didn’t do it on purpose.

927
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,800
I guarantee there will be no next time.

928
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,860
You just promised yesterday

929
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,630
that you wouldn’t cause trouble anymore.

930
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,520
You tricked me

931
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,719
into signing a fake agreement.

932
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,370
You lied to me

933
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:24,969
about selling all my belongings.

934
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:25,670
Then you made me copy books

935
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,929
and kept me from going out. That's why...

936
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,949
I went out and spoke ill of you.

937
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,520
I just didn’t expect it

938
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,320
to become this severe.

939
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,750
So it’s

940
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,870
my fault?

941
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,210
Not entirely.

942
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,889
It takes two to tango.

943
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,699
We both share responsibility in this matter.

944
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,630
But don’t worry.

945
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:47,469
I’ve already

946
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,469
sent someone to handle it.

947
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,370
I guarantee there will be

948
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,639
no more rumors tomorrow.

949
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,500
You stay here. I’m leaving first.

950
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,580
Aren’t you afraid of women anymore?

951
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,230
Anyway,

952
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,840
this issue started because of you.

953
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,410
If you don’t suppress

954
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:31,070
the rumors,

955
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,850
neither of us will have peace.

956
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,110
Move aside!

957
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,200
Young Master.

958
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:42,800
Young Master.

959
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,330
Have you clarified things?

960
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:53,480
Why is it so hot?

961
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,340
Was it really Young Madam?

962
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,610
I think I'm crazy.
