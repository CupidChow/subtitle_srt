[Debit Queen]

3
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,880
[Episode 4]

4
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,190
Well...

5
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,020
I...

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,580
Lady Meili must have

7
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,670
felt very wronged.

8
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,479
As long as

9
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,390
my dear beautiful daughter likes it,

10
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,860
she can smash whatever she wants.

11
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,630
Well done!

12
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,850
She has never

13
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,890
cried so sadly.

14
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,950
The Xu Family is doomed.

15
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,370
I won't let them off.

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,240
They even want to purchase goods with my help?

17
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,990
Bullshit!

18
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,730
No way!

19
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,710
My Lord, you're awesome.

20
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,970
Her eyes are red from crying.

21
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,970
What should we do?

22
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,640
They will swell when she gets up tomorrow.

23
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,270
Xiaohe,

24
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,890
help Lady Meili ask for a leave from the school.

25
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,870
Then buy some ice cubes and bring them back.

26
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,470
Prepare them for Lady Meili.

27
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,710
My Lord! My Lord!

28
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,190
Are you alright?

29
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,030
I'm fine.

30
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,350
I...

31
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,040
My Lord!

32
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,430
Tidy up her room at once.

33
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,180
Let me help you back first.

34
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,810
I think the lustre of

35
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,980
this color is suitable.

36
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,480
It'll make the skin look fair.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,020
Right?

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,220
This blue one looks nice, too.

39
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,170
Old Madam!

40
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,140
By that time, I will...

41
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:09,650
Old Madam.

42
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:10,710
Se, you're here.

43
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,320
Your nose

44
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,550
is really sensitive.

45
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,750
Just now, I was about to ask someone

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,810
to summon you here.

47
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,280
I noticed that you didn't bring

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,680
many clothes when you came to the mansion.

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,500
I've selected these several

50
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,030
pieces of sample cloth for you.

51
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,290
What color do you like?

52
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,270
I think this light color...

53
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,870
Old Madam.

54
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,710
It suits you very well.

55
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,800
Actually, I want to tell you the truth.

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,650
Xu Zilu and I...

57
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,470
He actually... I...

58
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,390
In the middle of the night,

59
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,500
don't mention his name.

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,810
If you mention his name, it'll spoil my fun.

61
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,590
Ms. Jia.

62
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,829
Look. We can make

63
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,079
a high-waisted dress for Se.

64
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:34,920
If it's close-fitting,

65
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,140
it can make her legs look longer.

66
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,390
Well, Xu Zilu and I...

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,010
We didn't...

68
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,610
By the way,

69
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,490
there's something I've

70
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,610
been wanting to tell you.

71
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,620
That's a secret.

72
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:43,880
You know what?

73
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,540
When Ziyuan was a kid,

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,360
his face looked quite delicate,

75
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,110
and he was like a little girl.

76
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,000
I just liked daughters,

77
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,590
so I let him wear dresses

78
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,320
and even let him wear hairpins.

79
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,630
Guess what?

80
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,160
He really wore them.

81
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,960
I didn't expect that after he grew up,

82
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,070
and I couldn't fool him anymore,

83
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,590
he would bring

84
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,040
Se for me at least.

85
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,800
Now I can dress you up

86
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,720
with no worries.

87
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,270
Look.

88
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,170
Let's make a long sleeve

89
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
with this pink cloth.

90
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,600
It represents wealth.

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,020
Long sleeves are not okay.

92
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,269
With long sleeves, it'll be inconvenient for me

93
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,800
to sell things at the stall.

94
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,529
What's more,

95
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,970
it'll be a waste to let me

96
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,320
wear such beautiful cloth.

97
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,450
No one will watch me.

98
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,780
I'll watch you.

99
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,710
I know how to judge people.

100
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,150
When I first saw you,

101
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,670
I knew you were a good girl.

102
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,140
Se.

103
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,090
Don't have the idea of self-negation arbitrarily

104
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,950
just because of

105
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,810
a few people who have ignored you.

106
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,890
Understand?

107
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,290
You have suffered a lot

108
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,490
in the past few years.

109
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,040
I didn't suffer at all.

110
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,070
Since my mother passed away,

111
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,110
no one has cared about

112
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,570
whether I suffered or not.

113
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,950
You have a mother now.

114
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,930
Your mother is here.

115
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,060
As long as I'm here,

116
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,020
no one will dare to make you suffer.

117
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,080
If you don't have enough clothes to wear

118
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,280
or enough food to eat,

119
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,090
or you need to use money,

120
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,120
just tell me.

121
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,670
I'll give you as much as you want.

122
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,570
That's not okay.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,300
Compared with spending money,

124
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,630
I prefer earning money.

125
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,530
What if I accidentally

126
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,540
earn so much money that I become the richest person?

127
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,920
I just like your temper like this.

128
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,240
Look at you.

129
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,190
This is what

130
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,120
the daughter-in-law of our Xu Family should be like.

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,290
Didn't you just say that

132
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,890
you had something to tell me?

133
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,960
Darling.

134
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,480
It's so late now.

135
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,420
Why haven't you gone back yet?

136
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,630
Are you trying to

137
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,890
tell on me in front of my mother?

138
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,390
Now I understand it.

139
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,620
No wonder Se rushed to

140
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,280
my room angrily at night.

141
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,690
You...

142
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,180
You must have made Se angry.

143
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
Apologize to her!

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,900
Mother.

145
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,710
How can you ask me to apologize

146
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,090
without figuring out the truth?

147
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,900
Nonsense.

148
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,940
This is the Xu Family's rule.

149
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,990
Don't you know that?

150
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,610
If a husband quarrels with his wife,

151
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,220
it's always the husband's fault.

152
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,110
Apologize now.

153
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,810
Who set this rule?

154
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,570
Your father.

155
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,570
Darling, I'm sorry.

156
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,400
I shouldn't have joked about you

157
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,670
by saying that you have wide shoulders and a thick waist.

158
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,730
Actually, your waist

159
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,830
is not thick at all.

160
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,580
Your waist is thick.

161
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,630
Enough.

162
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,380
You're acting like a child.

163
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,400
Let me tell you.

164
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,290
In terms of the principle for a couple to get along with each other,

165
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,820
the most important thing is

166
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,750
to stop before going too far.

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,510
A small argument can strengthen your feelings,

168
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,630
while a big argument is bad for your health.

169
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,560
Smile for me now.

170
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,560
You look so pretty when you smile. Come here!

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,070
I heard that the girl from the Tao's Mansion

172
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,330
came to our home today.

173
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,190
Go to her mansion tomorrow

174
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,390
and apologize to her.

175
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,770
The Imperial Merchants Conference

176
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,830
is coming soon.

177
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,290
Now there are so many people

178
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,230
who are watching the Xu Family.

179
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,920
We can't make any mistake at this time.

180
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,720
If this plan is ruined

181
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,960
because of you and me,

182
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,790
I'll kill myself here.

183
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,070
Mother.

184
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,480
That depends on whether

185
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,159
my wife wants me to go or not.

186
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,380
So please

187
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,710
help him

188
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
and keep an eye on him.

189
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,450
My mother is talking to you.

190
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,070
Okay.

191
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,030
I'll definitely keep a close eye on him.

192
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,470
She'll keep a close eye on you.

193
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:52,930
Let's go.

194
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,909
Let's go select the fabric.

195
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,409
Sure.

196
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,280
Mother, I think this pink color

197
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,480
is really beautiful.

198
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,880
It suits your skin color very well.

199
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,810
I think so, too.

200
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,310
Xu Zilu.

201
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,340
Don't walk so fast. Just...

202
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,140
Young Master.

203
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,130
Are you okay?

204
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,940
I can't believe that you came up with

205
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,330
such a dirty trick.

206
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,310
Darling, I'm flattered.

207
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,670
It's just a small trick.

208
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,330
It's not worth mentioning it.

209
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,080
Alright.

210
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,310
I won't leave.

211
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,810
Don't regret it.

212
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,190
Young Master.

213
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,720
What did you do to Young Madam this time?

214
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,630
She found out that the agreement was fake.

215
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,750
Then why don't you just give her

216
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,570
a real one?

217
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,590
I don't think Young Madam is bad.

218
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,760
The hardest thing to see through is a person's heart.

219
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,360
You trust others too easily.

220
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:44,870
Yes.

221
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:46,810
If you don't give her a real one,

222
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,830
and she doesn't cooperate,

223
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,690
it'll ruin our big plan, won't it?

224
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,590
I don't think she'll be able to

225
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,650
cause any trouble.

226
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,040
If I really give it to her,

227
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,550
I'll also have to see

228
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,550
whether she's really trustworthy.

229
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,510
I think you will contradict yourself.

230
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,820
Young Madam.

231
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,630
Are you looking for Young Master?

232
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,760
I need to talk to him.

233
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,280
Young Master went out early in the morning.

234
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,540
He said that he would only be back at noon.

235
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:22,960
Thank you.

236
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,710
Young Master.

237
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,400
Young Master.

238
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,130
You are back.

239
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,560
Did anything happen

240
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,730
in the mansion today?

241
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,790
Nothing happened.

242
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:55,730
Really?

243
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,300
Yes, nothing happened.

244
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,830
Young Master, don't worry.

245
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,790
Young Master is worried that

246
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,860
Young Madam might make trouble in the mansion.

247
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,660
He has been worried all morning.

248
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,960
So you've been

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,370
thinking about Young Madam?

250
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,970
Young Madam has been at home this morning.

251
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,900
She's been good.

252
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,700
Is she so obedient today?

253
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,740
Young Master, you're awe-inspiring.

254
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,780
I knew Young Madam would be like that.

255
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,900
What kind of weird thing do you think

256
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,760
she could do in the mansion alone?

257
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,510
Young Madam

258
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,730
may not know

259
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,160
what Young Master likes,

260
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,930
but she surely knows

261
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,730
what Young Master doesn't like.

262
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:44,330
Shut up!

263
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,340
Ling Se, come out!

264
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,470
Mother.

265
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,420
Why are you so angry?

266
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,100
Did you decorate my room?

267
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,330
Yes.

268
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,270
I've been busy decorating your room all morning.

269
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,040
Do you like it?

270
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,300
Who let you hang those green decorations in my room?

271
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
Go change them for me!

272
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,740
Why?

273
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,770
I've been busy doing it all morning,

274
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,590
because I want to give you a new life

275
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,450
and a new start.

276
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,180
You don't like it?

277
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,470
Xu Zilu, stop right there!

278
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,260
You ungrateful man.

279
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,670
Se has been

280
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,070
busy for you all morning.

281
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,410
I think they look good.

282
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,550
Don't change them.

283
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,950
Who dares to change them?

284
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,940
I won't change them.

285
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,470
Darling, don't go.

286
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,890
I've specially made many dishes that are all over the table.

287
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,940
I just want our whole family

288
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,870
to have a meal together.

289
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,420
I've even put your bowl and chopsticks there.

290
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:42,960
Why don't you...

291
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,690
That's right.

292
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,490
It's noon now.

293
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,800
It's rare for you to eat at home.

294
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,490
Come here.

295
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,870
Mother, Ms. Jia told me that

296
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,400
you grew up in Sichuan,

297
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,350
so I specially made this Sichuan food.

298
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,100
Mother, taste it to see if it's authentic enough.

299
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,230
My daughter-in-law is so thoughtful.

300
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,330
Yummy!

301
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,900
Yummy?

302
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,950
It's the Sichuan dialect.

303
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,210
It means "delicious".

304
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,790
Eat more.

305
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,020
Darling.

306
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,460
Taste this Duck Blood in Chili Sauce.

307
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,390
Taste it to see if it's yummy.

308
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,630
Se.

309
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,750
My son

310
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,330
has hated spicy food since childhood.

311
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,390
People in this mansion

312
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,870
always cook meals according to his taste.

313
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,310
We've never prepared any spicy dishes.

314
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,310
He doesn't have the luck to enjoy it.

315
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,280
It's my fault.

316
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,210
I didn't know that my husband doesn't like spicy food.

317
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,150
It's my fault.

318
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,130
Poached Spicy Pork Slices?

319
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,640
This is also my specialty dish.

320
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,770
This little chilli is also delicious.

321
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,120
This meat is amazing, too.

322
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,140
It's delicious.

323
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,870
Darling, I forgot to tell you that

324
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,910
this is Cabbage in Mustard Sauce.

325
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,640
It's the spiciest one among all the dishes.

326
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,830
Stop!

327
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,350
What?

328
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,860
Are you going to hit me?

329
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,880
I'm so scared.

330
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,510
You did it on purpose, right?

331
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,030
Young Master Xu,

332
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,560
what are you talking about?

333
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,430
How could I

334
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,180
not do it on purpose?

335
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,670
It was all thanks to your good friend,

336
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,540
Mr. Wang.

337
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,430
He even told me that you wetted

338
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,960
your bed when you were a kid.

339
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,640
He also told me that you hate green.

340
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,350
My efficiency was very high, wasn't it?

341
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,540
This morning, I brought you

342
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,140
so many things that you hate.

343
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,740
It's a pity that I don't have enough funds.

344
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,440
Otherwise,

345
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,510
I would have found ten maids

346
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,470
and asked them to wear green clothes

347
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,490
to sing and dance in front of you.

348
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,530
What a pity.

349
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,370
Don't think that you can do whatever you want

350
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,940
just because my mother likes you.

351
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,020
I dare not.

352
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,630
I dare not. I dare not.

353
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,730
I learned this trick from you.

354
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,240
If you don't like it,

355
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,020
just kick me out.

356
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,510
You...

357
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,830
Are you having a bellyache

358
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,960
because the food you ate was too spicy?

359
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Just wait and see.

360
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,040
Darling, bye.

361
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,630
Turn left to get to the toilet.

362
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,050
No hurry.

363
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,560
I'll see how long you can put up with me.

364
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,940
Uncle.

365
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:39,870
Zilu.

366
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,820
What's wrong with you?

367
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,110
You went to the toilet many times

368
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,510
within such a short time.

369
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,150
I just had a bellyache because I ate something improper.

370
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,590
Uncle.

371
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,450
What were you talking about?

372
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,950
That's why I said

373
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,870
it's better to remove enmity than to form it.

374
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:54,690
You had better

375
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,400
go visit the Tao's Mansion.

376
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,670
I'm afraid it'll be hard to have a chance to turn the trend.

377
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,870
The Tao Family is also experienced in doing business.

378
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,470
They won't go against money.

379
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,600
If both parties can gain benefits,

380
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,380
I'm sure

381
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,590
the Tao Family won't refuse to earn money from this plan.

382
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,310
But now,

383
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,930
I'm afraid I can't even

384
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,990
enter their house.

385
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,870
I'll go with you.

386
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,250
I don't believe that

387
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:18,790
Tao Ziran

388
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,810
will forbid me from entering his house, too.

389
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,320
Okay.

390
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,800
Then I'll go with you tomorrow.

391
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,670
Okay.

392
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:29,390
Well...

393
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,380
Zilu.

394
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,580
Do you need to see a doctor?

395
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,560
No, Uncle.

396
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,570
Excuse me.

397
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,330
Ling Se.

398
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Just wait and see.

399
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,850
Young Master Xu is so miserable.

400
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,410
Sister.

401
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,800
What are we

402
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,760
going to do next?

403
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,030
I still have

404
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,080
many dirty tricks which I'm waiting to

405
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,870
use on him.

406
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,430
However,

407
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,470
I have to wait for two days before I use them.

408
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,770
He won't fall into my trap easily these two days.

409
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,110
By that time,

410
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,580
I'll suddenly use

411
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,490
a big trick on him.

412
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,680
How brilliant.

413
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,220
You're really brilliant.

414
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,070
Not bad.

415
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,180
Alright.

416
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,150
Let's rest early.

417
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,710
Tomorrow morning,

418
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,190
we'll still need to go out to sell things at the stall.

419
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,000
Wait, Sister.

420
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,330
Why do we still have to sell things at the stall?

421
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,590
What other choices can we have?

422
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,320
In a year,

423
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,550
we'll still have to leave here.

424
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,310
We need to save money for our leaving here, don't we?

425
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,240
It turns out that

426
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,090
you're not going to leave now?

427
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,690
If I had not signed the agreement,

428
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,280
I would leave now.

429
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,360
But in two days,

430
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,870
the Imperial Merchants Recommendation Conference will be held.

431
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,350
If I leave now,

432
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,890
Old Madam will get sick because of anger,

433
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,890
won't she?

434
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,170
She's so nice to me.

435
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,390
I can't do this to her.

436
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,830
You're just so stubborn that you refuse to admit it.

437
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,770
Ping'er,

438
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,720
you're getting bolder and bolder.

439
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,480
How unlucky.

440
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,030
Why are you following me?

441
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,430
Why are you following me?

442
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,380
Look. What do you think of my clothes?

443
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,400
Can I surpass

444
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,490
Mrs. Qin in beauty?

445
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,640
Old Madam.

446
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,460
There are the latest patterns on your clothes.

447
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,609
I'm sure you'll win.

448
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:27,970
Mother!

449
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,310
Mother.

450
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,910
You look so beautiful today.

451
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,860
Se, you're here.

452
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,510
You have such a sweet mouth.

453
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,350
Why didn't you sleep for a while longer?

454
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,810
Mother.

455
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,510
I'm here to greet you.

456
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,430
Did you two come together?

457
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,160
-Of course not.
-Of course not.

458
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,530
Mother.

459
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,670
Look.

460
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,990
I've specially brought you some snacks.

461
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,730
Snacks?

462
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,450
Come and taste them

463
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,780
to see if they're yummy.

464
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,670
Just let me see them now.

465
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,750
Let me see them.

466
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,390
There are so many snacks.

467
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,590
How do you know I like sweet food?

468
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,110
I'll eat this.

469
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,100
Yummy!

470
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,830
It's yummy?

471
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,490
Mother.

472
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,870
I can also make Mung Bean Soup,

473
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,490
Furong Cakes,

474
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,810
Red Bean Pastries and Red Date Cakes.

475
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,940
If you like eating them,

476
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,580
I'll make them for you gradually in the future.

477
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,070
I'm so lucky to have a chance eat the delicious food.

478
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,320
Mother, take your time to eat them.

479
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,380
I'm leaving first.

480
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,520
If I go later,

481
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,790
there will be no good positions in the morning fair.

482
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,250
Mother.

483
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,830
Today,

484
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,400
you've invited some friends to play mahjong

485
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,060
with you in our mansion, haven't you?

486
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,480
Why don't you take Ling Se along

487
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,010
so that everyone can taste the food she makes?

488
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,140
Xu Zilu, you obviously know that I...

489
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,600
Why didn't I think of that?

490
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,200
Right?

491
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,040
These several old women

492
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,000
have shown off the good traits of their daughter-in-laws

493
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,520
in front of me many times

494
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,750
in the past few years.

495
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,230
They just thought that I didn't have a daughter-in-law.

496
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,530
Now that I have Se,

497
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,480
I'm also going to show it off

498
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,570
to piss those several old women off

499
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,030
and defeat them this time.

500
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,780
-But I...
-Ling Se.

501
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,410
My mother has asked for it.

502
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,040
Just accompany her

503
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,670
to entertain those several old ladies.

504
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,770
That's right.

505
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,780
If there's anything, just deal with it tomorrow.

506
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,740
Even an official of the imperial court

507
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,470
has a few days' marriage leave.

508
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:05,170
Please

509
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,900
help me with this.

510
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:07,960
Mother.

511
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,610
Then I'll get back to work.

512
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,990
Have fun.

513
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,620
Just leave at once.

514
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,480
Se.

515
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,240
Today,

516
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,230
you have to perform well.

517
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,060
Help me piss those several old women off.

518
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,570
Young Master.

519
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,630
What a good trick you've used.

520
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,230
Every time Old Madam played mahjong,

521
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,830
she always fought with them.

522
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,830
Young Madam has never seen such a scene.

523
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,090
You are so cunning.

524
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,950
Young Madam is no match for you.

525
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,710
Stay here and keep an eye on her.

526
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,150
Don't let her out until it's over.

527
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,610
No problem, Young Master.

528
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,600
You're so bad.

529
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,030
You go.

530
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:53,490
You go.

531
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,090
You go.

532
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,380
My Lady,

533
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,240
you don't eat or drink.

534
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,990
If His Lordship knows it,

535
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,960
he will feel bad.

536
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,810
I won't eat.

537
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,460
My Lady,

538
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,370
how about we go to the western suburbs to have fun?

539
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,960
The maple leaves are red now.

540
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,560
I won't go.

541
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,250
Well, let's play the game of pitch-pot.

542
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,980
Right. Let's play the game of pitch-pot.

543
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,020
I won't play it.

544
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,040
If I can't

545
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:15,960
vent my anger,

546
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,370
I won't stay alive.

547
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,470
My Lady,

548
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,840
how can you ease your worries?

549
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,900
Only by buying things can you do that.

550
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,470
This is a good way.

551
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:27,890
Xiaohe!

552
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:29,720
Prepare more money.

553
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,390
I'm going to buy as many things as I want

554
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,110
so that Ling Se, that annoying girl,

555
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,170
will be so envious.

556
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,360
His Lordship asked you two to sit for a while first.

557
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,420
He'll be back soon.

558
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,890
Gentlemen, please have some tea here.

559
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,150
Let's sit down.

560
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,710
What do you mean?

561
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,830
When did I

562
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,710
make up stories to slander your son?

563
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,010
If Mrs. Xu had not

564
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,990
talked about her daughter-in-law

565
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,320
who ran a stall outside,

566
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,880
do you think I would have brought up this subject?

567
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,540
Look at you. You're really...

568
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,200
What's wrong with my daughter-in-law running a stall?

569
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,180
Though my daughter-in-law runs a stall,

570
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,780
she's better than your daughter-in-law.

571
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,130
Spit out what you've eaten

572
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,750
if you're so capable.

573
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,590
You should spit it out, too.

574
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,520
She's even so angry?

575
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,900
Why are you blaming me?

576
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,100
I didn't say that.

577
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,460
Look at you.

578
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,590
It was you who said it.

579
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,390
Stop being so unreasonable in front of me.

580
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,790
I heard you two saying it.

581
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,710
You've said it more than twice.

582
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,650
How could you say that?

583
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,980
Why can't I say that?

584
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:37,470
Well...

585
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,850
If you had not said that... Look.

586
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,990
What did I say?

587
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:40,610
Didn't you brag at night?

588
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,610
Spit it out if you're so capable.

589
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,590
How do I spit it out?

590
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,290
Why should I spit it out?

591
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:44,240
I'll spit it out if you can spit it out.

592
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,930
Gosh.

593
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,470
Wait!

594
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,340
If her family is so rich, how come...

595
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,300
-Don't you think she's so annoying?
-I won!

596
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,490
It's a self-drawn victory with all tiles in one suit.

597
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,390
You have to pay me the money doubly, right?

598
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,150
How boring.

599
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,330
Gosh.

600
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,210
Threefold!

601
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,170
Threefold!

602
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,350
Give us the money.

603
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,350
Give us the money.

604
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,190
That bloody Xu Zilu.

605
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,070
He deliberately made me

606
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,250
stay there to play mahjong.

607
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,580
Luckily, I was so smart.

608
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,580
You think you were smart?

609
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,310
It was obvious that

610
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,090
you won so much money that

611
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,620
those several old ladies were speechless.

612
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,090
That was why we ended the game perfunctorily.

613
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,690
It was also due to my excellent mahjong skills.

614
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,590
Yes, yes, yes.

615
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:15,950
Apart from studying,

616
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,020
my sister is good at

617
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,540
doing everything else.

618
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,940
Do we still have to sell things at the stall today?

619
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,340
It's almost dinner time.

620
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,530
It's too late to sell things at the stall now.

621
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,150
Besides,

622
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,070
they ate up all the food

623
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,180
I was going to sell.

624
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,070
You're such a money-grubber.

625
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:29,950
The money we've won

626
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,350
in the mahjong game today

627
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,040
is enough to run a stall for ten days or half a month.

628
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,110
For all the money I've won,

629
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,710
I have to give it back to them.

630
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,630
Why?

631
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,870
The winner has to

632
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,080
treat others to a meal.

633
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,010
This is the rule.

634
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,980
Since I've won some money,

635
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,050
don't you think Old Madam

636
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:45,950
will treat others to a meal by that time?

637
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,100
Then I'll have to return the money to Old Madam.

638
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,190
Isn't it the same?

639
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,390
Well,

640
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,480
for the money I've just won,

641
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,450
I haven't kept it for a long time,

642
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,740
and I have to return it.

643
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,840
It would be better if they had not given it to me.

644
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,650
I don't understand.

645
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,070
Anyway, except for studying,

646
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,680
you don't understand anything else.

647
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,210
Let's go.

648
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,310
Come with me to select a gift

649
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,110
for Old Madam.

650
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,830
My Lady!

651
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,200
My Lady! My Lady!

652
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,750
Wait for me!

653
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,490
I haven't shopped

654
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,470
at this street carefully before.

655
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,230
Today, I'm going to buy some stuff here nicely today.

656
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,170
You'll go on buying stuff?

657
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,060
I can't carry extra things now.

658
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,090
You can send them back home first.

659
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,090
You're so stupid.

660
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,660
What if you're in danger?

661
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,250
What a nagger.

662
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,580
How could I be in danger?

663
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,240
That's not okay. I still have to follow you.

664
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,500
Sir, this bracelet...

665
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,400
Stingy Girl?

666
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,890
Miss Tao, what a coincidence.

667
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,150
Unfortunately,

668
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,520
I'll buy this bracelet.

669
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,870
Miss Tao,

670
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,840
I selected this first.

671
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,870
You're really interesting.

672
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,330
You competed with me for the place

673
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,270
and for the man.

674
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,930
Now you're also competing with me for the bracelet.

675
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,590
Miss Tao,

676
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,170
I came into the shop first.

677
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,430
I came in first.

678
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,030
I...

679
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,180
Ladies.

680
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,260
-Ladies.
-I selected it first.

681
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,590
Please calm down first.

682
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,770
No matter which of you

683
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,280
selected this bracelet first,

684
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,260
if you go on scrambling

685
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,850
for it with so much strength,

686
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,460
once this bracelet gets broken, which of you will compensate for it?

687
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,060
My Lady.

688
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,630
I'll pay.

689
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,580
300 coins.

690
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,130
I'll buy it.

691
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:03,750
Okay.

692
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,910
600 coins.

693
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,080
I'll pay one tael of silver.

694
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,610
Three taels of silver.

695
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,750
Five taels!

696
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,830
Do you have five taels of silver in your pocket?

697
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,470
Is it enough?

698
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,010
Yes, it is.

699
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,300
Miss, you not only have good taste,

700
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,640
but you're also very generous.

701
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,970
You're both beautiful and kind-hearted.

702
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,510
You are indeed rich and willful.

703
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,030
Fine.

704
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,990
I'll let you buy this bracelet.

705
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:31,920
Sir.

706
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,410
Do you have some bracelets that look nicer?

707
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:34,910
Yes.

708
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,730
Then please look at the one in front of you.

709
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,220
This one looks quite nice.

710
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,950
I'll buy this one, too.

711
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,550
Fine.

712
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,910
I'll let you buy it.

713
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,040
Sir,

714
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,730
I want the most valuable

715
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,700
and the most beautiful

716
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,960
bracelet in your shop.

717
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,850
Then please look at this row,

718
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,390
especially this green agate.

719
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,100
It's the best of all agates.

720
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,790
The lighter its color is, the more crystal clear it is.

721
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,010
It's from the Western Region.

722
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,220
I haven't been willing to sell it till now.

723
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,150
If you like it,

724
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,430
I'll sell it to you with a discount.

725
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,540
No need to give me a discount.

726
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,560
Just sell it at the original price.

727
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,140
I'll buy all the bracelets at this row.

728
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,270
I'll buy all the bracelets at this row.

729
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:15,970
My Lady.

730
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,030
Don't be impulsive.

731
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:17,500
Shut up!

732
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,200
If I can't surpass others,

733
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
can't I surpass this annoying girl?

734
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,430
My Lady, well...

735
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,800
Pay the money.

736
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,630
Sir!

737
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,090
They've even bought these bracelets.

738
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,900
What can I buy?

739
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,360
Why don't you continue to take a look at...

740
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,120
other products?

741
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,730
Take a look at other products.

742
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,600
In your shop, what other products

743
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,780
can I take a look at now?

744
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,760
For the stuff I like,

745
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,010
it's not something a bumpkin

746
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,340
like you can wish to buy.

747
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,310
Sibing.

748
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,030
Let's go.

749
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,720
Come on, Xianggui!

750
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,390
Pack the things.

751
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,830
Okay.

752
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,510
Come on.

753
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:51,820
Sir.

754
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,150
You've made a fortune today.

755
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,350
Thanks to you,

756
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,810
I've made a small fortune today.

757
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,630
Since it's all thanks to me,

758
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,230
I still lack

759
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,820
a few coins to buy this bracelet.

760
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,060
Why don't you round the figure down to an integer?

761
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,520
Miss, you have good taste.

762
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,930
This bracelet is a top-quality product.

763
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:09,870
It's even more expensive

764
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,360
than all the products which Miss Tao

765
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,910
selected just now.

766
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,820
But since you

767
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,180
brought me a fortune like my God of Wealth,

768
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,660
just offer the price as you like.

769
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,200
I’m not the God of Wealth.

770
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,300
The real God of Wealth

771
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,350
is that Miss Tao.

772
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,870
She is stupid and rich.

773
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:24,520
How about this?

774
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,430
When she comes here next time,

775
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:25,970
you can mention my name.

776
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,880
In this way, I'm sure she'll buy anything you recommend.

777
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,350
Okay.

778
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,740
Pack it up.

779
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,180
Okay.

780
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,470
Come on, sir.

781
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,990
Come and take a look at the wine.

782
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,440
As I'm thinking of the expression

783
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
of the Stingy Girl when she couldn't

784
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,240
buy anything,

785
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,520
I feel quite refreshed.

786
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:42,990
What do you think?

787
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,920
Isn't it pretty?

788
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,170
Yes, it's pretty.

789
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,810
But we didn't have to buy so many bracelets, did we?

790
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,490
So many bracelets?

791
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,580
It only cost dozens of taels to buy these bracelets.

792
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,220
My Lady.

793
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,190
A relative in my family used to

794
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,120
do such business.

795
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,870
These dozens of taels

796
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,060
are enough to buy a carriage of bracelets.

797
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,990
So what?

798
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,470
Obviously, Young Madam Xu tricked you

799
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,470
into buying them.

800
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,570
She tricked me?

801
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,770
She didn't want to buy these bracelets at all.

802
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:05,970
She deliberately raised the prices

803
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,770
to make you...

804
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

805
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,690
I wanted to talk, but you didn't let me.

806
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,690
So, just now, that Stingy Girl

807
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,180
pretended to me on purpose

808
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,310
in order to make me spend more money?

809
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,100
Then I really spent more money,

810
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,160
and I was even so pleased with myself.

811
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,080
Weren't you quite happy just now?

812
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,310
I'm going to argue with that owner of the shop now.

813
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:27,910
Come back!

814
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,120
Do you think it's not embarrassing enough?

815
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,880
Ling Se, you annoying girl!

816
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:36,830
From now on,

817
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,860
I won't exist with you.

818
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,330
You won't exit with me.

819
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:49,460
My Lady, look.

820
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:50,540
I didn't lie to you, did I?

821
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,780
It didn't break even after you threw it to the ground like that.

822
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,320
My Lady!

823
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,150
Wait for me!

824
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,380
Isn't this Young Master Xu?

825
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,710
How come you still dare to come to my home?

826
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,560
I admire you.

827
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,840
Mr. Tao,

828
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,550
I asked my Third Uncle

829
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,660
to bring this for you from Furong City.

830
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,660
It's a small gift.

831
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,030
Please accept it.

832
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,800
It's the Wuyi Mountain Dahongpao Tea?

833
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,690
It's for you.

834
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,510
Normally, something like this

835
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,310
would be sent to the palace directly.

836
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,360
It can't be bought in the market even though you have money.

837
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,470
It's for you.

838
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,320
Xu,

839
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,020
now you have many approaches.

840
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,800
Stop teasing me.

841
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,420
Thank you.

842
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,960
Have a seat.

843
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,860
Sit.

844
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,500
If you have something to say, just say it now.

845
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,760
I'm not that free.

846
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,280
For the cooperation we've discussed before,

847
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,190
the Tao's Mansion has never

848
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,990
sent the agreement to our place.

849
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,360
I wonder whether you still have concerns

850
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,030
about a certain clause.

851
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,720
Are you playing dumb?

852
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,800
This matter has become like this now.

853
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,820
Tell me how we can

854
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,400
cooperate with each other.

855
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,480
My daughter has become a joke in the entire city.

856
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,690
I haven't got even with you about this,

857
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,950
but I'll just let it go.

858
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,910
Tao.

859
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,740
These are two different things.

860
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,150
The problem between the kids

861
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,680
is something between them.

862
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,630
But business is business.

863
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,660
We are living at the same city.

864
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,640
We tend to meet each other easily every day.

865
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,080
Wouldn't it be better if we could

866
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,010
resolve the conflicts between us?

867
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,390
If you think that we can still

868
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,050
negotiate about this matter,

869
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,290
I'm willing to

870
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,900
raise the original price

871
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,850
by 20% again.

872
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
What do you think?

873
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,430
20%?

874
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,230
I'll also ask Zilu

875
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,150
to come here to apologize to your daughter.

876
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,210
What do you think?

877
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,520
If just as you said,

878
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,630
you can give my daughter an explanation,

879
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:22,790
we can still

880
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:23,410
negotiate

881
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,630
about this matter.

882
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,150
Father!

883
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,030
Father!

884
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,800
I can't live this life anymore.

885
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,030
Well... What... What happened?

886
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:31,890
What happened?

887
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,720
What's wrong?

888
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,490
I don't care.

889
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,820
Ask him to leave.

890
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,550
I don't want to see him.

891
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,870
From now on,

892
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,820
the members of the Xu Family are not allowed to enter the Tao's Mansion.

893
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,420
What's going on?

894
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,540
Lady Meili

895
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,080
argued with that girl again.

896
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,740
Who is it?

897
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,440
Young Madam Xu

898
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,510
colluded with the owner

899
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,250
of the jewellery shop

900
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,250
to cheat Lady Meili out of her money.

901
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,030
It's just some money.

902
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,940
I have plenty of money.

903
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,430
I'll give you some money again.

904
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,660
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

905
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,250
Miss Tao.

906
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,150
Although I don't know the details of this matter,

907
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,210
I'll take responsibility for the money

908
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,000
you've lost.

909
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,720
Ling Se is my wife.

910
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,230
Since she has done something wrong,

911
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,470
I'll apologize to you on her behalf.

912
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,110
Wife?

913
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,860
Your wife?

914
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,500
Do I need money?

915
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,080
Ling Se made me become a laughing stock

916
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,690
in public again and again.

917
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,730
You're still defending her?

918
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:28,680
Fine.

919
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,430
Ask Ling Se to kneel down and apologize to me here.

920
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,760
She'll have to kneel until I'm satisfied.

921
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,080
Otherwise,

922
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,380
you won't be able to talk about business with my father.

923
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,070
Xu Zilu, you're just blind.

924
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,750
Meili.

925
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,670
Meili.

926
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,660
Follow her! Follow her!

927
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,470
What's going on now?

928
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:51,950
Well...

929
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,620
You saw it, didn't you?

930
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,730
Either you do as my daughter said,

931
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,630
or you won't be able to discuss this transaction with me.

932
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,720
Then I'll ask my niece-in-law to come here to apologize.

933
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,790
With Mr. Tao here,

934
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,170
he won't really let a young girl

935
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:07,030
keep kneeling like that, will he?

936
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,760
Am I right?

937
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,710
Since ancient times,

938
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,310
only one person has not been able to make a quarrel.

939
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,710
If you want my wife to apologize, it's okay.

940
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,420
But your daughter will also

941
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,020
have to apologize to my wife.

942
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,940
Who do you think your wife is?

943
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,970
You want my daughter to apologize to your wife?

944
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,230
Xu, you have to know that

945
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,120
you're the one who begs me.

946
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,650
I'm not the one who begs you.

947
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,330
Calm down. Calm down.

948
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:29,970
Mr. Tao.

949
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,480
You and I are both businessmen.

950
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,690
Business is business.

951
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,830
Let's not talk about personal feelings.

952
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,620
If this cooperation can be achieved,

953
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,820
it'll be a good thing.

954
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,990
If it can't be achieved, the friendship will still exist.

955
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,930
Why do you have to make no distinctions between them?

956
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,660
First of all,

957
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,400
I didn't do anything

958
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,930
improper to your daughter.

959
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,280
Secondly, I didn't promise her

960
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,080
anything about the engagement.

961
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,200
The conflicts between your daughter

962
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,840
and my wife

963
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,190
were purely caused by her own wishful thinking.

964
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,270
Don't you know

965
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,120
what her temper is like?

966
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,070
Moreover,

967
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,170
I never beg others for help.

968
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,210
You're not the only one we can cooperate with.

969
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,430
Xu Zilu,

970
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,900
you're awesome.

971
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,850
Your Xu Family is awesome.

972
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,210
I won't entertain you anymore.

973
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:09,840
Get out!

974
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,130
Goodbye.

975
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,070
Bye!

976
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:12,840
Zilu.

977
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,110
Tao.

978
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,140
I... I'll come again to see you.

979
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,070
I'll come again.

980
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:16,930
Zilu!

981
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,150
Zilu!

982
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,400
What a rude brat!

983
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,500
Zilu.

984
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,930
Zilu, stop right there!

985
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,220
How could you be so impulsive,

986
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,690
vent your anger like that

987
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,670
and just refuse

988
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,610
the Tao Family's request directly?

989
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,810
It's just an apology.

990
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,880
Not only will there be no losses,

991
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,010
but we can also solve

992
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,520
the Xu Family's current problem at once.

993
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,180
What's so difficult about it?

994
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,240
Do you care so much about that woman

995
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,650
and disregard

996
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,190
the Xu Family's future?

997
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,160
What does it have to do with her?

998
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,410
How could it be possible that I care about her?

999
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,020
Uncle.

1000
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,980
Cooperation requires mutual trust.

1001
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,880
If we agree

1002
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,110
to their terms today,

1003
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,800
it will solve our urgent crisis indeed.

1004
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:02,770
But they will also think that

1005
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,500
they can control the Xu Family.

1006
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,070
When a more critical time comes in the future,

1007
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,660
if they use the same trick again,

1008
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,060
won't we be more passive?

1009
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,210
How could I entrust the Xu Family's future

1010
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,739
to such a business partner?

1011
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,130
Okay. Okay.

1012
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,820
You've grown up.

1013
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,900
I'm not able to refute what you said.

1014
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,340
But you have to discipline

1015
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,670
your wife strictly.

1016
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,429
Don't let her come out

1017
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,230
to cause trouble to the Xu Family again.

1018
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,060
The Xu Family

1019
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,800
might become an Imperial Commercial Firm soon.

1020
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,250
From now on, you have to be more cautious with

1021
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,310
your words and actions when you socialize with others.

1022
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,659
Don't make yourself get into trouble.

1023
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,110
My Lady.

1024
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,070
Now if you make the goods

1025
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,080
you're going to sell tomorrow morning,

1026
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,630
they won't taste good if they're placed there for a long time.

1027
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,139
I only had these several copper coins.

1028
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:52,580
I bought some rice, and I'm going to make wine.

1029
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,909
I have to go get a jar now.

1030
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:57,130
Just the two of us will go get it?

1031
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,990
Who else will go with us?

1032
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,050
I don't have the money to hire others.

1033
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Where is my stuff?

1034
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,050
I obviously put it here this morning.

1035
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,070
Did the butler

1036
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,290
take your stuff away?

1037
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,030
That's impossible.

1038
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,640
I clearly told Mr. Tang

1039
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,070
not to take my stuff away.

1040
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,030
Who was it? How could you steal something like this?

1041
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,490
I did it.

1042
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,250
Xu Zilu.

1043
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,100
Cutting a person's sources of income is like killing his parents.

1044
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,830
Why did you take away my jar? To have a foot bath with it?

1045
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:33,090
You had a good luck in making money today.

1046
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,730
I won the money in an aboveboard way.

1047
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,060
Don't try to get it back.

1048
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,520
You colluded with the owner of the shop

1049
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,670
to trick Miss Tao.

1050
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,850
It's also called an aboveboard way?
