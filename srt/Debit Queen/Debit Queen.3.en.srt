[Episode 3]

4
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,450
So you are the girl

5
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,509
Zilu brought back?

6
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,229
I am,

7
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,840
I suppose.

8
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:48,670
Are you asking me?

9
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,350
I'm asking you.

10
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,090
Mother.

11
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,410
She just came to our mansion.

12
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:55,600
She's not quite used to the life here yet.

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,060
Let her rest for a few days.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,660
Stop there.

15
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,170
Now that you're here,

16
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,770
are you leaving without serving me a cup of tea?

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,050
Right, I'll serve you tea.

18
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,840
I know that.

19
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,090
Come on. Let me.

20
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,460
Thank you.

21
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,970
Mother, please have some tea.

22
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,090
Tell me the truth.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,079
How long have you known my son?

24
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,870
Not long.

25
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,870
You're marrying him even though you haven't known him for long?

26
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,200
He asked me to marry him.

27
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,040
It's because I like him.

28
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,610
What do you like

29
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,270
about him?

30
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm asking you.

31
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,120
In fact, I didn't like him a lot

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,390
at first.

33
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,350
He has a long face

34
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,590
and talks meanly.

35
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,890
He's full of evil ideas.

36
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,620
Everything about him is wrong,

37
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,960
and he's very stubborn.

38
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,070
But

39
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,020
I think

40
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,890
he has a very confident heart.

41
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,050
Although his own conditions

42
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,470
aren't very good,

43
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,670
he thinks he's great.

44
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,960
I was overwhelmed

45
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,790
by this unknowing confidence of his,

46
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,190
which swept me off my feet.

47
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,110
I just like this about him.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,590
Mother.

49
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,570
I know you are not satisfied

50
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,200
with the wife I chose.

51
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,660
But I'm determined

52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,620
to marry her.

53
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,650
No matter how much you don't like her,

54
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,430
please

55
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,600
respect my choice, Mother.

56
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,320
Did I say

57
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,880
I'm not satisfied with her?

58
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,220
Nice tea.

59
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,130
How could you get married like this?

60
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,280
You didn't go through the bridal process

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,480
or the wedding rites.

62
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,690
You didn't even hold a banquet.

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,480
Was she raised for nothing?

64
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,150
How could you marry her

65
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,110
so effortlessly?

66
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,770
It's a disgrace to our family.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,150
Miss.

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,120
What's your name again?

69
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,830
Ling Se.

70
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,920
What a special name.

71
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,760
Miss Ling Se.

72
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,390
Is there something

73
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,590
my son holds over you,

74
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,130
so you had no choice but to marry him?

75
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,620
I know

76
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,580
my son very well.

77
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,269
He's indeed full of evil ideas.

78
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,190
He...

79
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,640
Of course not.

80
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,650
Zilu is very nice to me.

81
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,230
How could he possibly

82
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,490
hold anything over me?

83
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,600
If you say that, I don't buy it.

84
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,470
Since you entered the room,

85
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:39,170
I've noticed it.

86
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,890
You've been standing at least

87
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,350
1 meter away from my son.

88
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,470
It's obvious that you don't want to be near him.

89
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,240
Ling Se, I don't blame you.

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,670
If someone is to blame,

91
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,270
I should blame myself

92
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,850
for giving birth to such a disappointing son.

93
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,870
I let his dead father down.

94
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,610
It's not like that.

95
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,360
I mean it.

96
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,150
Look. Look.

97
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,600
Look.

98
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,790
We really love each other

99
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,850
and want to get married,

100
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,310
right?

101
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,150
Darling.

102
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,790
Mother, look.

103
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,080
What did you just call me?

104
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:20,990
Mother.

105
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,350
Come to me.

106
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,110
Come on.

107
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,860
Come to me.

108
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,740
Se.

109
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,850
I'll do you justice.

110
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,750
I'll make up for the wedding.

111
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,310
Also,

112
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,400
we'll hold a banquet and invite 10 or 20 tables of guests.

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,480
Our whole family will have some fun together.

114
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,040
Mother.

115
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,600
I don't think this is necessary.

116
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,120
Do you think anyone would care about

117
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,350
what you think?

118
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,090
It's settled then.

119
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,710
Mother.

120
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,260
I think maybe we should

121
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,460
drop the wedding.

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,340
Think about it.

123
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,270
It's both costly and troublesome.

124
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,860
Isn't it better if we save the money

125
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,730
for business?

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,020
Think about it.

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,530
The Xu family is

128
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,660
a prestigious family in Linchun City.

129
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,400
How can we let you marry into our family

130
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,550
without a wedding?

131
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,210
Besides,

132
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,470
I must get back the money

133
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,750
I gave other families as wedding gifts

134
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,190
over these years.

135
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,870
Also, this is an opportunity

136
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,300
for me to

137
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,130
vent my anger

138
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,770
about all the gossips I heard over the years.

139
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,470
Right.

140
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,390
You have to get the money back.

141
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,860
Ms. Jia.

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,170
Make arrangements already.

143
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,170
Let's do it today.

144
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,190
Today?

145
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,710
Where can we find the people

146
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,470
to prepare for the banquet and make wedding arrangements on such short notice?

147
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,670
Right, Mother.

148
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,300
This is too much trouble.

149
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,560
Let's forget about it.

150
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,650
I have someone in mind.

151
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,250
You do?

152
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,210
Mother.

153
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,330
I know someone

154
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,220
who specializes in holding banquets.

155
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:45,830
She's a fast worker,

156
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,890
and we can save a lot of money if we hire her.

157
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,350
Mother.

158
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,230
Just sit at the main table during the banquet.

159
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,310
Don't worry about anything.

160
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,110
Just drink.

161
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,790
I will

162
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,909
arrange it nicely.

163
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,270
That was close.

164
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,430
Luckily, I'm smart and cute,

165
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,160
and I managed to fool Old Madam.

166
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,660
Did you do it on purpose?

167
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,110
What did we agree on yesterday?

168
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,670
You said you wouldn't meddle in the Xu family's affairs.

169
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,520
But today, you egged my mother on

170
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:09,890
to hold a wedding banquet.

171
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,950
What's that about?

172
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,030
Young Master Xu, there's some misunderstanding here.

173
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,870
Your mother

174
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,750
wanted to hold this wedding very badly, right?

175
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,310
Besides,

176
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,630
I've already skipped

177
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,630
all the previous steps,

178
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,180
and we'll only need to hold a wedding banquet.

179
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,320
Or, do you want to go through

180
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,600
all the wedding rites?

181
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,350
Do you think I don't know

182
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,400
what you're thinking?

183
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,530
You just want money.

184
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,680
Young Master Xu,

185
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,950
what are you talking about?

186
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,909
Am I that kind of person

187
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:37,680
who thinks of nothing but money?

188
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,159
It's just your mother is an elder.

189
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,070
I only went with her flow.

190
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,480
Have you ever thought about

191
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,150
what would happen

192
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,080
if we got caught?

193
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,990
Do you still want the shop or not?

194
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,840
Of course I do.

195
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,409
Don't be angry.

196
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,930
I think your mother really

197
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,830
wants to witness you

198
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,790
have a grand wedding.

199
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,870
Although she seems to despise you,

200
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,400
she treats you really well.

201
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,310
To be honest, I envy you.

202
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,360
My mother

203
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,110
wouldn't be able to do the same.

204
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,260
Forget it.

205
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,470
I can't be bothered with this.

206
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,510
But from now on,

207
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,550
you mustn't do anything

208
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,880
without my permission.

209
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,310
You can't make any decision on your own.

210
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,110
Do you hear me?

211
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,330
Yes, I understand.

212
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,670
I'll take my leave if there's nothing else.

213
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,870
Look at me.

214
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,990
I forgot about the important thing.

215
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,530
Well,

216
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,980
I have a maid

217
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,030
who's still at the Ling Mansion.

218
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,049
Her name is Ping'er.

219
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,049
Without me there,

220
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,070
they'll definitely ill-treat her.

221
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,080
Young Master Xu.

222
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,470
Could you please

223
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,590
do me a favor and send someone

224
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,790
to bring her here?

225
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,510
Fuding.

226
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,280
What's wrong, Young Master?

227
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,110
Go to the Ling Mansion

228
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,390
and bring back

229
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,190
that maid of Young Madam's.

230
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,720
Ping'er.

231
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,460
But Old Madam

232
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,440
asked me to...

233
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,990
I'll send someone

234
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,100
to bring her back right away.

235
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,360
Sorry for the trouble.

236
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:01,830
Thank you.

237
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,350
I've come around.

238
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,520
Let's hold the wedding banquet.

239
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,920
But if we want to do it, we must make it great.

240
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,750
No problem.

241
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,910
I'm on it.

242
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,660
What do you want?

243
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,700
What now?

244
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,320
Young Master Xu.

245
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,260
Look, the protagonists of this wedding banquet

246
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,740
are you and me, right?

247
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,870
Shouldn't you

248
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,950
give me half of the money

249
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,430
you'll collect as wedding gifts?

250
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,760
At least wait until

251
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,250
you hold it successfully.

252
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,790
Rest assured! You'll be satisfied.

253
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,720
What about here?

254
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,270
Here.

255
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,790
Here.

256
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,620
It hurts here.

257
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,540
It hurts.

258
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,990
That's the right spot.

259
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,120
Old Madam.

260
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,780
Are you sure about the wedding banquet?

261
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,070
After all,

262
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,590
it's a life event for Young Master.

263
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,580
Shouldn't he marry

264
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,110
someone we know well about?

265
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,110
We must hold it.

266
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,490
That's for sure.

267
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,140
Otherwise, how can I make them

268
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,740
have no turning back from it?

269
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,710
Do you believe what they said?

270
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,420
Not even

271
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,310
a word.

272
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:23,130
Then why didn't you call their bluff on the spot?

273
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,400
That's what you don't understand.

274
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,820
I can tell that Ling Se

275
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,170
is not a simple girl.

276
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,140
There's something about her that refuses to admit defeat.

277
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,400
It's a perfect fix for Zilu's bad temper.

278
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,670
Look how

279
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,240
whimsical and lovely she is.

280
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,150
She reminds me of when I was young.

281
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,640
Based on my experience,

282
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,750
they are a perfect match.

283
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:47,100
They are born to be a quarrelsome but loving couple.

284
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,410
Aren't you a bit too optimistic?

285
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,570
Just wait and see.

286
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,390
Here. Here.

287
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,710
That feels good.

288
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,910
[Tao Mansion]

289
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,730
My Lady, why are you

290
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,950
wearing this hairpin with dangling coral beads today?

291
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,550
What day is today?

292
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,670
Today is my big day.

293
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
Today is the day

294
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,170
Zilu's going to propose to me.

295
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,010
Why didn't I hear

296
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,830
there's a matchmaker coming to our house?

297
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,800
What do you know?

298
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,490
Zilu told me about it yesterday.

299
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,230
We even talked about our married life.

300
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,560
Today is the last day

301
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,710
of our three-day appointment.

302
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm sure he'll come.

303
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
No one

304
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,070
is good enough for Zilu except me.

305
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,310
Then I, Xiaohe, want to congratulate you.

306
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,340
Congratulations, My Lady.

307
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,420
Your dream has finally come true.

308
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,750
Am I beautiful?

309
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,310
Yes.

310
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,050
You are stunningly beautiful, My Lady.

311
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,870
When Young Master Xu

312
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,730
sees you later,

313
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,110
I'm sure he won't be able to take his eyes off of you.

314
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,630
Xiaohe.

315
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,210
Ask Hu Sibing to prepare a sedan.

316
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,830
We'll definitely need it later.

317
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,990
Yes, My Lady.

318
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,220
Mr. Tang, Mr. Tang.

319
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,340
Can you get me someone else?

320
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,600
There's no one else.

321
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,600
Young Master only gave me a few hours

322
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,110
to prepare for his wedding.

323
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,030
You should feel lucky that I found

324
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,020
someone idle for you.

325
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,830
But, Mr. Tang,

326
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,640
he's too scary-looking.

327
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,720
Don't worry.

328
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,320
You can't find another person

329
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,430
who's more gentle than him

330
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,830
in the Xu family.

331
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,410
Alright.

332
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,370
I'll leave him to you.

333
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm busy.

334
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:32,600
Don't. Don't.

335
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,150
Mr. Tang. Mr. Tang.

336
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,790
Come... Come back...

337
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,100
Young Master asked you to run an errand.

338
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,150
Can you do it?

339
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,120
So you're not chasing me away.

340
00:12:59,300 --> 00:12:59,900
I can do it.

341
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,460
Sorry, I...

342
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,830
I...

343
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,330
Young Master ordered you

344
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,330
to go to the Ling Mansion right away

345
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,310
and bring Young Madam's maid, Ping'er,

346
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:16,910
back.

347
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,070
You must bring her back.

348
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,070
Understand?

349
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
If the Ling family gives you a hard time,

350
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,090
don't you act like this.

351
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,390
Be tougher.

352
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,090
Young Master's order is

353
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,860
to bring her back.

354
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,610
Otherwise,

355
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,240
you know his temper.

356
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,250
No one will be able to survive until tomorrow.

357
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,230
I understand. I understand.

358
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,380
All the tableware used in today's banquet

359
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,020
must be made of the finest colored glaze.

360
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,900
Especially the main table,

361
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,470
which requires jade tableware.

362
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,410
This is the first time Young Master's getting married.

363
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,240
Make it as luxurious as possible.

364
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,650
Why should we use colored glaze and jade?

365
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,670
After drinking to late hours,

366
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,530
no one will be sober.

367
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,060
If the tableware gets broken, will you be responsible for it?

368
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,150
Just use the most ordinary tableware.

369
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,280
The cheaper, the better.

370
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,310
Who are you?

371
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,220
Hello.

372
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,840
I invited her here for banquet arrangements.

373
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
She's Ms. Liu.

374
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,010
Ms. Liu?

375
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:08,910
Young Master is

376
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,390
the richest man in Linchun City.

377
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,910
How can we let him use

378
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,570
the most ordinary porcelain?

379
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,630
First, there's not enough time.

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,480
Second,

381
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,990
what's the point of spending money

382
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,120
on these ornaments?

383
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,550
It's better to spend it on better food and drinks.

384
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,230
It's obviously unrealistic

385
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,430
for us to find a restaurant

386
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,390
that can prepare all the dishes.

387
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,890
We have to order each restaurant's specialty dish

388
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,570
and put them together to make a table.

389
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,540
If we delay any longer,

390
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,590
your guests will have to eat porridge.

391
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,350
Is... Is this appropriate?

392
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,430
Listen to her.

393
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,340
She's experienced.

394
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:32,910
Right.

395
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,740
The simpler, the better.

396
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,750
Don't be too extravagant.

397
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,150
What if I have a peaceful divorce

398
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,020
with your young master in the future?

399
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,820
It'll be a waste of money, right?

400
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,070
Young Madam.

401
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,070
Today is your wedding day.

402
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,310
You can't say things like that.

403
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,070
It's just an example.

404
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,850
Go back to work.

405
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,200
You can leave this to us.

406
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,580
All right, remove all these.

407
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,470
Yes.

408
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,320
You've got something up your sleeve.

409
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,380
I thought you never thought about it,

410
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,220
but you

411
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,200
got yourself the best husband.

412
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:06,910
Tell me.

413
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,710
When did you two hook up?

414
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,650
I didn't hook up with Xu Zilu.

415
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,420
Hook...

416
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,650
This is not what you think.

417
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,050
We have plenty of time.

418
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,710
I'll tell you about it in detail some other day.

419
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,790
Are you sure you can handle the banquet today?

420
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,710
Is there anything

421
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,370
I, Liu Yeniang, can't handle?

422
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
But I'm confused.

423
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,540
Why does a rich family like the Xu family

424
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,080
need to save money?

425
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,720
The budget is so tight.

426
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,820
Well,

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,150
didn't we agree that

428
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,810
we'll make money together?

429
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,390
Look.

430
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,520
I didn't forget about you when I'm saving money myself.

431
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,720
No problem.

432
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,670
But

433
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,830
make sure you take Young Master Xu

434
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,290
to my shop more often in the future.

435
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,090
This way,

436
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,540
I can look at Young Master Xu openly.

437
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,250
Alright.

438
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,550
I promise you'll see so much of him

439
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,080
that you'll get sick of him,

440
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:01,670
okay?

441
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,680
Get to work.

442
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,620
Step it up, all of you.

443
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,600
If you delay Young Master's wedding,

444
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,260
you won't be able to afford it.

445
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,870
Okay.

446
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,190
Be careful with these.

447
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,030
Don't break them.

448
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,420
Got it.

449
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,170
What the teacher taught us yesterday was so difficult.

450
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:13,690
Right.

451
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't worry.

452
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,410
When Ling Shuo comes,

453
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,740
you'll know where Se is.

454
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,430
Ling.

455
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,160
What took you so long?

456
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:22,910
Ping'er?

457
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,450
Why are you here?

458
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,240
Do you know where Se is?

459
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,670
No.

460
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,710
I heard from my mother that

461
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,910
she wanted to sell Se,

462
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,390
so I told Se to run away.

463
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,790
She ran away?

464
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,950
So... Where did she go?

465
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,350
I don't know about that.

466
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,060
I'm sure Se is okay.

467
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,690
When she settles down,

468
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,970
she'll come find you.

469
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,890
By the way,

470
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,950
why are you two together?

471
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:47,910
I...

472
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,890
I met her

473
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,030
when we went to Fulai Inn together

474
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,610
for midnight wine

475
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,270
last night.

476
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,850
Midnight wine?

477
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,230
Everyone heard it, right?

478
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,320
He's the governor's son,

479
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,260
yet he deliberately broke the law.

480
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,430
He broke the curfew.

481
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,150
Shouldn't we go to his father

482
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,490
and ask for an explanation?

483
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,030
What?

484
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,160
Did you see it with your own eyes?

485
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,920
Look at you,

486
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,849
always poking your nose into others' business.

487
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,270
What does this have to do with you?

488
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,369
You talked about the midnight wine yourself.

489
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,010
What?

490
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,510
You dare not admit it even though you did it?

491
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,790
I...

492
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,280
Wait.

493
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,910
Why is drinking midnight wine

494
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,930
equivalent to breaking the curfew?

495
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,589
It's called midnight wine

496
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,319
because it's a midnight drink.

497
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:26,369
What a silly girl.

498
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,970
Why don't you know anything?

499
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,190
Young Master.

500
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,630
That is not what midnight wine means.

501
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,710
The ancients said, "When I drink midnight wine on the lake,

502
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,230
the west wind blows past me."

503
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,030
That's right.

504
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,740
The ancients would use midnight wine

505
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,400
to refer to promising young people

506
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,650
who were depressed

507
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,800
and drowned their sorrows at home.

508
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,580
There was a drunkard in the previous dynasty

509
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,670
named Jun Jinzhi.

510
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,720
He often drank and wrote poetry

511
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,160
with his friends, who were also his schoolmates.

512
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,390
When they parted,

513
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,990
he'd gift them the wine he brewed himself,

514
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,850
which was named "midnight wine".

515
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,640
So, the midnight wine we drink now

516
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,270
refers to

517
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,870
the wine brewed by Jun Jinzhi,

518
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,940
which is unique flavored.

519
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,270
It's now also very popular

520
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,630
among the royal families of

521
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,080
Beichen and Yanyun State.

522
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,620
Ping'er.

523
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,190
You even know that?

524
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,630
You're amazing.

525
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,240
Isn't this common sense?

526
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,390
Come on, let's go.

527
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:13,950
Come on.

528
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,280
Young Master!

529
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,830
-What a shame.
-Young Master!

530
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,590
Great news!

531
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,200
Old Master asked you to go back

532
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,130
and attend your sister's wedding.

533
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,330
-Wedding?
-Wedding?

534
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,720
Who's Miss Ling Se marrying?

535
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,450
I don't know.

536
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,350
You don't know?

537
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,420
Let's go!

538
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,050
Let's go!

539
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,540
My Lady! My Lady!

540
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,960
Someone from the Xu family is here.

541
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
He brought us a wedding invitation.

542
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,650
Zilu is so straightforward.

543
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,860
He even

544
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:44,950
got this prepared.

545
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,950
The Xu family sent someone

546
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,180
to deliver this wedding invitation,

547
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,630
saying the wedding banquet will be held this afternoon.

548
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,310
Why in such a hurry?

549
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
It's just that...

550
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,760
The bride is someone else.

551
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,220
What?

552
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,770
The bride is Ling Se.

553
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,910
That's impossible.

554
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,060
My Lady, don't be sad.

555
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,720
Young Master Xu is not lucky enough to marry you.

556
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,440
It must be this vulgar wench

557
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,470
who played dirty tricks.

558
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,480
I'm the one

559
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,110
who Zilu should be marrying.

560
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,700
My Lady!

561
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,110
Floral umbrellas for sale!

562
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,020
Umbrellas for sale!

563
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,910
Take a look at the floral umbrellas!

564
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,080
Small pendants!

565
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,930
Come and take a look.

566
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,290
I just got kicked out.

567
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,670
I'd better not go in.

568
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,290
I'll wait for you at the gate.

569
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,620
I'll wait here with you.

570
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,310
Okay.

571
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,230
I'll go in and figure it out.

572
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,890
I'll be right out.

573
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,550
-Wait for me here.
-Okay.

574
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,130
Wait for me.

575
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:33,460
Okay.

576
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,220
The Xu family sent someone here again?

577
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,440
Are they delivering us more betrothal gifts?

578
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,260
I'm not sure, but he said

579
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,190
he was sent here by Young Master Xu.

580
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,420
Let him come in.

581
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,240
Ask some servants

582
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,700
to help move those things.

583
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,920
Young Master Xu is really decent.

584
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,590
Yes.

585
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:01,100
He's here.

586
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,560
My Lord.

587
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,550
This is the person sent by the Xu family.

588
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,150
Well,

589
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,060
is there anything else

590
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,310
Young Master Xu wants to tell us about?

591
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,720
Young Master asked me

592
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,910
to bring Young Madam's maid,

593
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,330
Ping'er, back to our mansion.

594
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,840
Where is she?

595
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,660
Bring her here.

596
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,190
Get her here now!

597
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,260
My Lord.

598
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,890
Ping'er

599
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,650
was kicked out yesterday.

600
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,950
Father.

601
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,070
Who are you planning to kick out?

602
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,700
Well...

603
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,250
There are many maids in our mansion.

604
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,050
Can you take someone else?

605
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,260
Young Master said

606
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,250
I must take Ping'er back today.

607
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,270
If I can’t,

608
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,030
you guys

609
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,430
won't be able to survive until tomorrow.

610
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,830
Why does the Xu family

611
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,290
have to take Ping'er away?

612
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,860
Well,

613
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,530
anyway, it's Young Master's order.

614
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:11,790
Young Madam has married into the Xu family,

615
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,650
so she's a member of the Xu family.

616
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,940
Her maid is, too.

617
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,420
You...

618
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,410
The Xu family

619
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,580
is too domineering.

620
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,830
I don't care.

621
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:19,470
Today,

622
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,230
either I take her back with me,

623
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:21,630
or

624
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,910
I won't leave here!

625
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,740
Wang!

626
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,690
-Ling Shuo.
-Wang!

627
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,250
Did you find it out?

628
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:27,690
Who is it?

629
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,130
This is bad. It's Xu Zilu.

630
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,360
Xu Zilu?

631
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,860
Why would Xu Zilu get married?

632
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,630
Why would Miss Ling Se

633
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,630
marry Xu Zilu?

634
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,180
It's true.

635
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,330
Someone from the Xu family is in there right now.

636
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,480
He's asking them to hand over Ping'er.

637
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,390
He's so imposing that

638
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,090
it's like he wants to cut you into pieces.

639
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,850
Did you and Ling Se

640
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,040
offend Xu Zilu?

641
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,720
Miss Ling Se and Xu Zilu

642
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,030
did have

643
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,630
a little conflict.

644
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,830
But he can't be that petty.

645
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,780
He actually can.

646
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,630
Xu Zilu

647
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,740
is just petty like this.

648
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
No, this won't do.

649
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,930
It's like Miss Ling Se

650
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,330
is in a wolf den right now.

651
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,500
I have to go save her.

652
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,030
Wait!

653
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,280
You can't defeat him alone.

654
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,340
Let's go together.

655
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,090
Let's go together.

656
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:03,370
Let's go.

657
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:03,900
Let's go.

658
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,060
Congratulations.

659
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,060
[Xu Mansion]

660
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,590
Please come in.

661
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,970
Congratulations.

662
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:06,990
Please come in.

663
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:07,910
Please come in.

664
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,500
Congratulations.

665
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,300
Hello.

666
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:17,990
Mr. Xu.

667
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,190
Are you here to have some alone time?

668
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:20,910
Don't worry.

669
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,310
I've sent all your naggy relatives away

670
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,120
for you.

671
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,870
No one will come to bother you.

672
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,870
Aren't you human?

673
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,130
You're indeed sharp-tongued.

674
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,220
If it weren't for the fact that

675
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,120
you are my boss,

676
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,680
I wouldn't put up with this.

677
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,790
This is for you. It's free.

678
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,030
What is it?

679
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,540
Gloves.

680
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,560
They'll come in handy

681
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,900
when we set up a stall in the market.

682
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,420
Those bought outside don't fit our hands.

683
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,600
These were hand made by me.

684
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,330
Look how comfortable they are.

685
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,030
Since we're putting on an act

686
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,920
in front of Old Madam,

687
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,990
it's inevitable for us to have

688
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,050
physical contact.

689
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,960
You dislike it, right?

690
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,540
If there's an emergency,

691
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,070
you can put on these gloves.

692
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,430
It should be better

693
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
with gloves and clothes between us.

694
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,580
I don't want it.

695
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,680
Just take it.

696
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,230
Mr. Xu.

697
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,920
Don't you think

698
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,950
I'm considerate?

699
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,470
Don't you think it's time

700
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,990
to give me

701
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,880
my half of the wedding gift money?

702
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,060
When did I say

703
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,160
I'll share the wedding gift money with you?

704
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Didn't you agree to it this morning?

705
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,940
Is it in the agreement?

706
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,250
The venue was provided by the Xu family,

707
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,850
and we invited all the guests.

708
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,680
We also bore

709
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,110
all the expenses.

710
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,690
Why should I share the money with you?

711
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,050
I...

712
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,870
All right.

713
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,350
Just for the sake of

714
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,450
me working all morning.

715
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,160
I should at least earn rewards for effort,

716
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,690
if not achievement, right?

717
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,490
Let's split it 40/60, okay?

718
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,180
Please.

719
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:50,810
Congratulations.

720
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,360
Mrs. Li.

721
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,480
Please come in.

722
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,050
Thank you.

723
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,690
Okay.

724
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,160
Miss Tao, why are you here alone...

725
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,220
Miss Tao. Miss Tao.

726
00:23:59,370 --> 00:23:59,890
Miss Tao!

727
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,950
What's that about?

728
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,830
Zilu!

729
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,680
Why are you...

730
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,280
Stop.

731
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,890
We love each other.

732
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:13,820
Why did you

733
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,110
suddenly marry someone else?

734
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,370
Did someone force you?

735
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,740
Help me.

736
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,800
I don't think helping you get rid of other women

737
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,920
is in the agreement.

738
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,270
50/50.

739
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,680
Please calm down, Miss Tao.

740
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,840
You brat.

741
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,410
I haven't got the opportunity to get even with you.

742
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,320
If you hadn't

743
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,640
showed up there that day,

744
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,520
why would Zilu

745
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,480
have proposed to you?

746
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,020
For one thing, you're not as pretty as me.

747
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,500
Yes.

748
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,830
Secondly, you're not as knowledgeable as me.

749
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,270
Right.

750
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,790
Thirdly, you're not as rich as me.

751
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,540
Right.

752
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,320
So who are you to compete with me?

753
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,080
Miss Tao.

754
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,030
I also think

755
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,210
you are a better match

756
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,270
for your dear Zilu.

757
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,080
So why did you marry him, knowing I'm a better match for him?

758
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,140
Are you mocking me?

759
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,440
I wouldn't dare.

760
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,960
I know you're sad

761
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,280
that Xu Zilu got married.

762
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,190
How about this?

763
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,710
Wait for him to have a peaceful divorce.

764
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,950
I promise you won't have to wait long.

765
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,380
I mean it.

766
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:03,990
Shut up!

767
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,620
You brat.

768
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,420
Why are you talking so viciously?

769
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,420
You stole Zilu from me.

770
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,750
Either you die or I live today.

771
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,650
So I'll die anyway.

772
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,520
You really hit me?

773
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,210
Stop there!

774
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,030
Don't come over!

775
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,510
Stop!

776
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,170
Guys. Guys.

777
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,700
Where's Xu Zilu?

778
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,560
Where's your invitation?

779
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,240
Why do I need an invitation to see Xu Zilu?

780
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,720
Move!

781
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,540
Young Master.

782
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,110
Someone broke in!

783
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,110
Se!

784
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,640
She's inside.

785
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,560
You go first. Hurry.

786
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,420
You can't go in!

787
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,390
Se!

788
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,330
I'm here to save you, Se!

789
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,870
My Lady!

790
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,500
Where are you?

791
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:33,810
You can't go in, Young Master.

792
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,670
You can't go in.

793
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,440
Se, I...

794
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,550
You can't go in.

795
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,090
What are you doing?

796
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:39,630
My Lady!

797
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,780
You can't go in.

798
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,400
-You can't go in!
-Let go of me!

799
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,470
Guards!

800
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:43,980
What are you doing?

801
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,090
Guards! Help!

802
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,010
How dare you stop me?

803
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,670
What are you doing?

804
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,340
Let go of me!

805
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,470
How dare you stop me?

806
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,380
You can't go in!

807
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:53,930
Stop!

808
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:54,570
I'm sorry!

809
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,030
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

810
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,870
You wench!

811
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,350
Where is Eldest Miss Ling?

812
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,440
Tell me!

813
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,850
Where is Eldest Miss Ling?

814
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,230
Tell me!

815
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,810
I don't know!

816
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,390
I'm here!

817
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,590
My Lady!

818
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,150
Ping'er.

819
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,620
You've suffered.

820
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,210
We'll take you away immediately.

821
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:16,740
Wait.

822
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:16,990
Se!

823
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:17,820
Are you okay?

824
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,110
You've smashed so many things.

825
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,050
How can I be okay?

826
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,980
You,

827
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,450
don't be afraid.

828
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,810
We're here to save you.

829
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,070
What's going on?

830
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,200
What happened?

831
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:28,960
Xu!

832
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,080
Let go of my sister!

833
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,150
Wang Zhujue.

834
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,090
If I didn't know you well,

835
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,010
I'd think

836
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,240
you love me so much

837
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,720
that you came to cause trouble at my wedding.

838
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,950
Nonsense!

839
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,800
Don't you talk nonsense,

840
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,110
slander me, or accuse me of something when you're the one to blame.

841
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,870
Listen,

842
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,150
let that girl go.

843
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,990
Otherwise, when my father comes,

844
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,320
you'll be punished for abducting a woman.

845
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,100
Even if Zilu abducted someone,

846
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,150
it wouldn't be someone like her.

847
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,680
Are you looking down on him?

848
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,400
Why are you everywhere?

849
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,170
I won't bother to explain to you.

850
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,820
I advise you to

851
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,120
turn yourself in right now.

852
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,220
Otherwise,

853
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,210
don't blame me for being rude.

854
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,150
Bring it on.

855
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,420
Bring it on.

856
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,690
This is a misunderstanding.

857
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:14,420
It's all a misunderstanding.

858
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,750
Calm down.

859
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,950
Xu Zilu

860
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,930
didn't kidnap me.

861
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,860
We are faking...

862
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,030
Faking?

863
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,150
I mean, our story is about a talented man falling in love with a pretty lady at first sight.

864
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,270
We truly wanted

865
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,110
to get married,

866
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,510
right?

867
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,430
Did you hear that?

868
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,980
We fell in love at first sight.

869
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,860
Say that again.

870
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,770
I fell in love with her at first sight,

871
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,550
and I was determined to marry no one but her.

872
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,350
You all treat me so badly.

873
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,270
I hate you!

874
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,870
This...

875
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,030
Don't you think you went too far?

876
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,170
How would she give up

877
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,130
if I don't treat her a bit cruelly?

878
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,310
Miss.

879
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:05,710
Tell me the truth.

880
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,440
Were you kidnapped here by him?

881
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,800
Don't be afraid.

882
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,510
My father is Governor Wang.

883
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,630
He will do you

884
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,470
justice.

885
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,670
I...

886
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,550
Right, My Lady.

887
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,920
What happened exactly?

888
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,710
Ling Shuo said

889
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,920
you were captured here.

890
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,740
Right, Se.

891
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,680
I heard it myself that

892
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,880
the Xu family sent someone to our mansion

893
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,010
to capture Ping'er.

894
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,230
Ling Shuo!

895
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,830
Are you out of your mind?

896
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,070
I jumped

897
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,400
onto Xu Zilu's sedan myself.

898
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
I was the one who asked Xu Zilu

899
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,320
to bring Ping'er here.

900
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,580
Aren't you aware

901
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,130
how much I could possibly be worth?

902
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,130
Kidnapping?

903
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,550
You're so good at making up stories.

904
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,910
You're wasting your talent, going to school.

905
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,710
Also,

906
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,620
Ping'er is such a glutton.

907
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,680
Who would want her?

908
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,990
I'm not that much of a glutton, am I?

909
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,270
Se.

910
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,200
I didn't mean it.

911
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,270
So, My Lady,

912
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,470
why didn't you inform me immediately

913
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,790
if you were all right?

914
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,550
Do you know how worried I was?

915
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,760
Ping... Ping'er...

916
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,510
I was in a hurry to run away yesterday.

917
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,570
I... I forgot about you.

918
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,410
It turns out you forgot about me.

919
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,810
Well, I didn't...

920
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,520
Ping'er.

921
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,210
It's not like that.

922
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,330
Let me explain!

923
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,410
My dear Ping'er.

924
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,350
Please forgive me.

925
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,020
I will never forget about you again

926
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,550
at the sight of money.

927
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,550
Look.

928
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,320
I specially saved this roast chicken for you.

929
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,900
The chef of Yuerong Restaurant made it.

930
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,270
It'll be cold if you don't eat it now.

931
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,390
I'll only take one bite.

932
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,080
No problem.

933
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,870
Have some meat.

934
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,790
Is it good?

935
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,870
Yes.

936
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,550
Let me give you a massage.

937
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,100
Don't be angry.

938
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,560
Don't do it again.

939
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,300
I promise.

940
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,850
It won't happen again.

941
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,750
Your birthday gift.

942
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,760
Although it's one day late.

943
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,130
Did you make this yourself?

944
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:02,970
So cute.

945
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,350
From now on,

946
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,750
keep all your money in it.

947
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,630
I made the lining with tarpaulin.

948
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,750
It's waterproof.

949
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,520
Ping'er, you're so nice.

950
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,750
Someone said to me that

951
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,510
she wouldn't get married and she'd rely on herself,

952
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:23,640
but she got married in a blink of an eye.

953
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,180
I won't believe any of your word

954
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,660
from now on.

955
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,790
It's not like that, Ping'er.

956
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,660
Actually, I shouldn't tell anyone

957
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,780
about this.

958
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,240
But you're not anybody else.

959
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,170
So I'll tell you.

960
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,060
The marriage between Xu Zilu and me

961
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,630
is fake.

962
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,190
I'm only getting married for money.

963
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,860
It's fake?

964
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,750
Keep it down.

965
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,120
Xu Zilu and I have an agreement.

966
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,350
As long as I can stay

967
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,380
in the Xu Mansion for a year,

968
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,340
he will return my old shop

969
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:52,790
to me.

970
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,870
What do you think?

971
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,590
Isn't it a great deal?

972
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,870
Why would such a good thing

973
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:59,190
happen to you?

974
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,120
It sounds weird.

975
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,230
You silly girl.

976
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

977
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,190
What's weird about it?

978
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,790
Xu Zilu has promised me

979
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,890
that as long as I stay in the Xu Mansion for a year,

980
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,830
not only will he return the shop to us,

981
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,090
but he'll also give us another 500 taels.

982
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,230
By then,

983
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:14,970
we'll be able to

984
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,090
live it up.

985
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,390
By the way,

986
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,110
look.

987
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,450
I have the agreement here.

988
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,250
It's written in black and white.

989
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,880
[Agreement]

990
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,270
You call this an agreement?

991
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,400
Yes.

992
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,390
What do you think?

993
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,020
Didn't I get myself

994
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,100
a good deal?

995
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,640
But this is obviously a seven-character regulated verse.

996
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,280
Seven-character regulated verse?

997
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,010
What? You know that

998
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,870
I can't read.

999
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,800
But I know

1000
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,420
this is the character "One".

1001
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,510
"Two golden orioles sing amid the willows green."

1002
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,360
"A flock of white egrets flies into the blue sky."

1003
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,680
Fly into the blue sky?

1004
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,000
"The yellow crane left and will not come back in any way."

1005
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,950
"The white clouds float in the sky for a thousand years and more."

1006
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,830
What does that mean?

1007
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:10,940
I think

1008
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,670
what he means is that

1009
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,230
you'll lose

1010
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,370
what you want eventually.

1011
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,270
In the end,

1012
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,320
it's all in vain.

1013
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,720
You brat, Xu Zilu.

1014
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,570
How dare you lie to me?

1015
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,060
I'll send you to the sky right now!

1016
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,180
You must have had

1017
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:36,310
a lot of drinks today, Young Master.

1018
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,570
Why don't you go to bed?

1019
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,110
I'll come back tomorrow.

1020
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,110
It's okay. I'm waiting for someone.

1021
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,040
Okay, Young Master.

1022
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,120
Also, the pepper needed in the fragrance

1023
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,430
must be delivered to the perfume shop

1024
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,960
by the middle of next month.

1025
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,510
Otherwise, it will affect the delivery date.

1026
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,950
I don't think the Tao family will be able to make it.

1027
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,480
I'll figure something out.

1028
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,010
Profiteer!

1029
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,260
Profiteer!

1030
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,630
You crooked, evil...

1031
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,670
Young Madam.

1032
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,060
So the one you're waiting for is Young Madam, Young Master.

1033
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,390
I’ll take my leave then.

1034
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,070
You knew I was coming?

1035
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,150
When you said your maid

1036
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,390
could read and write this morning,

1037
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:13,230
I knew it.

1038
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,700
In that case,

1039
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,120
tell me, what do you mean?

1040
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,240
Say something! Are you mute?

1041
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,990
It's not safe to have an agreement about this.

1042
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,950
But don't worry about the content of the agreement.

1043
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,480
I won't break my promise.

1044
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,080
You even gave me a fake agreement.

1045
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,950
Do you think I'll believe what you said?

1046
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,150
So what do you want me to do?

1047
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,390
Sign a new agreement with me

1048
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,510
right away,

1049
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,760
and give me the wedding gift money.

1050
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,150
Okay.

1051
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,460
Let's take this opportunity

1052
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,120
to balance today's accounts.

1053
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,440
What accounts?

1054
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,230
The housekeeper just delivered the wedding gift money list.

1055
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,620
Didn't we agree that

1056
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,050
we'll split the wedding gift money

1057
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:57,720
50/50?

1058
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,760
Let's balance the accounts

1059
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,490
so that I can give you the money.

1060
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,310
You can't be so nice.

1061
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,060
What kind of person

1062
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,180
do you think I am?

1063
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,150
Not counting physical gifts,

1064
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,159
the wedding gift money alone

1065
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,580
is 811 taels.

1066
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,909
That much?

1067
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,290
Are you really giving it to me?

1068
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,000
Mr. Xu.

1069
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:23,560
I didn’t know you

1070
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,320
well enough.

1071
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,760
I'll reflect on myself as soon as I get home.

1072
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,210
What a money-grubber.

1073
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,380
You think you can beat me this way?

1074
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,020
What do you mean?

1075
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:39,960
Don't be so anxious.

1076
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,510
This is just the interest.

1077
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,060
The principal hasn't been included.

1078
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,920
The principal?

1079
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,469
The cost?

1080
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,639
There were 15 tables of guests in total.

1081
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,280
According to Ms. Liu,

1082
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,670
the dishes were ordered from the top restaurant in the city.

1083
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,590
It cost about

1084
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,150
five taels per table.

1085
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,690
Five taels?

1086
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,210
What dishes did you order?

1087
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,340
How could it cost five taels per table?

1088
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,800
I told you it’s a top restaurant.

1089
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,100
Under normal circumstances, you can't eat there

1090
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,360
even if you have money.

1091
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,040
Besides,

1092
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,260
this is already the price after 50% off.

1093
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,070
Indeed rich and willful.

1094
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,540
You don't care about quality as long as it's expensive.

1095
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,170
Are all rich people brainless?

1096
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,430
If you don't believe me,

1097
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,430
you can check the receipt yourself.

1098
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,830
Okay.

1099
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,760
Forget it.

1100
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,550
It's just 75 taels, isn't it?

1101
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,060
Even if you include that,

1102
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,790
there should be 700 taels left.

1103
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,910
How do you want to pay me, Mr. Xu?

1104
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,420
I'm not done yet.

1105
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,100
The decorations and setting of the tables,

1106
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,240
the food and drinks, as well as the invitations sent out

1107
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,100
all cost money.

1108
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,840
I'll give you a discount.

1109
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,170
Let's say it's 27 taels.

1110
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:44,710
You...

1111
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,990
Ms. Liu asked for 3.8 taels.

1112
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,000
I'll round it down for you as 30 taels in total.

1113
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,980
Yeniang?

1114
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,430
Didn't she say she was only here to help,

1115
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,360
and she wouldn't charge anything?

1116
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,780
That's not what she told me.

1117
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,540
How dare you, Liu Yeniang?

1118
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,340
Just you wait.

1119
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,280
I'll give it to you.

1120
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,160
Also,

1121
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,890
your maid and brother

1122
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:13,260
were here for you, right?

1123
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,590
The things they smashed

1124
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,850
will be paid for with the wedding gift money.

1125
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,380
Do you have any objections?

1126
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,720
Ling Shuo.

1127
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,230
If it weren't for the fact that I couldn't hit you now,

1128
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,520
I would have peeled

1129
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,390
your skin off!

1130
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,930
You are indeed a profiteer.

1131
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,790
Cut the crap.

1132
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,140
I want cash.

1133
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,860
Those items your brother broke

1134
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,150
were worth a lot.

1135
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,780
Plus, he hit someone and caused injuries.

1136
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,550
He must pay for the medical expenses, cost of lost labor,

1137
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,080
and the consolation money.

1138
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,690
All of the costs above

1139
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,510
add up to

1140
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,500
921 taels.

1141
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,340
I won't charge you for

1142
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,290
the flowers and plants you ruined

1143
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,150
and the servants' overtime pay.

1144
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,350
I'll cover it for you.

1145
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,620
Also, I'll round it down for you.

1146
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,680
It'll be 900 taels.

1147
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,990
Therefore,

1148
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,580
you can get...

1149
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,420
45 taels.

1150
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,550
Minus!

1151
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,100
Your arithmetic is not bad.

1152
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,200
The hell not bad!

1153
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,710
You are blackmailing me!

1154
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,840
I have no choice.

1155
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,030
When you pay me back the money,

1156
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,830
we can talk about the agreement.

1157
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,330
Xu Zilu.

1158
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,150
Do you think you're the only one who knows how to scheme?

1159
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,670
Don't forget that I still have something

1160
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,630
against you in my hands.

1161
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,430
Do you believe

1162
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,500
I'll make it public

1163
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,960
that our marriage is fake?

1164
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,390
Let me remind you.

1165
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,960
We just had our wedding.

1166
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,470
Now, everyone in the city knows that

1167
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,040
I married you officially.

1168
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,600
You also told everyone that

1169
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,670
you were willing to marry me.

1170
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:34,830
If you tell them now that

1171
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,230
our marriage was arranged,

1172
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,290
do you think anyone will believe you?

1173
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,760
No wonder you suddenly changed your mind

1174
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,280
about holding the banquet.

1175
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,800
You're so cunning.

1176
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,650
Same to you.

1177
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,090
You also plotted against me.

1178
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,530
Don't worry.

1179
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,230
There's no turning back

1180
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,310
for me.

1181
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,400
It's no good for me to lie to you.

1182
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,340
Just accept it.

1183
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,760
Accept it?

1184
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,450
The hell I'll accept it!

1185
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,440
Just you wait!
