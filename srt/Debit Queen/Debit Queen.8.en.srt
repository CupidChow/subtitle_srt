[Debit Queen]

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,850
[Episode 8]

4
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,910
Why do you think it's your fault?

5
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,440
Mr. Ling.

6
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,270
I'm confused about

7
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,270
what you said.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,030
What do you mean by saying that

9
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,509
my wife wasn't raised by a mother?

10
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,320
Did Mrs. Ling

11
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,220
marry you after my wife

12
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,210
got married?

13
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,450
Mr. and Mrs. Ling,

14
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,880
Ling Se is Young Madam Xu

15
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,210
of our Xu's Mansion now.

16
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,910
I'll show respect for her

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,100
and dote on her.

18
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,030
I don't need you two to worry about this.

19
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,030
Of course.

20
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,320
The cooperation between us

21
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,150
is only feasible due to

22
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:15,890
my wife.

23
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,780
You'd better

24
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,270
understand this.

25
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,550
Ling Se.

26
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,630
Let's go.

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,220
-Mr. Xu!
-Mr. Xu!

28
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:38,910
Xu...

29
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,250
Little toys!

30
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,360
Pendants!

31
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,880
You took the initiative to hold

32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,829
my hand this time.

33
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,340
Don't get even with me about this again later.

34
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,780
Actually, you could have told me

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,180
why you didn't want to go.

36
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,110
Anyway, you know the reason now.

37
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,540
They treated you like that,

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,870
but you didn't even refute what they said.

39
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,910
So,

40
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,190
all your passion of refuting others' words

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,650
has been used on me, right?

42
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm used to it.

43
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,560
When I was a kid, I was immature

44
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,190
and felt very sad and upset.

45
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,940
As time went by,

46
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,770
I just pretended that I didn't hear it.

47
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,660
They could say whatever they wanted,

48
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,320
and I would do what I should do.

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,579
I'm really fine.

50
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,710
As long as I don't care about those words,

51
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,060
they won't be able to hurt me.

52
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,890
If I get angry because of

53
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,220
these things every day,

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,430
I won't need to eat.

55
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,030
I'll just be full because of my anger every day.

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,590
You didn't eat much food just now, did you?

57
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,120
I'll take you to have a meal.

58
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,700
Okay.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,100
Then I want to eat spicy food.

60
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,070
Okay.

61
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,920
Let's go.

62
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:11,790
Young Master.

63
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
You smiled?

64
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,950
There's something wrong, Young Master.

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,730
After you and Young Madam came back,

66
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,890
you look weird.

67
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,230
Do I look weird?

68
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,110
Yes.

69
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,890
Of course you look weird.

70
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,870
Look at your face.

71
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,420
You look very happy

72
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,220
as if you were enjoying a spring breeze.

73
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,930
Don't you want

74
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,390
your next month's salary?

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,620
Of course I want it.

76
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,120
Young Master.

77
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,320
Let me tell you something.

78
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,390
Do you know that Mr. Wang

79
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:49,110
is going to hold the Wine Cups Floating Feast

80
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,640
in this Fulai Inn tomorrow?

81
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,750
Can he have an aesthetic mood like that?

82
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,950
That's not the point.

83
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,270
The point is that he has also sent an invitation letter

84
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,130
to our mansion.

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,900
Throw it away.

86
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,580
I won't go.

87
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,890
It's not for you.

88
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,310
This invitation letter from Mr. Wang

89
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,530
is for Young Madam.

90
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,920
Then she won't go, either.

91
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,950
But I've heard that Young Madam

92
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,820
has agreed.

93
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,650
Young Master.

94
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,560
Do you think that recently,

95
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,410
Young Madam and Mr. Wang

96
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,190
have been

97
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,370
a... a little close to each other?

98
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,130
Where did you hear the rumor?

99
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,960
This is not a rumor.

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,870
Let me analyze it for you.

101
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,670
Young Master.

102
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,720
Why did he

103
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,260
send an invitation letter

104
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,150
to Young Madam for holding this feast

105
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,680
without sending one to you?

106
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,120
That means the relationship between them

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,280
is unusual.

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,240
I think that there are too many

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,770
green objects in this room.

110
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,250
We should still remove some of them.

111
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:52,800
Otherwise, it'll bring you bad luck.

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,110
I...

113
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,640
No! Young Master! Young Master!

114
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,190
Look.

115
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,430
This is also green.

116
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,159
How unlucky.

117
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,040
By the way,

118
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,630
Young Master,

119
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,150
shall we

120
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,590
go take a look tomorrow?

121
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,230
I won't go.

122
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:06,810
Well...

123
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,400
Are there any arrangements for me tomorrow?

124
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,870
Yes.

125
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,670
We're going to have

126
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,900
an inspection tour in the west of the city tomorrow.

127
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,030
You don't have to go.

128
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,150
[Fulai Inn]

129
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,170
The water flowing activity around the Orchid Pavilion is very interesting.

130
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,380
Let's hold the feast in late autumn.

131
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,150
Wang's Wine Cups Floating Feast.

132
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,950
I'd like to invite all the scholars and people with refined tastes

133
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,770
to attend this feast.

134
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,350
My literature skills are so good.

135
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,080
Hu, hurry up!

136
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,710
Hurry up!

137
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,490
It's the room in front of us.

138
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:45,930
Really?

139
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,260
That room in front of us?

140
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,030
It's not here.

141
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,880
Over there! Over there!

142
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,390
Okay.

143
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,159
Let's go.

144
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,180
This sign is placed here.

145
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,580
I couldn't see it indeed.

146
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,100
Mr. Wang.

147
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,260
Although

148
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,560
you're a distinguished guest in our inn,

149
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,360
people need to

150
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,620
go through this area, don't they?

151
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,510
There are many guests who will attend my feast today.

152
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,440
There should be a receptionist, right?

153
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,920
Otherwise, it can't show the importance of the feast.

154
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,180
How about you ask two waiters to do this?

155
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,960
Sure.

156
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,820
Whether you want them to be men or women, tall or short ones,

157
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,680
-fat or thin ones, it's all up to you.
-Yes, yes, yes.

158
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,420
But that's a separate price.

159
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,640
I've given you so much money.

160
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,010
Are there no additional services at all?

161
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,970
Why do you have so many requests if you don't have money?

162
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Young Master.

163
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I told you not to follow me, didn't I?

164
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:15,180
Young Master.

165
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,910
Your words are really hurtful.

166
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,960
A few days ago,

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,940
the problem of a rumor just occurred.

168
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,410
Old Madam specially asked me

169
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,570
to protect you from the wind and rain

170
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,780
to resist...

171
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,010
Did you see that wagon just now?

172
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,290
What wagon?

173
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,340
Young Master.

174
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,340
Do you you want to get rid of me again?

175
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,060
Alright. Stop serving the dishes.

176
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,290
Do you think I can eat them all by myself?

177
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,310
Wang.

178
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm starving.

179
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:05,590
Ping'er.

180
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,130
I thought you wouldn't come.

181
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,110
Have a seat.

182
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,900
Come on.

183
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,120
Mr. Wang.

184
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,880
This... This so-called

185
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,100
"Floating Feast"

186
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,570
is arranged nicely.

187
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,400
But... But how come we're the only two guests here?

188
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,930
Stop mentioning it.

189
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,350
I've sent dozens of invitation letters out.

190
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,730
In then end, no one came.

191
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,520
Even Ling Shuo didn't come.

192
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,390
Mr. Wang,

193
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,550
although you're

194
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,530
not quite popular among your friends,

195
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,400
don't be too pessimistic.

196
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,530
That's right.

197
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,990
Wang,

198
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,700
I just think that you're a very nice person.

199
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,090
As for your friends,

200
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,910
maybe they have something else to do.

201
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:48,040
Let's wait for them for a while longer.

202
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Don't wait anymore.

203
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,050
They won't come.

204
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,240
Tao Meili?

205
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,170
Tao Meili?

206
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,980
I don't mean anything else.

207
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm just here

208
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,000
to tell you about it incidentally.

209
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,680
Wang Zixuan asked Xu Qiuhe

210
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,240
to make Ling Shuo get drunk.

211
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,650
He even threatened them that

212
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,940
no one was allowed to attend

213
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,630
your Wine Cups Floating Feast.

214
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,200
Just pack up and go home.

215
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,470
So Wang Zixuan is the one who made trouble behind this?

216
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,570
I'll go get even with him.

217
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,430
Wang.

218
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,990
Calm down.

219
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,150
Don't be angry.

220
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,630
Sit.

221
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,200
Well...

222
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,830
Look.

223
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,560
Three people can get together for a feast, while five people can get together for a banquet.

224
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,350
Now there are

225
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,960
already five people in our room.

226
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,580
Yes.

227
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,150
Let's start the "Floating Feast"

228
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,640
at once.

229
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,330
I can't wait anymore. Come on.

230
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,450
You're so uneducated.

231
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,500
It's the "Wine Cups Floating Feast".

232
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:33,910
Also,

233
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,710
don't ask me to join you.

234
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,950
I don't want to play with you.

235
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,170
You're an educated person.

236
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:37,900
Just tell us.

237
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,280
What does "Floating"

238
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:39,870
mean?

239
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,250
It means...

240
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,150
Why should I tell you guys?

241
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,400
Ping'er.

242
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,450
Then let me tell you about it.

243
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,630
The phrase of Wine Cups Floating

244
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,990
was originated from a great calligrapher.

245
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,750
One day,

246
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,910
this calligrapher

247
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,040
brought his friends

248
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,580
to the side of a stream in the mountain

249
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,970
and put a wine cup

250
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,510
on the stream

251
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,110
so that it could float with the water waves.

252
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,990
If the wine cup stopped in front of someone,

253
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,990
this person had to improvise a poem.

254
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:15,280
Otherwise, he would have to drink three cups of wine as a punishment.

255
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,880
Ping'er, you're so amazing.

256
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,280
I admire you.

257
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,570
Well, Young Master, you...

258
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,970
What on earth did you see?

259
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,350
I saw a wagon

260
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,990
carrying Xu Family's goods.

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
How is that possible?

262
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,230
We've been counting

263
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,120
our Xu Family's goods recently.

264
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,570
It's impossible to deliver the goods.

265
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,420
Young Master, you must be mistaken.

266
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,820
What did you say just now?

267
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,180
I have to create a poem during this meal?

268
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,110
Then I won't be able

269
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,240
to have a meal today.

270
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,050
That's not okay. How about we...

271
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,570
I got it, Young Master.

272
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,000
It's just your excuse to watch the goods.

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,280
Your real purpose is watching Young Madam.

274
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,730
Young Master.

275
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,340
Look at you.

276
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,070
Stop pretending in front of me.

277
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,750
This is great.

278
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,750
I haven't eaten anything yet today.

279
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,590
Just go.

280
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,260
Find this wagon today.

281
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,030
If you can't find it,

282
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,360
you won't be able to eat for the rest of your life.

283
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,910
Okay.

284
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,030
Then where are you going, Young Master?

285
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,670
I...

286
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,060
I'll go inside to take a look.

287
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,870
You... This kid has gone too far.

288
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,170
You still want to get rid of me by doing this, don't you?

289
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,030
You and Young Madam

290
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,130
will enjoy a big feast up there,

291
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:43,910
while I'll be out alone

292
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,440
to find those goods for you.

293
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,670
Got it.

294
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm no longer your

295
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,200
most cherished person.

296
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,850
If you keep talking like this,

297
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,250
the wagon will have arrived in Furong City.

298
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,840
Save some dishes for me.

299
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,730
Speaking of which,

300
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,170
why isn't Xu Zilu here?

301
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,070
Do you think I would invite Xu Zilu here?

302
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,560
If he wants me to treat him to a meal,

303
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
it won't even happen in my next life.

304
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,270
Mr. Wang.

305
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,650
I've been curious all this time.

306
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,850
What's the big grudge

307
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,180
between you and Xu Zilu?

308
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,710
Logically speaking, as you've known each other since childhood,

309
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,410
the relationship between you two is supposed to be good.

310
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,560
My relationship with him isn't good at all!

311
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,350
You have no idea

312
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,560
how outrageous Xu Zilu's behavior was.

313
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,820
How outrageous was it?

314
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,900
When I was six or seven years old,

315
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,280
I had just arrived in Linchun City,

316
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,890
and I didn't have any friends.

317
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,620
I treated him

318
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,590
as my friend.

319
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,870
But he lied to me.

320
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,930
He not only cheated me out of my money,

321
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,060
but also cheated me out of my feelings.

322
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,270
That was because you were stupid, wasn't it?

323
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,840
Cheating you out of your money is really a bit outrageous.

324
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,960
Just talk about

325
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,710
how I cheated you.

326
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,640
Do you dare to say that you didn't trick me

327
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,700
into buying you some delicious food?

328
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,900
My purpose was to get rid of you.

329
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,770
Because you always

330
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,330
followed me like a plaster every day.

331
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,150
You were dressed as

332
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,510
a girl all day long.

333
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,780
Otherwise, I wouldn't have followed you around.

334
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,510
Do you think I wanted to do that?

335
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,650
But you didn't explain it clearly.

336
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,390
A soldier can be killed but cannot be humiliated.

337
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,910
You hurt my feelings so badly just like killing me.

338
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,150
That was because you had poor eyesight

339
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,510
and couldn't distinguish whether I was a boy or a girl.

340
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,030
You...

341
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
What are you talking about?

342
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,870
Is this just as what I understand?

343
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,110
In my opinion,

344
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,870
this matter

345
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,810
may be like this.

346
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,390
Candied haws!

347
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,100
Little toys!

348
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:33,040
Pendants!

349
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,760
You dropped something.

350
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,820
What's wrong with you?

351
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,430
I just didn't have enough pocket money,

352
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,190
so I went to my father's private vault to get some money.

353
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,110
After my father found out about it,

354
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,790
he hit me.

355
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,540
It's okay. These are all for you.

356
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,340
Just eat them.

357
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,140
Are they really all for me?

358
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,890
Of course.

359
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,760
By that time, when I save enough money,

360
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,560
I'll buy some food for you again.

361
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,590
Well, can I go to your house to play with you?

362
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,590
No, you can't.

363
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,010
[Xu's Mansion]

364
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,660
She even looks so charming while rejecting others.

365
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,390
That's what my future wife should be like indeed.

366
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,750
I'm leaving.

367
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:38,670
Okay.

368
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,130
Bye.

369
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,410
Why are you here again?

370
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,610
So your father didn't hit you this time?

371
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,850
That's impossible.

372
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,240
That's absolutely impossible!

373
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,420
You are definitely not her.

374
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,220
You're not her.

375
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,250
You're not her.

376
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,790
In that case,

377
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,110
Young Master Wang

378
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,570
has held a grudge against Xu Zilu since then.

379
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,230
This grudge

380
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,190
has lasted for more than ten years.

381
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,060
No wonder

382
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,600
Wang has been holding a grudge for so many years.

383
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,860
It's understandable.

384
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,510
That's because his first love

385
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,770
is Young Master Xu.

386
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,250
-I'm not his first love!
-I'm not his first love!

387
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,210
Now I can finally give up.

388
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,270
It's fine to compete with her for the man.

389
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,220
But if I try to compete with him for the man,

390
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,070
people might say that

391
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,670
I have such bad taste, right?

392
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,070
Stop laughing.

393
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,640
What's so funny about it?

394
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,890
Alright. Alright.

395
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,030
After this meal,

396
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,880
let's play the game of pitch-pot.

397
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,980
I'll team up with you.

398
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,040
Let's defeat Young Master Xu together.

399
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,990
Then you can regain some dignity through this victory.

400
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,550
Okay.

401
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,360
Xu Zilu,

402
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,850
if you lose,

403
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,480
you'll have to apologize to me.

404
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,950
Then you probably won't be able to hear

405
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,950
my apology for the rest of your life.

406
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,870
Brother!

407
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,970
Didn't we agree that

408
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,900
you shouldn't show up in Linchun City?

409
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,880
What if someone from our master's family

410
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,670
sees you?

411
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,800
Don't worry.

412
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,180
There wouldn't be such a coincidence.

413
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,910
What's more,

414
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,869
we haven't seen

415
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,220
each other for more than a year.

416
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,349
We should have a meal together at least.

417
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,069
But...

418
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,670
Don't worry.

419
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,339
I won't take much of your time.

420
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:21,980
Recently,

421
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,910
it seems that the government has been

422
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,390
investigating a case strictly.

423
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,170
The passers-by at every intersection in this Linchun City

424
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,740
are checked very strictly.

425
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,090
Is it that scary?

426
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,220
Stop nagging.

427
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,150
Let's go at once.

428
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,260
By the way,

429
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,770
watch the goods here.

430
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,380
When I'm back later,

431
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,730
I'll bring you something delicious.

432
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,550
Okay, Bin.

433
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,950
This restaurant is really good.

434
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,200
Come and taste this.

435
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,240
This dish is so delicious.

436
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,750
Da.

437
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:50,830
Da!

438
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,110
Ma'am.

439
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:52,840
Go to the kitchen

440
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,920
and fetch the rolling pin for me.

441
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,870
What are you going to use it for?

442
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,000
Let's get ready and take precautions.

443
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,320
Ma'am!

444
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,670
Give me two jars of Nu'er Hong Wine.

445
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,110
Okay.

446
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,390
2 to 1.

447
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,430
It's my turn.

448
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,800
Wang Zhujue.

449
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,390
What?

450
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,510
No one came here.

451
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:22,230
So you've started to smash things to vent your anger?

452
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,100
Why do you think there's no one here?

453
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,630
Can't you see that there are many people here?

454
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,390
Li?

455
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,670
Why are you here?

456
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,110
Why can't I be here?

457
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:30,540
Who is he?

458
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,410
I'm not afraid of you speaking ill of me

459
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,440
in front of my father

460
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,790
and our teacher.

461
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,260
I wouldn't dare to do that, Li.

462
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,210
I'm just afraid that others might see you

463
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,000
being with

464
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,780
an ignorant and incompetent loser, right?

465
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,200
It will damage your good reputation.

466
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,660
Who are you talking about?

467
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,960
I'm talk about those vulgar people who are playing

468
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,820
the game of pitch-pot at the Wine Cups Floating Feast.

469
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,620
Aren't you afraid that people will laugh at you if this news gets out?

470
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,720
In that case,

471
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,180
Mr. Wang,

472
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,670
you plotted to prevent

473
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,000
Wang's friends from attending the feast,

474
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,470
but you brought these people here to make trouble.

475
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,130
What kind of behavior is that?

476
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,110
You have no benevolence or righteousness.

477
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,650
I think you are actually

478
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,670
a disgrace to the scholars.

479
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,210
What's more, how come the game of pitch-pot

480
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,870
is not a graceful recreation?

481
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,070
You're just a maid.

482
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,050
You have no right to speak here.

483
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,830
If you try to make things difficult for a maid,

484
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,250
you're just not a gentleman, are you?

485
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,070
I agreed to participate in the game of pitch-pot.

486
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,070
What? You're not pleased with that?

487
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:28,990
Li.

488
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,830
I didn't know that you wanted to play this game.

489
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,020
It's a misunderstanding.

490
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,630
Alright.

491
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,960
Today, I won the game

492
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,840
and had a feast.

493
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,450
As long as I'm happy, it'll be fine.

494
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,210
I'm tired. Let's go.

495
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:37,640
Sibing, let's go home.

496
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:37,900
Yes.

497
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,690
Li, let me send you home.

498
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,590
Wang Zixuan!

499
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,410
Let me send...

500
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,420
I thought you came here

501
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,820
to do something special.

502
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,090
It turns out that you're here to

503
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,330
be laughed at by me.

504
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,610
A person had better know his place.

505
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,350
You have to know your place.

506
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,460
Even if Tao Meili

507
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,880
might have a crush on Hu Sibing,

508
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,410
she wouldn't have a crush on someone like you.

509
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,910
Well said.

510
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,870
Wang Zhujue!

511
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,720
What are you watching?

512
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,080
Go hit him now!

513
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,220
Are they fighting with each other? It's so noisy.

514
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,030
How could you say that?

515
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,090
I knew something wrong would happen.

516
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,500
My God!

517
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,580
These little brats

518
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,200
are really driving me crazy!

519
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,420
Who on earth is making trouble there?

520
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,620
Is the water flowing?

521
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,000
It's all your fault!

522
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,430
-It’s your fault!
-It’s your fault!

523
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,320
It's your fault!

524
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,250
It's your fault!

525
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,720
-It's all your fault!
-It's all your fault!

526
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,750
-It's just your fault!
-Wang Zixuan!

527
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,380
It's all your fault!

528
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,990
It's just your fault!

529
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,480
Wang Zixuan!

530
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,440
It's your fault, Wang Zhujue!

531
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,110
It's your fault!

532
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,630
Wait!

533
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,360
Let's reason with each other.

534
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,020
Let's reason with each other.

535
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,560
Let's reason with each other.

536
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,750
It was because you brought some people here

537
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,420
to ruin my feast, wasn't it?

538
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,750
If you had not held the Wine Cups Floating Feast,

539
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,010
would I have come here?

540
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,470
How can I not blame you?

541
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,110
It's just your fault!

542
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,770
It's your fault!

543
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,050
I told you not to hold this

544
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,800
Wine Cups Floating...

545
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,550
Well...

546
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,050
Well... Well...

547
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,680
There was a small accident.

548
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,870
A small accident?

549
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,970
You think this is a small accident?

550
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,350
Who on earth did this?

551
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,030
It's him!

552
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,680
He did it!

553
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,290
He brought some people here.

554
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:13,960
It's him!

555
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Stop right there!

556
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,490
So it's you?

557
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,570
No, I didn't do it.

558
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,170
Come here!

559
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,340
I'll beat you to death!

560
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,790
-I'll beat you to death!
-I didn't do it.

561
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,150
Let's go.

562
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,210
I didn't do it. I'm sorry.

563
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,030
I'm sorry.

564
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,610
I'll beat you to death, Wang Zixuan!

565
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,600
You bastard!

566
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,610
You evil man!

567
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,090
How dare you damage my restaurant!

568
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,340
I'll kill you!

569
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,580
What a jerk!

570
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,460
He deserves it!

571
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,870
Just beat him to death.

572
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,890
Are you okay?

573
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,710
I'm fine.

574
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,470
Young Master.

575
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,050
Are you all right?

576
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,080
What... What happened?

577
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,960
Ask him.

578
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,370
It's all his fault.

579
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,130
Don't think that I didn't see it.

580
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,890
You also joined the fight just now.

581
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,740
That servant

582
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,820
was hit by you so hard that he kept yelling.

583
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,050
They asked for it.

584
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,350
Let's go.

585
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,250
Let's go.

586
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:58,990
You...

587
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,010
I haven't finished speaking yet.

588
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,230
Mr. Wang,

589
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,810
take care.

590
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,030
I'm leaving.

591
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,830
Ping'er.

592
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,070
My tea leaves!

593
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,110
My tea leaves!

594
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,430
Well... Well...

595
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,780
Who did it?

596
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,860
In broad daylight,

597
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,310
do you want to die?

598
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,890
Where did you go?

599
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,520
I... I...

600
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,510
I...

601
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,750
There is such a strong smell of alcohol.

602
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,780
Good for you.

603
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,010
When I was away for a short while,

604
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,590
you went to have a drink and slack off.

605
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,050
Tell me.

606
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,230
What should we do now?

607
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,760
It's... It's my fault, Bin.

608
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,240
But what should we do now?

609
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,490
If Third Master knows this,

610
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,680
we'll be killed.

611
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,610
I don't need you to tell me this.

612
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,210
I'm asking you what to do now.

613
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,010
By the way,

614
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,650
I told you to chase the wagon, didn't I?

615
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,260
Where is the wagon?

616
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,850
I... I couldn't catch up with it.

617
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,490
Why should I keep you as my servant?

618
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,530
No, no.

619
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,450
Young Master, here's the thing.

620
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:06,890
I've really...

621
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,810
I've tried all my best

622
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,760
to chase that wagon.

623
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,830
But as you know, it's a carriage.

624
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,130
It can certainly run faster than me.

625
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,300
I just kept chasing it.

626
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,930
When it turned,

627
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:13,840
I just didn't know where it went.

628
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,640
I couldn't catch up with it. Then I...

629
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,390
What is that?

630
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,540
A carriage.

631
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,910
Come and take a look.

632
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,930
How about... How about we ask Young Master for help?

633
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,590
Asking Young Master for help?

634
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,180
You idiot!

635
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,440
How could we let Young Master know this?

636
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,840
What's the thing that you can't let me know?

637
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,760
-Young Master.
-Young Master.

638
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,880
How come you two look

639
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,040
so unfamiliar to me?

640
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,190
Young Master,

641
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,670
they are from the Xu Family in Furong City.

642
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,450
You have good eyesight, Young Master.

643
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,830
These are really the goods of Xu's Shop.

644
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,960
I thought you were lying to me just now.

645
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,380
Go.

646
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,630
Check what the goods are.

647
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,990
Okay.

648
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,470
Young Master!

649
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,410
The Xu Family also does the business of tea leaves?

650
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,240
The first step of making sachet products

651
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,010
is to fumigate the basic fragrance.

652
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,840
Our Xu Family

653
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:09,470
usually uses

654
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,220
high-quality tea leaves to fumigate it,

655
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,700
so we have our own tea estate.

656
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,970
All these tea leaves are wet now.

657
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,140
Can they still be used?

658
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,300
What a pity.

659
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,910
Go back and get changed.

660
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,550
Be careful not to get sick.

661
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,190
Young Master.

662
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,240
Just tell me.

663
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,520
What happened?

664
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,110
Young Master.

665
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,660
Let me explain.

666
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,210
This matter...

667
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,880
It was just an accident.

668
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,590
That day,

669
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,850
Third Master Xu ordered me to transport

670
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,200
a batch of tea leaves from the tea estate urgently.

671
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,800
He said he wanted to form a connection with Prince Xian.

672
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,210
He needed the goods in such a hurry,

673
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,610
so we had to finish the transferring procedure of the goods later.

674
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,580
He asked me to deliver the goods out first.

675
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,620
I didn't expect that...

676
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,610
I really didn't expect that

677
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,220
when I had just arrived in Linchun,

678
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,080
there would...

679
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,690
there would be a flood in the teahouse

680
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,730
during my lunchtime.

681
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,320
It was really not my fault.

682
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,690
I see.

683
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,350
It looks like I really have to

684
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,410
get even with Wang Zhujue about this.

685
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,010
Why did he have to hold the Wine Cups Floating Feast?

686
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,140
Why didn't Third Uncle tell me

687
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,270
about it in advance?

688
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,780
My mansion is full of people.

689
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,270
If he had told me, this matter wouldn't have become like this.

690
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:20,790
Yes.

691
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,320
Young Master.

692
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,510
It was all my fault.

693
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,750
Then what are you going to do?

694
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,030
I...

695
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,130
I...

696
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,390
Forget it.

697
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,530
Since these goods are for Prince Xian,

698
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,590
you can't delay it.

699
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,520
I still have some goods here.

700
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,380
Leave the wet tea leaves here

701
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,320
and get some new tea leaves from Manager Wan.

702
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,870
Yes.

703
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,070
Remember.

704
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,280
For the sake of Third Uncle,

705
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,650
I didn't hold you accountable for this.

706
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:51,920
In the future,

707
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,030
if you still do your job like this,

708
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,160
I won't forgive you!

709
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,380
Thank you, Young Master.

710
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,100
I will try all my best

711
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,910
to work for the Xu Family.

712
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:02,310
Just go.

713
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:03,670
Yes.

714
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,050
Who is this man?

715
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,350
Chen Yun's younger brother.

716
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,730
No wonder.

717
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,500
By the way,

718
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,900
for the ginger tea I asked you

719
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,930
to prepare for Young Madam,

720
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,750
is it ready?

721
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,730
I'll ask someone to do it later.

722
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,430
What's the use of you?

723
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,890
Yes, yes, yes.

724
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,900
Well, it's all my fault.

725
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,590
Actually, it looks like

726
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,160
you still

727
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,950
quite care about Young Madam.

728
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,820
Young Master.

729
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,510
You smiled?

730
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,490
You smiled, Young Master.

731
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,730
It's not normal.

732
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,580
Young Master, I knew it.

733
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,310
I knew it.

734
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:52,900
I knew that

735
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,870
you still like Young Madam.

736
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,350
Right?

737
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,340
Young Master, my initial guess

738
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,340
was right indeed.

739
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,300
But Young Master,

740
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,240
speaking of this matter,

741
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,570
I have to criticize you.

742
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,970
Just think about what you did previously.

743
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,020
[Book of Songs]

744
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,890
You tortured Young Madam

745
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,990
so badly.

746
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,150
In my opinion,

747
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,520
the most important thing now

748
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,840
is to rebuild

749
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,560
your image.

750
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,060
Right?

751
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,290
Find a way and use some tactics to...

752
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,950
Don't you think you are noisy?

753
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,330
Young Master.

754
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,050
Reading a book is really not helpful.

755
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,560
You have to ask me about this.

756
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,490
I am...

757
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,610
I'll make ginger soup for Young Madam.

758
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,170
I guarantee that the soup will be thick and fragrant.

759
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:29,750
It'll be thick and fragrant.

760
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,220
No need. Come here.

761
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,420
Come here. Come here.

762
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,690
Why is reading a book not helpful?

763
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,550
Young Master! Young Master!

764
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,280
Are you okay?

765
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,300
Are you sick?

766
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,460
I'm very fine.

767
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:02,980
Young Master.

768
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,670
Then let me tell you something.

769
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,370
The owner of Fulai Inn

770
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,450
came here just now.

771
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,440
She said that

772
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,250
the expenses of the Wine Cups Floating Feast

773
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,710
plus the maintenance fees

774
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,040
add up to this amount.

775
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,910
Young Master.

776
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,170
Read it for yourself.

777
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,040
[Bill]

778
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:26,850
Young Master!

779
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,130
Young Master!

780
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,460
Young Master, are you alright?

781
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,240
Young Master!

782
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,500
Wake up, Young Master!

783
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:36,780
Sister.

784
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,850
This is the ginger soup which Young Master Xu

785
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,840
specially asked someone to bring you.

786
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,610
Just put it there.

787
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:42,410
I'm busy now.

788
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,790
Sister.

789
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,200
What are you looking for

790
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,660
in the middle of the night?

791
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,670
Recently, I've been playing outside aimlessly

792
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,890
and haven't done anything serious.

793
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,980
Because of it, there is no money in my wallet.

794
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,420
And I have to suffer from the grudge between them when I'm back.

795
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,030
Yesterday, when we had the Wine Cups Floating Feast

796
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,430
with Wang and the others,

797
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,100
didn't we have so much fun?

798
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,110
Did we?

799
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,470
I found it.

800
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,150
Mother has bought me too many clothes recently.

801
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,810
It took me such a long time to find it.

802
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,390
What do you think of it, Ping'er?

803
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:16,790
Look.

804
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,230
Is it beautiful?

805
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,250
It looks quite nice.

806
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,330
Its color makes your skin look quite fair.

807
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,590
It suits you very well.

808
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,840
Is it festive?

809
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,400
Yes, it is.

810
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,890
It's very festive.

811
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,600
You look like

812
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,280
the Money Distributing Boy

813
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,680
among the Spring Festival Painting Dolls.

814
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,390
What do you mean by "Money Distributing"?

815
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,030
I'm going to get money.

816
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,640
Tomorrow, it'll be the annual celebration

817
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,830
for the anniversary of Yile Casino.

818
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,660
All the silver rewards will be doubled.

819
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,910
Tomorrow, I'm going to earn

820
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,310
a large amount of money.

821
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,310
You're dressed like a bride

822
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,890
just in order to get

823
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,780
some good luck?

824
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:55,710
Of course.

825
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,190
Wait.

826
00:30:59,210 --> 00:30:59,830
Hold it.

827
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,130
Wear this tomorrow.

828
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,640
You and I will wear red and purple clothes

829
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,600
and collaborate with each other

830
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,670
to win a large amount of money.

831
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,970
[A Hundred Ways To Win A Girl's Heart]

832
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,630
Fuding!

833
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,810
Young Master, are you looking for me?

834
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,260
Haven't you said that you have a idea?

835
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,190
What's the idea?

836
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,210
What's the idea?

837
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,180
Young Master.

838
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,980
You're enlightened now.

839
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,550
I'm not the one what wants to ask about it.

840
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,610
I'm asking you on behalf of my friend.

841
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,710
Okay.

842
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,450
Then I'll answer the question

843
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,380
for your friend.

844
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,480
Speaking of how to chase girls,

845
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,610
in our Xu's Mansion,

846
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,830
I'm best at it.

847
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,570
Why haven't I ever heard that

848
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,250
you once chased a girl before?

849
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:22,970
Young Master.

850
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,520
Even though I can't do this,

851
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,780
my mother can.

852
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,960
She's a matchmaker who has brought many couples together.

853
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,290
My mother has a very useful maxim.

854
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,060
Evil spirits are afraid of Zhong Kui,

855
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,430
while a virtuous woman is afraid of men pestering her.

856
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,690
As long as a man is thick-skinned enough,

857
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:41,220
there are no girls he can't chase like a pig trying to eat cabbage.

858
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,880
Are you describing me as a pig?

859
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,290
No, Young Master.

860
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,890
The main meaning of this sentence

861
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,580
is that you...

862
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,830
While... While you're chasing a girl,

863
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,010
you... you have to make efforts sincerely.

864
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,130
When you're free... Right?

865
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,480
Just show up in front of Young Madam more often

866
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,880
to let her notice your existence

867
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,900
and cater to her liking.

868
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,300
Right?

869
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,450
As long as Young Madam is happy,

870
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,010
she will change

871
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,470
her view of you, won't she?

872
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,250
She loves money the most.

873
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,410
Shall I give her some money directly?

874
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,920
Young Master, you...

875
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,320
You...

876
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,870
You have to...

877
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,970
You have to show your sincerity

878
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,300
from inside to outside.

879
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,350
What do girls like?

880
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:16,940
Shopping

881
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,220
and buying things.

882
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,610
Take Young Madam

883
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:20,250
to go shopping outside

884
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,110
and buy things.

885
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,520
Young Madam will surely

886
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,780
change her view of you.

887
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:25,380
Really?

888
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,670
Your friend

889
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,950
also has a wife, right?

890
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,630
Get out!

891
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,520
Okay.

892
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,500
I'm leaving.

893
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,110
Let's go. Hurry up.

894
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,080
Young Master.

895
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,530
I don't have to be grounded today, do I?

896
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,210
I'm free today.

897
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,679
I can go shopping.

898
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,780
Do you want to go?

899
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,760
Though you're free,

900
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,159
I have something to do.

901
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:16,830
Next time.

902
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,360
I'll definitely accompany you next time.

903
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,150
If you agree,

904
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,860
I'll pay for all the expenses today,

905
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,800
including the goods you like.

906
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:30,469
Really?

907
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:39,630
Yes.

908
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,179
I won't regret it.

909
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,500
Look.

910
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:53,150
I told you this dress would bring me good luck.

911
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,989
We encountered good luck as soon as we went out of the room.

912
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,300
Let's make him spend a large sum of money for us.

913
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,140
Then we'll go to the casino to win a lot of money.

914
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,820
Let's go.

915
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:01,910
Young Madam.

916
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,600
Look at these two sets of jewellery of mine.

917
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,970
All the hairpins, hair accessories

918
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,720
and earrings

919
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,980
embody the style of Blooming Flowers and Wealth.

920
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,080
They'll make you

921
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,510
look more elegant.

922
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,670
Don't you like them?

923
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,320
Yes, I do.

924
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,220
I like them all.

925
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,230
Hurry up. I'm not picky.

926
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,230
I'll buy them all.

927
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,130
Okay.

928
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:18,740
Wrap them up.

929
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,850
Hurry up. Wrap them up.

930
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,250
Wrap them up.

931
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,630
Yes.

932
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,980
Don't just stand there.

933
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,460
Do it carefully.

934
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,400
Got it, Sir.

935
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,180
Be careful.

936
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:27,990
Got it.

937
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,000
Young Master Xu.

938
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,920
Did you hurt your brain

939
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,530
during the fight yesterday?

940

Or do you

941
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:35,630
have any tricks that you'll use on me later?

942
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,350
Are you going to

943
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:38,080
terminate the contract with me?

I'll buy everything for you.

947

Do you really have

948
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,540
no other purposes?

949
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,910
What... What other purposes

950
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:47,600
can I have?

951
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,110
Do you want me to have a purpose?

952
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,800
Alright.

953
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,710

These... These goods are too green. I don't want them.

Wrap everything up except these goods.

Young Master Xu.

966
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,880
I don't care whether you took some wrong medicine

967
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,580
or you didn't check the almanac

968
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,520
before you came out today,

969
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,310
or whether you suddenly became so kind that

970

you wanted to be the Money Distributing Boy.

00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,450
I'm very happy that you let me

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,200
I should treat you to a meal.

976
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,910
But I suddenly have something to do.

977
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:25,960
I'm really in such a hurry.

978
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,590
How about this?

979
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,830
Just try to be a good man till the end.

981
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,790

Well...

986
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:40,950
After Young Madam

987
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,450
gained some benefits, she was still so insatiable.

988
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,850
It was fine that she left here.

989
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,190
But she still took advantage of our young master.

990
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,520
Who asked you to wipe it?

991
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,190
I forgot it.

992
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,820
Things are different now.

993
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,630
I'll wipe it back for you.

994
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,400
Alright.

995
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,210
She really left?

996
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,140
I finally got rid of her.

This Liu Yeniang

998
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,150
even came to our house to collect debts.

999
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,550
If my father finds out that

1000
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,220
I still owe her so much money,

Don't do that.
