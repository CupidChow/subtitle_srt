[Episode 14]

3
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,430
You have to think carefully.

4
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,550
Who in Linchun City

5
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,670
can still come up with

6
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,180
30,000 taels of silver?

7
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,430
If you miss this chance,

8
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,210
the only way to get cash again

9
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,430
is to sell your daughter.

10
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,310
You all!

11
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,320
Get lost!

12
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:56,780
Get out!

13
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,590
Let's go.

14
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,780
Get out.

15
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,270
Get out.

16
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,910
Get out.

17
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,490
Get out.

18
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,270
Miss Tao, you're here.

19
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,150
Help yourself to whatever

20
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:22,910
you want to drink or eat.

21
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,970
But you have to pay.

22
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,070
Stingy Girl.

23
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,950
I'm finished.

24
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,770
What happened?

25
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,390
I have a vague feeling

26
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,250
something has gone wrong at home.

27
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,660
I never thought my father would be

28
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,930
at the point of selling off our family assets.

29
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm so scared.

30
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,790
I don't want to marry someone I don't love

31
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,990
just to pay off debts.

32
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,280
How could that happen?

33
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,760
Your father loves you so much.

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,060
He wouldn't do that.

35
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,829
I'm about to lose everything.

36
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,240
Will you despise me?

37
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,600
How could you lose everything?

38
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,070
You still have me.

39
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,130
You still have this shop.

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,810
You still have Ping'er.

41
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,180
You still have the Bosslady.

42
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,910
I said before

43
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,920
that we sisters will share good times

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,250
and bad times together.

45
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,630
As long as I'm here,

46
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,290
you'll never be alone.

47
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,860
I don't want your pity.

48
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,329
My dear lady,

49
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,180
how could I dare to pity you?

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,650
You're a shareholder in this shop.

51
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,840
We said

52
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,180
we'd open more than ten,

53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,980
even more than twenty branches.

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,040
If we work a little harder,

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,640
we can still live a good life.

56
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,520
But I'm not good at anything.

57
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,670
Who says you're not good at anything?

58
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,920
You have a good eye.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
You invested in me!

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,160
Ling Se.

61
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:46,870
Thank you.

62
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,140
You're right.

63
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,290
I can live well

64
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,100
on my own too.

65
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,550
As long as I try a little harder in the future,

66
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,480
nothing can

67
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,620
knock me down.

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,190
Alright, stop crying.

69
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,350
That's not like you.

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,090
I'm fine now.

71
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,279
Why are you here?

72
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,329
I felt a bit upset.

73
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,870
What's wrong?

74
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,510
This afternoon,

75
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,810
Tao Meili came to see me

76
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,570
and said something had happened at her home.

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,800
I've heard a bit about that.

78
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,330
Although Mr. Tao

79
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,500
deserves it,

80
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,670
seeing Tao Meili like that,

81
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,530
I can't help but feel a bit sorry for her.

82
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,090
Do you want to help the Tao family?

83
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,310
What can I possibly do

84
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,570
to help the Tao family?

85
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,570
It's just that Tao Meili is my friend,

86
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,770
and I want to help her.

87
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:49,790
I understand.

88
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,490
Don't think too much about it.

89
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,770
Go home and rest early.

90
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,520
How can I have time to rest?

91
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,600
I need to go back and develop new products.

92
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,650
You have no idea

93
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,750
how hard it is to do business lately.

94
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,750
That popular

Linchun Tea Shop

96
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,920
even went out of business.

97
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,230
I guess it's because

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,230
they set their prices too high and made their stuff too awful,

99
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,910
so they got what they deserved.

100
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,440
Alright, you get busy then.

101
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,840
I'll head back to work on the new products.

[Fragrant Aromatic Tea Shop]

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,290
Bring out your bosslady.

104
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,270
I want to see her, I'm her mother.

105
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,400
Tell her to come out!

106
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,470
Young Madam, she...

107
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:26,990
Se.

108
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,720
Did he send you here?

109
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,760
Se.

110
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,890
For the sake of your father

111
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,270
who gave you life and raised you,

112
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,670
please help your family.

113
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,150
Madam, please get up to speak.

114
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,190
Qian, don't bother with her.

115
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,780
Go out.

116
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:38,540
Yes.

117
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,230
How did I end up with such a hard life?

118
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,340
Everyone, please judge for yourselves.

119
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,310
We worked so hard

120
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,590
to raise our daughter,

121
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,600
even marrying her off to the richest Xu family

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
as a young madam.

123
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,110
Now that her family is in trouble,

124
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,750
this daughter

125
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,730
doesn't care at all.

126
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,830
How did I end up with such a miserable fate?

127
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,230
What exactly do you want?

128
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:05,790
500 taels.

129
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,030
Help your father pay off his debt.

130
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,390
If you don't have the money,

131
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,450
your husband does.

132
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,350
Don't even think about it.

133
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,910
Oh heavens,

134
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,430
everyone, please judge for yourselves!

135
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,460
Other people's daughters are as dear as a small cotton-padded jacket,

136
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,260
but our family

137
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,390
raised a thankless wretch!

138
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,000
She’s determined to force her father and me

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,630
to sleep on the streets and freeze to death.

140
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,600
Is this right?

141
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,660
You tell me, how can this be?

142
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,790
Go ahead and make a scene.

143
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,090
Even if you ruin my shop,

144
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,550
I won't give you any money.

145
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,909
Ling Se.

146
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,070
Darling, you're back.

147
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,640
How is it?

148
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,150
Did Ling Se agree to give you the money?

149
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,350
I knew

150
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,420
this tactic wouldn't work.

151
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,120
She's always been like this since she was a child.

152
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,450
No one could control her

153
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,070
except her mother.

154
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,910
Since you say that,

155
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,830
why don't you let her mother

156
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,700
handle her?

157
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,040
Mr. Xu.

158
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,920
You're here to mock me, aren't you?

159
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:29,950
What

160
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,030
are you planning to do now?

161
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,750
I've made a big joke of myself this time.

162
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,270
Are you satisfied?

163
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,600
Now that you've had your laugh, just leave.

164
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,220
I need to

165
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,250
find a place where I can

166
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,590
cry alone.

167
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,990
I'm not here to mock you.

168
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,170
I have a solution.

169
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,200
Are you interested?

170
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,230
What big idea

171
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,400
is Young Master Xu plotting this time?

172
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,520
Go ahead.

173
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,270
It doesn't matter to me anymore.

174
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,559
I have

175
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,610
the ready-made Jiuchongtian tea blend.

176
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,360
You can take it to fulfill your orders.

177
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,050
We'll count it as our families' joint venture.

178
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,910
From now on, we'll work together,

179
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,650
splitting the profits evenly.

180
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,650
What do you think?

181
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,640
After the way I treated your Xu family,

182
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,110
why would you help me?

183
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Why?

184
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:09,530
To err is human.

185
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,120
Although

186
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,990
you’ve done things

187
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,750
that weren't in Xu family’s favor,

188
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,510
those things happened

189
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,510
because of me,

190
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,400
so I bear some responsibility too.

191
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,220
For so many years,

192
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,650
your Tao family has conducted business

193
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,580
with integrity.

194
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,140
I don't want to

195
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,850
see an honest merchant

196
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,710
fall like this.

197
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,880
Harmony brings wealth.

198
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,100
This is the foundation of prosperity.

199
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,320
Mr. Tao.

200
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,860
Do you

201
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,390
forgive me now?

202
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,560
Zilu.

203
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,000
Young Master.

204
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,430
Your methods are sharp,

205
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,890
and your vision is grand!

206
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,360
Young Master.

207
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,650
You are truly both sharp and grand!

208
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,890
Stop flattering me.

209
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,040
Get back to work.

210
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,630
Young Master.

211
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,300
I have to say something to you.

212
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,650
You've been doing things

213
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,530
you shouldn't do,

214
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:37,190
but you need to do the things that should be done.

215
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,640
What things?

216
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,040
The Young Madam.

217
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,260
Confessing your feelings. Did you forget?

218
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,890
But I don't know

219
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,460
how to create

220
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,420
that opportunity.

221
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,620
If you don't know, I do!

222
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,360
Young Master.

223
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,090
That's why I'm here to help you.

224
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,630
I've thought it over.

225
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,690
This is actually very simple.

226
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,070
You just need to cater to her likes.

227
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,080
Go and ask

228
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,640
Young Madam what she likes,

229
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,440
then buy that thing

230
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,470
and give it to her.

231
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,340
After that, just go with the flow,

232
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,150
and the matter will be settled, right?

233
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,490
If Young Madam is happy,

234
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,500
if Young Madam is delighted,

235
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,280
if she gives you a hug...

236
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,380
Right.

237
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,940
Taking the first step is the hardest

238
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,870
and most courageous.

239
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,310
Go!

240
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,330
Young Master!

241
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:27,920
Come on!

242
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,460
Ask her what she likes.

243
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,120
Do I need you to teach me?

244
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,120
Of course, I know.

245
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,540
Xu Zilu.

246
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,500
Where are you going?

247
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,080
I was just looking for you.

248
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,180
Have you prepared the item

249
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,110
for the auction?

250
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,770
I forgot about it.

251
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,230
I'll go prepare it now.

252
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,460
What's wrong?

253
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,840
What do you like?

254
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:12,960
I like money.

255
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,250
What else could I like?

256
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,160
No, I mean,

257
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,090
what kind of person do you like?

258
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,790
I like someone who reeks of money.

259
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,250
Stop talking to me.

260
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,960
I need to think carefully

261
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,640
about what I should prepare.

262
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Don't disturb me.

263
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,030
Then I'll go.

264
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:35,760
Goodbye.

265
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,710
Are you two having a little spat?

266
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,430
Why do you look like

267
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,690
it just snowed in June?

268
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,140
I've got a bunch of things bothering me.

269
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,910
What's going on? Tell me.

270
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,830
I won’t talk about

271
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,780
family matters.

272
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,840
Let me tell you about business.

273
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,790
Xu Zilu wants me to join

274
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,830
that Linchun Chamber of Commerce.

275
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,470
I thought

276
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,600
having some backing would

277
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,930
bring me some benefits,

278
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,330
but now I have to attend

279
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,430
that charity auction.

280
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,880
I have to prepare

281
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,990
an item with collectible value.

282
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,240
And you know anything with collectible value

283
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,490
won't come cheap.

284
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,610
Why don't you just say

285
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,790
you don't want to

286
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,540
spend money?

287
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,860
You're so stingy.

288
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,780
Now that you're

289
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,760
a big boss.

290
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,110
can't you be a little more generous?

291
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,730
The better the item you prepare,

292
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,850
the more it will sell for, and the more you can donate.

293
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,660
It's a good deed.

294
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,050
That's easy for you to say.

295
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,630
Why don't you give me something?

296
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,890
I don't have anything.

297
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,440
How about

298
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,730
you learn a craft

299
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,760
and make something yourself?

300
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,820
That'll have to do.

301
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,220
You really have it easy,

302
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,780
talking while standing up.

303
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,430
Right.

304
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,350
Why did you come here?

305
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,580
Where is my flower cake?

306
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,500
Oh, my brain!

307
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,410
I finished it,

308
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,620
but I almost forgot to bring it.

309
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,500
Come, let me show you.

310
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,100
Let me see.

311
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,640
Gosh, Se.

312
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,790
Your skills are now truly

313
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,170
exceptional!

314
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,210
In a few days,

315
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,110
someone is celebrating

316
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,040
their 80th birthday at my place.

317
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,570
Can you make peach-shaped birthday buns?

318
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,060
That's easy.

319
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,430
And what about a figure of the the God of Longevity?

320
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,350
That's no problem either.

321
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:12,930
Then I'll place an order

322
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,580
with you.

323
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,470
But make sure the God of Longevity figure

324
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,120
is festive

325
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,150
and realistic.

326
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,790
The dough figure artist outside

327
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,740
is too expensive.

328
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,670
so this will definitely cost less.

329
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,650
I've got it!

330
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,080
I know what I'll donate for the charity auction.

331
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,220
I guarantee no one else will have it.

332
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:30,820
What is it?

333
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:31,630
Se.

334
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,140
Master Ling sent a letter for you.

335
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,990
He said if you don't gather

336
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,660
500 taels of silver by the end of today,

337
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,740
he'll throw out your mother's

338
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
memorial tablet.

339
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,590
How can someone be so wicked?

340
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,850
Is he even human?

341
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,790
He must have let the dogs eat his conscience.

342
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,910
He actually has the nerve to ask you for money.

343
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,220
Has he ever spent a penny on you

344
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,480
since you were little?

345
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,630
And now he's using his deceased wife

346
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,290
to threaten his own daughter.

347
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:56,890
He's truly shameless.

348
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,140
My Lord.

349
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,210
Will it work?

350
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,160
Don't worry.

351
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,400
This girl loves her mother more than anything.

352
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,470
She'll definitely come back.

353
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,710
As long as Ling Se brings the money

354
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,890
to get us through this tough time,

355
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,230
our Ling family will rise again.

356
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,210
Only by sticking with me

357
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,590
will you live in luxury.

358
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,820
Marrying Ling Se

359
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,830
into the Xu family

360
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,910
was the right choice back then.

361
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,690
It's my duty

362
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,550
to ease your burdens, My Lord.

363
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,910
So you know how to come back?

364
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,230
Master Ling, you went to great lengths

365
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,810
to get me back,

366
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,000
so drop the act.

367
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,040
We both know

368
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,000
I never wanted

369
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,430
to set foot in here again.

370
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,840
You...

371
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,550
My Lord.

372
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,770
The money is what's important.

373
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,550
Fine.

374
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,400
You've seen the letter.

375
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,780
Hand over the money quickly,

376
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,400
or

377
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,860
I'll throw out your mother's

378
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
memorial tablet.

379
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,150
I can give you the money,

380
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,410
but I have a condition.

381
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,010
Name it.

382
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,430

do such an unfilial thing?

You want to take your mother's memorial tablet away,

But she is a member of the Ling family.

Making money is due to oneself,

00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,810
Can I get that back too?

574
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,610
That means I have 600 taels now.

575
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,670
I'm rich!

576
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,450
You money-grubber!

577
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:08,990
Young Master.

578
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,720
How is it?

579
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,200
I've thought about it.

580
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,810
This thing

581
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,840
should be sewn onto the clothes after all.

582
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,410
What do you think?

583
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,410
Am I smart or what?

584
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,410
Take it apart.

585
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,870
We don't need it anymore.

586
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,520
Young Master.

587
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,510
Aren't you going to express your feelings to Young Madam?

588
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,150
The timing

589
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,360
isn't right now.

590
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,970
Let's just forget it.

591
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,850
It’s okay, Young Master.

592
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,470
As long as your intentions are there,

593
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,560
the Young Madam

594
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,440
will definitely feel it herself.

595
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,430
Isn't there an old saying?

596
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,940
"A determined suitor wins the lady."

597
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,270
Keep at it.

598
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,030
Go back.

599
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,380
What’s going on?

600
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,350
Did you go out stealing last night?

601
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,760
Of course not.

602
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,430
I put a lot of effort

603
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,190
into preparing

604
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,920
this valuable auction item.

605
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,390
I hope

606
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,650
today’s auction ends quickly.

607
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,970
I’m really exhausted.

608
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,550
What is it?

609
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,150
I can’t show you now. It’s a secret.

610
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,280
You’ll find out soon enough.

611
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,570
Let's go.

612
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,730
[Linchun Charity Sale]

613
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,020
Mr. Xu,

614
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,730
big spender, huh?

615
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,030
What about you, Madam?

616
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,110
It's the thought that counts,

617
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,790
right?

618
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:18,740
Of course.

619
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,240
I made this

620
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,720
God of Wealth figure

621
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,210
by hand.

622
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,920
Which business

623
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,410
wouldn’t want the God of Wealth

624
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,610
to stay in their home?

625
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,230
Am I right?

626
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:30,810
Yes.

627
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,440
Let me see.

628
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,870
Young Master.

629
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,750
This God of Wealth does look a lot like you.

630
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,610
It really does.

631
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,430
Let me see.

632
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,690
I’ll take it.

633
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,590
Can this be fixed?

634
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:47,890
It’s fine.

635
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,190
Manager.

636
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,540
When you hand it over later,

637
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,640
be sure to support

638
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,750
its head like this.

639
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,250
Maybe the head is too big and heavy.

640
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,070
Why don’t the two of you rest in the backyard for now?

641
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,480
I’ll come and get you

642
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,900
when the auction starts.

643
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,280
-Young Master, I’m leaving.
-Thank you.

644
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,120
How did I do?

645
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,910
Isn’t it both meaningful

646
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,070
and valuable?

647
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,950
The best part is it didn’t cost anything.

648
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:12,880
I made it myself.

649
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,860
It really is meaningful.

650
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:17,830
Brother Xu.

651
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,240
Your wife is here too?

652
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,360
Se.

653
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,270
I haven’t had a chance to congratulate you

654
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,530
on joining the Chamber of Commerce.

655
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,440
Thank you, Mrs. Qiu.

656
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,150
Once

657
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,450
the auction is over,

658
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,460
let’s have a good drink together.

659
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,060
Sure.

660
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,730
This sago drink is really good.

661
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,640
I’ll reserve some.

662
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,630
I’ll come get it from you later.

663
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,550
See you!

664
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,310
Miss Ling.

665
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,830
Mr. Wu?

666
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,970
You’re here for the auction too?

667
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,590
I’ve visited your shop several times,

668
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,850
but you weren’t there.

669
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,340
I was quite disappointed.

670
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,590
I’ve had some personal matters recently.

671
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,370
But don’t worry,

672
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:48,330
I’ll be around for the next few days.

673
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,390
You should come by.

674
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,450
And who might you be, sir?

675
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,130
What business do you have with my wife?

676
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,820
So he’s really your husband?

677
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,690
A girl as interesting as you

678
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:01,820
is already married?

679
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:03,240
What a pity.

680
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,070
Sir,

681
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,590
that’s not

682
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,390
a very appropriate thing to say.

683
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,680
Now that you know I’m her husband,

684
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,180
I suggest you stop bothering my wife.

685
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,500
How can you call it bothering?

686
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,420
We’re just friends,

687
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,040
aren’t we?

688
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,110
I need to introduce my wife

689
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,110
to other friends.

690
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:27,650
We don’t have time

691
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,970
to continue this conversation with you.

692
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,240
Aren’t you curious

693
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,470
about who I am, Mr. Xu?

694
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,610
I’m Wu Qi, Imperial Merchant of Furong City.

695
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,920
I've long heard of your great reputation, Mr. Xu.

696
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,520
Mr. Wu, you're actually an Imperial Merchant?

697
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,780
Miss Ling,

698
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,550
do you really want to chat

699
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,150
with those old men and women?

700
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,940
Why not

701
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,120
continue our conversation instead?

702
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,190
Everyone,

703
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,490
the auction is about to begin.

704
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,440
Please take your seats.

705
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,680
See you in a bit.

706
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,980
This way, please.

707
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,580
Everyone,

708
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,040
Let's go.

709
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,830

the young master of the Wu family from Furong City.

714
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,520
The starting bid

715
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,840
is 100 taels.

716
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,410
Who is this Wu Qi?

717
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,590
He actually has

718
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,790
a royal tribute item!

719
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,750
I’ve heard

720
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,850
he’s an Imperial Merchant from Furong City.

721
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,970
He became an Imperial Merchant

722
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,100
at just 24 years old.

723
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,750
That’s impressive.

724
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,720
I should get to know him.

725
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,530

Stop,

729
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,100
that’s high enough.

730
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,200
250 taels, going once.

731
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,190
Forget it.

732
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,010
I'm out.

733
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,430

734
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:57,760

Congratulations!

740

741
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,220
This is such a valuable item,

742
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,410
It costs so much.

743
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:10,910
You...

744
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,830

Ten taels?

755
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,640
Interesting.

756
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Miss Ling, you have quite the skill.

757
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,960

Why are you bidding?

763
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,030
80 taels.

764
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,770
80 taels.

765
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:52,710
100 taels.

766
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,870
150 taels.

767
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,280
300 taels!

768
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,030
500 taels.

769
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,090
Are these two crazy?

770
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,070
800 taels.

771
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,380
800 taels.

772
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,000
1,000 taels.

773
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,830
1,500 taels.

774
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,370
Stop bidding.

775
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,890
This little dough figurine

776
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:10,620
is only worth two copper coins.

777
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,940
If you really want one,

778
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,200
I can make you another.

779
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,540
I only want this one.

780
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,110
I can make an identical one for you.

781
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,090
Besides,

782
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,260
its head is already broken.

783
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,060
It's not good.

784
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,270
Really?

785
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,010
Forget this one.

786
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:24,830
Okay.

787
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,910
Wu Qi.

788
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,560
1,000 taels, going once.

789
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,270
Mr. Wu wants it.

790
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,350
Is it possible we’re missing something?

791
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:32,840
Indeed.

792
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,510
Se

793
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,250
seems to have quite the charm.

794
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,500
Wu Qi, 1,000 taels, going twice.

795
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,990
Sold!

796
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,860
Congratulations to Mr. Wu.

797
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,760
Congratulations to Mr. Wu.

798
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,390
Congratulations.

799
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,300
One thousand taels just for a girl's smile.

800
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,270
Mr. Wu really knows how to spend!

801
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,250
Why did Mr. Xu

802
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
back down at the last minute?

803
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,260
Maybe you didn’t like

804
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,120
the figurine that much after all.

805
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,130
Mr. Wu, you're from out of town.

806
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,210
I’m simply letting you have it.

807
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,780
If I truly wanted it,

808
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:15,790
I’m afraid you couldn’t afford to outbid me.

809
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:17,340
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

810
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,470
But the more I look at this figurine,

811
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,030
the more I like it.

812
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,050
The more I look at it,

813
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,500
the more it seems

814
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,470
to resemble me.

815
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,830
Don’t you think, Ling Se?

816
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,560
Really? What a coincidence.

817
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,570
Mr. Wu, you sure are full of yourself.

818
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,410
Keep the figurine then.

819
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,030
There won't be another one like it.

820
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,630
Unlike me.

821
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,280
If I want one,

822
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,390
my wife can make it for me anytime.

823
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,190
Ling Se and I are friends.

824
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,510
I’m sure if I asked,

825
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,040
she would make one for me as well.

826
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,920
It’s getting late.

827
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,130
I’ll take my leave.

828
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,180
Ling Se.

829
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,020
Let’s meet again another time.

830
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,550
See you.

831
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,050
Let’s go.

832
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,530
Wu Qi

833
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,150
is definitely not a good guy.

834
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,659
Stay away from him.

835
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,170
Men's

836
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,130
inexplicable competitive streak

837
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,560
is really childish.

838
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,110
Ling Se.

839
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,810
You didn’t touch

840
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,920
your food tonight.

841
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,739
How about

842
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,389
I go with you to get something to eat?

843
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,120
I’m not eating anymore. I’m going to sleep.

844
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,770
I'm so sleepy.

845
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,389
Well…

846
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,280
I have something to ask.

847
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,199
What is it?

848
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,110
You have to make one for me too.

849
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,230
Make what?

850
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,350
You didn’t let me bid on it.

851
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,480
You said you’d make another one for me.

852
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,389
The dough figurine, right?

853
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:47,949
Alright, if you want one so badly,

854
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,810
I’ll make you one when I have time.

855
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,280
Well,

856
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,920
I want it to be even better.

857
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,739
Okay, an even better one.

858
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,690
I’m so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.

859
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,810
I'm going to bed.

860
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:56,590
Don't forget.

861
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,070
Okay.

862
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,760
Young Master.

863
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,570
Which place will you stay at when you go to the mountains

864
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,820
the day after tomorrow to look at the timber,

865
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,680
Songhe Pavilion or Tangquan Inn?

866
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,800
Neither. I’ll return to the mansion.

867
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,270
You’re surely coming back

868
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,330
to accompany the Young Madam, right?

869
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,770
To accompany you.

870
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,170
Mr. Wu?

871
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,070
Miss Ling.

872
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,710
I happened to pass by today

873
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,930
and remembered that you mentioned

874
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,550
wanting to experiment with some new foods.

875
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,190
I wonder

876
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,250
if I might have the honor

877
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,230
of trying them today?

878
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,050
There is indeed that honor.

879
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,980
Mr. Wu, please have a seat.

880
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,550
Ping'er.

881
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,160
Bring out the new products.

882
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,560
Okay.

883
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,560
Mr. Wu.

884
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,030
Mr. Wu.

885
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,110
This is a pastry I made

886
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,230
by reducing the moisture

887
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,410
from one of our milk teas,

888
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:08,520
using the method you mentioned.

889
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,320
Please try it.

890
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,120
Does it contain taro paste?

891
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,130
I only put a little bit in.

892
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,240
You can taste it?

893
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,110
Mr. Wu, you really have a refined palate.

894
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:23,770
Not really.

895
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,850
It’s just that

896
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,540
I really like seasonal foods.

897
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,870
If you have time,

898
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,530
we could go to the suburbs together

899
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,360
to look for local seasonal ingredients.

900
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,670
With your innovative ideas,

901
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,950
I’m sure you can develop

902
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,480
unique local specialties.

903
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,840
Sounds good.

904
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:38,030
When are you free?

905
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:38,810
I happen

906
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,940
to want to go

907
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,690
and gather some inspiration.

908
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,230
Alright.

909
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,110
Next time, do come and taste more of the new products.

910
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:43,510
Okay,

911
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,700
and remember

912
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,730
to make plans

913
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,830
to visit the suburbs with me next time.

914
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,860
Alright, we’ll meet then.

915
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,320
Alright, we’ll meet then.

916
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,740
Mr. Wu, you seem very leisurely.

917
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,500
Why are you

918
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,640
visiting

919
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,130
my wife's shop?

920
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,910
I'm not like you, Young Master Xu,

921
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,610
who is always busy with your own affairs.

922
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,330
I really enjoy

923
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,900
the desserts in Ms. Ling's shop.

924
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,070
Once I taste them, I can’t forget them,

925
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,810
so I end up coming often.

926
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,500
I have other matters today, so I’ll leave first.

927
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,150
Ms. Ling,

928
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,210
don’t forget our appointment.

929
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:21,430
It seems

930
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,860
that Mr. Wu visits frequently.

931
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,510
Yes.

932
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,050
Even customers from Furong City

933
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,650
really enjoy the food I make.

934
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,840
My skills are really

935
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,610
top-notch.

936
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,910
Isn’t opening a branch store

937
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,240
just around the corner?

938
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:35,990
By the way,

939
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,450
what about my dough figurine?

940
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,440
You can't get over this, right?

941
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,080
I’ve been so busy recently.

942
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,570
When would I have the time to make it for you?

943
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,700
But you promised me.

944
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,170
I’ll make it when I have time.

945
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,830
Then

946
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,520
I want to drink milk tea.

947
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,500
The one you made for me last time,

948
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,700
which is called "Wish You Prosperity."

949
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,000
Did you find it good?

950
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,880
Should I add it

951
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,940
to the menu?

952
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,310
How did you make that ingredient?

953
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,440
I didn’t write it down at the time.

954
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,390
Let me think about

955
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,920
how I made that ingredient.

956
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,080
Wish You Prosperity…

957
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,410
What’s going on here?

958
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:26,990
My Lord.

959
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,870
Something’s gone wrong in Linchun.

960
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,270
Speak.

961
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,590
Tao Ziran bribed

962
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,960
Eunuch Zhou from Prince Xian's Mansion

963
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,460
getting Eunuch Zhou to transfer the order

964
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,410
to himself.

965
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,790
However, there was a mistake,

966
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,870
and Prince Xian found something wrong with the fragrance.

967
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:41,300
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

968
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,500
My Lord. Don't worry.

969
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,010
The issue was resolved

970
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,030
by a twist of fate.

971
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,480
Xu Zilu stepped in

972
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,560
to save Tao Ziran,

973
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,740
And Prince Xian

974
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,560
didn’t pursue the matter further.

975
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,590
He even personally

976
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,480
sent the goods back to Furong City.

977
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,080
By the way,

978
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,710
My Lord.

979
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,380
Xu Zilu has successfully been appointed as the Imperial Merchant.

980
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,440
That was expected.

981
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,910
This matter won’t affect

982
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,640
you, will it?

983
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,910
It’s fine.

984
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,830
Prince Xian is benevolent

985
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,680
and generally

986
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,970
doesn’t hold grudges.

987
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,470
If he were that type,

988
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,310
Tao Ziran

989
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,060
would have lost his head by now.

990
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,010
By the way, My Lord,

991
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,150
we just received news from Linchun.

992
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,960
The head

993
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,110
of the Wu family from Lingnan, Wu Qi,

994
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,510
is currently in Linchun.

995
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,090
It looks like a trip back to Linchun is needed.

996
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,750
Mr. Qi has written

997
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,760
saying he is willing to take over the last batch of goods.

998
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,350
This will

999
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,970
help clear the accounts

1000
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,890
and prevent Zilu from noticing anything.

1001
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,290
Prepare the carriage.

1002
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:36,600
Yes, My Lord.

1003
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,880
This is freshly dried persimmon cake.

1004
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,170
The best time to eat it is just after it’s dried.

1005
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:50,960
Paired with

1006
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,990
a warm drink,

1007
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,250
it’s the best snack

1008
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,350
for this season..

1009
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,550
From what you’re saying,

1010
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,800
it sounds even more delicious.

1011
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,530
Let me try it.

1012
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,900
Delicious.

1013
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,610
You’re getting

1014
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,660
more and more diligent.

1015
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,190
Even checking the timber

1016
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,650
in the mountains personally.

1017
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,710
I’m quite pleased.

1018
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,580
If I’m not diligent, who will pay you?

1019
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,650
That’s true.

1020
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,310
But after winter,

1021
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,990
the scent of pine will be gone.

1022
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,480
We need to prepare early

1023
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,420
to ensure a smooth process

1024
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,350
for making fragrance next spring.

1025
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,710
I’m speaking.

1026
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,760
Well. Look at that couple

1027
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,460
over there.

1028
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:32,480
Really. I wish you could

1029
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,850
be as sweet to the Young Madam

1030
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,180
as they are.

1031
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,550
This is quite tasty.

1032
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,210
Quite good.

1033
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,050
Young Madam?

1034
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:40,980
Who are you lying to?

1035
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,940
Well Young Master.

1036
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,020
Young... Young Madam.

1037
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,910
Look.

1038
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,680
I won't.

1039
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:46,440
Look, it's right ahead.

1040
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,810
Just ahead. Look.
