Will you continue to run away?

I'll still shoot you with a slingshot?

Let me look at you.

How come you're fatter now?

26
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,840
Maybe it's because I had

27
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,210
nothing to do in prison,

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,180

Anyway,

30
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,660
thank you very much this time.

31
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,820
You don't have to thank me.

32
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,190
But speaking of which,

33
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,760
you should thank Wang Zhujue.

And why didn't he invite us?

95
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,960
I wouldn't go even if he had invited me.

96
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,710
I would go.

97
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,520

00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,590
Yes.

100
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,770
I can't believe that my father actually commended me.

101
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,820
Isn't that good?

102
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,040
Wang,

103
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,190

your father to commend you?

105
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,170
But I didn't expect that

106
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,300
he would be so happy.

107
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,360

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,590

112
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,260
I always think that

113
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,180
you are very excellent.

114
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:54,770
It's just that Magistrate Wang

115
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,300
probably didn't notice it.

116
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,680
But in your opinion,

117
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,950
what achievement is considered as bringing glory to our family?

118
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,550
I can't always

119
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,810

120
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,430
I have an idea.

122
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,970

124
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,640
if you study hard this time,

125
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,500
you might be able to pass the exam.

126
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,320
If you pass the Provincial Examination,

127
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,550
your parents

128
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,530
will definitely be very happy.

129
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,240
Isn't this an achievement

130
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,740
which can bring glory to your family?

131
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,510
Yes.

132
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,350
I failed the exam because I didn't want to study hard.

133
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,710
What if I pass the exam after I

134
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,910
study hard this time?

135
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:32,990

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,020
Can you be my teacher?

137
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,740
I can understand all that you've said.

138
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,240
But I just don't understand

139
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,470

140
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:42,330
Of course I can.

Don't worry.

151

I've never

But you just can't take her away from me, right?

154
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,530
My shop has just been opened.

155
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,190
There must be many customers.

156
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,170
Many customers?

But Sister,

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,670

159
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,180
I can't help much, either.

160
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,150
I... I have such a big appetite.

161
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,690
After your new shop has been opened,

162
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,470
don't make it go bankrupt because I eat too much.

163
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,720
How about

164
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,620
you just let me be Wang's teacher?

165
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,280
You silly girl.

166
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,760
How much money can it cost if you eat the food?

167
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,870
Right now,

168
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,470
your incident is just a trivial matter.

169
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,330
The point is that

170
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,060
we don't have

171
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,780
enough money now.

172
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,980
That's right.

173
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,140
Humans are not important, while money is important.

174
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,670
How about

175
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,260
we borrow some money?

176
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,570
Your friend, Liu Yeniang,

177
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,890
runs an inn, doesn't she?

178
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,020
She must have money.

179
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,950
I don't want to borrow money.

180
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,380
That's my principle.

181
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,540
As the saying goes,

182
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,250
if a person borrows money,

183
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,820
the more he borrows, the poorer he'll become.

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,150
Yeniang,

185
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,990
last time, I told you about

186
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,250
the investment...

187
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:04,850
and asked you to become a shareholder.

188
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,860
Have you made up your mind after consideration?

189
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,520
Let me tell you.

190
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,340
I've found a supplier that will

191
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,480
give me a 30% discount.

192
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,390
We only need 30 taels

193
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,320
to open the shop.

194
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,450
30 taels?

195
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,680
Do you think my money

196
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,280
was earned without efforts?

197
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,820
Ma'am, give me a pot of wine!

198
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,770
Wait a moment.

199
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,230
I usually don't even have enough money

200
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,950
to buy clothes, watch an opera and go shopping.

201
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,870
How would I have money for you?

202
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,870
Ma'am, hurry up and give me the wine.

203
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,530
I'll be right there.

204
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,120
You can buy

205
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,670
clothes anytime, can't you?

206
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,070
It's rare for several best friends

207
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,400
to make money together.

208
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,980
How about this?

209
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,070
I'll exert my capability

210
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,070
as the Stingy Girl

211
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,659
and open the shop with 20 taels.

212
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,750
My dear girl,

213
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,990
you can also sell your tea at the stall, can't you?

214
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,970
How can it be the same?

215
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:40,429
At the stall, I can only sell the tea

216
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,010
at the price of 20 coins per cup.

217
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,780
If I run a shop, the price can be 30 coins per cup.

218
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,620
Think about it.

219
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,290
Even if I sell

220
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,620
only 50 cups in a month,

221
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,280
then the net profits will be

222
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,160
20 taels a month

223
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,320
and 200 taels a year.

224
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,500
You'll earn a large amount of money, won't you?

225
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
You'll be the major shareholder.

226
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,830
You might even wake up from your laugh in your dream, huh?

227
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,210
Alright.

228
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,060
You're so shrewd.

229
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,690
I can't refute what you said.

230
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,340
Thirteen taels. I won't give you a penny more.

231
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,140
My good sister.

232
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,790
I know you're the best.

233
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,670
Don't worry.

234
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,970
I will definitely

235
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,260
regard every penny of your money

236
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,710
as my lifeline

237
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,670
when I spend it.

238
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,060
I will definitely enable our shop

239
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,390
to have a grand opening.

240
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,150
Opening a shop? What kind of shop are you going to open?

241
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:21,790
She's going to run

242
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,710
a weird shop.

243
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,260
She even asked her best friends to invest in it.

244
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,280
Yes, Miss Tao.

245
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,790
If there's a good project, as best friends,

246
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,720
we can make money together.

247
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,800
We can work together and spend money together.

248
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,060
Aren't you happy just thinking about it?

249
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,070
Miss Tao.

250
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,660
Do you have some spare money?

251
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,860
Will you consider investing in my shop?

252
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,270
Does that mean that

253
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,470
you'll work for me?

254
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:43,670
Sure.

255
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,070
But I don't have that much money.

256
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,450
Don't loathe it if I don't give you much money.

257
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,450
Of course I won't.

258
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,510
Even a copper coin is also money.

259
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,830
How would I loathe it if you don't give me much money?

260
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,430
100 taels.

261
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,170
This is all the money I have.

262
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,540
You said you didn't have much money.

263
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,850
How come it's not quite the same

264
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,520
as what I've imagined?

265
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,860
Are you busy?

266
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,410
The deadline of the Assessment of Imperial Merchants

267
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,270
is coming soon.

268
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,220
I need to pay more attention to the affairs

269
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,620
of the perfume workshop.

270
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,860
What's the matter?

271
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,180
Well, tomorrow,

272
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,940
it'll be the opening day of my tea shop.

273
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,720
I think

274
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,530
you must be quite busy recently,

275
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,670
so I've brought my new product here

276
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,730
to let you taste it.

277
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,130
It's a good thing that you'll open a tea shop.

278
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,150
If I have time,

279
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,440
I'll certainly go there.

280
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,660
Then I'll wait for you tomorrow.

281
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,720
Remember to eat it.

282
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,490
I won't disturb you any longer.

283
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,410
[Fragrant Aromatic Tea Shop]

284
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,310
A happy opening!

285
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,230
Please support us.

286
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,910
Congratulations.

287
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,690
Big Boss Ling Se.

288
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,510
The same to you.

289
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,560
Manager Ping'er.

290
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,630
Ms. Ling.

291
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,620
Ms. Tao.

292
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,830
Ms. Ling, wish you a prosperous business.

293
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,840
Wish you prosperity!

294
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,140
Let's open a branch store!

295
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,650
Let's open ten branch stores next year!

296
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,710
Ten branch stores!

297
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,180
We've almost finished

298
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,440
discussing business.

299
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,990
As I have something else to do, I have to go now.

300
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,100
Xu,

301
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,880
it's still early.

302
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
Why are you in such a hurry to go back?

303
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,310
Are you going back home to be bullied?

304
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,560
Look at us.

305
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,590
We've finished talking about work.

306
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,750
Just listen to me talk about

307
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,810
my family affairs.

308
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,710
There's a promotion event for our opening.

309
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:54,170
Ladies,

310
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,090
if you buy one cup, you'll get another one cup for free.

311
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,450
If you buy three cups, you'll get another two cups for free.

312
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,450
What do you think?

313
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,850
Please enjoy yourselves.

314
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,150
Liu.

315
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,520
Give me ten cups of Aromatic Tea.

316
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,410
Little Young Master, each person can only buy five portions.

317
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,760
Otherwise, the people after them can't buy the tea.

318
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,850
Can't the shop owner's family buy ten cups?

319
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,580
Not even the family can do this.

320
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,920
Sorry to keep you waiting. Here's your milk tea.

321
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,380
Please enjoy yourselves.

322
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,790
Be patient. Be patient.

323
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,270
Sorry to keep you waiting. The milk tea is ready.

324
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:19,870
Thank you.

325
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,660
What do you want?

326
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,250
Drink it while it's still hot.

327
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,180
It's delicious.

328
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,710
Really?

329
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,200
It's good. It's really good.

330
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,950
What are you looking at?

331
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,550
Nothing. Go give them to the customers now.

332
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,950
Hurry.

333
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,830
Yes, yes, yes.

334
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:43,950
Alright.

335
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,780
I really have something to do. I have to go now.

336
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,990
No, Xu!

337
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,700
I just want to

338
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,250
complain to you about this.

339
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,990
I'm just

340
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,470
trying to get drunk to relieve all my sorrows.

341
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,760
Come on, Xu.

342
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,720
Thank you for listening

343
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,070
to me talking about so many

344
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,070
sad things today.

345
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,250
Now that I have you here...

346
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,570
Come on. Let's drink. Okay?

347
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,340
Waiter!

348
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,270
Bring me two more pots of wine.

349
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,120
I'm so tired.

350
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,030
I've never done

351
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,990
so much work

352
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,260
all my life.

353
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,450
My legs are also

354
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,620
aching so badly.

355
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,200
How about we take a rest

356
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,410
for a day tomorrow?

357
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,140
No.

358
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,510
We sold all the goods

359
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,340
on the first day of the opening.

360
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,030
We have to go on working hard on it tomorrow.

361
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,540
Ordinary people can't stand this, can they?

362
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,650
Are you really not considering

363
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,580
hiring several people to help you?

364
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,220
I'm considering about it.

365
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,340
But it'll cost some money to hire

366
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,100
some people to help us, won't it?

367
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,830
We had a promotion event today.

368
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,510
After the costs are deducted,

369
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,970
we still have some losses.

370
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,570
We'll still need to save more money.

371
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,010
The saying of suffering losses only to earn some popularity can be used to describe you.

372
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,790
Anyway,

373
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,440
today,

374
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,880
we had a good start in a way.

375
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,390

There have been no customers in my shop in the past few days.

Is it because

Plus, this is your first time doing business.

in the past few days.

539
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,840
But none of them was effective.

541
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,690
when will it stop being difficult?

542
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,100
Actually, there are still two sentences

543
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,560
following this sentence.

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,630
The beginning is always difficult no matter what we do.

545
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,630

There will be a trade fair in the east of the city tomorrow.

participants are supposed to take their family with them to go there.

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,100
With my current identity,

555
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,880
it's inappropriate for me to go alone.

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,510
Okay.

561
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:09,010
I'll do that for the sake of the most difficult part.

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,150
Welcome, everyone.

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:13,630
Mr. Qiu.

564
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,760
Xu, you're finally here.

565
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,050
There are still many things

566
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,280
to be handled by you.

567
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,510
Come with me now.

568
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,070
Ling Se.

569
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,800
Later,

570
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,250
wait for me after you enter the inner court.

571
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:23,860
I'll get back to work.

572
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,310
Okay.

573
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,610
Let's go.

574
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,670
Hurry. Come with me now.

575
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,730
What's the matter?

576
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,920
Okay. Three people, right?

577
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,590
Okay.

578
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,650
Let me take records for it.

579
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,320
Sure. No problem. No problem.

580
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,560
Come on. Everyone, please come in. Please come in.

581
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,270
Miss.

582
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,950
Please stop.

583
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,200
Miss,

584
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,030
you look a bit unfamiliar to me.

585
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,080
Who are you?

586
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,580
I'm Ling Se.

587
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,940
What Ling Se?

588
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,800
Please show me your invitation letter.

589
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,320
Invitation letter?

590
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,750
Miss,

591
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,640
our club

592
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,700
is not open to outsiders.

593
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,290
You can't come in without an invitation letter.

594
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,960
So please show me your invitation letter.

595
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:05,800
Well...

596
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,510
I came in with someone else.

597
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,040
It seems that I've dropped my invitation letter.

598
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,990
I dropped it at my home.

599
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,760
How about letting me go in first?

600
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,260
I'll ask someone to send it to you later.

601
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,290
Why don't you come here again another day?

602
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,100
No. I'll continue to look for it.

603
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,270
That annoying Xu Zilu!

604
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,380
Miss, you dropped something.

605
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,230
Sir,

606
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,650
have you mistaken me for someone else?

607
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,980
I didn't drop anything.

608
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,530
I saw it with my own eyes.

609
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,680
You dropped

610
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,310
[Invitation Letter]

611
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,340
this thing, Miss.

612
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,950
You didn't notice it, did you?

613
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,190
Yes, it's mine.

614
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,660
Thank you.

615
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
Please come in, Miss.

616
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,870
I can come in now, right?

617
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,770
Please.

618
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm going inside first.

619
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,720
My husband

620
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,720
bought a new piece of land in the southern suburbs.

621
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,600
He said he would take me to see it in two days.

622
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,370
I teased him.

623
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,550
Can there be gold

624
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,790
growing in this land?

625
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,750
There are quite many flavors.

626
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:20,750
Who is that?

627
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,720
Whose wife is this?

628
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,750
Who are you?

629
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Are you asking me?

630
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
My name is Ling Se.

631
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,420
Whose wife are you?

632
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,120
I'm from Xu's Perfume Shop.

633
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,530
I'm a member of the Xu family.

634
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,260
You... So you are the Young Madam of the Xu Family?

635
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,510
Young Madam Xu,

636
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,180
did you not eat enough food at home?

637
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,240
Why are you eating these snacks here?

638
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,740
Well, these snacks are really delicious.

639
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,560
You can also taste them.

640
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,210
I won't eat the food here.

641
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,370
Take it away.

642
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,930
Mrs. Chen is used to being picky about food.

643
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,140
Since this food is placed there,

644
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,200
it's just for people to eat, isn't it?

645
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,950
Young Madam Xu.

646
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,770
Why are you wearing this dress?

647
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,670
Yes, your dress is so short.

648
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,430
It looks like a maid's dress.

649
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,560
Why... Why didn't you bring your wife along

650
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,620
when you came here?

651
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,870
I think

652
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,460
my wife is in the inner court now.

653
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,720
Did she go there alone?

654
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,480
Well... Young Madam Xu

655
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,510
is here for the first time.

656
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,710
You're supposed to take her there

657
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,430
and... and introduce her to those several

658
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,290
ladies inside.

659
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,830
You know what my wife is like.

660
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,560
The other ladies inside there

661
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,290
are also not to be trifled with.

662
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,380
Young Madam Xu is young.

663
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,130
I'm afraid that she can't

664
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,590
manage with it by herself.

665
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,610
You've thought too much.

666
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,850
I think it'll be fine.

667
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,560
I'll go take a look.

668
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,720
Don't you think he's just...

669
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,220
Let me tell you a secret skill.

670
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,480
When you cook rice, you need to put some oil in it.

671
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,890
In this way, the rice will be

672
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,130
both fragrant and soft.

673
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,670
The kids will all like eating it.

674
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,310
Really?

675
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,020
My child

676
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,460
doesn't like eating rice.

677
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,510
This is great.

678
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,030
Then do you know

679
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,950
how to make the egg custard delicious?

680
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,350
My husband always says that

681
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,840
the egg custard I made smells fishy.

682
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,880
Egg custard?

683
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,620
It's even easier to make egg custard.

684
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,440
Just put some

685
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,730
corn grains,

686
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,410
carrot granules, shelled shrimps,

687
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,610
peas and so on inside.

688
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,310
Just remember the most important thing is that

689
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,600
you need to add vinegar and cooking wine to remove the fishy smell.

690
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,320
Then

691
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,750
steam it with a bamboo tube.

692
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,500
After it's steamed,

693
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,620
I'm sure it will be

694
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,330
both fragrant and smooth.

695
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,920
Isn't this Mr. Xu

696
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,870
of Xu's Perfume Shop?

697
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,600
Why are you hiding there and listening to our conversations?

698
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,920
He must be worried about his wife,

699
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,470
so he's here to see his wife.

700
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,040
I... I'll go there first. You guys...

701
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,100
-Just go.
-Just go.

702
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,580
They are really close to each other.

703
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,020
I used to hear that Mr. Xu

704
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,030
was apathetic about the intimate relationship with women.

705
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,910
After I saw him today,

706
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,580
I can't believe that he cares about his wife so much.

707
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,550
That's right.

708
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,070
Mrs. Xu is good at controlling her husband.

709
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,040
She's so lucky.

710
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,030
I've really learned a lot.

711
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,820
It turns out that a party for rich married women

712
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,560
is like this.

713
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,590
Right?

714
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,830
You usually associate with the disciples of Hong Sect

715
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,330
and vendors in the market.

716
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,310
You should also learn about

717
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,390
the preferences of rich married women.

718
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,750
In this way, it'll be good

719
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,810
for your business.

720
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,590
I think

721
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,650
you get along well with them.

722
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,190
You must have talked a lot with them.

723
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,600
So you specially

724
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,850
brought me here?

725
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,970
I... just did it incidentally.

726
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,130
Incidentally?

727
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,430
No wonder

728
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,310
you didn't even give me the invitation letter.

729
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,350
I almost couldn't come inside just now.

730
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:34,810
Well...

731
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,440
Didn't they know you?

732
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,370
They said they would only recognize invitation letters, not people.

733
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,630
Who was that?

734
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,730
Just forget it.

735
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,990
We're leaving anyway.

736
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,100
But I still want to thank you.

737
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,700
Thanks for doing this for me.

738
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,580
When I look up to the sky, I have a clear conscience.

739
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,220
When I lower my head, I don't feel guilty as I haven't done anything disgraceful.

740
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,480
These are the two joys.

741
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,350
Wang,

742
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,090
what is the third joy?

743
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,390
Joy...

744
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,570
Alone...

745
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,310
It's better to enjoy something with others than to enjoy it alone.

746
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,810
Ping'er.

747
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,990
I'm sorry. I fell asleep again.

748
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,960
Why did you always doze off?

749
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,590
People tend to get sleepy in spring, get tired in autumn and doze off in summer.

750
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,320
During March in winter, it's hard to get totally awaken.

751
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,840
In such weather, I just can't help

752
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,990
dozing off.

753
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,510
Alright.

754
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,710
I have an idea.

755
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Go out and do some exercises with me.

756
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,030
Ping'er.

757
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,880
Your idea is really good.

758
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,630
After running two laps, not only am I not sleepy anymore,

759
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,960
but my body is also warm.

760
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,910
In the future, if you are sleepy,

761
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,840
we can run more.

762
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,520
It's just that

763
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,890
the weather is cold now.

764
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:11,590
Even though our bodies are warm after running,

765
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,870
our hands are still quite cold.

766
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,410
The hands are cold?

767
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,780
By rubbing your hands, they'll get warm.

768
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,390
Look.

769
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:23,940
How about

770
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,920
you rub your hands by yourself?

771
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,590
Look at you.

772
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,190
You don't stay in your shop,

773
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,750
but you come to my inn every day instead.

774
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,350
Well...

775
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,950
What kind of mess is this?

776
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,780
There are no customers anyway.

777
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,640
Isn't it better to close it earlier?

778
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,280
Look at you.

779
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,620
I just don't know

780
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,650
what you guys are

781
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,080
worried about every day.

782
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,610
Ma'am, give me a pot of wine.

783
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,940
Wait a moment.

784
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,990
I know this woman.

785
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,850
Let me help you.

786
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,800
Mrs. Qiu.

787
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
You're here, too?

788
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:15,920
Why are you here

789
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,120
to have a drink alone?

790
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,990
Don't mention it.

791
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,440
It's due to my mother-in-law.

792
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,870
I really don't know what evil things I did

793
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,150
in my previous life.

794
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,690
Last time, I taught you the tactic of cooking for her.

795
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,220
Didn't you use this tactic?

796
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,950
Even my husband said that

797
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,060
the dishes I made were delicious.

798
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,020
But my mother-in-law

799
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,070
just didn't like this

800
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,060
and didn't like that.

801
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,570
I was furious when I heard it.

802
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,170
But I couldn't say anything.

803
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,690
I'm so angry.

804
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,390
It shouldn't be like that.

805
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,230
By the way,

806
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,520
your mother-in-law often

807
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,810
plays mahjong with my mother, doesn't she?

808
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,670
How about this?

809
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,820
Next time when she comes,

810
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,280
I'll sound her out for you.

811
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,230
Come on. Let me have a drink with you.

812
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,610
Mother.

813
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,310
What do you think is going on

814
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,650
between Mrs. Qiu

815
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:01,740
and Old Madam Qiu?

816
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,060
Why are you suddenly interested in

817
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,790
the gossip about their family?

818
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,590
The grudge between them

819
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,000
has lasted for a long time.

820
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,540
Since Mrs. Qiu

821
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,090
married into their family,

822
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,450
Old Madam Qiu has never liked her.

823
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,850
This afternoon,

824
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,110
I came across Mrs. Qiu.

825
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,100
She told me that she couldn't gain favor

826
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,900
from Old Madam Qiu all this time.

827
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
I feel sorry for her,

828
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,750
so I just want to help her.

829
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:28,520
No wonder

830
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,640
I just like you.

831
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,580
You are so soft-hearted.

832
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,800
But this is their family affair.

833
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,120
It's inconvenient for us to intervene.

834
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,510
How will you help her?

835
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,480
How about this?

836
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,310
Mother,

837
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,290
you can ask Old Madam Qiu

838
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,780
to play mahjong tomorrow.

839
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,960
It's okay to ask her to play mahjong.

840
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,780
But playing mahjong and helping her are two different things.

841
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,770
By that time,

842
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,650
we'll put on a show in front of her.

843
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,220
This is not okay. I'm not able to do it.

844
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,850
No, no, no.

845
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,290
Mother, you can do it.

846
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,030
By that time, I'll teach you how to say it.

847
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,960
You'll teach me?

848
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,429
Okay.

849
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,630
Just give it a try.

850
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,719
I'm so nervous.

851
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,030
You can do it.

852
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,340
[Xu's Mansion]

853
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,810
It's the same to do it earlier.

854
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,480
Mother.

855
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,860
Exactly.

856
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:22,540
Right?

857
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:23,699
Yes.

858
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,460
I've made some Furong Cakes for you.

859
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,120
Taste them.

860
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,830
What?

861
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,889
Furong Cakes.

862
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:32,179
What kind of weird name is that?

863
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,199
What kind of food did you make?

864
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,719
It’s neither sweet nor spicy nor sour.

865
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,060
Fu... Furong Cakes?

866
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,040
Your cooking skills are really getting worse and worse.

867
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,900
Take them away.

868
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,380
Yes.

869
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,260
Have I asked you to leave now?

870
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,370
You have no insight at all.

871
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,820
What are the three of us doing?

872
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,050
We're waiting for you.

873
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,170
We need one more player. Let's play mahjong.

874
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:55,699
Sit down.

875
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,500
Come on. Sit down.

876
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,630
Se.

877
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:01,770
Give me that cake. Let me taste it.

878
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,870
Aren't you afraid of being poisoned?

879
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,640
It's quite delicious.

880
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,140
The cake you made is much better than

881
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,640
the one my daughter-in-law made.

882
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,230
You just

883
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,410
don't know how lucky you are.

884
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
I'll eat them all.

885
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,270
Who actually doesn't know how lucky she is?

886
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,820
Speaking of your daughter-in-law,

887
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,760
a few days ago,

888
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,590
she specially came to our mansion

889
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,000
and learned to make cakes from Se

890
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,380
in order to make you happy.

891
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,310
I even like your daughter-in-law.

892
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,000
She just faked sincerity.

893
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,680
My daughter-in-law

894
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,390
always makes my son and my grandson

895
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,190
stay with her.

896
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,440
My son always spends time with his wife.

897
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,570
I can hardly see my grandson every day.

898
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,630
Since she married into our family,

899
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,510
the three of them have been a family.

900
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,870
Wherever they go, the three of them always go together.

901
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,730
And I'm always left alone at home.

902
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,450
That's too much.

903
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,470
What did you say just now?

904
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,840
A family of three, right?

905
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,320
You have a son and a grandson.

906
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,410
Do I have a grandson?

907
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,770
How I wished that I could have a grandson.

908
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,720
Have you ever given birth to a grandson for me?

909
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,670
No, you haven't. You...

910
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,640
I don't think I have.

911
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,690
You... You can give it a try on this.

912
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,070
Mother, I'm sorry.

913
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,290
It's my fault.

914
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,370
Look. I've married into the Xu Family

915
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,140
for so long.

916
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,270
But I haven't had a child yet.

917
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,520
If I could give birth to a child

918
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,610
for our family like Mrs. Qiu,

919
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,930
my mother wouldn't have been so worried.

920
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,680
Well...

921
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,750
Why are you crying?

922
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,300
Look. It's all my fault.

923
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,190
I shouldn't have talked about my grandson.

924
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,450
Calm down. Just calm down.

925
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,090
Every family has its own problems.

926
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,300
No one's life is easy.

927
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,540
Let's play mahjong.

928
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,050
Alright. Stop crying. Let's play mahjong.

929
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,490
Hello.

930
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,480
Is this the Fragrant Aromatic Tea Shop?

931
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:53,920
Yes.

932
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,670
Please give me a portion of

933
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:56,530
each kind of tea in your shop.

934
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,050
I'll take them away.

935
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,180
Okay. Wait a moment.

936
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,000
Hello.

937
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,230
Do you have any speciality snacks here?

938
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:02,910
Yes.

939
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,830
Give me a portion of each kind of

940
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,890
snack in your shop.

941
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,630
Yes.

942
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,950
Give me a portion, too.

943
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,560
Okay.

944
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,690
Ladies, please have a seat.

945
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:12,550
-I'll bring them for you right now.
-Let's sit down.

946
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,790
What flavor of milk tea do you want to drink?

947
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,690
Here's your milk tea.

948
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,040
Thank you, Ma'am.

949
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:17,550
Bye.

950
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,270
Thank you.

951
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,330
Ping'er.

952
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,310
Sister.

953
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,970
I can't believe that there are so many customers.

954
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,300
You're really amazing.

955
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,680
I guess Mrs. Qiu

956
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,810
did some publicity for me.

957
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,430
People came here

958
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,080
just for her sake.

959
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,420
In a few days,

960
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,630
maybe the business will be bad.

961
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,710
It won't.

962
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,620
The milk tea you made is so delicious.

963
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,290
They will definitely come back

964
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,820
to buy your products again.

965
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,910
You're right.

966
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,710
Come and help me.

967
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,310
I'm so busy.

968
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,840
Let's go.

969
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:47,800
I've heard that

970
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,530
the desserts here

971
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,550
are very delicious.

972
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,100
Really?

973
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,080
Which one is good?

974
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,290
Green Bean Cakes and Red Bean Cakes.

975
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,050
And Furong Cakes, too.

976
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,480
This is their speciality.

977
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,680
It's very delicious.

978
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,040
Dear customers, please have a seat first.

979
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,730
I'll come serve you later.

980
00:37:58,730 --> 00:37:59,720
Hurry up.

981
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,490
Okay.

982
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,270
Here are your desserts.

983
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,930
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

984
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,330
This milk tea is our speciality.

985
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,080
Please taste it.

986
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
It smells so good.

987
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,110
I want a cup of

988
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,440
Mashed Taro Bubble Tea.

989
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,270
Why are you here?

990
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,030
I...

991
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,200
You came at the right time.

992
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,380
Help me take these cakes

993
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,210
to that table.

994
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,310
Be careful not to drop them.

995
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,800
Okay.

996
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,490
Hello, what milk tea would you like?

997
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,950
I want that Mashed Taro Bubble Tea.

998
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,550
Sir, here are your desserts.

999
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,830
Taste them to see if they're delicious.

1000
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:28,430
If you think they're delicious,

1001
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,970
recommend them to your relatives and friends.

1002
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,510
Okay.

1003
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,690
Enjoy yourselves.

1004
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,610
Alright.

1005
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,280
Take these two cups of milk tea to that table.

1006
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,380
Be careful. They're a bit hot.

1007
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,350
Tell them to drink the tea while it's still hot

1008
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:38,910
as it'll taste good in this way.

1009
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,260
Okay.

1010
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,580
What would you like?

1011
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,980
Come on, dear customers.

1012
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,920
Drink the tea while it's still hot.

1013
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,730
What is this?

1014
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,010
This one is for you.

1015
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,700
It's called "Wish You Prosperity".

1016
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,710
Young Master Xu, thank you

1017
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,370
for your guidance these days.

1018
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,390
I didn't help much.

1019
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,610
Ladies, your takeaway drinks are ready.

1020
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,210
-Thank you.
-Enjoy yourselves.

1021
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,070
I'm really so busy with the business

1022
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,610
in my shop.

1023
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,950
I really can't handle it.

1024
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,550
I really need to hire one more person to help me.

1025
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,510
I guess next year,

1026
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,710
I can open another branch store.

1027
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,580
I've even decided what its name should be.

1028
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,080
I'll name it Scented Aromatic Tea Shop.

1029
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,490
Then I'll hire some

1030
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,390
versatile

1031
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,670
and eloquent waiters.

1032
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,230
Drink it while it's still hot.

1033
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,170
I have to get back to work.

1034
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,450
You should get back to work, too.

1035
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,420
Here are your desserts.

1036
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1037
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,780
Okay.

1038
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,580
Here's your milk tea. Drink it while it's still hot.
