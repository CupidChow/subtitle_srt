[Episode 2]

4
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:39,870
Ms. Jia.

5
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,310
Madam.

6
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,450
Inform the elders of our clan

7
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,470
to come over.

8
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:44,780
Yes.

9
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:45,720
Well.

10
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,810
This...

11
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,710
Isn't it just getting married?

12
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:51,729
Within three days,

13
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:53,729
I will definitely bring back a wife.

14
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,270
Zilu.

15
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,670
What are you talking about in anger?

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,170
I am not speaking in anger.

17
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,539
Three days is fine.

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,530
If you fail to marry within three days,

19
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,140
even if you kneel until the floor wears through,

20
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,400
I won't change my mind.

21
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,080
Alright.

22
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,710
Three days it is.

23
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,160
I'll choose the person.

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,770
That'll be great.

25
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
But if you dare play any tricks

26
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,730
to deceive me,

27
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,620
don't blame me for not considering our mother-son bond.

28
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,490
Aren't you leaving?

29
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,020
Go ahead.

30
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,160
Sister-in-law, you have a way.

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,820
I didn't expect it to work.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,490
He's still a bit inexperienced

33
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,820
to be competing with me.

34
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,900
I don't want to be like this.

35
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,940
But look,

36
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,020
if I didn't push him a bit,

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,090
he wouldn't have changed his mind.

38
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:48,990
But

39
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,829
can he really find

40
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,520
a suitable marriage partner within three days?

41
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,050
I have my own plan for that.

42
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
Besides,

43
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,320
if he can't

44
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,630
handle this well,

45
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,540
he shouldn't get involved

46
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,070
in the royal family's mess.

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,180
Third Brother, have a seat.

48
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,590
Young Master.

49
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,140
Young Master.

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,480
You acted impulsively.

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,030
Young Master, you were too impulsive!

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,570
Young Master, you were too impulsive!

53
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,630
How could you agree

54
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,100
to get married within three days?

55
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,760
Where are you going

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
to find someone in three days?

57
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,290
Can you stop pacing?

58
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:22,550
Yes.

59
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,829
If you can't find anyone,

60
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,870
how are you going to explain it to the Old Madam?

61
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,329
I'll use you as a stand-in.

62
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,790
Fine.

63
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,390
Get lost!

64
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:31,970
Come back!

65
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,110
Young Master.

66
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:36,880
I know.

67
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,960
Even though you say

68
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,170
you dislike me,

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,150
in your most helpless moments,

70
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,270
you still want me

71
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,310
to stand firmly by your side, right?

72
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,750
Can you stop talking nonsense?

73
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,150
Help me think of a way.

74
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,350
I've already said the words.

75
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,990
Don't worry, Young Master.

76
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,750
Your business

77
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,880
is my business.

78
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,079
Don't worry.

79
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,360
I guarantee that within three days,

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,150
I'll help you overcome this difficulty

81
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,500
and find a Young Madam.

82
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,110
I know.

83
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,310
Every morning at this time,

84
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:11,990
he always takes a sedan chair

85
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,940
from Xiangyun Street to Xianghua Garden.

86
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,530
You can tell it's Young Master Xu's sedan chair

87
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,769
by the scent of the agarwood.

88
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,269
Alright, Xianghua Garden.

89
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:18,990
What?

90
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,050
It's just rained lightly,

91
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,740
the flowers haven't bloomed yet.

92
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,160
Why would he go to Xianghua Garden every day?

93
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,790
I haven't seen him for three days.

94
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,770
I figure around this time,

95
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,180
he should be at the Tongfu Tavern in the East Market.

96
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:26,590
No.

97
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,130
It's Xianghua Garden.

98
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,710

99
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,180

101
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,410
It's Xianghua Garden.

102
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:31,910
What are you talking about?

103
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,650

This jade only exists in the heavens,

106
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,750
and there's only one piece on earth.

107
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,470
Young Master, keep it close,

108
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,310
and within three days,

109
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,030
you're sure to find a good match.

110

Young Master, put it on now.

113
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,770
The sooner you wear it,

114
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,900
the better your chances for marriage.

115
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,240
Forget it.

116
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,190
No, Young Master.

117
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,240
At this point,

118
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,130
you might as well give it a try.

119
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,220
Do you still want to get married or not?

120
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,870
Hurry.

121
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,230
Young Master.

122
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,910
Why does this feel so unreliable?

123
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:09,670
It's reliable.

124
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,980
Just take it.

125
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,170
This is great.

Love will bring you together.

I’ve heard the news.

132
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,550
Now, forget about being an Imperial Merchant.

133
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,120
you might not even be able to keep your position

134
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,180

135
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,740
What's wrong with you?

136
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,550
The humiliation you gave me when we were kids,

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,230
I’m about to

138
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,150
pay it back now.

139
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,220
Do you think I’ll miss this chance?

140
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,310
But,

141
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,159
if you kneel down respectfully

142
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,380
and say to me,

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,770
"Brother.

144
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,350
I was wrong."

145
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,080
I might consider leaving you alone.

146
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,950
I forgive you.

147
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,770
You...

148
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,750
You might be heartless, but I can't be unrighteous.

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,570

150
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,840

This plaque is well-made.

155
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,710
There’s a heavy reward for it.

156
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,550
Wang Zhujue, are you just bored?

157
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,430
Young Master Wang, can you act like a decent human being?

158
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,040
My Young Master

159
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,400
has had a really hard time.

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,670
Since this morning,

161
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,730
we've seen five matchmakers

162
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,670
and six fortune tellers.

163
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,860
Next, we still have to see a doctor.

164
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,530
My Young Master...

165
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,060
So you're the one with the smooth tongue, huh?

166
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,920
You're even going to see a doctor?

167
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,690
Let's go.

168
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,550
He's seeing a doctor.

169
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,480
We have some dignity to uphold too.

170
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,970
Young Master Xu.

171
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,110
Move aside.

172
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,110
Go away.

Come and take a look.

176
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,240
Young Master Xu.

177
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,270
Excuse me.

178
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,560
Young Master Xu.

179
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,460
Let's go.

182
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,220

183
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,390
She left.

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:08,870
Let's go.

Young Master.

186
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,030
You didn't take the jade pendant.

187
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:12,920
Why do I need it?

188
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,820
What kind of thing is that, anyway?

189
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,930
That jade pendant signifies a heaven-sent match.

190
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,580
It means

191
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,330
you’ll have

192
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,510
a good wife in the future.

193
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,770
This represents love.

194
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,350
Looks like I’m going to have a good marriage now.

195
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,950
Yes.

196
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,630
Do you think this jade pendant really works?

197
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,670
Of course.

198
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,420
You saw how convincing that master was.

199
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,310
Could she be the heaven-sent match?

200
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,310
Your heaven-sent match is over there.

201
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,600
My good marriage.

202
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,070
Maybe the two of them are meant to be together.

203
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,990
I’ve wasted

204
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,470
an entire morning with you.

205
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,270
Young Master.

206
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,610
All of these cost money.

207
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,590
This...

208
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,540
Well.

209
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,170
They weren't cheap.

210
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,070
Young Master.

211
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,200
Young Master.

212
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,770
Isn’t our approach here to err

213
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,030
on the side of caution?

214
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,160
And seeking divine guidance

215
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,350
is only the first step.

216
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,740
Look.

217
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,590
I’ve already found

218
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,610
a famous doctor hiding in the city

219
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,760
who specializes in treating difficult cases like yours.

220
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,600
His appointments are booked

221
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,350
until after the New Year.

222
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,170
I paid a hefty price

223
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,120
to get us in.

224
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,400
Don't worry, Young Master.

225
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,950
This time, it’s sure to work.

226
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,480
Let's go.

227
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,560
Shall we go?

228
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,470
Okay.

229
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,550
Let’s go.

230
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,790
[Liu Family's Pharmacy]

231
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,240
Young Master, that girl isn't following us.

232
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:25,870
Hurry up.

233
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,970
Young Master.

234
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,940
You should take this with you.

235
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,950
The doctor said

236
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,500
that the remains of this ancient fierce beast

237
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,850
can help you renew

238
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,350
within an hour,

239
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,159
making you fearless of women.

240
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,690
I think he made a good point.

241
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,669
Sir, care to take a look at some storybooks?

242
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:41,900
Okay.

243
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,630
Where is he?

244
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,770
He ran fast.

245
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,590
Young Master.

246
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,210
-What about I brew it for you?
-I found you finally.

247
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:56,890
I’ve been looking for you for half the day.

248
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,890
My legs are practically worn out from running around.

249
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,670
Why are you like

250
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,290
a stubborn bandage

251
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,310
that I can’t shake off?

252
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,050
Young Master Xu,

253
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,600
I have something to discuss with you.

254
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,370
Every time I come to you,

255
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,570
I barely get a word in.

256
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,440
You should have said so earlier.

257
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,260
You’re here to treat hemorrhoids, huh?

258
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,520
I know a great pharmacy

259
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,140
I can recommend to you.

260
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,230
This place won't work.

261
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,310
They're just a bunch of swindlers.

262
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:14,840
Their medicine is useless.

263
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,080
Hemo...

264
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,300
I don’t...

265
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,510
Fuding!

266
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,330
Well...

267
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,290
No, this...

268
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,070
It's like this.

269
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,180
How could my Young Master

270
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,040
possibly have that kind of illness?

271
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,880
Absolutely not.

272
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,810
Absolutely not.

273
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,170
It's okay. I understand.

274
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,830
Nine out of ten men have it.

275
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,360
I have a very effective remedy.

276
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:37,840
I'll give it to you later.

277
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,100
Okay.

278
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,720
No need.

279
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:39,990
Thank you.

280
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:40,990
I...

281
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,940
Don’t follow me.

282
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,840
Young Master Xu, I...

283
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,390
Miss.

284
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,190
Haven’t you noticed that my Young Master

285
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,930
doesn't want to talk to you?

286
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,430
If you keep doing this,

287
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,590
we’ll report you to the authorities.

288
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,260
Young Master Xu,

289
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,720
I really have something to discuss with you.

290
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,440
Discuss?

291
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,270
Is this how you discuss something?

292
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,280
You’re being rude and completely insincere.

293
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,810
Think it over and come back when you’re ready.

294
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,340
Sincerity.

295
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,310
Sincerity?

296
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,430
Sincerity.

297
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,910
It smells good. Sister.

298
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,610
Let me have a taste.

299
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,570
There’s not enough to sell anyway.

300
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,380
But you can’t eat any.

301
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,090
These are

302
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,770
all meant to be given as gifts.

303
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,870
Gifts?

304
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,130
Who are you giving them to?

305
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,590
And who are you giving them away for free to?

306
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,760
You’re not planning to give them to Xu Zilu, are you?

307
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,230
In business,

308
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,540
it’s better to be generous with gifts.

309
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,640
Giving victory cakes to others

310
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,780
means giving victory

311
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,990
to them, right?

312
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,150
Then

313
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,370
you’re definitely losing.

314
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,170
Young Master.

315
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,100
Tomorrow is the last day.

316
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,320
We've tried

317
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,230
all the methods we could.

318
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:19,680
Well.

319
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,390
The key thing is to find a girl.

320
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,990
If there's no other choice, Young Master,

321
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,280
give me a general direction.

322
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,710
I

323
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,670
can at least help you find someone.

324
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,460
First,

325
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,130
she shouldn’t be interested in my Xu family background.

326
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,140
Not interested in the Xu family background.

327
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,630
Second,

328
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,380
she shouldn’t be clingy.

329
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,910
Miss Tao will do.

330
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:37,760
Third,

331
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,060
she shouldn't be interested in me.

332
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,030
Young Master.

333
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,530
The third requirement is too difficult to meet.

334
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,790
You won’t find such a person

335
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,310
even if you search

336
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,440
for three years, let alone three days.

337
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,510
In my opinion,

338
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,530
Miss Tao is quite good.

339
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,070
She’s beautiful,

340
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,350
well-educated, and refined.

341
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,210
You might as well discuss with her.

342
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,890
She might agree to sleep

343
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,950
in separate rooms.

344
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,200
You go sleep in separate rooms with her.

345
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
Young Master, it’s already this time.

346
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
Time waits for no one.

347
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,950
I suggest

348
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:03,650
that we directly invite Miss Tao tomorrow

349
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,570
and have an honest

350
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,810
and open discussion.

351
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,650
Who knows, she might agree.

352
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,360
Young Master.

353
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,080
Just give it a try.

354
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,140
Even if she doesn't agree,

355
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,130
we can always look for another target.

356
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:14,590
Right?

357
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,780
Young Master, how can you know

358
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,410
if you don’t try?

359
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,050
Forget it.

360
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,710
Don't stop.

361
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,550
Go to the Tao Mansion and send an invitation

362
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,310
and ask Miss Tao to meet in the East Market tomorrow.

363
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:25,840
Alright.

364
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,660
Step back.

365
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,310
Step back.

366
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,660
Make way.

367
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:39,550
What a scene.

368
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,370
Young Master.

369
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,610
This is for you.

370
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,220
Young Master.

371
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,420
You can do it. Come on.

372
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,610
Zilu.

373
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,820
My Young Master is shy.

374
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,230
Zilu.

375
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,490
Do you have something

376
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,250
to tell me?

377
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,670
Miss Tao,

378
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,370
-If we get married...
-Mr. Xu.

379
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,550
Who are you?

380
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,950
Where did you come from?

381
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,070
I apologize.

382
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,790
Mr. Xu.

383
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,830
I... I think you might

384
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,040
not know me very well.

385
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,210
Let me introduce myself again.

386
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,780
I know you. You’re a maid from the Ling family.

387
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,940
I’m not a maid from the Ling family.

388
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,160
I’m the eldest young lady of the Ling family.

389
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,290
You misunderstood.

390
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,200
You?

391
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,350
The eldest young lady?

392
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,630
A few days ago,

393
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,680
I might have offended you.

394
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,110
But after I went back,

395
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,110
I made a complete turnaround.

396
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,230
I deeply regretted my actions.

397
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,790
I reflected on myself.

398
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,510
So,

399
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,110
hearing that you love sweets,

400
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,680
I specially made these victory cakes

401
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,480
for you to try.

402
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,480
Who told you I like sweets?

403
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,840
This is for girls.

404
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,730
I don't want it.

405
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,820
Young Master Xu.

406
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,030
I made it really delicious.

407
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,710
Try it.

408
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,030
Will you stop?

409
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,810
Listen,

410
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,150
Zilu and I

411
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,670
love each other.

412
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,780
We are going to

413
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,960
get married soon.

414
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,690
You

415
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,420
have no chance.

416
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,820
I... I know

417
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,730
you’re about to get married.

418
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,980
Congratulations to both of you.

419
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,950
But I really have something important

420
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,080
to discuss with your esteemed fiancé.

421
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,510
I spent an entire night

422
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,630
making this.

423
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,340
I watched the timing closely.

424
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,530
I was afraid it would turn out poorly

425
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,790
if I missed the timing.

426
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,810
I simmered it for a full two hours.

427
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,350
How could you do this?

428
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,350
Young Master.

429
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
That was too much.

430
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,920
I didn’t do it on purpose.

431
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,780
To save time,

432
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,220
I used the best flour.

433
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,950
It cost me 210 coins.

434
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,810
And the red beans were also top quality.

435
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,210
That cost me 350 coins.

436
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,650
The osmanthus flowers were picked by me personally.

437
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,380
I spent as much as two cash on it.

438
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,290
I even added a special ingredient

439
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,190
of brown sugar.

440
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,080
That cost me one tael and 32 coins.

441
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,670
Altogether, after rounding,

442
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,440
it’s worth about

443
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,350
one tael, eight cash, and 92 coins.

444
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,590
This is all the wealth

445
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,740
I have.

446
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,370
And you wasted it

447
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,010
just like that.

448
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,670
How can you speak about

449
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,750
Zilu like this?

450
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,680
It’s just money.

451
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,250
What’s the big deal about wasting it?

452
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,490
Do you think everyone

453
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,570
is as stingy as you?

454
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,120
Do you think everyone is like you?

455
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,350
Who would like

456
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,780
this vulnerable “Zilu”?

457
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,800
He’s like a paper doll.

458
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
He can’t even be touched.

459
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,770
I, Ling Se, have sworn.

460
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,170
I will never marry in this lifetime.

461
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,240
I won’t rely on a man.

462
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,370
And I will never like someone like him.

463
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,330
Listen.

464
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,590
I don't want your shop anymore.

465
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,090
But just wait.

466
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,350
No matter what store

467
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,590
they open in that shop,

468
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,270
I’ll make sure

469
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,740
it goes out of business.

470
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,030
This girl is not bad.

471
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,520
She’s quite a fighter.

472
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,110
Back off!

473
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,530
Back off!

474
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,060
Back off!

475
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,910
As for you...

476
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,140
Go away.

477
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:22,930
Fuding.

478
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,180
Young Master.

479
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,840
Help me with something later.

480
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,000
What is it?

481
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,350
[Ling Mansion]

482
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,510
Why have you been drinking so much?

483
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,710
Come on.

484
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:49,650
Look carefully.

485
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,710
I'm your daughter.

486
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,470
Daughter?

487
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,670
Yes.

488
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,240
I have another daughter.

489
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,430
You...

490
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,300
You...

491
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,579
You’re just like

492
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,910
your lowly

493
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,910
mother.

494
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,130
How unlucky.

495
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,420
How unlucky.

496
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,099
Master Ling, if that’s the case,

497
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,500
then why did you marry her

498
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,660
and have such an

499
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,150
unlucky daughter like me?

500
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,390
Why?

501
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,569
For her dowry, of course.

502
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,660
Otherwise,

503
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,300
would I have what I have today?

504
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,620
What are you trying to do?

505
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,610
Do you want to hit your own father?

506
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,030
You don’t know

507
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,960
how to properly honor your father.

508
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,170
You even want to rebel against me.

509
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,000
I’ll beat you to death.

510
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,100
Honor?

511
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,820
I think even a copper coin

512
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,880
is too much for you.

513
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,380
A father like you,

514
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,100
I’d be better off without.

515
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,310
Come back here.

516
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,030
Come back, you...

517
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:09,870
Yes.

518
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,720
I’m talking about Miss Ling.

519
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,810
What I’m saying is...

520
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,810
Actually, who it is doesn’t matter.

521
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,810
You don’t need to

522
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,290
make up lies to deceive me.

523
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,430
Whether he is ill or taking a new wife

524
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,360
doesn't matter.

525
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,390
What matters is

526
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,030
how much sincerity he has.

527
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,630
So, Mrs. Ling, how much

528
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,500
do you think is appropriate?

529
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:33,950
50?

530
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,750
500?

531
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,790
Isn't 500 taels

532
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,720
a bit too much?

533
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,790
How about making it a little less so I can earn something?

534
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,650
Just 500 taels.

535
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,780
Even a penny less would be a loss for me.

536
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,180
As long as the money is in place,

537
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,970
you can

538
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,500
take her away tonight.

539
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,450
Alright, deal.

540
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,630
Sister, Mother sold you.

541
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,920
She said she’s sending you over tonight.

542
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,810
Hurry up and leave.

543
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,870
Otherwise, it’ll really be too late.

544
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,580
What kind of trap are you

545
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,640
setting for me now?

546
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:38,730
Se.

547
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,630
Se.

548
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,350
Se, are you back?

549
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,840
Shuo?

550
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,410
What are you doing here?

551
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,270
Mother.

552
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,100
I...

553
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,430
Madam, why are you here?

554
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,910
My dear Se.

555
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,300
Look, you've lost weight.

556
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,640
It breaks my heart to see you like this.

557
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,790
I had the kitchen prepare a feast.

558
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,530
I specially asked them to stew a black chicken

559
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,630
to help you regain your strength.

560
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,070
Let's go.

561
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,270
Let's have a nice family meal together.

562
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,110
I just came back from outside.

563
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,200
My clothes are dirty.

564
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,490
Why don’t you both go ahead?

565
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,550
I’ll change first.

566
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,550
It's okay. I'll wait for you.

567
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,030
Mother.

568
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,110
I'm hungry.

569
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,760
Can I go and have some food first?

570
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,260
Let's wait for her in the front hall.

571
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,030
Look at you.

572
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:25,930
Can't you wait?

573
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,470
Mother.

574
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,810
Let’s go ahead.

575
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,240
If we stay here,

576
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,960
it's inconvenient for Se to change.

577
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,530
Okay.

578
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,830
Then hurry up. I’ll wait for you.

579
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,360
Let's go.

580
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,380
Mother, let's go.

581
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,270
Hurry!

582
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,070
Look at you.

583
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,210
Look how anxious you are.

584
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,010
I'm starving.

585
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,060
Eldest Miss!

586
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,840
Eldest Miss has run away.

587
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,720
Eldest Miss!

588
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,060
Eldest Miss!

589
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,170
Eldest Miss!

590
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,130
Help!

591
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,550
Eldest Miss has run away.

592
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,750
Eldest Miss!

593
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,510
Go check over there.

594
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:08,840
Okay.

595
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,600
Eldest Miss.

596
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,030
Eldest Miss!

597
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,670
Over there.

598
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:18,880
Eldest Miss!

599
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,290
Eldest Miss.

600
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,450
What’s going on?

601
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,440
What’s going on?

602
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,440
Who are you?

603
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,560
Miss Ling?

604
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,200
What are you doing here?

605
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,130
Come and help me.

606
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay.

607
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,010
I came here today

608
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,670
to...

609
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,290
Search!

610
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,480
If you can't find her tonight,

611
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,960
you will all suffer.

612
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,250
Understood.

613
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,730
Well,

614
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:03,830
I'll give you five coins.

615
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,730
No more than five coins.

616
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,420
Take me away.

617
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,100
Eldest Miss!

618
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,940
Hurry up.

619
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,730
Okay.

620
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,270
Where did she go?

621
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,220
Hurry up. Get on.

622
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,550
Eldest Miss!

623
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,430
Hurry up.

624
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,290
Okay.

625
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,480
What's going on?

626
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,300
I put the stool here for nothing.

627
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Is she over there?

628
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,780
No. Check over here.

629
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,460
Eldest Miss!

630
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,380
Eldest Miss!

631
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,970
So easy?

632
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,950
Eldest Miss!

633
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,630
Bro.

634
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,290
No one is chasing us from behind, right?

635
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,150
Don't worry. I'm good at driving.

636
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,230
Thank you.

637
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,120
You're welcome.

638
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,920
It’s just that

639
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:44,120
we have a good understanding, isn’t that right, Young Madam?

640
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,850
Young Madam?

641
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,770
Who is the Young Madam?

642
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:48,980
Don’t you know that the Young Master

643
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,780
is here to pick you up,

644
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,650
so you were in such a hurry

645
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,580
to leave with me?

646
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,050
I was in a hurry?

647
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,570
I was...

648
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,030
Don't worry, Young Madam.

649
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,020
I will make sure

650
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,950
you get safely to the Young Master.

651
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,010
Why is the Young Madam asleep?

652
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
Where am I?

653
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,940
Why does my head hurt so much?

654
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,470
What a treasure.

655
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,290
Such a large piece of jade.

656
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,000
My goodness.

657
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,690
What a waste to use such fine jade

658
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,390
as a stand.

659
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:07,880
Young Madam.

660
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,690
What are you doing with this incense burner stand?

661
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,690
Isn't it heavy?

662
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,750
Young Madam?

663
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,510
You...

664
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,840
I recognize you.

665
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,710
You are the driver

666
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,870
who kidnapped me earlier.

667
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,330
Tell me.

668
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,990
Where am I?

669
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,030
This is...

670
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,360
Young Master.

671
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,790
Xu Zilu?

672
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,330
I should have known it was you.

673
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,790
Don't come over.

674
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,060
I have a weapon.

675
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,980
You'd better put that down.

676
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,320
It’s worth a hundred taels.

677
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,580
If you break it, you’ll have to pay for it.

678
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,310
You do have a good eye.

679
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,540
This item costs 50 taels each.

680
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,010
But they are sold in pairs.

681
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:53,540
If you break one, you’ll have to pay for a pair.

682
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,070
Are you just burning money?

683
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,320
Why spend so much

684
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,510
on these things?

685
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,060
The world of the wealthy

686
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,010
is ridiculous.

687
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,960
Can we talk this out?

688
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,730
Who wants to talk to you?

689
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,600
Heartless bird, stinky fox.

690
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,710
If I trust you again,

691
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,040
I'll take your surname.

692
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,500
You might really end up with my surname.

693
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,520
[Marriage Letter]

694
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,280
Your mother has already betrothed you to me.

695
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,580
You proposed the marriage?

696
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,310
Look for yourself.

697
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,500
Xu Zilu, are you crazy?

698
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:33,940
After tonight,

699
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,610
I would have turned 18

700
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,950
and left the Ling family.

701
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:36,800
And now,

702
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,190
you’ve ruined

703
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:38,990
all my plans.

704
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,060
I, Ling Se, will never marry.

705
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,870
And I certainly won’t marry you.

706
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,830
This is troublesome.

707
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,700
Your mother has already taken

708
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,710
500 taels from me.

709
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,050
That money-hungry woman.

710
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,880
She’d love nothing more than to sell me off quickly.

711
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,590
She can’t make decisions about this.

712
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,560
I’m not willing.

713
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,190
What?

714
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,510
Do you want to forcibly take a common girl?

715
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,590
Let me tell you.

716
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,700
I’m not one of those

717
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,810
easily manipulated young ladies

718
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,580
kept in the house.

719
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,930
I have to leave tonight.

720
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,880
Otherwise, you’ll have to kill me.

721
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,230
I’ll give you the shop.

722
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,350
Do you take me for a fool?

723
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,230
Plus 500 taels.

724
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,950
You’re really giving me the shop?

725
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,880
How much is the interest?

726
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,610
Can it be paid in installments?

727
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,440
No need to pay.

728
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,940
It’s a gift to you.

729
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,170
Plus 500 taels.

730
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,650
Isn’t that a guaranteed profit?

731
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,810
Stop scaring me.

732
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,160
There’s no such thing

733
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,360
as a guaranteed profit in this world.

734
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,730
So, what are the terms?

735
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,720
You’re smart.

736
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,650
The terms are

737
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,670
that you and I will be married for a year.

738
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,350
But you must ensure

739
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,630
no one knows the truth.

740
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,210
After a year, we’ll part ways

741
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,740
amicably.

742
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,730
Why me?

743
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,120
Because you don’t want to marry,

744
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,920
and I don’t want to marry either.

745
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,390
But my mother

746
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,210
is pressing too hard.

747
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,540
I really have no choice.

748
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,220
As long as you can play the role of my wife well,

749
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,890
I guarantee

750
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
the shop and money

751
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,130
will be yours after a year.

752
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,590
What if I refuse?

753
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,790
Then I can let you go.

754
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,810
But, Miss, you’re a smart person.

755
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,650
Didn’t you say you’d never marry

756
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,950
and wanted to set up your own business?

757
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,030
Can you afford a shop now?

758
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,070
Since you can’t afford it,

759
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,520
the Ling family will definitely

760
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,180
marry you off to someone else.

761
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,110
Even if you escape,

762
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,310
can you guarantee

763
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,510
they won’t catch you and bring you back?

764
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,750
If you receive

765
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,030
the protection of the Xu family,

766
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,770
after the divorce,

767
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,220
you will be truly free.

768
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,220
It’s all gain with no harm.

769
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,870
Hold on.

770
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:02,610
Ling Se.

771
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,830
You absolutely

772
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,920
must not laugh now.

773
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,850
Not just gain,

774
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,460
but tremendous gain.

775
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:12,700
Stay calm.

776
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,090
Stay calm.

777
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,560
Heaven is truly opening its eyes.

778
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,360
I’ll offer extra incense to you

779
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,140
in the future,

780
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,270
the expensive kind.

781
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,440
What do you think?

782
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,460
Do you provide meals?

783
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,480
I’ll cover food, clothing,

784
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,290
and living expenses.

785
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,220
Deal!

786
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,540
I forgot that you can’t shake hands.

787
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,550
It would be a handshake of peace.

788
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,020
Rest assured.

789
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,770
I’m absolutely worth the investment.

790
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,340
Alright.

791
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,520
Starting tomorrow,

792
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,790
you’ll be my wife.

793
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:54,850
Remember,

794
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,800
you must not let anyone,

795
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,070
especially my mother,

796
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,270
see any flaw.

797
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,670
Otherwise, the contract will be immediately voided,

798
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,040
and you’ll get nothing.

799
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,250
I understand.

800
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,160
It’s just role-playing, right?

801
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,090
I’m good at this.

802
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,040
I’ve seen it all before

803
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,620
when I worked

804
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,580
in the theater.

805
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,830
There are just

806
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,110
a few types of couples.

807
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,470
The loving couple.

808
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,620
The one with affairs.

809
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,790
The one with different intentions.

810
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,910
The bickering couple.

811
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,850
Which one do you want?

812
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,910
I can be any of them.

813
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,070
Then

814
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,090
you should rest early.

815
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,250
Wait.

816
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,470
Sorry.

817
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,560
I'm still not very skilled at this.

818
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,840
Young Master Xu.

819
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,330
Words alone are not enough.

820
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,390
Do we need a written agreement?

821
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,080
Don’t worry about that.

822
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,900
I'm a man of my word.

823
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,280
Besides,

824
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,070
this money isn’t a significant amount

825
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,070
for the Xu family.

826
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,470
I won’t deceive you.

827
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,310
It’s not that I don’t trust you.

828
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,750
I don’t trust myself.

829
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,760
How about this?

830
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,520
Here.

831
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,830
Here.

832
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,580
I don’t think a written agreement is necessary.

833
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,160
I think it’s very necessary.

834
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,910
This is to protect

835
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,840
your interests.

836
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,510
Then you write it.

837
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,300
But I can’t…

838
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,070
I...

839
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,160
I’m not used to this calligraphy brush.

840
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,150
Put it over there.

841
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,150
Bring me the ink.

842
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,290
I’ll grind the ink.

843
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,240
[Agreement]

844
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,490
How is it?

845
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,080
Not bad, Young Master.

846
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,470
Remember,

847
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,000
this matter must not be disclosed

848
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,030
to anyone.

849
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,110
Don't worry.

850
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,630
My lips are sealed.

851
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:14,890
If I find out

852
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,190
this information leaked from your mouth,

853
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,640
you’ll never speak again.

854
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,860
Don’t, Young Master.

855
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,530
I still want to marry a wife.

856
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,110
But Young Master,

857
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,570
you’re really something.

858
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,440
Young Madam

859
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,500
looks shrewed.

860
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,860
I didn’t expect her to agree so quickly.

861
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,140
Because I wrote her

862
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,100
an agreement.

863
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,850
But Young Master,

864
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:36,610
didn’t you say

865
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,360
there should be

866
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,430
no evidence of this?

867
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,110
If it’s used by someone with ill intentions,

868
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,330
it’s a crime of deceiving the emperor.

869
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,530
You will be beheaded.

870
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,510
It's fake.

871
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:45,990
Young...

872
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,430
Young...

873
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,780
Young...

874
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:53,560
Young...

875
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,330
Pay me back!

876
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,470
Stop pretending.

877
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,390
I gave you

878
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,680
five coins today

879
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,490
fo you to drive the carriage

880
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,690
to bring me here.

881
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,060
Young madams from other families

882
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,250
give rewards.

883
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,930
Why are you taking money back?

884
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,400
You didn't do anything good.

885
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
Rewards? It should be a penalty.

886
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,830
I shouldn’t be short

887
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,270
even a coin.

888
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,560
If it’s not my money,

889
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,210
I don't want even a coin more.

890
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,390
Mr. Xu.

891
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,880
Darling.

892
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,030
I'm leaving.

893
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,720
She's really a money-grubber.

894
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,650
I thought she had overheard us.

895
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,070
I'll make it up for you.

896
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,540
That'll be good.

897
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm short five coins.

898
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,470
Go.

899
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:57,080
Let go of me!

900
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,610
Hurry up!

901
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,330
What are you doing? Let go of me!

902
00:32:59,330 --> 00:32:59,790
You...

903
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,280
Get out.

904
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,470
Leave now.

905
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,930
No one will keep you here.

906
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,830
Where did you

907
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,900
sell my young lady?

908
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,540
I don't believe she'll get married.

909
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,500
Believe it or not.

910
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,030
Listen.

911
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,350
Just leave when I tell you to.

912
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,340
Curfew is about to start.

913
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,400
If you don't leave,

914
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,450
when you get caught by the officials,

915
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,830
don't say I didn't remind you.

916
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,790
I don't believe it.

917
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,270
I won't believe a word.

918
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,780
Open the door!

919
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,950
Open the door!

920
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:28,900
Young Master.

921
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,030
It’s already curfew.

922
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,470
Why did you come out?

923
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,410
If Master knows,

924
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,490
he will scold you again.

925
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,490
What do you know?

926
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,890
My classmates all said

927
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,580
they drank the midnight wine

928
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,660
at the Fulai Inn.

929
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,660
I’ve already been left behind.

930
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,100
But

931
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,400
breaking curfew means a penalty.

932
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,070
If the night patrol catches you,

933
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:44,780
the Master will definitely

934
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,580
be furious and bedridden again.

935
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:47,980
What do you know?

936
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,880
Look at you.

937
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,950
Fine.

938
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,670
Return to the mansion and wait for me.

939
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,330
-Okay.
-Go.

940
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,190
At this hour,

941
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,070
who else can I find?

942
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,230
Are you here for the midnight wine too?

943
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,840
I’m a person.

944
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,520
Be careful not to attract the officials.

945
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,690
Young Master.

946
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,710
You are...

947
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,460
Who's there?

948
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,070
Stop!

949
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,350
Run!

950
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:21,980
Stop!

951
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,290
Chase them.

952
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,989
Stop!

953
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,590
Stop!

954
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,699
Over there!

955
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:30,870
Stop!

956
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:31,840
Go after them!

957
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,500
Over there!

958
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,670
I can't run anymore.

959
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,030
Stop!

960
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,710
Me, either.

961
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,170
Why didn't you stop?

962
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,650
You haven’t stopped either.

963
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,070
Stop!

964
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,330
If I stop and you don’t,

965
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,590
do you think I’m a fool?

966
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,360
Stop!

967
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,150
Here, here, here.

968
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,590
Stop!

969
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,610
Where are they?

970
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,310
Over there.

971
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,179
Go after them!

972
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:10,990
Young Master.

973
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,950
We should be safe now, right?

974
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,710
Don't worry.

975
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,140
As long as I’m here, we’re fine.

976
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,890
Even if they catch you,

977
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,920
my father

978
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,950
will get us out.

979
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,060
My father is the governor.

980
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,600
Your father is the governor?

981
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,600
My goodness.

982
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,580
Thank you, Young Master.

983
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,500
I’ll leave now.

984
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,100
Miss.

985
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,670
It’s the middle of the night, and the city is under curfew.

986
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,800
Where are you going?

987
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,230
Are you hungry?

988
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,270
I’ll take you to get something to eat.

989
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,570
Let's go.

990
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:00,920
Here.

991
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,210
Young Lady, which family are you from?

992
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,270
Why haven't I seen you in the academy?

993
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,110
I don't mean anything else.

994
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,820
I just wanted to

995
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,600
befriend you

996
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,270
since we went through this adventure

997
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,330
together tonight.

998
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,490
Have a seat.

999
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,040
Actually,

1000
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,310
I’m not a young lady.

1001
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,200
I’m a maid from the Ling family.

1002
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,450
Ling family?

1003
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,750
Which Ling family?

1004
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,520
The Ling family

1005
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,280
that runs a silk and satin shop.

1006
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,390
You mean Ling Shuo's family?

1007
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,510
Ling Shuo has a younger sister?

1008
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,510
Why didn't I know?

1009
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,370
He has an elder sister.

1010
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,110
I came out tonight

1011
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,830
specifically to find her.

1012
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,700
I’ll take you to find Ling Shuo

1013
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,910
first thing tomorrow morning.

1014
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,310
He will definitely know.

1015
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,630
Given our relationship,

1016
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,090
he will tell me for sure.

1017
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,100
Thank you.

1018
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,310
You're so nice.

1019
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,360
It’s nothing.

1020
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,720
Here, drink more water.

1021
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,760
Ping'er, what time is it?

1022
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,390
It’s time to set up the stall.

1023
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,850
Where's Ping'er?

1024
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:34,960
Just this set.

1025
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,790
Just this set.

1026
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,360
Just this set.

1027
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:36,990
Uncle.

1028
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,560
Alright.

1029
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,320
May I ask

1030
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,520
where Xu Zilu is?

1031
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,150
I need to talk to him urgently.

1032
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,790
My Young Master is over there.

1033
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,390
Thank you.

1034
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,620
You'd better not go.

1035
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:51,460
Young Master Xu.

1036
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,560
You’re being rude and disrupting public order.

1037
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,140
You’ve completely disgraced the Xu family.

1038
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,470
Are you busy?

1039
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,580
You can carry on.

1040
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,150
Don't go.

1041
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,330
Come in.

1042
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,390
What's going on?

1043
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,420
It’s exactly what you see.

1044
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,930
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1045
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,270
So, you’re the girl

1046
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,480
Zilu brought back?

1047
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,220
I am,

1048
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,750
am I?

1049
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,360
Are you asking me?

1050
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,270
I'm asking you.

1051
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,060
Mother.

1052
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,280
She just arrived at our mansion.

1053
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,450
She’s still not used to it.

1054
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,250
Let her rest for a couple of days.

1055
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,510
Stop right there.
