[Episode 10]

4
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,390
-Stop!
-Stop!

5
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,390
Don't move!

6
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,440
Well. Young Master.

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,650
I didn't see anything.

8
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,400
Go on.

9
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,150
Don't look.

10
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,420
I...

11
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,710
Well. You jumped at me.

12
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,690
Don't blame me.

13
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,050
I...

14
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,270
You bumped into me yourself.

15
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,400
-Well...
-Well...

16
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,260
You go first.

17
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,010
Well...

18
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,300
Don't worry.

19
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,160
Let's pretend

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,280
nothing happened.

21
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,590
Nothing...

22
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,020
Happened?

23
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,730
Or

24
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,510
consider it

25
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,580
a close contact between brothers.

26
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,350
Are you and your brother

27
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,360
are so casual?

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
This happened because of you.

29
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:11,950
Right.

30
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,110
I...

31
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,150
Then

32
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,720
consider it as an accident.

33
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,450
Brother.

34
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,370
Good night.

35
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,680
An accident?

36
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,910
Yes.

37
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,950
An accident.

38
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,740
Young Master.

39
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,829
I brought Chen Yun and Chen Bin

40
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,829
back to the study.

41
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,940
Xu Zilu is so scary.

42
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,270
Luckily, I ran fast.

43
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,170
He changed his attitude in the blink of an eye.

44
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,470
What's wrong with me lately?

45
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,750
Did I drink too much tea?

46
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,410
I won't drink it.

47
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,540
I'll rest early.

48
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:17,940
I'll give you

49
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,890
one last chance.

50
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,380
If you tell me the truth,

51
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,630
I'll let you go.

52
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,560
What's so bright?

53
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,790
Congratulations.

54
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,710
You triggered the rich golden coffin.

55
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,670
All the treasures inside...

56
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,290
Are all mine?

57
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,120
You can only choose one.

58
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,060
So stingy.

59
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,490
I'll close it if you think it's too little.

60
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,470
Don't.

61
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,870
One will do.

62
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,320
It's really gold.

63
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,450
I'm rich!

64
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,230
Have you kissed enough?

65
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,260
Where is my pig?

66
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,950
It was a dream.

67
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,830
Old Madam, have some tea.

68
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,909
There's a mole in the house.

69
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,640
I'm not in the mood to drink tea.

70
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,830
Mother.

71
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,010
How did it go?

72
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,290
We just caught Chen Yun and Chen Bin.

73
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,000
They admitted that they colluded with each other

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,909
and planned to steal high-quality fragrance

75
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,630
from the warehouse to sell it on the black market.

76
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,850
How dare they

77
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,730
do such a thing?

78
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,790
They said

79
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,960
they had no choice.

80
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,970
Their mother is seriously sick.

81
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,480
Even if they had no choice,

82
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,510
they couldn't do

83
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,860
such a sneaky thing.

84
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,230
Besides, they could have

85
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,230
told us the truth.

86
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,870
Our Xu family

87
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,230
wouldn't ignore it.

88
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,260
These two servants

89
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,270
are really...

90
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,150
They have betrayed your Third Uncle's

91
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,950
years of nurturing and support.

92
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,660
At the same time,

93
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,430
they have also let down

94
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,630
our care and support.

95
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,550
Yes.

96
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,420
Is it true that

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,060
this matter was the work of those two?

98
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,520
Yes.

99
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,250
Just the two of them.

100
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,230
That's fine.

101
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,140
Young Master.

102
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Someone reported

103
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,770
that Miss Ping'er

104
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,470
was taken away by the government to be questioned.

105
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,940
It seems to be related to some case.

106
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,110
Don't worry.

107
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,550
Recently,

108
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,590
I’ve been investigating a case.

109
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,710
Miss Ping'er is not a local.

110
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,780
It's just a routine. She's here for questioning.

111
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,659
If there's nothing else,

112
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,260
I'll send her back tomorrow.

113
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,480
Lord Wang, are you lying to me?

114
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,870
Why does it take so long to question her?

115
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,880
After that,

116
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,410
we have to check it.

117
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,170
Don't worry. It's not a big deal.

118
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,320
After we figure it out,

119
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,680
I'll send someone

120
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,450
to send Miss Ping'er back.

121
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,720
Is that okay?

122
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,740
Since Lord Wang said so,

123
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,500
she should be fine.

124
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,060
Let's go back and wait.

125
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,350
Okay.

126
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,550
Lord Wang,

127
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,790
you have to prepare more food

128
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,450
for Ping'er.

129
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,710
She has a big appetite.

130
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,549
She'll have enough food.

131
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,830
I promise I won't starve her.

132
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,850
The soup is delicious today.

133
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,480
Se.

134
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,050
You love fish, right?

135
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,750
Look, these small fish

136
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,440
are fried to a perfect and look so good.

137
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,570
Here, Se, have some.

138
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,800
Thank you, Mother.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,710
Se,

140
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,590
I have something to ask you.

141
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,800
Is there a maid

142
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,290
called Ping'er in your room?

143
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:07,990
Did she commit

144
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,030
a case?

145
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,600
As soon as the authorities stepped in,

146
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,460
they took her away from our house.

147
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,050
Well...

148
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,760
It's not good to spread out.

149
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,760
Mother, don't worry.

150
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,830
Ping'er is like that.

151
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,890
What could happen?

152
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,150
I'm worried about you.

153
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,940
You can't judge a book by its cover.

154
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,150
The most unpredictable thing

155
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,230
is human mind.

156
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:27,980
Understand?

157
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,480
Mother, don't worry.

158
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,550
It's not a big deal.

159
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,710
The government just wants to talk to her.

160
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,170
She'll be back in two days.

161
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,220
Not a big deal?

162
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,190
Then that's good.

163
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,530
So many people

164
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,170
are watching

165
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,310
our Xu family.

166
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,880
We have to guard against them.

167
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,380
Mother, you are right.

168
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,190
Lord Wang.

169
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:58,940
Lord Wang.

170
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,030
When can I

171
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,210
pick Ping'er up?

172
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,150
It’s hard to say.

173
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,020
Why?

174
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,020
Your maid

175
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,250
is extraordinary.

176
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,150
I interrogated her for so long,

177
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,030
but she didn't tell me the truth.

178
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,630
Now,

179
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,920
she is the most suspicious.

180
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,410
Ping'er is timid.

181
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,950
She must be too nervous.

182
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,460
She's usually afraid of a cockroach.

183
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,320
How could she

184
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,200
kill someone?

185
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,290
She's still timid?

186
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,670
She made up

187
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,900
lots of stories.

188
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,740
They're more interesting than the novelists'.

189
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,390
I think

190
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,620
she's just bold.

191
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,800
To be honest,

192
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,210
the Ministry of Justice gave me seven days.

193
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,800
It's almost time.

194
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,630
If she doesn't tell the truth,

195
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,870
I’ll have to send her

196
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,040
to Furong City.

197
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,100
No.

198
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,270
Lord Wang.

199
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,230
You don't have

200
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,650
the evidence of Ping'er's murder.

201
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,380
How can you easily condemn her?

202
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,350
I don't want to.

203
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,230
Then she should tell me the truth.

204
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,400
How about this?

205
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,300
Look.

206
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,310
Ping'er and I are the closest.

207
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,190
Could you make an exception

208
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,790
and let me see her?

209
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,940
Maybe I can find out something.

210
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,070
Look.

211
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,740
You said that this concerned the important officials of the court.

212
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,860
The Ministry of Justice

213
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,360
must value it very much.

214
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,760
If I can get something out,

215
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,780
it'll be good for you, right?

216
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:16,950
Fine.

217
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,700
You should come out quickly.

218
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,650
Thank you, Lord Wang.

219
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,000
Ping'er.

220
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Ping'er, wake up.

221
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,040
Ping'er?

222
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,990
Se?

223
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,400
I miss you so much.

224
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,430
It's okay.

225
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,650
You're in jail too?

226
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,250
What are you talking about?

227
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,200
Are you okay?

228
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,020
Did they starve you?

229
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,310
They only gave me cornmeal buns

230
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,510
to eat for every meal.

231
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,250
-I’m starving.
-This Magistrate Wang.

232
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,130
He told me to let you eat well.

233
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,610
Se.

234
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,820
When can I get out?

235
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,230
Ping'er.

236
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,500
You have to tell me the truth now.

237
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,610
When I first came in,

238
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,670
the officer told me

239
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,940
if you don't tell the truth,

240
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,670
you'll be imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,830
Trust me.

242
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,140
I didn't kill anyone.

243
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,230
I trust you.

244
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,230
But why didn't you

245
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,910
tell us

246
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,940
who you are?

247
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,350
Ping'er.

248
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,510
This is really

249
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,670
your last chance.

250
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,150
Don't you

251
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,310
trust me?

252
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,550
I trust you.

253
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,990
Let me tell you.

254
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,690
I am actually

255
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,420
the granddaughter of the Minister of the Bureau of Astrology.

256
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,590
What bureau?

257
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,790
It doesn’t matter.

258
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,840
I ran away from a marriage

259
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,240
arranged in Furong City.

260
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,030
I didn't tell you

261
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,040
because

262
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,180
if I told you,

263
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,600
I'll be hunted down.

264
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,280
Please keep it a secret.

265
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:00,830
Trust me.

266
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,730
I really didn't kill anyone.

267
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,660
I trust you.

268
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,720
I don't care

269
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,870
who your grandfather is.

270
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,680
Anyway, I believe you won't kill anyone.

271
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,210
How about this?

272
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,890
I'll go out and think of a way.

273
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,550
Wait for me.

274
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,070
I'll wait for you.

275
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,290
All right.

276
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,650
Young Madam Xu.

277
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,510
How did it go?

278
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,500
She didn't say anything.

279
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,890
But I believe

280
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,910
she is innocent.

281
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,580
I want to believe it too.

282
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,880
But even you

283
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,990
can't find out about her background.

284
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,830
There's nothing I can do.

285
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,630
Lord Wang.

286
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,470
May I request that

287
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,420
you continue to investigate the true culprit

288
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,110
until concrete evidence

289
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,500
is found proving

290
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,050
that Ping'er is the murderer?

291
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:57,830
I think,

292
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,910
Lord Wang,

293
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,410
you don't want to wrong a good person, do you?

294
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,350
Of course.

295
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,850
The government will do

296
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,580
what the government should do.

297
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,830
See Young Madam Xu off.

298
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,740
Young Madam Xu, this way, please.

299
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:18,750
Father.

300
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,390
You're finally back.

301
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,470
If you don't come back,

302
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,030
my mother will go to the government to take you back.

303
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,760
Your mother is messing around.

304
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,950
I'm a governor.

305
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,120
I was busy all day.

306
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,340
I wasn't out to play.

307
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,110
What could you do all night?

308
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,780
Not to mention my mother.

309
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,130
I don't believe it.

310
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,510
You brat.

311
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,680
How dare you!

312
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,690
You know what?

313
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,550
I've never met

314
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,050
such a difficult suspect.

315
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,800
We've investigated her for about 15 hours.

316
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,570
Stay away from

317
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,140
the Xu family for now.

318
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,150
Father.

319
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,710
What's wrong with the Xu family?

320
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,430
Maybe

321
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,910
there's really a murderer in their house.

322
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,910
A murderer?

323
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,730
It’s confidential. Don’t ask.

324
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,610
Then...

325
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,920
Will something happen to the Xu family?

326
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,370
It's hard to say.

327
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,920
Now I think

328
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,190
having a useless son like you

329
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,750
is nothing bad.

330
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,230
At least,

331
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,660
you won't cause so much trouble

332
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,540
to torture me.

333
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,720
Ever since Xu Zilu

334
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,200
married his wife,

335
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,010
trouble has never ceased.

336
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,350
Some time ago,

337
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,510
his wife was kidnapped by bandits.

338
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,020
Now,

339
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,310
his wife's maid killed someone.

340
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,790
Well...

341
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,180
Maid?

342
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,630
You mean Ping'er?

343
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,750
What should I do?

344
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,790
Bribe them?

345
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,810
But I don't have money.

346
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,870
Ling Se.

347
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,820
You haven't eaten anything all night.

348
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,350
Try it.

349
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,200
Ping'er is alone in the prison.

350
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,090
I wonder if she has anything to eat

351
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,760
or if anyone is bullying her.

352
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,360
Don't worry.

353
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,750
Ping'er is a member of the Xu family now.

354
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,390
Besides, the truth hasn't been found out yet.

355
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,590
They won't bully her.

356
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,950
I had promised her before

357
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,790
that as long as there was food for me,

358
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,480
there would be food for her as well.

359
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,990
But she's all alone in the prison

360
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,270
and has no one to rely on.

361
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,670
I can do nothing.

362
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,310
Do you really believe

363
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,840
Ping'er won't kill anyone?

364
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,960
After all, she's hiding so much.

365
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,220
There must be a secret.

366
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,260
She has her reasons

367
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,980
for not wanting to tell me right now.

368
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,810
But as her friend, I trust her.

369
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,750
How did you

370
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,000
meet?

371
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,290
That day, I was

372
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,430
at my stall on Sweetwater Street…

373
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,700
Zongzi for sale!

374
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,089
Freshly made, fragrant zongzi.

375
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,020
Come take a look!

376
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,990
Boss.

377
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,540
I'll have a bowl of wontons.

378
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,869
Miss, would you like some zongzi?

379
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:22,849
No need to pay. It's a gift for you.

380
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,510
Here you go.

381
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,310
Thank you.

382
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,720
Here you are.

383
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,460
Thank you.

384
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,640
Thank you. Miss.

385
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,470
You don’t have enough for yourself

386
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,200
and you’re giving it to others?

387
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,900
I just thought she might be hungrier than I am.

388
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,580
I haven’t thanked you properly yet.

389
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,640
The zongzi you made

390
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,980
is the best I’ve ever had.

391
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,270
Of course.

392
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,860
Don’t you know who I am?

393
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,990
You’re such a grown-up person.

394
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,750
How come you don’t even know

395
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,880
how to peel a zongzi?

396
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:39,790
I wonder what you’ve been

397
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,790
eating to grow up.

398
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,190
Thank you.

399
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,470
What's your name?

400
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:47,910
My name is...

401
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,090
My name is Ping'er.

402
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,350
Ping'er.

403
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,100
Where are you from?

404
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,960
You're dressed well.

405
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,500
What happened?

406
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,140
Did something happen to your family?

407
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,940
There’s nothing wrong with my family.

408
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,740
I'm a maid.

409
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,590
I was

410
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,830
driven out by my master and madam

411
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,690
in Furong City.

412
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,710
I’ve been escaping all the way here.

413
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,310
I brought some wages with me.

414
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,730
But I gave them all

415
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
to people who were even more pitiful

416
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,810
than me along the way.

417
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,270
It must have been hard

418
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,000
for you on the road.

419
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:25,600
There are so many people

420
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,190
in this world who are pitiful.

421
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,550
It’s hard to take care of everyone.

422
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,390
You should take care of yourself first

423
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,080
before you can take care of others.

424
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,920
You probably

425
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,080
don’t have a place to stay now, right?

426
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,070
Why don’t you come with me?

427
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,870
Although the conditions

428
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,270
at my place aren’t great,

429
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,830
at least

430
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,350
if I have a bite to eat,

431
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,080
you will too.

432
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,600
Let's go.

433
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,110
When I was at the Ling mansion,

434
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,060
even the servants treated me

435
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,110
poorly.

436
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,470
But since Ping'er arrived,

437
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,040
I finally felt like

438
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,130
I had family again.

439
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,830
I felt cared for

440
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
and looked after.

441
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,750
So

442
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,480
no matter what,

443
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,790
I can’t let anything happen to Ping'er.

444
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,190
I understand.

445
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,240
The authorities are still hunting for the murderer.

446
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,300
Let’s wait for now.

447
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,450
When the murderer is caught,

448
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,650
Ping’er can come back

449
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,920
even if she doesn’t say anything.

450
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:32,870
Don't worry.

451
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,000
I'll help.

452
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,650
Thank you.

453
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:42,830
Xu Zilu.

454
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,510
Ping'er.

455
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,850
Ping'er.

456
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,150
Wang?

457
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,770
Why are you here?

458
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,590
Ping'er.

459
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,440
I brought you delicious food.

460
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,840
I know you haven't been eating well in prison,

461
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,860
so I specially went to Yuerong Restaurant

462
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,190
buy your favorite food.

463
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,500
This is what you like.

464
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,740
Wang.

465
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,000
You’re so kind.

466
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,430
Thank you.

467
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,270
Eat while it’s still warm.

468
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,200
Thank you, Wang.

469
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,590
You’re always thinking about me

470
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,320
and even bringing me good food.

471
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,350
Wang.

472
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,880
Don’t you have anything

473
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
you want to ask me?

474
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,430
No.

475
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,110
How could you possibly

476
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:07,910
be a murderer?

477
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,370
I think my father has just become senile.

478
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,300
I will find a way

479
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,110
to get you out.

480
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,390
Just hold on a little longer.

481
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,950
When you’re out,

482
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,050
I’ll take you to eat even better food.

483
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,630
Ping'er.

484
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,970
This dish is made by me.

485
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,870
Really?

486
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,090
I’ve failed many times.

487
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,660
This is the only time I succeeded.

488
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,300
Eat more.

489
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,470
Then I’ll eat more.

490
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,910
Ping'er.

491
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,550
You look so thin from hunger.

492
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,970
I don’t think I’m thinner.

493
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,430
Young Master?

494
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,400
Young Master.

495
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,460
How did you get in?

496
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,410
I came to visit a friend. Any problem?

497
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,390
Young Master.

498
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,720
You can't go in here.

499
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,110
If the Master finds out, I’ll be in trouble.

500
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,790
I know.

501
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,700
-You go out first.
-Young Master.

502
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,100
Hurry.

503
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,070
Ping'er.

504
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,770
I will definitely get you out.

505
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,830
I’ll be waiting for you.

506
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,160
Okay.

507
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,900
Young Master, hurry and leave.

508
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,940
Ping'er.

509
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,730
-Young Master, let’s go.
-I will definitely get you out.

510
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,190
Okay.

511
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,740
Ping'er.

512
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,050
I’ll be waiting for you.

513
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,450
Okay.

514
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,100
[Xu Mansion]

515
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,180
Greetings, Mother.

516
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,190
By the way,

517
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,390
it's been a whole day already.

518
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,890
Why hasn't that maid

519
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,980
from Se's room been released yet?

520
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,660
I’ve already sent someone to inquire about it.

521
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,700
If there’s no news, it means there’s nothing to worry about.

522
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,260
Old Madam, there’s bad news.

523
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,620
Just now, both Mrs. Fan and Mrs. Qin

524
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,420
sent messages

525
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,380
saying they won’t come to the Xu Mansion for the card game.

526
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,190
They both

527
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:54,270
have something going on?

528
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,030
No.

529
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,200
It’s because of the rumor outside.

530
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,470
What’s the rumor?

531
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,860
They say the Xu family is harboring a criminal,

532
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,940
and the criminal

533
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,670
has even killed a high-ranking official from Furong City.

534
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,580
In short,

535
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,640
those two madams probably

536
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,270
don’t want to be associated with our Xu family.

537
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,840
Didn't you two say

538
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,870
Ping'er was just called in

539
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,870
for questioning?

540
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,730
How did it get so serious?

541
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,250
I’m not sure either.

542
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,700
But I believe Ping'er

543
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,580
is innocent.

544
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,100
Se, I believe you too.

545
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,380
But the authorities

546
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,840
have their reasons for holding her.

547
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,390
Mother.

548
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,070
Please don’t worry.

549
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,740
The rumors outside are unfounded

550
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,140
and lack solid evidence.

551
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,740
Rumors can be devastating.

552
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,530
This matter affects

553
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,710
the Xu family's reputation built over a century.

554
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,390
Besides,

555
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,380
you have a three-month agreement

556
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,710
with Mr. Tao.

557
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,470
I know you’re confident,

558
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,700
but we can’t afford such problems.

559
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,380
I understand.

560
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,720
I won’t stand by idly.

561
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,440
I will definitely resolve this issue.

562
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,660
Oh my.

563
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,510
Ling Se,

564
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,630
what Mother said

565
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,340
was from

566
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,890
the Xu family’s perspective.

567
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,150
Don’t take it to heart.

568
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,400
I don't understand

569
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,760
why no one is willing

570
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,920
to believe Ping'er.

571
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,780
What others think doesn’t matter.

572
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,880
Right now, we need to work hard to prove

573
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,140
Ping'er’s innocence.

574
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,470
Young Master!

575
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:21,620
Young Master!

576
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,810
Young Master, bad news!

577
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:24,030
You'd better go back to the shop and take a look.

578
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,000
What happened now?

579
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,790
Since this morning when we opened the store,

580
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,590
all the customers have been coming to cancel their orders.

581
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,980
They say our Xu family has a murderer,

582
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,630
and the things we sell are unlucky.

583
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,090
Mr. Qiu,

584
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,880
and Mr. Li from the money house,

585
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,030
and Mr. Wang from the manor,

586
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,650
all said they want to

587
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,370
cancel their cooperation with us.

588
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,030
Manager Wan

589
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,650
is so anxious he has fainted.

590
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,020
I will update you on Ping'er's situation.

591
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,550
Let's go.

592
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,300
Oh no.

593
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Have I caused him

594
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,300
trouble again?

595
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,370
This situation is serious.

596
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,570
What should we do?

597
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,590
Mr. Xu.

598
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,370
You're finally here.

599
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,830
Sorry to keep you waiting.

600
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,860
My goodness.

601
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,420
Mr. Xu, you are finally here.

602
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,760
Do you know how high

603
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,100
my costs are for a single voyage?

604
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,810
Your goods

605
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,600
were sent out and then returned.

606
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,300
My losses are huge.

607
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,250
No more talking.

608
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,280
Just sign this contract termination letter.

609
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,030
From the next quarter,

610
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,990
I won’t invest any more money.

611
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:16,840
Considering our years

612
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,650
of friendship,

613
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,780
I won’t ask for more.

614
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,290
The compensation rate will be 20%.

615
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,110
It’s all in the contract

616
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,110
we signed before.

617
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,540
Gentlemen. Calm down.

618
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,830
I understand

619
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,430
this matter is exceptional.

620
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,770
You three are reasonable people.

621
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,630
This case

622
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,210
is a confidential government matter.

623
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,060
The truth won’t be revealed

624
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,640
until the investigation is complete.

625
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,600
What’s spreading in the city

626
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,880
is just a rumor.

627
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,160
Surely you can

628
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,390
tell the difference.

629
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,510
That’s true.

630
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,160
But our business

631
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,270
has been affected.

632
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,570
We need an explanation.

633
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,240
Yes.

634
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:53,820
Yes.

635
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,580
I'm also a businessman.

636
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,190
How could I

637
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,180
see your business get affected?

638
00:27:59,390 --> 00:27:59,920
Tomorrow

639
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,670
I will visit Magistrate Wang

640
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,380
and have him post a public notice in the city

641
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,510
asking people not to trust the rumors.

642
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,950
Once the rumors die down,

643
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,040
business will naturally improve.

644
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,400
In a few days,

645
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:12,580
when Magistrate Wang catches the real culprit,

646
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,240
this matter will be resolved.

647
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,060
Gentlemen,

648
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,470
you have cooperated with the Xu family for many years

649
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:21,000
and weathered many storms.

650
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,750
Haven’t they all been resolved one by one?

651
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,090
If this issue causes you

652
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,880
to end your cooperation with the Xu family,

653
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,680
wouldn’t it be too unfortunate?

654
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,800
That’s true.

655
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,080
Yes, that makes sense.

656
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,750
How about this?

657
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,610
We

658
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,180
won’t cancel the orders for now.

659
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,790
But

660
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,370
if this issue

661
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,980
isn’t resolved as you said

662
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,360
and continues to fester,

663
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,420
then compensation

664
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,570
must be according to our demands.

665
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,390
Look.

666
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,770
What do you two

667
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,110
think?

668
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,090
Alright.

669
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:52,800
Just like that.

670
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,280
That’s the best arrangement.

671
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,080
-Agreed.
-Fine.

672
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,230
Mr. Xu,

673
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,500
don’t back out at the end.

674
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,710
Okay.

675
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,720
I won't go back on my word.

676
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,100
[Xu's Perfume Shop]

677
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,640
Manager Liu.

678
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,270
Don't be too anxious.

679
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,730
These sachets

680
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:10,180
are just some stock.

681
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,430
If they don't sell,

682
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,010
it won’t be a huge loss.

683
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,080
Young Master,

684
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,740
I'm worried

685
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,960
about the reputation of Xu’s.

686
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,050
It’s not easy to build up this business,

687
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,980
and it can be destroyed overnight.

688
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,400
The competition with the Tao family

689
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,930
is almost halfway through.

690
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,970
I am indeed an incapable manager.

691
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,400
Manager Liu.

692
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,490
Don’t say such things.

693
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,360
This matter

694
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,990
has nothing to do with you.

695
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,780
These baseless rumors

696
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,910
will pass.

697
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,650
Rest assured, I won’t let these

698
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,580
ill-intentioned people succeed.

699
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,130
Who has ill intentions?

700
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,510
Young Madam.

701
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,590
Why are you here?

702
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,700
I noticed you hadn’t come back,

703
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,440
so I came to see if there’s anything

704
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,340
I can help with.

705
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,360
Father-in-law?

706
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,130
What should we do now?

707
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,830
Aren’t you going to do anything about it?

708
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,640
This matter has caused quite a stir.

709
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,300
We can't sell a single sachet.

710
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,350
What should we do?

711
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,180
Why are you here?

712
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,970
Do you still have the face to stand here?

713
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,110
If you hadn't brought that troublemaker

714
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,760
into our home,

715
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,420
my business

716
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,430
wouldn’t be dragged down by that murderer.

717
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:13,890
Quickly

718
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,950
cut ties with Ping’er.

719
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,500
No way.

720
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,460
I won’t give up on Ping'er.

721
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,080
You know nothing.

722
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,930
Shielding a criminal

723
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,600
is punishable by death.

724
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:25,950
Ping'er did not commit murder.

725
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,430
You...

726
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:27,900
Well.

727
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,300
She's just a maid.

728
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,830
Can she be more important

729
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,830
than my business?

730
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,930
Exactly.

731
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:34,400
To you,

732
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,100
as long as there's profit,

733
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,800
anyone can be abandoned, right?

734
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,730
Father-in-law,

735
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,670
please calm down.

736
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,110
Ling Se.

737
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,730
What Father-in-law said

738
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,460
is not entirely unreasonable.

739
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,470
Detaching Ping'er

740
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,600
from the Xu family

741
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,240
could indeed solve the problem.

742
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,310
He doesn’t want

743
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,710
the situation to worsen.

744
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,190
It’s not that he wants to abandon Ping'er.

745
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,390
Not unreasonable?

746
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,440
You think he's right?

747
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,670
Detaching Ping'er

748
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,850
from the Xu family

749
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,450
could indeed solve the problem.

750
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,550
You actually agree with him?

751
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,040
Ling Se.

752
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,250
We’re discussing business.

753
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,510
You have to understand

754
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,050
that business is business

755
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,400
and feelings are feelings.

756
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,560
So, you can disregard feelings

757
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,880
just for the sake of making money, right?

758
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,140
That’s not what I mean.

759
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,740
-I...
-Xu Zilu.

760
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,400
That’s exactly what you mean.

761
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:23,150
Fine.

762
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,550
If you want to

763
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,510
cut ties with Ping’er,

764
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,370
you might as well

765
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,360
cut ties with me directly.

766
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,910
Ling Se.

767
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,910
This woman is short-sighted.

768
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,390
Zilu.

769
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,030
Hurry up and get that maid

770
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,160
out of your mansion.

771
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,590
This can’t

772
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,380
go on like this.

773
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,630
Father-in-law.

774
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,360
I have my own ways

775
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,810
to handle business.

776
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,620
Ping'er is part of the Xu family.

777
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,630
You don’t need to worry about it.

778
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,900
Xu Zilu, you’re a big fool.

779
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,390
Given how handsome

780
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,740
Young Master Xu is,

781
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,450
you should forgive him.

782
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,160
No.

783
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,680
You don’t know.

784
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,100
He asked me

785
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,850
to cut ties with Ping'er today.

786
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,250
I used to think

787
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,040
he was somewhat

788
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,500
different from other men.

789
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,570
But today, he and my father

790
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,110
conspired together.

791
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,970
That’s called colluding.

792
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,590
I told you to read more books.

793
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,180
Why are you here? To watch me suffer?

794
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,020
I came to spend. What’s it to you?

795
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,280
I don't care.

796
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,420
You don’t know

797
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,450
how cold-hearted

798
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,310
Xu Zilu is.

799
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,590
He’s just like my father

800
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,550
who is willing to give up everything for benefits.

801
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,680
He even said he would help me

802
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,810
save Ping'er today.

803
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,630
No way.

804
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,880
It’s infuriating.

805
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,610
Liu Yeniang.

806
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,860
I’m not going back to the Xu Mansion.

807
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,390
I’ll stay with you tonight.

808
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,900
Get out of here.

809
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:46,890
Ling Se.

810
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,990
Do you know what you’re like right now?

811
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,390
You’re like a petty woman

812
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,830
quarrelling with her husband

813
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,830
from a storybook.

814
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,300
You’re the petty one.

815
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,300
I don’t know who it was

816
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,310
who said they wouldn’t marry anyone but Xu Zilu before.

817
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,280
Is that so?

818
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,960
Why don't I remember?

819
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,710
I understand now.

820
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,750
It’s all because of business

821
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,840
that Xu Zilu doesn’t care about your personal issue.

822
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,790
So what?

823
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,160
Can’t you handle things without him?

824
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,270
Is your life over

825
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,070
without a man?

826
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,270
Tao Meili.

827
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:16,870
What?

828
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,810
Are you going to hit me just because you can’t argue with me?

829
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:23,230
You're right.

830
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,150
I should find a way myself.

831
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,120
I’ll save

832
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,710
my own people.

833
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,790
Tao Meili.

834
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,200
I didn't expect

835
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,130
you to be

836
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,280
such an independent and strong woman.

837
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,740
From now on,

838
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,060
you are my

839
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:38,820
best friend.

840
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't touch me.

841
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,030
Don’t think I didn’t see you

842
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,150
just wiping your nose with your hand.

843
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,150
It’s disgusting.

844
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,100
Bosslady, how come the things I ordered

845
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
aren’t ready yet?

846
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,400
Just a moment. It has to be made fresh.

847
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,950
Hold on.

848
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,800
Hua.

849
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,570
Have you fallen asleep?

850
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,700
Where are the braised pig’s trotters the customer ordered?

851
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,390
Coming.

852
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,590
Come on.

853
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,380
Isn’t it better if it’s made fresh?

854
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,440
Thank you for your hard work.

855
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,300
Go and get busy.

856
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:07,670
Miss Tao.

857
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,670
Liu Yeniang.

858
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,900
Where did this young man

859
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,060
come from?

860
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,350
I have a good eye, don’t I?

861
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,409
Let me tell you.

862
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,230
You can’t just judge by appearances.

863
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,739
Can he cook well?

864
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,400
He’s definitely better than some people.

865
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,139
Well,

866
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,929
it is much better than before.

867
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,190
So, Miss Tao,

868
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,620
you should come often.

869
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:31,920
No problem.

870
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:34,040
As long as this person is not here.

871
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:37,940
Little Pride.

872
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:40,909
Xu Zilu.

873
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,030
Bad man.

874
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,380
Here are your pastries.

875
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,639
Young Master.

876
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:45,870
Young Master.

877
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:46,909
I’ve already looked into it.

878
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,620
Young Madam is staying

879
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,949
at Fulai Inn these days.

880
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,670
Ask her if she needs anything

881
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,030
and send it over tomorrow.

882
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,870
But Young Master,

883
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,989
shouldn’t you go

884
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,860
and bring Young Madam back at this time?

885
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,260
Right.

886
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,060
Tomorrow, go to the government office.

887
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,290
Give some money to the guards.

888
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,070
Remind them to give Ping'er

889
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,480
some food and necessities.

890
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,010
Also, it’s cold in the jail.

891
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,810
Have them add extra blankets for Ping'er.

892
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,430
Got it.

893
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,610
By the way, Young Master,

894
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,500
I’ve already released

895
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,700
Chen Yun and Chen Bin.

896
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,010
But I still think you’re too kind.

897
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,290
Aren’t you going back?

898
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,680
I should tell you

899
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,790
that staying here will cost money.

900
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,410
Let it cost.

901
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:32,530
Then I’ll take the least expensive room.

902
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,460
Doesn't that make you reconsider?

903
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:36,340
So, you’re serious.

904
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,250
Not entirely.

905
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,910
I asked Nosy Parker to help me investigate

906
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,550
the women

907
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,830
from outside who have arrived since July.

908
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,290
I need to meet him at night.

909
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,710
It's inconvenient

910
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,130
to stay at the Xu Mansion.

911
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:49,340
Mainly,

912
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,400
I’m afraid I’ll see Xu Zilu

913
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,540
and want to jump

914
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,810
to punch him.

915
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,950
Stop it.

916
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,980
Don’t keep mentioning it.

917
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:00,970
Since you

918
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,850
have no natal family to return to,

919
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,630
I’ll reluctantly let you

920
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,230
stay in the same room with me.

921
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,720
Bosslady.

922
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,560
I knew you were the best to me.

923
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,750
Don’t act like that.

924
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,610
At most three days.

925
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,220
For each additional day,

926
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,880
you'll owe me a tael of silver.

927
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,500
Thank you, Bosslady.

928
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,230
I’m stinky too.

929
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,150
Yeniang.
