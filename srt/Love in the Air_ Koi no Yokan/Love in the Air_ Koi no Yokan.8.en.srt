1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
"Episode 8"

2
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:11,625
(I'm home!)

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,675
Arashi?

4
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,925
What's going on? Arashi?

5
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:27,000
Ah! Help!

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,225
Arashi!

7
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:31,404
Arashi! Arashi!

8
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:39,750
(I'm home!)

9
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,181
Thanks for everything last night.

10
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:55,196
And now you're even seeing me off.

11
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,825
Of course. After all, I got to kiss you.

12
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,950
That's hardly a fair exchange.

13
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,200
Everyone values things differently.

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,475
To me, you're priceless.

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,773
Anyway, I'll pick you up again

16
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:16,918
this evening.

17
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,187
After tonight's race,

18
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,500
I'll tell him everything.

19
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,750
Once I do,

20
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,750
I won't have to be afraid anymore.

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,750
Good morning.

22
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:38,225
Good morning.

23
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,900
Is Rei running late?

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,950
Umm...

25
00:01:43,725 --> 00:01:44,975
He said he'd be working on

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,193
assignments last night.

27
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:47,873
He might've fallen asleep again.

28
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,825
Hey, senpai? What's up?

29
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,827
Oh!

30
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:54,702
Just now at the gate,

31
00:01:54,726 --> 00:01:56,984
a tall, handsome guy stopped me

32
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:00,175
and told me to give this to Kai-kun.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,850
A hotel room key?

34
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:05,846
What? Oh, no, it's morning!

35
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,851
It's obscene!

36
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,425
No, I won't accept it.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,467
He must be a real playboy to

38
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,001
ask someone out like this.

39
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:13,450
What if it was Fuma-san?

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,900
Huh?

41
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,700
So you know him?

42
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,575
My boyfriend.

43
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,375
- Whoa! This is spicy! Hot, hot!
- Whoa! This is spicy! Hot, hot!

44
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,475
Geez.

45
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:31,300
- Four in the evening.
- Four in the evening.

46
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,200
To go to that location?

47
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,150
And right before the race, Fuma-san...

48
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,375
- Hey, hey, really?
- I don't know.

49
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,050
- It's still early.
- That's right.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,750
An acquaintance, huh?

51
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:49,200
What's wrong?

52
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,950
I can't get through to Rei.

53
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,125
What? Since when?

54
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,384
He texted me last evening

55
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,806
that he had arrived home.

56
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,725
When was the last time you saw him?

57
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:02,650
Like, two minutes before that.

58
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,600
Huh?

59
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,975
Whoa... Isn't that a bit strict?

60
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:09,378
He's coming to watch

61
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:10,620
the race tonight, yeah?

62
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,325
Yeah.

63
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,175
Haa...

64
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,225
Ah, maybe I can finally get

65
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:29,050
serious about tonight's race.

66
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,325
Him again? Doesn't he ever give up?

67
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,393
Oh, look who it is!

68
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,706
The shady mechanic

69
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:41,394
and his side character.

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,725
Huh?

71
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,500
Hey, hey.

72
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,975
Isn't your expression a bit dark?

73
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,351
Are you worried?

74
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:54,200
- Come on.
- What is it?

75
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:57,575
Nothing. It's just...

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,250
I just picked up a kitten.

77
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,650
Help me, Arashi!

78
00:04:04,175 --> 00:04:05,425
Arashi!

79
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:09,568
If you value your life,

80
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:11,467
give me back my boyfriend.

81
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:15,700
You might want to rethink your tone.

82
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,675
What if one of my guys

83
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,550
decided to cut that pretty face of his?

84
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,600
What do you want?

85
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:34,050
Step into the race instead of Fuma.

86
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,525
I want to beat you and drink good sake.

87
00:04:37,775 --> 00:04:39,050
You want me to lose on purpose?

88
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,026
If you involve the police,

89
00:04:42,034 --> 00:04:43,968
outsiders, or the organizers,

90
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:48,025
I can't promise he'll be safe.

91
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,545
But if you do as I say,

92
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,553
he'll walk away unharmed.

93
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,450
Not a bad deal, right?

94
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,500
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

95
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:24,800
Man, I hate that guy so much.

96
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,675
He pisses me off!

97
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,550
What the hell are you looking at?

98
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,825
Ah, right,

99
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:37,092
you can't talk.

100
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,775
Arashi won't lose.

101
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,939
Even if you use a dirty method,

102
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:45,312
do you think you can win?

103
00:06:45,337 --> 00:06:46,696
You're just a loser who couldn't

104
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,228
win even when you cheated!

105
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:52,610
Hey, just keeping him

106
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:53,829
confined is enough.

107
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:55,750
What are you scared of?

108
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,025
Kidnapping him's already bad enough.

109
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,900
Therefore...

110
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,900
Here, cool, right?

111
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,018
I want to see your expression

112
00:07:10,027 --> 00:07:11,227
when he loses.

113
00:07:13,675 --> 00:07:15,550
Your beautiful face.

114
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,117
Keep it safe.

115
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
Arashi won't lose!

116
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:24,000
Not to someone like you!

117
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,600
Aki.

118
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,750
Arashi won't lose!

119
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,750
Arashi won't lose!

120
00:07:48,825 --> 00:07:50,025
Don't worry.

121
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,578
If it's Fuma-san,

122
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:55,274
he'll surely accept it.

123
00:08:18,325 --> 00:08:19,400
What?

124
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,600
Alright.

125
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,050
We meet again.

126
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:41,975
Let's have some fun tonight.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,275
Let go of me! Let go!

128
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,625
Don't say stupid stuff.

129
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Stop it!

130
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,550
You've grown defiant, haven't you?

131
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,670
Still as cold as ever.

132
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,292
Wasn't he your boyfriend?

133
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:03,366
Boyfriend?

134
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:05,757
He was just a toy!

135
00:09:12,025 --> 00:09:13,750
A toy I broke

136
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:16,575
and threw away.

137
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,350
There it is,

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,575
that victim act.

139
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,100
You enjoyed being with me, didn't you?

140
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:30,900
Pretending you hated it,

141
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:33,323
but you were always happy

142
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:35,028
to come to be hugged.

143
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,300
No.

144
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,150
I just wanted to be a good boyfriend.

145
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,575
You laugh too much.

146
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:50,325
Because I feel sorry for him.

147
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,269
And now his ‘new boyfriend' is

148
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:53,738
going to dump him too.

149
00:09:54,825 --> 00:09:57,025
- Huh?
- Ah...

150
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,350
Shocked?

151
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,650
Should I show him

152
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,500
those pictures, videos,

153
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:11,632
and many other things

154
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,950
of you from back then?

155
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,950
Liar.

156
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:19,650
- You're lying.
- It's the truth.

157
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:21,737
What do you think

158
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,441
your boyfriend will say?

159
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:28,425
"I don't want the something dirty."

160
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,100
"Take it back."

161
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,450
It's a lie.

162
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,875
It's already been many years,

163
00:10:40,025 --> 00:10:42,000
but it's still the same as it was then,

164
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:47,350
Naive and dumb Kai-kun.

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
Just right for killing time.

166
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,025
How nice.

167
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,100
Kai and Rei seem so happy these days.

168
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,450
Yeah, totally.

169
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,475
You two...

170
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,175
Are you friends of Sorano Kai?

171
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:16,675
Uh, yes.

172
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:18,350
Is he still in the classroom?

173
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:19,517
No.

174
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,131
Seemed like his boyfriend

175
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,662
called him to go to a hotel.

176
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:23,675
So,

177
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
- no flirting allowed...
- Wait.

178
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm his boyfriend.

179
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:30,892
Wait. But I met him this morning.

180
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:35,100
Fuma-san has a piercing right here.

181
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:37,650
Hey, what are you doing?

182
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,675
I'm afraid his shoulder will dislocate

183
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,025
or a bone might break.

184
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,350
So I asked him.

185
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,475
That guy...

186
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,600
- Which hotel?
- Huh?

187
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,025
Kai's in danger. Please, just tell me!

188
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:51,525
Umm... Which hotel was it?

189
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,125
What? I don't remember!

190
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,025
- Neither do I...
- Please!

191
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,396
When Fuma comes,

192
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,396
I'll ask him to let me race instead.

193
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:10,400
Are you really going out there to lose?

194
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,875
There is no other way.

195
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,075
Because Rei is the most important.

196
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,900
I've never done any maintenance to lose,

197
00:12:24,425 --> 00:12:25,775
will it go well?

198
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,000
Do the maintenance as usual,

199
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,050
as a mechanic should.

200
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,075
Umm...

201
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,150
I'm sorry!

202
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,700
Please stop him!

203
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,300
Hey, hey, are you lost?

204
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,400
Stop!

205
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:35,064
Because of that weakling,

206
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,768
the plan was all ruined.

207
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,858
- Let my boyfriend go!
- If I let him go now,

208
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,050
you won't do as I say, will you?

209
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:58,675
Hey!

210
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,950
This 'love' thing is so hilarious.

211
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:07,525
Oh right.

212
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:09,743
Since we're all here,

213
00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:12,085
let's have some fun.

214
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,925
Get on your knees.

215
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,975
Hurry up!

216
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:46,700
Brilliant. Like an obedient dog.

217
00:14:47,325 --> 00:14:49,650
Makes me want to keep you as a pet.

218
00:14:51,425 --> 00:14:52,725
Next up.

219
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,575
Bow your head to the ground.

220
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,825
Arashi, don't!

221
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,325
Not there!

222
00:15:05,475 --> 00:15:07,125
Crawl to me.

223
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:13,600
Arashi!

224
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:48,925
- Let my boyfriend go!
- Don't be so impatient.

225
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,200
Now, a commemorative photo.

226
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,800
Alright, so miserable. Yay.

227
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:05,775
You've been mocking me a lot!

228
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,225
Fighting back?

229
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,125
Do you want to see your boyfriend hurt?

230
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,100
That's better.

231
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,650
That's how it should be.

232
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,625
- Kurosaki-san is so stubborn.
- What are you talking about?

233
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,200
What the hell?

234
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,325
Take that!

235
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,825
You...!

236
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,750
Ah, you're misunderstanding.

237
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,975
He invited me here. Stripped himself.

238
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:11,870
We were lovers once,

239
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,192
so occasionally, things like this

240
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,720
happen between us.

241
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:17,025
Kai!

242
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:20,600
Look at me.

243
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,250
Kai!

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Kai!

245
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,975
Fuma-san.

246
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:31,825
I...

247
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:35,300
am not yours alone.

248
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:38,675
I...

249
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,825
I'm dirty, ugly, and defective.

250
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:49,225
So I can't belong to just you.

251
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:58,275
You can. Of course, you can.

252
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:02,575
You're so beautiful, so good.

253
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,875
It's all right.

254
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,525
You're mine, Kai.

255
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,050
- He'll die!
- Good!

256
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,950
Fuma-san.

257
00:18:40,675 --> 00:18:42,275
Let's go home, okay?

258
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,850
Mm.

259
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:56,800
Cut it out, you coward!

260
00:18:57,646 --> 00:18:58,575
Huh?

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,320
You can't win on your own,

262
00:19:00,336 --> 00:19:01,626
so you use your gang,

263
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,775
and even using a knife.

264
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,835
If I were you, I'd die of embarrassment.

265
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
You coward!

266
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,875
You little...

267
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,150
Stay away from my boyfriend.

268
00:19:11,642 --> 00:19:14,067
You weakling! Coward!

269
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:18,700
I said stay away!

270
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,425
Dammit!

271
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:24,400
Stop! Don't hurt Arashi!

272
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:30,925
Ah! Ouch! Ow, ow, ow!

273
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:32,000
Oww!

274
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,600
- Tomaru-san.
- Shut up!

275
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,125
Hey, you lot!

276
00:19:39,141 --> 00:19:41,346
Don't lose and take care of this guy!

277
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,875
Otherwise, I'm not paying!

278
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,800
Hey!

279
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,500
You lot... Ouch!

280
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,100
The hell you doing?

281
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:58,382
Hey!

282
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:01,950
What?

283
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:03,900
What are you trying to do?

284
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:09,650
Don't do it. Hey, look!

285
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,100
This is for hurting my boyfriend.

286
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:13,375
I got it. How much do you want?

287
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,325
I said I got it! Don't!

288
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:30,350
Arashi.

289
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:32,375
The race went off without a hitch!

290
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:34,168
Even though those guys were

291
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:35,606
caught during the competition.

292
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,875
As for the situation,

293
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,525
the organizer will handle it later.

294
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,975
From now on...

295
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,250
Thanks.

296
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:47,525
- You were worried, huh?
- Not at all.

297
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,028
I knew if anyone could handle it,

298
00:20:50,053 --> 00:20:51,295
it'd be you, Arashi.

299
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,725
In the past...

300
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,450
I used to date that person.

301
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:21,475
He was kind to me at first.

302
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,600
But then, he suddenly started to hit me.

303
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,615
It became more and

304
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,999
more intense day by day,

305
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:38,250
and it left scars.

306
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,471
Even though my friends

307
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,160
told me to leave him.

308
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:48,825
But I didn't listen to them.

309
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,075
I thought it was because I was bad

310
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,125
and I thought he loved me.

311
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:02,300
One day,

312
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,925
I was tied to the bed.

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
Took off my clothes,

314
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,500
he brought his friends,

315
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:23,675
and they raped me.

316
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,900
After he laughed

317
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,200
and played,

318
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:38,175
he said he got tired of me

319
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,775
and threw me away.

320
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,000
Why are you crying?

321
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:00,475
Because Kai doesn't cry.

322
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,250
If Kai can't cry, I'll cry for him.

323
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,675
If Kai suffers, I suffer with him.

324
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,029
If Kai is in pain,

325
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:14,264
I'll endure the pain too.

326
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,225
Therefore...

327
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,550
Don't carry it alone anymore.

328
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:32,000
You're allowed to cry when it hurts.

329
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,225
I'm here for you.

330
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,550
I will wipe your tears

331
00:23:42,575 --> 00:23:43,775
and take care of you.

332
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:48,825
So,

333
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,025
cry,

334
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,720
Kai.

335
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,900
Fuma-san.

336
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:21,850
Can I...

337
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:26,750
love you?

338
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,825
Don't ask me that.

339
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,625
My greatest wish

340
00:24:33,825 --> 00:24:35,450
is for Kai to love me.

341
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,020
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,550
If we had met sooner,

343
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,253
I would have been able to protect Kai

344
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,325
before anything happened.

345
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,700
But...

346
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,675
we met now.

347
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:19,525
These tears...

348
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,975
they're happy tears.

349
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,325
Thank you

350
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:31,150
for saving me

351
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,875
from my nightmare.

352
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:38,190
It should be me

353
00:25:38,214 --> 00:25:39,753
thanking you for telling me.

354
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,875
I'm happy too.

355
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,351
I'll show you by my actions

356
00:25:48,376 --> 00:25:50,359
from now on, not promises.

357
00:25:53,425 --> 00:25:55,046
I will make Kai so happy

358
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,570
that everyone will envy him.

359
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,750
I'm afraid of more happiness.

360
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,503
Then, I will make you so happy

361
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,199
that you forget the fear.

362
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,375
I will make Kai smile all the time.

363
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:22,300
Me too.

364
00:26:28,075 --> 00:26:29,075
Again.

365
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,425
No, no.

366
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:32,975
- Again.
- Hey.

367
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:34,900
Mm.

368
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:39,475
No.

369
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:01,700
Does it sting?

370
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,450
I'm fine.

371
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:11,900
When you tried to help me,

372
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,775
I fell in love with you again.

373
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,571
Have you ever fallen

374
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,790
in love with me before?

375
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:31,750
Can't you hear my heart?

376
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,525
If you don't tell me, I won't know.

377
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,175
I love Rei.

378
00:27:54,825 --> 00:27:57,175
Me too.

379
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:01,000
What's the same?

380
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,000
Don't cheat.

381
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,875
Rei loves Arashi.

382
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,125
The weather.

383
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:26,200
Hmm?

384
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,075
Well,

385
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,200
when a storm comes,

386
00:28:30,725 --> 00:28:32,550
rain always comes with it.

387
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,675
This is my new design.

388
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:16,375
(Love)

389
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,200
Mmm...

390
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,425
- Hey, how is it...
- Ignoring me?

391
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,675
Always treating me like this.

392
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:22,670
- It's so tasty.
- Really?

393
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,275
Oh, here they come in a pair.

394
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,870
They're always so dazzling.

395
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:33,875
Ready to go?

396
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:36,450
Mm.

397
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,050
Hey, Rinka...

398
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,175
Rei. Congratulations.

399
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:00,425
Thank you.

400
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,850
Honey!

401
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,100
Dammit!

402
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,825
I told you, stop calling me that.

403
00:30:22,975 --> 00:30:24,550
They're flirting again.

404
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:27,707
Those two are amazing.

405
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:29,700
They're really intense.

406
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,523
You've been listening to

407
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:18,062
Love in the Air.

408
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,775
May you all enjoy

409
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,350
the unpredictable weather

410
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,261
and the wonderful days ahead.

411
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:31,525
