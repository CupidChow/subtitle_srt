1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,650
"Episode 9"

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,425
"Love in The Air"

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,765
The sky after the rain stopped,

4
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:08,617
a rainbow unexpectedly appeared.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,545
In fact, the order of the colors of

6
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,246
the rainbow was already determined.

7
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:16,975
Whether it was a coincidence or not,

8
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:19,104
is there any fateful meeting

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,089
like the rainbow?

10
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,075
A fateful meeting like the rainbow?

11
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,200
Of course there is.

12
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:33,000
There's only one.

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,090
It all started on

14
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:38,247
the night the storm came.

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,600
No way! What's going on?

16
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:48,050
Huh?

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,770
Please start!

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,450
Ah, damn it! I give up!

19
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:05,500
Yes?

20
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,250
I'll take a look at the engine.

21
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:11,175
Open the hood of the car.

22
00:01:11,275 --> 00:01:12,975
Huh? Really?

23
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:26,481
I can't help, so

24
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:27,840
this is the least I can do.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Hold this.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,675
I was really stuck.

27
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,050
Thank you so much for helping me.

28
00:01:58,075 --> 00:01:59,700
It's an old car.

29
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:04,350
It's my father's most important car.

30
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:10,891
If you're going to keep driving it.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,250
Next time, handle it yourself.

32
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,675
Since then, many things have happened.

33
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:56,500
Hey! Don't hit me!

34
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,400
Even my parents never did that!

35
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:06,500
Before you start designing houses,

36
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:09,325
you need to design your own life first.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,675
We went through things that were

38
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,034
the first time together.

39
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,165
If that's not destiny, then

40
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,128
there's no destiny,

41
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:37,725
that's definitely destiny.

42
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:43,900
Even so...

43
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:57,000
A fateful meeting like the rainbow,

44
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,150
huh?

45
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,550
It's annoying to say

46
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,000
but there's only one person.

47
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,625
He's my boy.

48
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,325
My apologies.

49
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,325
Can we talk for a moment?

50
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:23,935
Do you know that this is

51
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,334
a dangerous place where outsiders

52
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,662
are not allowed to enter?

53
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,795
Anyone who sneaks in

54
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,500
doesn't leave unscathed.

55
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,575
What should I do?

56
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,450
Depends on the offer,

57
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,050
but if I get to choose...

58
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,350
You understand, right?

59
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,321
What you need to trade

60
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:47,993
to get out of here.

61
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:55,400
Just kidding.

62
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,379
Not everyone could resist

63
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:59,084
someone as cute as you,

64
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,450
but luckily I can.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,525
Don't come to such a dangerous...

66
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:06,400
I will do whatever you want.

67
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,200
That kind of terrible meeting,

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,781
even though I thought

69
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,539
we would never meet again.

70
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,325
Good morning.

71
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,709
I came here because you

72
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:32,904
didn't give me a reply.

73
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,950
A present.

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,176
Before I knew it,

75
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,473
I was interested in him,

76
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,175
Just seeing your cute smile is enough.

77
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,375
I like him.

78
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,200
(I'm worried about you)

79
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,175
"Porridge with egg, orange jelly."

80
00:05:52,175 --> 00:05:53,525
Stop it! Stop it!

81
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,500
"A player but takes racing seriously."

82
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:57,500
"A narcissist, but undeniably charming."

83
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,550
"Annoying, but makes me smile."

84
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,600
I love you.

85
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,850
I really love you.

86
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,225
I hear you.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,325
And I'm obsessed with him.

88
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:23,675
I'm afraid of more happiness.

89
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,415
Then, I will make you so happy

90
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,103
that you forget the fear.

91
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,508
I will make Kai smile all the time.

92
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,300
Kai, the car is fixed.

93
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,125
Ah, amazing. Thanks.

94
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,400
Well, I learned a lot from Arashi...

95
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,325
Oh, then let's continue.

96
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,037
The mountains at night are cold.

97
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,053
Fuma-san...

98
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,550
Told me...

99
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:16,475
Dammit, I really want to forget.

100
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,279
I want to forget, but why do

101
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,036
I keep thinking about him?

102
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,525
Okay, from now on,

103
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,300
let's not think about them anymore.

104
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,750
Agreed, "I don't know anyone like that."

105
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,337
"I don't know anyone like that."

106
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:31,009
Let's get them out of our heads.

107
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,350
- Because we...
- Because we...

108
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,725
- are angry!
- are angry!

109
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:51,650
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

110
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,350
(Friday)

111
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,712
What's wrong with you, Rei?

112
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:55,926
You're not cheerful at all.

113
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,175
- Want to tell me about it?
- No.

114
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,348
I have more life experience than.

115
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:02,747
Don't be shy.

116
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,231
I don't want to discuss

117
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,848
my life experiences with senpai

118
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:09,176
who only live with kouhai.

119
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:10,276
Hey, you!

120
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,350
Hey.

121
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:16,875
Dammit, this guy...

122
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,800
Ah!

123
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,100
Oww!

124
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,250
That hurts.

125
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,925
What's that?

126
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:24,325
This is...

127
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,264
It's the fox god that has been

128
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:27,654
protecting us since ancient times.

129
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:29,800
The fox god?

130
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,025
- Then we have to apologize...
- It's too late.

131
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,175
Huh?

132
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,875
You've now...

133
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:38,150
- been cursed!
- Whoa!

134
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,675
- Don't do that!
- You were so scared!

135
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,075
It's all because of Arashi.

136
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,475
Huh?

137
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,525
There's something like Tanuki

138
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,250
in a place like this?

139
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:29,925
What "something like Tanuki"?

140
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,200
Huh?

141
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:36,275
Umm, I'm sorry.

142
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:39,050
It's too late.

143
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,125
That's somehow scary.

144
00:11:06,425 --> 00:11:09,625
It's all because of Fuma.

145
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,725
What's wrong?

146
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:34,450
I'm the one who wants to ask.

147
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,075
You sighed before me.

148
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,175
I did?

149
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:42,325
Hmm... Then I win. Tell me.

150
00:11:42,475 --> 00:11:44,050
How annoying.

151
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,725
You have a problem with Fuma, don't you?

152
00:11:50,275 --> 00:11:51,275
No way.

153
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:52,975
Is that so?

154
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:56,375
Kai is usually kind.

155
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,300
But he's this irritated.

156
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:01,450
Only Fuma who can make him like this.

157
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,950
I...

158
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:09,475
- am kind?
- Mm, a lot!

159
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:17,150
So Fuma is at fault, right?

160
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,500
Mhm... That's right. Hey, listen to me.

161
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,175
I'll listen. You'll listen to me too.

162
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:30,200
- I knew something is bothering you.
- Of course.

163
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:32,489
Gosh,

164
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,504
I get irritated just thinking about it!

165
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,800
Then you speak first.

166
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,425
You go first.

167
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,550
Rock, paper, scissor!

168
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:48,175
Rock, paper, scissor!

169
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:50,850
Dammit!

170
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,550
(Thursday)

171
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,900
Hey, Arashi.

172
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:57,559
Have you thought about the contest

173
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:59,129
you mentioned the other day?

174
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,800
What about?

175
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,225
Huh?

176
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,260
Didn't you say you'd think about it?

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,010
Haven't you thought about it yet?

178
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:07,150
Hmm...

179
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,150
If I remember correctly...

180
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,550
Ah, the fashion contest?

181
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,775
It's a Japanese costume contest.

182
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,125
I think it'll definitely suit you.

183
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,025
Well... I suppose.

184
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:19,300
Right?

185
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,100
I want to see Arashi win.

186
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,975
It might be more suitable for Rei.

187
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:28,350
Stop saying that.

188
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,650
I'll think about it.

189
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:35,575
People who don't think like to say that.

190
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,125
Playing games is good.

191
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,140
But why don't you do

192
00:13:42,165 --> 00:13:43,438
something more useful?

193
00:13:46,775 --> 00:13:49,400
It's fun and a great way to kill time.

194
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:51,634
You're right.

195
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:53,165
But you've played too much.

196
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:54,407
Never mind that,

197
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,806
finish your work quickly.

198
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,525
Then we can go out to eat.

199
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,268
You should look at me

200
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,518
more than the game.

201
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:01,750
Hmm?

202
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm more interesting than that game.

203
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:07,976
The guy who's going to eat

204
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:09,890
with you is rushing with his work.

205
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:13,125
Even if you top up, you find one.

206
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:17,975
I think

207
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:20,820
if I just watch Arashi,

208
00:14:20,845 --> 00:14:22,117
it will be hard to work,

209
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:23,421
so I play games.

210
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,350
You can watch.

211
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,275
If you watch me, I will try even harder.

212
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,295
Because I want you to see

213
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,428
only the good side.

214
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,850
Of course I would want to watch.

215
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,675
It's really annoying.

216
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,800
Huh?

217
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,975
You're mad about that?

218
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,500
That's right.

219
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,750
Then what's Kai upset about?

220
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,850
I...

221
00:15:04,975 --> 00:15:08,125
(Thursday)

222
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:10,325
Oh, right.

223
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,275
What's wrong?

224
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:23,332
I just thought you'd look good

225
00:15:23,348 --> 00:15:24,465
in a Japanese outfit.

226
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,100
I told you I wasn't going to compete.

227
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,600
Please.

228
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,050
I wanted to do what you asked for.

229
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,618
But I don't want to spend my luck

230
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:34,201
on anything other than work.

231
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,375
Luck is unrelated, I think you'll win.

232
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,925
I sincerely apologize this time.

233
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,500
But I must refuse.

234
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,967
Why did you suddenly start

235
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:41,592
working out while I'm here?

236
00:16:41,825 --> 00:16:43,150
And why can't I do it?

237
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,009
Don't people usually do it

238
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:49,751
when others aren't around?

239
00:16:50,675 --> 00:16:52,100
Do you want to do it together?

240
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:54,450
Did you hear what I said?

241
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,925
I'm not working out.

242
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:00,100
Then just watch quietly.

243
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,325
It's obvious that he was inviting me.

244
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,575
So confident.

245
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:20,475
And really charming.

246
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,350
Oh gosh. I'm so irritated.

247
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,775
Are you mad about that?

248
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,051
Then what if Arashi

249
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,996
works out in front of you?

250
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,800
I wouldn't be able to stand watching!

251
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,607
And what does Fuma look like

252
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,170
when he's working seriously?

253
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,225
- I want to watch him forever.
- Right? And then...

254
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:46,325
What makes it even more annoying is...

255
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,650
What is it?

256
00:17:53,425 --> 00:17:54,740
No matter what happens,

257
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:56,146
don't stop playing games.

258
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,920
Is the work done?

259
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,225
Promise me, no matter what happens,

260
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,232
you won't stop playing games.

261
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,375
Huh?

262
00:18:07,575 --> 00:18:08,750
Fine.

263
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,125
I'm gonna die. Please stop.

264
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,625
You mean your game?

265
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,225
Or is it because you feel good?

266
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,525
Game...

267
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,300
Keep playing your game.

268
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,125
Wait a minute.

269
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,450
Keep playing.

270
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,642
I'm still playing but

271
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,330
what did you suddenly do?

272
00:19:15,175 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm done with work.

273
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:20,675
Then let's hurry up and go eat.

274
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:22,950
Hmm?

275
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,925
Then should we stop?

276
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,125
No...

277
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,750
No need to stop.

278
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,000
A good thing about you is...

279
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,084
Your words are true to your heart.

280
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,125
Oh no.

281
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,225
I can't take it anymore.

282
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,048
You promised you'd continue

283
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,512
playing your game.

284
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,250
You're right.

285
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,125
This is pure hell.

286
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,225
It's hell on earth.

287
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:39,100
The game is long dead.

288
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:42,490
But the game of negotiation

289
00:21:42,506 --> 00:21:43,795
just started from there.

290
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,575
It's obvious that you lost.

291
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:47,075
- Yay!
- Yay!

292
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:51,450
But sometimes I wonder if

293
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:53,718
the reason I'm being bullied

294
00:21:53,727 --> 00:21:54,968
is because I'm younger.

295
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,725
Haa...

296
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,750
Can I wipe my sweat?

297
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:11,650
Go ahead.

298
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:26,142
What are you doing?

299
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:27,800
I'm wiping it.

300
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,550
It's dirty.

301
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,400
So mean.

302
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:34,050
It's just sweat.

303
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,710
You used to say that

304
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:37,542
you liked me with wet hair.

305
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,525
I didn't say that.

306
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,925
If it's dirty or uncomfortable and

307
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,474
you really don't like it,

308
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:47,788
you can tell me to stop.

309
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,725
Oh.

310
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,367
Your shirt is wet.

311
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:07,656
You have to take it off.

312
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,850
Geez...

313
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,150
What nonsense are you talking about?

314
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:14,900
You'll catch a cold.

315
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
Aren't you cold?

316
00:23:28,075 --> 00:23:29,375
Just a little cold.

317
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,150
I told you it was sweat...

318
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:37,450
But it's warmer than before, right?

319
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,050
You want to start sweating now, yes?

320
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,775
Haa...

321
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:02,760
Having a boyfriend who's too

322
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:04,702
charming is really stressful.

323
00:24:05,525 --> 00:24:06,725
I totally understand.

324
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,150
But actually...

325
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,790
Tomorrow we're going on a three-day,

326
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:14,276
two-night hot spring trip.

327
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,100
Huh?

328
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,007
Tomorrow I...

329
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,476
have a date at the beach.

330
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:23,800
- Haa...
- Haa...

331
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,525
- So stressed!
- So stressed!

332
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,550
- Yay!
- Gosh, I'm not looking forward to it.

333
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,825
Yay!

334
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,050
I am so surprised

335
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,743
to hear that you'll listen

336
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:57,448
- to what I have to say.
- Arashi.

337
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:15,875
Once we return, please listen to me.

338
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,300
Of course.

339
00:25:57,275 --> 00:25:58,475
Fuma-san

340
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:00,120
is wearing it for me.

341
00:26:06,728 --> 00:26:10,333
You've gotten much better at wearing it.

342
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,675
It suits you.

343
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,750
Thank you,

344
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,650
it's all thanks to you.

345
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:27,575
You've been helping me all this time.

346
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:43,948
Hello, Rei.

347
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,600
- Let's go out!
- Let's go out!

348
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,025
(The sky in the rain is full of worries)

349
00:26:51,025 --> 00:26:54,100
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

350
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,000
He doesn't pick up the phone.

351
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:00,767
Arashi, you really don't know

352
00:27:00,783 --> 00:27:02,009
where Kai is?

353
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,450
Sorry, I don't know.

354
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,059
Actually, I haven't been able to

355
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:08,567
contact Rei since yesterday.

356
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,465
Actually, today we have

357
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:11,762
a date at the beach.

358
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,775
Huh, me too.

359
00:27:14,575 --> 00:27:15,723
We have a date to go

360
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:17,160
but we can't contact them.

361
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:21,625
Arashi.

362
00:27:22,275 --> 00:27:24,150
Kai just contacted me.

363
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,000
- Said he wanted to cancel the trip.
- Huh?

364
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:33,550
Oh, I also got my date canceled.

365
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,250
Why did it suddenly turn out like this?

366
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,650
There's no clue at all.

367
00:27:38,225 --> 00:27:39,150
Same here.

368
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:41,575
But it's good that they're safe.

369
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:44,575
Which onsen were you going to?

370
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,298
It's an inn belonging to

371
00:27:46,306 --> 00:27:47,954
an acquaintance of my father's.

372
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:49,750
Huh?

373
00:27:50,807 --> 00:27:52,407
Making a new reservation?

374
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:57,225
Then it's clear where those two are.

375
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,750
- Okay, time to hunt.
- Okay, time to hunt.

376
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,875
Even Kai was cheated on?

377
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:18,393
Even if he apologizes,

378
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:19,250
I won't forgive him.

379
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:20,475
Yeah, let's go.

380
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:22,909
Forget everything

381
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:24,300
and just travel together.

382
00:28:24,975 --> 00:28:26,200
- Hey, Payu.
- Hmm?

383
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,850
How are Sky and Rain doing?

384
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,675
- Huh?
- Huh?

385
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:38,657
Huh? Did you just call us?

386
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,900
Rei and Kai?

387
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,475
Hi.

388
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,900
What's going on with these two?

389
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,875
They look a little like someone else.

390
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:01,075
Oh, man. I really want to forget.

391
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,650
This time, it's just the two of us.

392
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,575
Let's have fun on our getaway!

393
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,700
- Yay!
- Yay!
