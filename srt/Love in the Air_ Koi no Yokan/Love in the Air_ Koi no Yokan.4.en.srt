1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
"Episode 4"

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,780
Don't come here anymore.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,160
Huh?

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,740
Why?

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,080
Stop joking like that.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,820
Am I a nuisance?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,220
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,740
I'll stay out of your way.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,080
So please don't stop me.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,320
Rei,

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,340
you're not a nuisance.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,420
Then...

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,600
You need to manage your time better.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,900
I've told you before.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,740
Before you start designing houses,

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,880
you need to design your own life first.

17
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,052
I'm not interested in a fleeting,

18
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,388
momentary relationship.

19
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,575
And do you think you can

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,958
expect a good relationship

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,161
from someone who is irresponsible

22
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:08,287
about their own life?

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,800
That's just who I am.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,840
If you can't accept that,

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,920
don't come back here.

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,472
But if I can prove

27
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:30,177
I can take responsibility...

28
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,500
Can I come back?

29
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,073
Only if you can follow

30
00:01:36,089 --> 00:01:37,347
through on your words.

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,700
Prepare to go home.

32
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:42,240
I'll wait in the car.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,480
Don't dwell on what's already done.

34
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,825
Focus on your next task

35
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:01,974
and give it your all.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,940
Got it,

37
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,000
troublemaker?

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,252
If you don't dry off,

39
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,323
you'll catch a cold.

40
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:19,960
Taking care of you would be a hassle.

41
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,020
You said you wouldn't comfort me.

42
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,080
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

43
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,980
(I'll become an architect.
Please let me pass)

44
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,200
(I'll become an architect)

45
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,400
Rei!

46
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,949
If we don't hurry,

47
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,136
the lecture will start soon.

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,620
- Sorry, coming!
- Mhm.

49
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,540
Oh, I forgot to bring it.

50
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,100
- Sorry! Go ahead!
- Mhm.

51
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
(I'll become an architect.
Please let me pass)

52
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
I'll do my best!

53
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,540
First,

54
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,200
I need to design my own life.

55
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,500
Being too confident was the cause.

56
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,940
Mhm.

57
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,297
Rei being the first one here?

58
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,657
Is it going to rain?

59
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,665
Return like this.

60
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,757
Does anyone have any questions?

61
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,040
- Yes!
- Yes, Amemiya?

62
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,537
Which is better, the previous model

63
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:43,771
or this model?

64
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,400
Haa...

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,820
(Rei)

66
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,120
Alright.

67
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,660
- The race is the day after tomorrow.
- Mhm.

68
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,280
Aren't you going to practice?

69
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,980
Don't need it for some amateur.

70
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,776
I heard this guy Fuma is supposed

71
00:06:44,784 --> 00:06:46,136
to be an incredible racer…

72
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,620
Will you be alright?

73
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,900
Sorry.

74
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,820
Just shut up and listen to what I say.

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
Don't worry.

76
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,220
My hands are great.

77
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,060
Rinka?

78
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,660
Want to grab breakfast together?

79
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,260
Mhm.

80
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,280
You see...

81
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,540
What?

82
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,420
Like him, right?

83
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,680
Arashi-senpai.

84
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,460
Who?

85
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,980
I said Arashi-senpai!

86
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,180
Why?

87
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:04,870
Why? Do you need a reason

88
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:06,247
to like someone?

89
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,120
At first, I just admired him.

90
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,931
But after we talked

91
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,636
at school the other day,

92
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,180
I realized I really like him.

93
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,627
You're close with him, right?

94
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,640
You'll help me, won't you?

95
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,480
Hmm?

96
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,080
Mhm! This is good!

97
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,660
Oh, it's delicious. Do you want some?

98
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,960
- I'll share some with you. Alright.
- Oh, thanks.

99
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,792
The person you liked

100
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,497
is now your rival, huh?

101
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,880
Huh?

102
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,940
Rei,

103
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,020
I'm asking seriously,

104
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,280
do you like Arashi-senpai?

105
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,060
I don't.

106
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,557
Before answering so quickly,

107
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:10,262
ask your heart first.

108
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,120
Take your time.

109
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,660
Only you can understand

110
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,880
your feelings.

111
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,546
Man, talking seriously

112
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,820
gives me goosebumps.

113
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,580
Model, check.

114
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,820
Blueprints, check.

115
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,760
Done!

116
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,320
All done!

117
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,920
Haa...

118
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,660
Tonight, unstable atmospheric conditions

119
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,850
may lead to localized

120
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:13,547
severe thunderstorms.

121
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,200
Stay safe, everyone.

122
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,540
- Good morning.
- Oh!

123
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,120
- Good morning.
- You're up early.

124
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,400
No, you Raita-san.

125
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,260
I woke up after that guy.

126
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,479
I heard he wants to hurry up and

127
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,760
finish his other work

128
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:35,791
for tonight's race.

129
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,100
No matter how busy he was in school,

130
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,959
he never gave up

131
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,664
on customizing machines.

132
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,700
That guy has always hated losing.

133
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,040
- I'm heading back.
- Oh?

134
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,980
Aren't you going to meet him?

135
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,717
We agreed I'd only come back

136
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:04,600
once I could prove myself.

137
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,760
- Sorry for the interrupt.
- Huh?

138
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,200
Rei.

139
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,020
Good luck.

140
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,260
Mhm.

141
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,380
The concept behind my design is

142
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,337
‘a home that harnesses nature's

143
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,212
power to create comfortable living.'

144
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,046
Opposite the living room

145
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,944
is a Western-style garden

146
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:06,359
with a meeting area specially

147
00:13:06,383 --> 00:13:07,827
designed for family gatherings,

148
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,382
with a layout that provides space

149
00:13:12,406 --> 00:13:13,576
for each family member

150
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:14,984
to engage in various activities.

151
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,635
Based on these principles,

152
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,143
I designed this home.

153
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,120
That concludes my presentation.

154
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,040
A well-thought-out concept,

155
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:36,065
suited to contemporary needs.

156
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,126
It's clear you've gained

157
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:39,462
a deeper understanding.

158
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,960
Thank you very much!

159
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,200
Presentation went well, didn't it?

160
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,660
Then what's with that face?

161
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,460
Remember when you asked if

162
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,920
I liked Arashi-senpai?

163
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,200
You told me to ask my heart.

164
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,880
Mhm.

165
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,840
I still don't know if it's love.

166
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,000
But

167
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,504
one thing I do know,

168
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,379
I don't want to give up.

169
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,120
But…

170
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,080
I'm still far from being

171
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,934
the kind of person he accepts.

172
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:27,043
Someone who can take

173
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:28,848
responsibility for their own life.

174
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,840
Rei, do you know?

175
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,060
I always call you annoying, right?

176
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,440
Well, 90% of the time, I'm lying.

177
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,100
You're not the type to give up easily,

178
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,900
I like Rei the way he is.

179
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,460
Both happiness...

180
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,960
And fortune...

181
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,860
Favor the bold.

182
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,740
Mhm.

183
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
So, what do you

184
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,620
want to do most right now?

185
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,500
I want to prove myself to him.

186
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,600
I'm going to see him!

187
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,400
That's the spirit.

188
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,380
Ah.

189
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,700
But

190
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,080
there's one problem.

191
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,480
Rei.

192
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,460
About Arashi-senpai…

193
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,660
- You're going to help me, right?
- No.

194
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,380
I…

195
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,740
can't.

196
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,240
- Huh?
- I'm sorry!

197
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,560
About Arashi-senpai,

198
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
I respect him,

199
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,660
or I want to be accepted by him,

200
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,880
and, maybe, like him as a person.

201
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,270
Honestly, I don't even know how I feel.

202
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:25,294
But...

203
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,920
That...

204
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,920
means love.

205
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,620
Huh?

206
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,760
I understand your feelings, Rei.

207
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
I won't ask you to help anymore.

208
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Sorry.

209
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,340
I'll handle my feelings by myself.

210
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,900
I'll be honest about my feelings.

211
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,000
You should do the same.

212
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,600
If you can't accept that,

213
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:13,648
don't come back here.

214
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,120
You need to design your own life first.

215
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
Dammit!

216
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,280
Hey! You cheated, right?

217
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,080
Don't blame me for your lack of skill.

218
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,180
If it weren't you...

219
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,040
It's your fault, you mechanic!

220
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,080
You're the one who chose the bike.

221
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,425
It's your trash tuning job

222
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:07,785
that's to blame!

223
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,000
If you hadn't rigged it,

224
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,380
I'd have won!

225
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,580
Pathetic.

226
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,220
What did you say?

227
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,560
A real racer doesn't whine like a child.

228
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,091
Aren't you ashamed of yourself

229
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,239
in front of the crowd?

230
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,500
I'll handle the bike next time.

231
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,100
Let's have another race.

232
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,020
The racer...

233
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,780
is you.

234
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,540
You damn mechanic.

235
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,900
You'd better not race.

236
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,980
Okay, I'm on my way.

237
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,600
Where is Arashi-senpai?

238
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,100
He seems to be in a bit of trouble.

239
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,720
- Yay!
- Yay!

240
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,240
Do it!

241
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,460
Hey, they're here!

242
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,200
- They're here!
- Do it!

243
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,260
- So awesome!
- Wow! Arashi!

244
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,360
Awesome!

245
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,480
- Do it!
- Go for it!

246
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
Arashi, go for it!

247
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,900
What's going on?

248
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,080
Woo!

249
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,640
Oh.

250
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,400
Ah, is this the famous Arashi's boy?

251
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,720
Nice to meet you.

252
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Hello.

253
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,420
Don't make that face. He'll be fine.

254
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,194
Arashi doesn't do things

255
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:15,233
he can't handle.

256
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,260
Ah!

257
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,040
Ha!

258
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,120
- He's finished!
- Woo!

259
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,820
Rei?

260
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,100
I'm so glad you're okay!

261
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,960
Were you worried?

262
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,693
Because Raita-san said

263
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,458
this was a dangerous race.

264
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,120
It's just a race.

265
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,780
I...

266
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,500
There's so much I have to tell you.

267
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,880
Something to tell me?

268
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,154
You told me to prove

269
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,888
I could take responsibility, right?

270
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,860
I know I'm not there yet,

271
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,280
but I did my best.

272
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,040
I wanted to be the first to tell you.

273
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,040
Can I stay by

274
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,960
your side?

275
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,460
- Wow!
- Yay!

276
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,660
Hey!

277
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,900
This is rigged, isn't it?

278
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,660
Come here, let's compete again!

279
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,940
Where are you going, you damn mechanic?

280
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,900
I haven't lost yet.

281
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,760
You troublemaker.

282
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,440
You confuse me.

283
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,180
I didn't come to see you for this.

284
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,180
You asked me earlier, didn't you?

285
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,660
Can I stay by your side?

286
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,060
Mhm.

287
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,340
I'm answering that question.

288
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,340
Don't stop me.

289
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,120
I won't hold back anymore.

290
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,840
Are you okay?

291
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,420
Mhm.

292
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,157
Are you going to do another

293
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,579
dangerous race again?

294
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,480
Mhm...

295
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,620
Probably not.

296
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,280
I love the sound of engines,

297
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,720
but I don't need to ride a bike.

298
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,860
It's like building a house,

299
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,760
but you don't need to live in it.

300
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,580
Hmm?

301
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,138
Was that the reason

302
00:27:15,163 --> 00:27:17,096
you aimed to be an architect?

303
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,220
When I was a kid,

304
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,400
my mom would complain to my dad.

305
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,281
She'd say, 'You customize bikes, but why

306
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:31,226
don't you do the same with the house?'

307
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,600
That's when I thought,

308
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,580
I'll make both bikes and houses

309
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,880
cool.

310
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,100
But when I actually tried both,

311
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,860
it was insanely difficult.

312
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,620
But...

313
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,680
But I can't give up either.

314
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,140
I...

315
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,760
get what I want with my own strength.

316
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,720
It's like the rain on the day we met.

317
00:28:12,698 --> 00:28:13,520
Rei.

318
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,660
Hmm?

319
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,200
The time for you to court me

320
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,040
let it be over.

321
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,740
Huh?

322
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,620
No.

323
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,460
Don't say things like that.

324
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,440
Don't cry.

325
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,960
What I'm trying to say is...

326
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,800
This time, I'll court you.

327
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,880
You're terrible!

328
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,820
You can choose.

329
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
What?

330
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,660
Whether you'll become mine,

331
00:29:07,687 --> 00:29:09,447
or I'll become yours.

332
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,160
I...

333
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,820
won't choose either.

334
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,940
I'll have both.

335
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,700
You're a bad child.

336
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,760
You need a punishment.

337
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,420
No!

338
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,620
Kai-kun,

339
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,860
I love you.

340
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,320
No!

341
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,480
Calm down.

342
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,000
It's just a dream.

343
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,640
It's okay…

344
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,680
It's okay.

345
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,420
“Not Just the Rain, but
the Storm Approaches”

346
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,540
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

347
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,140
Rei.

348
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,394
If you don't hurry,

349
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,516
the lecture will start soon.

350
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,020
- Sorry, coming!
- Mhm.

351
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,540
(I'll become an architect)

352
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,580
(Please let me pass)

353
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,680
(I'll become an architect
Please let me pass)

354
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,840
I'll do my best.
