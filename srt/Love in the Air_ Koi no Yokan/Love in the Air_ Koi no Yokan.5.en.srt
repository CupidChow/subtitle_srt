1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
"Episode 5"

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,060
Good morning.

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,080
Good morning.

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,960
My darling.

5
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,180
How about we go on

6
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:39,240
a date after breakfast?

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,520
Mhm.

8
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,200
Ever ridden a motorcycle before?

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,200
Ever ridden on the back?

10
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:52,280
No.

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:53,740
Mhm.

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,180
So this is your first time?

13
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:07,772
Hop on.

14
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,480
Arashi, hurry up.

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,760
It should suit you.

16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,060
How is it?

17
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,860
It's cute.

18
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:44,327
Wait, I mean the shirt.

19
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,140
- Every piece suits Rei, right?
- Mhm.

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,600
That's what I thought.

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,120
Arashi is so cute!

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,080
Alright, let's take a picture.

23
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
It's weird.

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,320
You’re being too nice today.

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,420
I just want to spoil you.

26
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,180
I’ll turn into a no good person!

27
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,140
Go ahead.

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,780
I’ll whip you back into shape.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,140
Geez!

30
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,640
Rei?

31
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,800
And Arashi-senpai too.

32
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:37,048
Holding hands.

33
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,140
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

34
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,960
Do you have something to tell me?

35
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,100
Umm...

36
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,180
I...

37
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,060
I’m dating Arashi-senpai!

38
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,580
Yeah, I can see.

39
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,108
Also that you've been in love

40
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,991
with Arashi-senpai for quite a while.

41
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,405
Even when you were hitting on Rinka,

42
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:33,936
you didn’t seem that serious.

43
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,100
Kai!

44
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,046
Was it hard for you to admit, Rei,

45
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,204
because Arashi-senpai is a guy?

46
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,300
For me,

47
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,856
as long as Rei is happy,

48
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:55,919
I’m okay with it.

49
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,420
Kai...

50
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,660
I love you!

51
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:05,060
Look at the person next to you first.

52
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,880
I’m not jealous.

53
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:13,277
I know Kai is an important friend

54
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:14,286
to Rei.

55
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,766
But I do have a question

56
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:20,961
for Rei’s dear friend.

57
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,480
Who’s Rinka?

58
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,300
Fuma, over here.

59
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,300
I finally found you.

60
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,740
He's my boy.

61
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,260
My apologies.

62
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,387
Can we talk for a moment?

63
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,801
Do you know that this is

64
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,355
a dangerous place where outsiders

65
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:04,684
are not allowed to enter?

66
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,574
Anyone who sneaks in

67
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,279
doesn’t leave unscathed.

68
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,440
What should I do?

69
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,260
Depends on the offer,

70
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,220
but if I get to choose...

71
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,180
You understand, right?

72
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,997
What you need to trade

73
00:06:24,022 --> 00:06:26,177
to get out of here.

74
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,280
Just kidding.

75
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,255
Not everyone could resist

76
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,747
someone as cute as you,

77
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,380
but luckily I can.

78
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,380
Don't come to such a dangerous...

79
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,400
I will do whatever you want.

80
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,040
No kissing.

81
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,940
Tsk.

82
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:29,120
Why is he here?

83
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,960
Fuma wanted to see Kai.

84
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,680
He told me that on race day,

85
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,389
when you got separated from Rei,

86
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:37,100
he helped you leave the venue.

87
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,580
At that time,

88
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,467
I was so desperate that

89
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:43,045
my memory was a little fuzzy.

90
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,480
Let me introduce you again.

91
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,465
Fuma-san is Arashi-senpai’s

92
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,153
best friend and a racer.

93
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,960
And his name is...

94
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
Kai, right?

95
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,260
Leaving already?

96
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,867
I’ve fulfilled my obligation.

97
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:02,938
I have no reason to stay.

98
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,120
Cold, aren’t you?

99
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,180
You were so cute just a moment ago.

100
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,289
At least give me

101
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:17,695
your contact information.

102
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,460
At least give me your name!

103
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,840
Oh, Fuma-san,

104
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,535
you came to return something

105
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,746
Kai forgot, right?

106
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Ah, yeah. I left it in the car.

107
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,420
Want to come with me to get it?

108
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,240
Rei doesn’t know, does he?

109
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,380
- I’ll be right back.
- Mhm.

110
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,760
They seem to get along well.

111
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,320
That face of his...

112
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,040
Did I forget something?

113
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,800
Hey, tell me your phone number.

114
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,400
Don't you like me at all?

115
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,180
Yeah.

116
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,775
If you want to play,

117
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:22,936
please play with others.

118
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,400
If I wanted to play with someone else,

119
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:25,776
I wouldn’t be here.

120
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,203
Listen. I have no interest in

121
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,668
playing with you.

122
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,814
No matter how persistent you are,

123
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,860
my answer is no.

124
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,160
Okay, I give up this matter.

125
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,340
I'm glad you understand.

126
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,120
That time was then,

127
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,420
and now is now.

128
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,900
Let's start from the beginning.

129
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,011
I still don't know your birthday

130
00:11:53,027 --> 00:11:54,147
or blood type.

131
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,380
I don't know your favorite food, movies,

132
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,960
and most importantly,

133
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,600
Are you dating someone?

134
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,460
- Do you really want to know?
- Yeah.

135
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,740
Ask me when you are born again.

136
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,020
Did you understand?

137
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,080
Did you get that, Kai-kun?

138
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,640
Kai-kun.

139
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,300
I’m going to start courting you now.

140
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,760
Are you mad about Rinka?

141
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,420
No, it's nothing.

142
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,340
Good to hear.

143
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,820
More importantly,

144
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,628
you told your best friend

145
00:12:53,644 --> 00:12:55,324
about our relationship,

146
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,620
I'm glad.

147
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,700
Why?

148
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,700
Did you think I wouldn't tell him?

149
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,351
I wondered if you’d be scared

150
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,320
your friend would see you differently.

151
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,780
I was scared.

152
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,960
Falling for a guy all of a sudden.

153
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,500
But

154
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,960
I was going to tell Kai anyway,

155
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,020
because he is my precious friend.

156
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,660
Give me Kai's phone number!

157
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,960
Everyone’s awful.

158
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,460
Even he is the same.

159
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,565
He’ll just toss me aside

160
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,691
when he gets bored.

161
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,980
You’re listening to Love in the Air.

162
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,800
Everyone, how are you this morning?

163
00:14:20,335 --> 00:14:21,620
Today’s topic is,

164
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,528
‘How to forget someone
you want to forget.’

165
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,206
Someone using the name
Heartbreaking Fireworks

166
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:29,231
says

167
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,932
"If you live earnestly day by day,

168
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,637
you’ll naturally forget."

169
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,766
I see,

170
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,595
Heartbreaking Fireworks

171
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:39,680
is so devoted to your life.

172
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,391
Next up, someone named

173
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,188
The Canary That Can’t Sing says

174
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,020
"If you want to forget, work"

175
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,960
"Push yourself to the limit
until the pain becomes numb."

176
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,360
Oh dear, that sounds unhealthy.

177
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,892
And finally,

178
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,036
Snowman in Summer's

179
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,060
answer is interesting,

180
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,140
"You don't have to forget."

181
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,960
"The more you try to forget,
the more you remember."

182
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,430
In order to forget someone

183
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:16,966
you want to forget,

184
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:19,860
what methods do you have?

185
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,060
(Unknown: How are you?)

186
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,506
Alright, the next agenda item

187
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,476
is the T-shirt design.

188
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
That's already decided.

189
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:37,760
We're going with this.

190
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,600
I came up with it myself.

191
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,520
Isn’t this kind of outdated?

192
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,180
The color scheme is off too.

193
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,180
What’s wrong with it?

194
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,000
Look!

195
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,600
This and this.

196
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,280
100 points.

197
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,900
- You know, right?
- Stop doing this to your juniors.

198
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,180
- You don't understand. Give it a try.
- No way. It's lame.

199
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,380
- You don't understand.
- It's so lame.

200
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,560
- This is so good.
- I don't see anything good about it.

201
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,300
- Look at this design. Ever seen it?
- I can't take it.

202
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,900
(Unknown: Let’s meet again)

203
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,680
- Never, right?
- But the color isn't right.

204
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,120
- The color? It looks good.
- Both of you, calm down.

205
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,531
I’ll come up with a compromise

206
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:11,672
by tomorrow, okay?

207
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,600
How is it lame? "Connection?"

208
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,200
- What's "Connection?"
- "Connection?"

209
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,220
"Connection."

210
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Hello.

211
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
Yeah, I'm fine.

212
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,700
Huh?

213
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,120
Spare trash bags?

214
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,640
Bottom drawer in the kitchen.

215
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,360
Dad, did you have dinner?

216
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,090
There’s soup in the freezer

217
00:16:50,115 --> 00:16:51,635
from the other day.

218
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,840
Make sure you eat some vegetables too.

219
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,660
Yes. Bye.

220
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,420
Let’s leave it here for tonight.

221
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,740
Why?

222
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,580
Sorry.

223
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,540
I’ll make it up to you next time.

224
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,300
Geez.

225
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,940
You’d better call me.

226
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,540
Got it.

227
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,300
Good morning.

228
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,825
I came here because you

229
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,075
didn't give me a reply.

230
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:25,474
I knew it was you who

231
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:27,162
sent me that annoying mail.

232
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,320
Annoying? That’s harsh.

233
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,180
It is annoying.

234
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,094
I’m here because I want

235
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,399
to know more about you.

236
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,281
From this distance, I can’t even

237
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:39,704
tell the color of your eyes.

238
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,200
What color are they?

239
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,280
Why don't you wear glasses?

240
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,460
That wouldn’t help.

241
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,340
Love makes me blind.

242
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,840
Kai-kun.

243
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,260
I love you.

244
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,880
Kai-kun.

245
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,140
Kai-kun.

246
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,880
You okay?

247
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,200
You look pale.

248
00:19:09,287 --> 00:19:10,616
I just didn’t get enough sleep.

249
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,625
I'm off.

250
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,460
- I’m sorry.
- Do you know why I’m mad?

251
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,220
Because...

252
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,900
I gave Fuma-san your phone number?

253
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,720
Yeah.

254
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,760
- Can I stand up now?
- No.

255
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,780
Sit there until you’ve reflected enough.

256
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,634
I promise to guard your number

257
00:19:39,643 --> 00:19:41,323
with my life from now on!

258
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,160
Nope.

259
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,560
- Don't I look pitiful?
- Not at all.

260
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,640
Ugh...

261
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,580
(I’m sending you some care.)

262
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,220
( I’m worried about your health.
Make sure to eat properly.)

263
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,380
(From Fuma)

264
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,600
The determination

265
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,980
of...

266
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,940
wind?

267
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,960
How lame.

268
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,380
Here are your documents.

269
00:20:50,587 --> 00:20:52,309
Hey, do you know what flowers

270
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:54,391
are popular among young people?

271
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,051
Usually you send roses, right?

272
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,216
Who do you send them to?

273
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,309
These aren't flowers

274
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:00,465
for business partners.

275
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,520
Then why don't you choose flowers that

276
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,107
fit the image of the recipient?

277
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,680
That's it.

278
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,420
Sexy, fragile,

279
00:21:11,892 --> 00:21:13,452
sometimes mysterious.

280
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,880
But I'd like to send bright flowers.

281
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,320
The kind that makes you smile.

282
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,340
Do you smoke?

283
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,320
No.

284
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,080
Hey, you're being rude to your seniors.

285
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,520
Take a hit.

286
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,680
Isn't that right?

287
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,480
Kurosaki-san!

288
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,260
Hey, greet him properly.

289
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:57,707
You...

290
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,100
What’s your name?

291
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,440
Kai-kun,

292
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,880
I love you.

293
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,880
I also

294
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,860
love you too, Kurosaki-san.

295
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,940
Kai, what’s wrong?

296
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,100
You look dead.

297
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,360
That...

298
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,236
You already told Kurosaki-san

299
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:55,772
to stop doing that.

300
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,880
He's unrelated.

301
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,720
I did it to myself.

302
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,480
Hey!

303
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,920
Hold him!

304
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,200
Kurosaki-san!

305
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Help me. I beg you!

306
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,200
Please stop!

307
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,720
Help me!

308
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,180
I beg you!

309
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:29,460
Kurosaki-san!

310
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,880
You love me, right?

311
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,660
I don't need a boring toy.

312
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,200
Huh?

313
00:23:55,272 --> 00:23:58,352
I’m tired of you.

314
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,800
Help me!

315
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,440
When will I forget?

316
00:24:49,307 --> 00:24:50,187
Someone, please...

317
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,060
Help me.

318
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,300
Why did we come so early in the morning?

319
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,240
And why do I have to be part of it?

320
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,680
Kai?

321
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,400
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

322
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,940
Ah, there you are, Kai!

323
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,320
Can you kick this guy out of
the committee already?

324
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,520
Huh? I just pointed out
an error in the document.

325
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,840
Aren't you embarrassed
to make such a big fuss?

326
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,480
I'm not making a big fuss.

327
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,080
- Yes, you are.
- What do you know?

328
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,740
Kai, do something!

329
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,460
Be quiet!

330
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,380
Kai, are you listening?

331
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,680
- Hey.
- Who are you talking to?

332
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,600
Ugh.

333
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,820
- Enough.
- You're being too loud.

334
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,240
Everything...

335
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,080
I don’t care anymore.

336
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,200
I’m so sorry!

337
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,960
Don't worry about it.

338
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,940
- Hey!
- Kai!

339
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,220
- Kai!
- Hey, Kai!

340
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,180
- Kai!
- Kai, are you okay?

341
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,340
Don't touch him yet.

342
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,120
“Not Just the Rain, but
the Storm Approaches”

343
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,320
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

344
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,820
Kai.

345
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,400
Kai.

346
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,580
Kai.

347
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,560
Is it too sweet?

348
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,020
Kai-kun.

349
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,180
Kai-kun.

350
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,060
Kai-kun.

351
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,260
Calling him like that might be nice.

352
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,440
Why don't you wear glasses?

353
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,520
Kai.

354
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,420
Kai.

355
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,140
Kai.
