1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
"Episode 1"

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,740
Hey, this way.

3
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,940
- Yay!
- Dammit.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,560
Please show your code.

5
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,640
I'm an acquaintance of the host.

6
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,241
If you don't have a code,

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:53,625
you cannot enter.

8
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,720
Yahoo!

9
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,380
- Whoa!
- Hey! Hey!

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,960
- It's not to that extend.
- What are you doing?

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
Let's return.

12
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,160
I'm going in.

13
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,880
Are you serious?

14
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,389
No matter how you look at it,

15
00:01:36,414 --> 00:01:37,436
this is dangerous.

16
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,720
But we have to confirm if he's in there.

17
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,357
Wait here,

18
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:46,084
I don't want to drag you into this.

19
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,140
Hey, Rei!

20
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,120
That troublemaker...

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,560
Where should we go today?

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,860
- Huh?
- That's cheating. Invite me too.

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,880
Everyone's going.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,940
Let's go.

25
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,700
- I'm going too.
- Let's go.

26
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,060
Ah. Wait a minute.

27
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,160
- Huh?
- Why?

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,080
See you later.

29
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,880
- Please don't go.
- See you later.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,840
You're really pumped up, Arashi.

31
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,620
Of course. Vanished from the race.

32
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,600
More like forced to be vanished.

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,600
The legendary racers and mechanics

34
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,997
are competing tonight

35
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,154
without holding back.

36
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,040
Gets my adrenaline going.

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,380
You're still the same.

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,754
If it's exciting then it means

39
00:02:29,762 --> 00:02:31,074
there's some serious money and

40
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,616
shady organizations involved.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,420
You don't look like you're hating it.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Huh?

43
00:02:36,375 --> 00:02:39,555
Because your kids are cute so I like it.

44
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,260
- Wow!
- Hey.

45
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,540
I get it.

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,520
Nice body lines, right?

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,980
Still the same as ever.

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,000
Yay!

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,780
Lost badly, damn it! Not worth it!

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,051
There's still the big finale.

51
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:13,176
Apparently, that guy Arashi

52
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,459
will be in the final race.

53
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,960
Arashi... I just heard Arashi!

54
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,220
Excuse me, may I check your pass?

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,620
I'm a local resident.

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,303
I heard the noise and

57
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:27,508
came to check it out.

58
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,040
Trespassing, huh?

59
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,060
Let go of me!

60
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,920
We've got a rat! Catch that kid!

61
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,560
There is an intruder!

62
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,920
A hero here to crash the race?

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,526
But if there's someone scarier,

64
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:48,104
there's one person right here.

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,820
Hey!

66
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,420
Whoa!

67
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,620
Let go!

68
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,260
Sorry about this, Arashi-san!

69
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,700
Arashi.

70
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,932
Pretty bold of you to call me

71
00:04:27,948 --> 00:04:29,396
that without honorifics.

72
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,660
You troublemaker.

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,780
Strange, isn't it?

74
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,796
That someone as ordinary as me

75
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,850
would end up in an illegal race venue.

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,760
It all started on

77
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,960
a stormy night...

78
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,160
Heavy rain is covering all over.

79
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,660
Drivers, please drive safely.

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,340
Listening to 'Love in the Air'.

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,740
I'm Hideshima Fumika, the host.

82
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,760
No way! What's going on?

83
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,680
Huh?

84
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
Please start!

85
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,260
Ah, damn it! I give up!

86
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,200
Yes?

87
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,020
I'll take a look at the engine.

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,960
Open the hood of the car.

89
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,780
Huh? Really?

90
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,102
I can't help, so

91
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:49,415
this is the least I can do.

92
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,000
Hold this.

93
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,460
I was really stuck.

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,860
Thank you so much for helping me.

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,300
It's an old car.

96
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,200
It's my father's most important car.

97
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,925
If you're going to keep driving it,

98
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:33,839
you'd better learn some maintenance.

99
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,060
Next time, handle it yourself.

100
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,440
The helmet.

101
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,320
Ah.

102
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,080
You're really handsome.

103
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,220
Ah, no...

104
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,340
Thanks for the compliment.

105
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll be taking this back.

106
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,143
You'd better get home soon,

107
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:36,276
or you'll catch a cold.

108
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,860
I'd like to get home too.

109
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,180
Thank you so much!

110
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,960
Never mind. Hurry back.

111
00:09:20,032 --> 00:09:22,212
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

112
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,660
(Kaminichi University)

113
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,180
(Faculty of Engineering,
Department of Architecture)

114
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,608
He waited until I left and watched me

115
00:09:29,617 --> 00:09:31,225
drive off before he went back.

116
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,028
At first, I was like,

117
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:34,641
'Is he going to kill me?'

118
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,926
But he was really kind,

119
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,383
a genius mechanic.

120
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,500
And his face…

121
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,976
So handsome that everyone just

122
00:09:39,984 --> 00:09:41,336
clears the road for him, right.

123
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,400
How'd you know?

124
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,720
Because this is the third time

125
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:44,916
you've told that story.

126
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,160
I just want to talk about it,

127
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
so listen, will you?

128
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Do you realize you're being annoying?

129
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,050
Do you realize how

130
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,636
cold you're being, Kai?

131
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Now I do.

132
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,360
Hey!

133
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
Come on, just listen! You're being mean!

134
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,460
What's the conversation about?

135
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,480
Rinka.

136
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,740
Did you need me?

137
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,100
No, I was looking for Kai.

138
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,360
Huh? Are you two secretly dating?

139
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,040
Are you crazy?

140
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,040
So, what's up?

141
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,639
The seminar's get-together next month.

142
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,516
Do you know if any alumni are attending?

143
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,660
Oh, alumni…

144
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,207
I just met my senior Arashi before,

145
00:10:29,223 --> 00:10:30,223
so I knew.

146
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,080
You saw Arashi-senpai?

147
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
He was on campus?

148
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:35,695
He graduated already, so why?

149
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,260
- When? How!?
- Too close.

150
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,780
Back up a bit.

151
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,020
Sorry.

152
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,480
By the way, who's Arashi-senpai?

153
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,800
You don't know?

154
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,860
No way…

155
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,900
You don't know Arashi-senpai?

156
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,420
Which Arashi?

157
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,087
He entered on a special scholarship,

158
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:00,956
graduated at the top of his class with

159
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,300
the highest scores in history.

160
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,400
From what I heard,

161
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,127
he's been selected multiple times in

162
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:09,940
international design competitions.

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,392
It is said that his family is

164
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,267
involved in some kind of business,

165
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,832
but the details are still a mystery.

166
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,343
The mystery around him

167
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,649
is part of the charm!

168
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,700
I get that.

169
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,654
My older brother was

170
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,670
always praising Arashi-senpai.

171
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,500
I admired him so much that I joined,

172
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,724
but it's disappointing

173
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:39,959
he graduated already.

174
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,460
Does your brother like guys?

175
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,800
Haa...

176
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,700
Rei.

177
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Didn't you also praise that biker guy?

178
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,600
I was just complimenting him.

179
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,920
- We're just complimenting him too, yes?
- I don't know why you're upset,

180
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,200
but it's weird to say that.

181
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,238
If you think something is beautiful,

182
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,972
gender has nothing to do with it.

183
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,800
And at least for our generation,

184
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,940
stop looking at others with prejudice.

185
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,337
Kai, let me know if you hear about

186
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:24,009
the alumni coming to the event?

187
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,200
- I'll check for you.
- Yeah.

188
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,620
Rinka.

189
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,880
I don't have any prejudice! It's just...

190
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,200
Speaking without thinking.

191
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,080
Let me sum it up in two words,

192
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,400
heart broken.

193
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,231
I haven't been rejected yet!

194
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:52,434
I'm still courting.

195
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,100
What's so special about Arashi anyway?

196
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,594
Can't even compete

197
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,844
with the motorcycle guy.

198
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,760
- Rinka, need any help?
- I'm fine. Focus on your own work.

199
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,340
- Rinka, let me carry that for you.
- No, it's super light.

200
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,260
Rinka, aren't you getting hungry?

201
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,760
Rei.

202
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,948
Hey, first-year, what's up?

203
00:13:37,964 --> 00:13:39,355
Looking so down.

204
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,600
Want some of my drink?

205
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,756
Hey, control yourself a bit.

206
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:43,795
If you keep acting up,

207
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,656
you'll regret it later.

208
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,060
No, I don't have the guts...

209
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,419
No, not you. I meant

210
00:13:47,435 --> 00:13:49,115
the legendary alumnus,

211
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,860
also known as 'the Savior.'

212
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,400
Senpai shows up

213
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,600
just at the right time.

214
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,020
That... Don't tell me that...

215
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,520
It's a storm out there.

216
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,463
Let's give a round of applause for

217
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:34,456
Arashi-san, who arrived with the storm!

218
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,000
- Yay!
- Arashi-senpai!

219
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,580
Well...

220
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,800
You are...

221
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,240
Arashi-senpai?

222
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,480
Yeah. And...

223
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,860
Who are you?

224
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,220
Arashi-senpai is...

225
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,040
is the motorcycle guy...

226
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,720
The harsh truth.

227
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,460
And he didn't even remember me.

228
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,840
I guess I don't need to thank anymore.

229
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,500
Let's go home.

230
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,360
Ah. Huh?

231
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,600
Hey! Don't tell me that...

232
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,560
Ah, dammit!

233
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,540
Am I cursed with cars?

234
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,220
Dammit!

235
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,080
Ugh, dumb head...

236
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Arashi...

237
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,020
Senpai!

238
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,280
Are you honking?

239
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,420
Oh, no, um...

240
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,620
The engine won't start.

241
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,980
Senpai, please help me.

242
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,660
Rei, was it?

243
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,740
Yes, that's right.

244
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,880
If you want to seduce me,

245
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,440
try being more subtle.

246
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,940
The battery is broken.

247
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,560
Did I hear him wrong?

248
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,120
I hear an unusual noise.

249
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,620
Give up. Leave it here tonight,

250
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,660
no tow company will come in this rain.

251
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,860
Wait.

252
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,860
This car means a lot to me…

253
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,480
I want to call a tow service right now.

254
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,960
Do you know a good one?

255
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,260
I know one.

256
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,320
It's expensive, though. Can you pay?

257
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,900
Yes, I can.

258
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,001
Thank you for letting me

259
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:40,377
use the bathroom.

260
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,873
Kai, I figured out what Arashi-senpai's

261
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:45,154
family does for a living.

262
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,603
You should have told me your family

263
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:48,736
owns a repair shop.

264
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,640
If I'd known, I wouldn't have hesitated.

265
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,860
I mean, about the repair fee, of course.

266
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,420
Sit here.

267
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,740
Let me dry your hair.

268
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,940
That feels nice.

269
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,320
Want me to keep going?

270
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,040
Is that okay?

271
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,340
Huh?

272
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,740
Wait. What are you doing?

273
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,660
Just discussing your payment.

274
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,660
You mean you like guys?

275
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,620
Depends on the person.

276
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,765
But you're the one

277
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,117
who started this, right?

278
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,620
No, I didn't.

279
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,220
Didn't you?

280
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,020
Hey.

281
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,280
Staring at me all that time,

282
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,900
holding on to me?

283
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,020
That...

284
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm not trying to seduce you.

285
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,560
Really?

286
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,440
Huh? Wait...

287
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,100
Why is he so handsome?

288
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,040
But...

289
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,460
Don't tease me,

290
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:26,188
you came here yourself.

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,320
Let go!

292
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,720
Don't misinterpret things!

293
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,849
Even if you paid me,

294
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:45,537
I wouldn't sleep with you!

295
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,660
Where are you going?

296
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,160
I'm going home.

297
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,700
I don't want to be here.

298
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,404
Is your only good feature

299
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:52,678
your face, you bastard?

300
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,620
What do you want?

301
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,000
Go to sleep.

302
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,540
I'm not in the mood anymore.

303
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,500
Who would believe that?

304
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,000
Then go outside and catch a cold.

305
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm going to sleep.

306
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:36,662
(00:12 AM)

307
00:20:36,663 --> 00:20:42,492
(01:25 AM)

308
00:20:42,493 --> 00:20:50,110
(02:29 AM)

309
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,960
Haa... I survived.

310
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,580
Just because you're wearing clothes

311
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,720
doesn't mean anything.

312
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,780
Don't look! You jerk!

313
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,520
What's that?

314
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,140
Want me to show you

315
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,620
what a real jerk is?

316
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Go die and turn into stardust!

317
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,420
Oww. That hurt.

318
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,760
Rei.

319
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,788
As your senpai,

320
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:16,680
let me give you some advice,

321
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,800
stop acting foolish.

322
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,740
Aren't you going?

323
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,040
Do you want to continue?

324
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,060
I'll tell everyone at the university

325
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,420
you're a jerk!

326
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,620
Dammit, so annoying.

327
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,760
Both the weather and that guy!

328
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,200
Do you need to go to the hospital?

329
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,480
I'm perfectly fine!

330
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,305
Then is there something

331
00:23:08,321 --> 00:23:09,766
you want to talk about?

332
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,050
You've been acting different

333
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,116
since the drinking party.

334
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,940
And then you suddenly went home.

335
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,600
It's obviously weird.

336
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,140
Yes.

337
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,660
Yes.

338
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,020
Oh, the repairs.

339
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Yes.

340
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,400
Yes, I'll pick it up tomorrow.

341
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,520
Yes.

342
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,460
Thank you.

343
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,800
Great,

344
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,520
I totally forgot.

345
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,951
The alternator has been replaced and

346
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,951
a new battery has also been installed.

347
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,260
Wow, the engine is running.

348
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,240
Now, here's the bill.

349
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,420
(Invoice Mr. Amemiya Rei
Amount charged: 700 000 yen)

350
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,640
Amamiya-san?

351
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,260
Oh no. There's no way I can pay this!

352
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,820
Oh, you're Arashi's boy?

353
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,960
Huh? B-boy?

354
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:28,806
If you're Arashi's boy, then you don't

355
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:29,836
have to worry about this.

356
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,780
Boy? No, I'm...

357
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,108
It seems he did some

358
00:24:33,124 --> 00:24:34,616
of the repairs himself.

359
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,874
If you're Arashi's boy,

360
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:37,056
the charges are waived.

361
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
I'm not anything to him!

362
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Besides,

363
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,120
what if he tampered with my car?

364
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,700
Customer,

365
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,880
Listen, I don't mean to brag,

366
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,640
but he is exceptionally skilled.

367
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,556
Besides his work

368
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,916
in architectural design,

369
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,140
he occasionally takes on repairs

370
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,205
for VIP clients.

371
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,432
His skills and passion for cars

372
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:07,977
are unquestionable.

373
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,960
I'm sorry.

374
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,740
Then just sign this receipt.

375
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,820
(Receipt
Signation: Amemiya Rei)

376
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,460
All done.

377
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,180
