00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,900
(Kaminichi University)

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,380
(Faculty of Engineering,
Department of Architecture)

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,940
Rei.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,920
Dodging loan sharks?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,940
Don't scare me like that.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,060
I'm not running away.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,320
(Unkown:
I never let my debtors escape)

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,000
I have to pay for car repairs.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,040
Repair fee? How much?

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,516
For now, I'll take a part-time job.

12
00:00:47,532 --> 00:00:48,732
15 hours a day,

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,780
1,200 yen per hour, six days a week.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,686
What about sleep, meals,

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,663
and assignments?

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,340
That's impossible.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,860
Haa...

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,180
Alright.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,320
Enough.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,498
You're wasting precious time.

21
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:08,723
We're late now.

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,260
- Whoa, oh my gosh!
- Wow, so cool!

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,900
Arashi.

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,161
Are there any other

25
00:01:19,186 --> 00:01:20,686
distinguishing features?

26
00:01:22,537 --> 00:01:23,780
Distinguishing features?

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,640
Beautiful, slender legs like an art.

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,720
Proportional chest.

29
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,172
A face that should be

30
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:35,708
national treasures.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,220
What's going on?

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,000
First-year with bright eyes.

33
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,080
Found you.

34
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,660
Why are you...

35
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,220
Rei?

36
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,500
Let go!

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,916
I told you, I never let

38
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:58,002
my debtors escape.

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,540
Or would you prefer to settle it here?

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,240
You've already paid in part, on the bed.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,380
On the bed?

42
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,440
On the bed?

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,440
Let's talk elsewhere!

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,340
Stop making misleading statements!

45
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,975
I'll pay the rest after

46
00:02:18,983 --> 00:02:20,178
working part-time.

47
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,180
It won't be immediate, though.

48
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,720
Another promise you can't keep?

49
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,803
I despise people who

50
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:31,628
don't honor their promises.

51
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,220
When did I ever break a promise?

52
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,040
You've already forgotten?

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,856
I warned you the repairs

54
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,385
would be expensive.

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,074
And the boy who cried wolf

56
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,210
said he'd pay.

57
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,900
Who's the boy who cried wolf?

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,280
- You claimed it'd be free!
- Not free.

59
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,580
I said money wasn't necessary.

60
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,440
What nonsense.

61
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,400
You scammer! You're heart isn't human!

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,560
I hate disrespectful brats.

63
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,300
You mean adult,

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,900
think you can scare me?

65
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,420
- Arashi-senpai.
- Arashi-senpai.

66
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,540
- Arashi-senpai.
- Arashi-senpai.

67
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,560
Where did Arashi-senpai go?

68
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,802
I want him to review

69
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,490
my rejected projects.

70
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,120
Maybe that way.

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,260
They said to come find him here.

72
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,360
Don't see him anywhere.

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,700
Too close! Move back!

74
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,280
What are you doing?

75
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,680
If you make too much noise,

76
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,320
they'll find out we're here together.

77
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,900
Call me Arashi-senpai.

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,260
Why?

79
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,800
Say it: ‘Arashi-senpai, '

80
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
'please let Rei go.'

81
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,260
No way.

82
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,780
What's your deal?

83
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,960
These eyes are unfair.

84
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,600
There's no choice but to beg.

85
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,020
Huh? What?

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,440
Am I being teased?

87
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,400
Alight. Let's think about

88
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,105
something meaningful.

89
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,700
Ummm...

90
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,520
Like...

91
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,620
I can't... Oh no.

92
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,380
I've reached my limit.

93
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,760
Arashi-senpai.

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,380
Please let Rei go.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
"Rei will never..."

96
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,840
"talk cheeky again"

97
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
Say it.

98
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,900
Rei will never...

99
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,200
talk cheeky...

100
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,540
again.

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Good boy.

102
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,500
Everyone has left.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,620
I told you I'd collect my debts.

104
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,660
I also warned you to speak politely.

105
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,779
If you don't listen to me, I'll have to

106
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,264
resort to forceful measures.

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,620
You can leave.

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,240
You're not attacking me?

109
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,190
Even though I look like this,

110
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,575
I have standards.

111
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:35,148
Disrespectful kids aren't my type.

112
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
This humiliation…

113
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,560
I'll get you back.

114
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,480
I'll find your weak spot!

115
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,880
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love -"

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,054
Welcome to "Love in the Air!"

117
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,011
Here's your afternoon trivia.

118
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,695
How long does a giraffe sleep?

119
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:22,601
Just one minute a day!

120
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,570
Their high blood pressure makes

121
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:25,936
lying down tough,

122
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,620
(Tall, long legs, perfect appearance)
a real weakness!

123
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,180
(Went to a world-class design competition,
became a top-ranking scholarship student)

124
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:28,640
(Has a car, know how to repair cars,
rich)

125
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,180
Ugh.

126
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,991
I'd rather know Arashi's weaknesses

127
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:34,359
than a giraffe's.

128
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,032
Giraffes, with four stomachs,

129
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,594
cries "moo", are actually part

130
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,042
of the cow family.

131
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,105
Maybe learning about their kin

132
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,855
will help you know giraffes even better!

133
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,080
That's it.

134
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,760
Man, your finish is top-notch as always.

135
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,980
Cheers to the best mechanic.

136
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,380
Thanks.

137
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,173
But seriously, can you stop

138
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:37,204
cornering better than the racers?

139
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,720
My confidence's already shaky

140
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,612
before the big competition.

141
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,940
Didn't think you were

142
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:45,034
the sensitive type.

143
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,080
Oh wow,

144
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,880
am I hearing things wrong?

145
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,720
I heard some background characters

146
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,690
from some group talked about

147
00:09:55,715 --> 00:09:57,395
racing and cornering.

148
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,896
Amateurs in a competition...

149
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,456
I wish they'd quit it

150
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,295
because it degrades

151
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:06,318
the whole competition.

152
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,580
Speaking of the race,

153
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,000
it's a top secret competition,

154
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,558
they say the organizers

155
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,156
are super dangerous.

156
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,080
Oh yeah, totally legit.

157
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,914
If everyone heard the name,

158
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:21,710
they would definitely be scared.

159
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,539
So it's a race that no one

160
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,244
can have a say in it.

161
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,440
But well, my dad's close with the guy.

162
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,845
I've been to his house

163
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,995
and had dinner with him!

164
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,760
Wow, that's amazing. That's great.

165
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,799
In this competition,

166
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:40,815
I can take you to meet him.

167
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,200
Don't chicken out.

168
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,700
The sponsor is that famous...

169
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,880
What?

170
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,920
Rule number one,

171
00:10:50,936 --> 00:10:53,470
never discuss race details in public.

172
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,520
Are you involved?

173
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,620
Whatever. Just like a racer,

174
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,840
I'll just show you the difference

175
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:09,156
in skill on the track.

176
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,180
So be prepared...

177
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,460
I think it's time to go home.

178
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,380
Hey!

179
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,100
If you're so scared, why don't you

180
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,344
go pray for rain and

181
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,203
hope the race is canceled?

182
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,300
I don't want it to be cancelled,

183
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,293
or I won't be able to experience

184
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:31,613
the exciting moment.

185
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,080
But rain? I don't hate it.

186
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,860
Isomura-senpai!

187
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,580
You're close with Arashi-san, right?

188
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Well, he's a senior whom I respect.

189
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,260
- Why?
- What's his weakness?

190
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,300
Rei.

191
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,540
Weakness?

192
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,578
Even if I knew, why would I tell you?

193
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:07,634
He's my idol.

194
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,340
What? Damn it.

195
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,800
Hey, where are you going?

196
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
Sorry for earlier.

197
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,180
I apologize on his behalf.

198
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,640
Rinka, listen!

199
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,860
You can't trust Arashi.

200
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,605
How would you feel if someone

201
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:26,554
insulted someone you respect?

202
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,740
That is how I feel right now.

203
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,620
- Let's go.
- Yes.

204
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,980
What's wrong with you?

205
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,440
Don't fights with senior and your crush.

206
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:47,020
Well...

207
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,800
Ugh, I just can't figure out anything.

208
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,200
His weakness...

209
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,523
You really want to know about

210
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:57,668
Arashi-senpai?

211
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Shikura.

212
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,647
You know something? Spill it!

213
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,900
Well, it's just a rumor...

214
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,180
Huh?

215
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,020
Really?

216
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,940
It's still just a rumor.

217
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,826
If you want to be sure, you have to

218
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:16,240
see it with your own eyes.

219
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,540
Please present your code.

220
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,820
I'm a friend of the host.

221
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,600
No code, no entry.

222
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,280
Damn it!

223
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,500
Hey, if you're not going in, move it.

224
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Huh?

225
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,880
Hey!

226
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,440
Who do you think you're talking to?

227
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,740
No idea. Who are you?

228
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,860
I...

229
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,880
Ah.

230
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,060
Hello, Papa.

231
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,920
No. You see...

232
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,590
I was told that I can't get in

233
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:19,815
without a code.

234
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,720
Ah... Yes.

235
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,720
Thank you very much.

236
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,300
Yes.

237
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,160
You may enter.

238
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,100
Let's go!

239
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,740
What's with him?

240
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,933
Stay here. I don't want you

241
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,019
caught up in this.

242
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,660
Hey, Rei!

243
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,940
That troublemaker...

244
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,220
Yay!

245
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,860
Lost everything again! Screw this!

246
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,915
Relax, the main event's still to come.

247
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:22,298
Arashi's racing.

248
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,180
Arashi? Did they just say Arashi?

249
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,418
Excuse me,

250
00:15:28,442 --> 00:15:30,508
may I check your pass?

251
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,660
I'm a local resident.

252
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,691
I heard the noise and

253
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:35,871
came to check it out.

254
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,100
Trespassing, huh?

255
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,220
Let go of me!

256
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,140
We've got a rat! Catch that kid!

257
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,760
There is an intruder!

258
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,260
A hero disrupting the race?

259
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,762
But if there's someone scarier,

260
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,098
there's one person right here.

261
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,240
I'm leaving early. Apologies.

262
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,800
What? You're leaving?

263
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,105
I'm prepared to take

264
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:17,802
appropriate punishment.

265
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,000
- Hey, what are you doing?
- This motorcycle is perfect.

266
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,873
All that's left is for a skilled racer

267
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:24,316
to fill what's lacking.

268
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,834
This isn't just any race,

269
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:27,196
we're racing together.

270
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,580
This one is not normal either.

271
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,320
It's special too.

272
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,640
Hey!

273
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,860
Oh no!

274
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,080
Let go of me!

275
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,640
I'm sorry, Arashi-san.

276
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,040
Arashi.

277
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
Bold of you to call me like that.

278
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,140
Troublemaker.

279
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,633
This is the biggest mess

280
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,098
I've ever been in.

281
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,940
Arashi-san.

282
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,180
- We'll take it from here...
- No need.

283
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,380
I'll handle it.

284
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,160
We're close.

285
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,280
Please keep an eye on him.

286
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,240
He's my boy.

287
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm sorry for being rude.

288
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,920
We need to talk.

289
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,500
Ouch!

290
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,240
Oww!

291
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,480
Ouch!

292
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,700
Hey! Don't hit me!

293
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,540
Even my parents never did that!

294
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,120
Say something.

295
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,660
Kids need discipline.

296
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,800
Do you even realize what you did?

297
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,780
I...

298
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,773
If I wasn't there,

299
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,218
what would've happened?

300
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,340
Sorry.

301
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't need apologies.

302
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,240
I'm asking you if you understand.

303
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,340
Do you want to throw your future away?

304
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,022
Any idiot should be able to

305
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:12,186
figure it out if he thinks

306
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:13,304
about it a little.

307
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,025
Even if they know it's an illegal race,

308
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,736
people will still turn a blind eye,

309
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,266
which means the organizer

310
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:20,954
is a dangerous person.

311
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,558
It's not hard to make

312
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:24,668
an idiot disappear.

313
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,920
- I didn't know...
- Not only that.

314
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,120
For adults,

315
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,054
apologizing and crying about it

316
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:36,758
won't make up for it.

317
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,880
Don't be naive.

318
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,809
You are also participating

319
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,354
in an illegal race!

320
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,080
You protected for me just now...

321
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,740
Aren't you in trouble?

322
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,107
I will take responsibility

323
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,263
for my own choices.

324
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,180
Because it is underground racing,

325
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,895
it is a place where people

326
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,747
want to risk their lives,

327
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,224
and who want to master

328
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:06,255
the art of maintenance.

329
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,240
As a mechanic,

330
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,711
I think learning from

331
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:11,360
underground racing is useful.

332
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,661
I am prepared to pay

333
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:19,366
for something important.

334
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,560
I didn't mean to give you any trouble,

335
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,480
I just wanted revenge,

336
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,800
that's all.

337
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,180
Idiot.

338
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,389
All you ever do is call me an idiot!

339
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,693
Is that all you can say?

340
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,820
I'm an idiot anyway.

341
00:20:51,312 --> 00:20:54,012
You're right, I am unable to think!

342
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,286
Don't think I'm going to let you

343
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,670
get away with it.

344
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,400
Watch me,

345
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,760
I'm going to make you fall for me.

346
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,360
And don't call me stupid anymore.

347
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm waiting.

348
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,560
Keep your promise.

349
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,380
Stay the night.

350
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,260
Huh?

351
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,920
This way, there's no way to turn back...

352
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,040
Trying to make me fall in love?

353
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,080
Fall in love?

354
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,720
Yay!

355
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,420
- Whoa!
- Go!

356
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,260
Wait, that's not Arashi.

357
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,660
A win's a win!

358
00:22:33,784 --> 00:22:35,104
Thanks, man!

359
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,900
They're truly amateurs.

360
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,869
None of them can even hope

361
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:48,165
to challenge me.

362
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,480
No matter how we compete, I'll win.

363
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,540
Why don't you prove it, then?

364
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,680
Did you just say that?

365
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,598
You can bet on anything

366
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:01,463
on tonight's match.

367
00:23:01,488 --> 00:23:04,020
Whatever you want, be it money,

368
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,460
fame, or lover.

369
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,460
Fuma! Come hang out with us tonight!

370
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,620
Wow, that's great suggestion.

371
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,440
But sorry,

372
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,560
I have something to do today.

373
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,340
Huh, why?

374
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,200
Were you angry just now?

375
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,360
- Can't you go?
- Sorry.

376
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,100
(Are you okay?
Not in danger, right?)

377
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,000
Dammit, what did I just say?

378
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,920
Want to take a shower?

379
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,480
