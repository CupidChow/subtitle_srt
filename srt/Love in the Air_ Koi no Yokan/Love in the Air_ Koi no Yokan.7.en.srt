00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,314
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:04,457 --> 00:00:06,857
Are you alright?

3
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:11,540
It's been a while.

4
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:14,345
I saw you earlier, with

5
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:15,774
that man at the restaurant.

6
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:22,889
Found a discarded second-hand good,

7
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:26,171
taking pity on it.

8
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:28,807
Such a kind person.

9
00:00:29,257 --> 00:00:31,714
He's nothing like you.

10
00:00:32,342 --> 00:00:34,628
Stay away from me.

11
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:45,020
Kai-kun, I told you, didn't I?

12
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:47,828
Serious people are boring.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,600
No matter how much it's fixed up,

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,435
if the toy itself is dull,

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,146
it'll be tossed aside again in no time.

16
00:01:01,314 --> 00:01:02,639
Who would ever take

17
00:01:02,655 --> 00:01:04,162
someone like you seriously?

18
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:11,828
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

19
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,171
Who are you?

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,228
What did you say to him?

21
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:17,714
Oh, excuse me.

22
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:19,392
My shoulder bumped into him

23
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:21,216
because of my carelessness,

24
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,134
I'm afraid his shoulder will dislocate

25
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:24,884
or a bone might break.

26
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:28,285
So I asked him.

27
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:30,499
Since everything seems fine,

28
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,538
I'll take my leave.

29
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,425
Hey!

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,750
- Never mind. I'm fine.
- How?

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,000
- You're shaking like this.
- It's said it's nothing.

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,850
- Kai!
- Don't follow me!

33
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,125
He's nothing like that guy.

34
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,175
Fuma-san cares for me.

35
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,300
He doesn't hurt me.

36
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,625
He shows me love.

37
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,650
But...

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,675
Again...

39
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:41,250
It's happening again.

40
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,700
It always ends up like this.

41
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:49,300
I don't need a boring toy anymore.

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,900
I've grown tired of you.

43
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:55,775
I...

44
00:02:56,783 --> 00:02:58,358
I never want to feel like that again.

45
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:00,825
Never!

46
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,625
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

47
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:23,275
(Let's meet today?)

48
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:24,975
(Working on a project
with friends today)

49
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:26,725
(Call me when you're done)

50
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,625
(Still not done?)

51
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:29,825
(Fell asleep)

52
00:04:29,825 --> 00:04:30,825
(I'll come pick you up)

53
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:31,625
(I have plans with an upperclassman)

54
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,600
(Busy)

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,650
(Tired)

56
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,650
(I'll call back later)

57
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,650
(I have plans)

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,725
(Meeting Rei)

59
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,225
(I'm worried about you)

60
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,075
Kai, why don't you go back home?

61
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,075
Am I bothering you?

62
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,300
No, that's not it.

63
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,975
I'm grateful to you, Rei.

64
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,568
For letting me stay this long.

65
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,226
.Hey, things were going well

66
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:40,931
with Fuma-san, right?

67
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,460
I even saw him picking you

68
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:43,531
up from university.

69
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,275
Why are you running away?

70
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,650
I'm not running away.

71
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,656
Fuma loves you, but are

72
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,140
you breaking up with him?

73
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,625
First of all, we are not dating.

74
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:02,350
And he doesn't love me.

75
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,100
He just thinks I'm a weird person.

76
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,279
Sorry, but can I

77
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,717
stay just a little longer?

78
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,650
I'm looking into a new dorm tomorrow.

79
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,225
You're going that far?

80
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:28,300
I...

81
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,150
I think Kai wants to cry

82
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,870
but is forcing himself to do something

83
00:07:32,894 --> 00:07:34,495
to keep himself from crying.

84
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,350
You should talk to Fuma-san.

85
00:07:49,307 --> 00:07:50,600
Fuma-san!

86
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,600
Good morning.

87
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:53,375
Good morning.

88
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:55,003
I'm going to stop by

89
00:07:55,027 --> 00:07:56,440
the student affairs office,

90
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:57,585
I'll go ahead!

91
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,325
Good morning, Kai.

92
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:07,125
Wait.

93
00:08:10,175 --> 00:08:11,125
Sorry.

94
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,050
Please stop this.

95
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:16,100
Huh?

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,425
Ambushing,

97
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:20,525
touching,

98
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,675
calling my name.

99
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,850
Are you serious?

100
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:28,260
.What happened after you

101
00:08:28,277 --> 00:08:29,768
left the restaurant that day?

102
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,525
What did that man say to you?

103
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,450
Whatever I do is none of your business.

104
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,225
I'm worried about you, Kai.

105
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:40,675
Don't you get it?

106
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,725
I'm tired of you.

107
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:48,600
Huh?

108
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:52,325
You suddenly disappeared and said that?

109
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:55,525
It's boring.

110
00:08:58,775 --> 00:08:59,931
I was just having fun,

111
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,189
but you were serious.

112
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:03,540
'I love you' and 'You're the only one'.

113
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:05,220
I got goosebumps listening to it.

114
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:09,548
Why are you saying

115
00:09:09,564 --> 00:09:10,775
things that aren't true?

116
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:12,375
It's not untrue.

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,400
Running errands, making food,

118
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,300
sleeping on the floor...

119
00:09:20,657 --> 00:09:23,007
It's too heavy to even be funny.

120
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:27,400
The last restaurant was decent,

121
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:29,681
But I'm tired of having you

122
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,735
feel sorry for me.

123
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,782
In the end, you're just taking care

124
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,540
of an innocent younger guy

125
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,500
and thought you were also innocent.

126
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:42,950
It's annoying.

127
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't believe you.

128
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:53,125
What you think doesn't matter to me.

129
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't go.

130
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,565
It's over.

131
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:01,257
Not that it ever really began.

132
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,175
- Yay!
- Woo!

133
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:13,225
Seriously?

134
00:10:13,925 --> 00:10:16,075
- Woo!
- No way.

135
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,125
The top racer actually lost?

136
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:24,500
Dammit!

137
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,450
Woo! Nice cornering!

138
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,700
Aren't you a bit too hot-headed?

139
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,550
Drinks will taste great tonight, huh?

140
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,400
Not yet. They still don't taste great.

141
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,725
Because of him.

142
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,162
For the disgrace he brought on me,

143
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,304
I'll make sure to get him back.

144
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:46,875
Ah... But in that last race...

145
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,925
You let that guy ride

146
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:51,682
a specially designed motorcycle,

147
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:54,962
but with one glance,

148
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,384
he immediately adjusted it.

149
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,300
Ah... Damn it!

150
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,950
Don't remind me! It pisses me off!

151
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,675
Arashi!

152
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:14,050
You okay?

153
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,221
Seems like I can hear

154
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:16,605
a little kitten meowing.

155
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,150
Apparently giraffes moo.

156
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:24,200
Huh?

157
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,175
His weakness...

158
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,875
is that kitten.

159
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,975
Haa...

160
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,000
I might be done for.

161
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,673
Of course I don't think that everything

162
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:52,965
Kai said is what he really meant.

163
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,375
That last day, he was acting strange.

164
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,325
He's trying to push me away,

165
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,176
He must be handling

166
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,881
something on his own.

167
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,000
Then go now.

168
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,284
Be persistent until

169
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:13,989
you can ease his burden.

170
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,650
I want to, but...

171
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:24,675
I've already been doing that.

172
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm scared.

173
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:37,650
I don't want to hurt him.

174
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,550
If I get rejected more than this...

175
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:46,375
Rei.

176
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,565
You know, 'idiot' can sometimes

177
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:50,901
mean 'adorable, ' too."

178
00:12:52,975 --> 00:12:53,825
Huh?

179
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,383
Words don't always equal feelings,

180
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,225
and actions don't, either.

181
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,195
Especially with someone like Kai,

182
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:01,126
who's so stubborn.

183
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,929
He never says what he really feels!

184
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,210
Even I know that

185
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,325
because we're friends.

186
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:08,600
But...

187
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,468
even if I understand that,

188
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,860
I can't help him.

189
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,425
It frustrates me,

190
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,993
but... I think you're

191
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,853
the only one who can

192
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,550
tend to Kai's heart right now, Fuma-san.

193
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,475
So...

194
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:34,777
We're both having trouble with people

195
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:36,208
who don't mean what they say.

196
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,825
Thanks. I'm going.

197
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,275
Sorry. I spilled a secret.

198
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:57,450
Idiot.

199
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:00,025
You meant 'adorable', right?

200
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,150
This time, I meant it literally.

201
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:05,550
Huh?

202
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,675
I need to move.

203
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,775
Is this what you are looking for?

204
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,050
Another hallucination...

205
00:15:39,675 --> 00:15:43,050
"Idle, lecher, eldest son."

206
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,950
You're real? How?

207
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,443
The management company for

208
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:54,154
this building happens to be my father's.

209
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:55,201
I borrowed a key.

210
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,775
Sorry.

211
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,575
You're a real stalker?

212
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:03,400
I'll sue you for trespassing!

213
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,600
"Idle, lecher, eldest son."

214
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:08,489
"Has a younger brother

215
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:09,676
and sister he's close with."

216
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,350
"Seems to want to introduce
them to me someday."

217
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:12,400
Stop it.

218
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:15,932
"Porridge with egg, orange jelly."

219
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,875
"I wonder how he knows my favorites."

220
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:18,950
Stop it, stop it!

221
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,075
"A player but takes racing seriously."

222
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:23,070
"A narcissist, but undeniably charming."

223
00:16:23,175 --> 00:16:25,325
"Annoying, but makes me smile."

224
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,975
"'Even when tired, he comes to see me."

225
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,200
"He is persistent but always makes me
make me happy."

226
00:16:33,382 --> 00:16:34,757
Stop.

227
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,725
Please stop.

228
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:40,125
"That's why I get scared."

229
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,575
- "One day, you'll grow tired of me."
- One day, you'll grow tired of me.

230
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,100
- "Because I'm boring."
- Because I'm boring.

231
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,275
And I'm not beautiful.

232
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,885
What should I do so

233
00:16:56,894 --> 00:16:58,151
you won't get tired of me?

234
00:16:58,175 --> 00:16:59,604
Please don't say love to anyone

235
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:00,613
except me.

236
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,800
Be nice to me alone.

237
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,325
Only take me out for a meal.

238
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,550
Don't leave me.

239
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:10,800
I'll try my best.

240
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,225
- "So please..."
- So please...

241
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,808
- "only like me."
- only like me.

242
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:22,025
"I love you, Fuma-san."

243
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,850
Is this just another game to you?

244
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,475
Look at me. Look into my eyes.

245
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,025
It's not fair for you to say it first.

246
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,209
So, I'll say it.

247
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,701
I don't just like you anymore, Kai.

248
00:18:01,225 --> 00:18:02,520
I love you.

249
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,350
It's not just ‘like'.

250
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,100
But it's love.

251
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,125
I...

252
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,633
I love you too, Fuma-san.

253
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:30,908
I love you.

254
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:33,975
I really love you.

255
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,225
I hear you.

256
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,825
You finally said it.

257
00:18:41,757 --> 00:18:42,957
Thank you.

258
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,250
I love you...

259
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
so please stay by my side.

260
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,279
Am I finally getting

261
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:58,576
promoted from servant?

262
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,383
Fuma-san.

263
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,725
When are you going to grow tired of me?

264
00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:12,275
Do you want to hear sweet words?

265
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,550
Good night.

266
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:23,950
Kai, what are you afraid of?

267
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,875
I'm not going anywhere,

268
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:31,033
I'm staying here.

269
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:39,125
Understood.

270
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:41,650
I accept you.

271
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:45,100
Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?

272
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:51,165
- Don't play around.
- I'm serious.

273
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,142
- I won't stop you anymore.
- Wait.

274
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,254
It's not that I don't want

275
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:57,325
to sleep with Kai.

276
00:19:57,825 --> 00:19:59,675
Actually, I want to do it.

277
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,200
But that's not why I came.

278
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,075
I just wanted to see you.

279
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:07,260
Though, of course,

280
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:08,635
I wouldn't mind a kiss.

281
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,925
Don't talk. Just hold me.

282
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,125
Can I?

283
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,200
Don't you want me?

284
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,325
I do.

285
00:20:32,908 --> 00:20:35,110
But I don't just want your body.

286
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:37,368
I want your heart too.

287
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,479
Fuma-san, hurry...

288
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:49,676
Hurry and get bored of me already.

289
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,382
Is that really what you want?

290
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:54,475
Please...

291
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,050
Don't get bored of me.

292
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:01,300
Don't ever get bored of me.

293
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,200
Kai and Fuma-san are dating...

294
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:13,000
Really? Like, really?

295
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,100
Mmm.

296
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,025
Whoa!

297
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:25,700
This way!

298
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,575
Hey, it's amazing!

299
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,084
You were open about your

300
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:34,053
relationship with Arashi-san, so...

301
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,600
I'm seriously so happy for you!

302
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,200
But, Kai...

303
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:43,450
Are you really okay with this?

304
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Hey, hey, what's the confirmation?

305
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,025
If you diss me, Kai will get angry.

306
00:22:48,675 --> 00:22:49,925
Are you going to get mad?

307
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,925
Rei, are you coming to tomorrow's race?

308
00:22:53,925 --> 00:22:54,987
Everyone will get mad if

309
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:56,051
someone attacks their partner.

310
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,500
- What about the race?"
- Oh, I'll be there.

311
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,675
Did you finish your assignments?

312
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:03,020
You don't know how much

313
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,708
Kai loves me, don't you?

314
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,363
Can we stick to one topic at a time?

315
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:08,758
My head hurts.

316
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,450
You don't understand.

317
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:14,850
- Huh?
- Yes.

318
00:23:15,225 --> 00:23:16,900
The topic is always the same.

319
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,282
Kai gets flustered and

320
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:20,329
tries to change it,

321
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:21,626
and I just bring it back.

322
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:26,825
Fuma-san, don't you ever get

323
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:28,153
told you're too stubborn?

324
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,675
Rei.

325
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,050
Don't criticize my boyfriend.

326
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:36,475
Got it.

327
00:23:38,075 --> 00:23:39,775
I'll go finish my assignments.

328
00:23:42,332 --> 00:23:43,957
Take your time and relax

329
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:45,682
before tomorrow's race.

330
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:55,275
Hey, my adorable protector,

331
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,675
can I kiss you?

332
00:23:59,825 --> 00:24:00,650
No...

333
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,875
Not in public.

334
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,787
Who else would I protect

335
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:08,310
if not my boyfriend?

336
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,200
"Love in the air,"

337
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:18,825
Tonight through tomorrow morning,

338
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,765
seasonal winds and sudden rain will

339
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,875
cause temperatures

340
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,148
to drop significantly.

341
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:26,585
Please be aware of the temperature

342
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,677
difference when going outside.

343
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:31,425
Thanks.

344
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,375
Text me when you're inside.

345
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,050
In 30 seconds?

346
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:39,291
Got it.

347
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,850
Good luck with your assignments.

348
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,550
Arashi.

349
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,476
I'll be there to cheer you on

350
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:49,585
at tomorrow's race.

351
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:00,000
See you later.

352
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,375
(I'm home!)

353
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,250
Arashi?

354
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,550
What's going on? Arashi?

355
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,950
Ah! Help!

356
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:38,625
Help, Arashi!

357
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,775
Arashi!

358
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:43,725
Arashi!

359
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,450
(Can you be the sky
at the end of the line?)

360
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,550
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

361
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,400
Hey, Kai.

362
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,425
Hmm?

363
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,000
What color do you like?

364
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,350
Emerald green.

365
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,900
What's your favorite food?

366
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Mhm...

367
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,525
I like everything.

368
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,450
Rice.

369
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,600
Rice porridge.

370
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,750
Orange jelly.

371
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,100
Kai.

372
00:26:24,475 --> 00:26:25,325
Hmm?

373
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,250
Kai.

374
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,525
What?

375
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:28,325
Kai.

376
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:29,300
Hmm?

377
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:30,475
My Kai.

378
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,875
Here it is again.

379
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,400
Again.

380
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,325
Kai.

381
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,450
What?

382
00:26:37,025 --> 00:26:37,950
Hey!

383
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:40,150
Enough.

384
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:41,025
Hey!

385
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,175
Ah.

386
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,925
What's with you?
