1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
(Episode 6)
Aren't you embarrassed?

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,740
(Episode 6)
I'm not making a big fuss.

3
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,220
- Yes, you are.
- What do you know?

4
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,000
He started it!

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,520
Kai, do something!

6
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,200
Enough.

7
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,320
Everything...

8
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,920
I don't care anymore.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:18,780
Kai!

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,040
- Kai!
- Hey, Kai!

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,900
- Kai!
- Kai, are you okay?

12
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,240
Don't touch him yet.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,340
Hey, Kai! Kai!

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,620
Are you alright, sir?

15
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,860
Hmm?

16
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,227
Ah, it's nothing.

17
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,150
I'm just a bit nervous, I guess.

18
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,320
Huh?

19
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,320
Maybe it's that...

20
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,160
the turmoil of love.

21
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,480
Fuma's pure heart wavered.

22
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,080
Is it arrhythmia?

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,909
You've been working and

24
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:46,019
playing harder than usual lately.

25
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,400
As expected. You can tell, huh?

26
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,840
Well, it's not arrhythmia.

27
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,692
Currently, I haven't received

28
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,723
a single response,

29
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,076
whether I go to sleep or wake up.

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,320
There's no progress.

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,920
But I won't be discouraged.

32
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:00,888
What are you talking about?

33
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,820
Oh, I feel better now.

34
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,120
Hello? Kai-kun?

35
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,480
Oh, Rei?

36
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,280
Got it. I'm on my way!

37
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,580
What are the plans after this?

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,260
Everything is adjustable.

39
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:24,980
As expected of you.

40
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,920
I'm coming.

41
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,140
Hang on, Kai.

42
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,480
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,340
Fuma-san!

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,800
Rei! Where's Kai?!

45
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,640
He just fell asleep.

46
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,425
Don't wake him up.

47
00:02:58,433 --> 00:03:00,536
Let me explain what's going on first.

48
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Fuma-san, listen to me.

49
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,792
Kai got dizzy and fell unconscious

50
00:03:08,816 --> 00:03:10,256
at the university.

51
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,159
The doctor said it was

52
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,183
a psychogenic fever caused by

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,460
lack of sleep and excessive stress.

54
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,560
Stress?

55
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,242
Being a member of the

56
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:22,437
executive committee of

57
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,696
the school festival is hard work.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,375
But Kai does a lot because he

59
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,456
is a caring and responsible person.

60
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,200
So it's probably too much of a burden.

61
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,040
Even though I was there for him,

62
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,600
but I couldn't help him.

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm the same as you.

64
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,520
He still have a fever,

65
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,376
and the doctor says he

66
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
should really be hospitalized.

67
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,440
Huh?

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,723
He didn't want to go because

69
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:56,535
he didn't want to worry his parents.

70
00:03:57,653 --> 00:04:00,920
I want to do the committee duties

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,620
for parts that others cannot complete.

72
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,760
How good-natured can you be?

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,920
That's why...

74
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,300
Can I trust you?

75
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,520
Of course.

76
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,100
I promise

77
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,342
I won't do anything weird

78
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,558
to your friend.

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,890
When Kai talks about Fuma-san,

80
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:37,672
he seems to have a bit of fun.

81
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,900
What? What's that?

82
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,080
Just take care of him.

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,871
If I was just playing around,

84
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,207
would I be this worried?

85
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,940
Even I'm surprised myself.

86
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,900
- Don't go.
- What's wrong? Kai?

87
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,980
You're sweating a lot.

88
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,635
I'm not going anywhere.

89
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:33,916
Let's get you cleaned up, okay?

90
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,240
Don't go, please.

91
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,700
It's okay. I'm here.

92
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,440
No one's going to hurt you.

93
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,683
I don't want to have

94
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:50,909
such a dream anymore.

95
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,740
Dream?

96
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,460
Tell me, Kai.

97
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,140
Who's been making you feel this way?

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,280
Dad.

99
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,880
Huh?

100
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:11,623
Where should I start laughing?

101
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,380
Being mistaken for your dad?

102
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,960
Or about cursing your dad?

103
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,960
Why do you have to look so cute,

104
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,171
even when you're sick?

105
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,210
Why do your eyes always

106
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:34,304
look like you're asking for help?

107
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,140
Is there anything I can do?”

108
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,156
Changing the bed sheet,

109
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:09,532
wiping your body,

110
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,975
This is the first time I've done

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,484
something for someone else.

112
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,060
It's a first for me, really.

113
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,920
I swear.

114
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,940
Nope.

115
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,400
I promised Rei.

116
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,580
Laundry time.

117
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,720
Oh, did you wake up? Seductive boy.

118
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,240
What are you even talking about?

119
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,880
Huh? You don't remember?

120
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,840
You clung to me all night.

121
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:24,960
Huh?

122
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,540
I didn't...

123
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,150
You don't know how much I

124
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:32,822
endured that fierce temptation.

125
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,700
Oh, the committee work.

126
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,960
Rei is doing it for you.

127
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,560
- You have to rest now.
- But...

128
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,652
No buts.

129
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,820
Wait a moment.

130
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,320
Here. A present.

131
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,540
I don't want it.

132
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,740
Do you want to know why sunflowers?

133
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,500
I don't want to know.

134
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,000
Because they face the sky.

135
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,140
Even if I can't be your sun,

136
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,561
I want you to look at these

137
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:26,706
and remember that

138
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,844
the wind always wraps the sky

139
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:30,194
and watches over you.

140
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,035
That's so cheesy.

141
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,760
Alright.

142
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,518
Now the stubborn, selfish

143
00:09:40,543 --> 00:09:41,908
and grumpy time is over.

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,060
I'll make you food.

145
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,969
Please take your medicine

146
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,109
and go back to bed.

147
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,500
Good morning.

148
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,440
It's ‘Love in the air'.

149
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,889
This morning, due to low

150
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:17,107
atmospheric pressure,

151
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:18,865
temperatures are spiking.

152
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,623
Be cautious of sudden

153
00:10:20,648 --> 00:10:21,904
strong gusts of wind.

154
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,100
- Now, here's the first track for today.
- Haa...

155
00:10:24,335 --> 00:10:25,535
"Sunflower"

156
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,260
Finally halfway there!

157
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,960
Don't overdo it.

158
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,654
Don't overdo it. If you collapse too,

159
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,788
we're in trouble.

160
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,100
Yeah. Thanks.

161
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,000
That's quite the workload.

162
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,472
Kai tried to handle all

163
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:47,464
of this on his own. I can't believe it.

164
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,776
When he is in trouble,

165
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,667
that guy doesn't really tell me.

166
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,180
If only I'd noticed sooner...

167
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,726
Sometimes we don't know

168
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,876
what's in our heart.

169
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,740
After realizing it, just do our best.

170
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,040
Fuma is doing the same now.

171
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,980
Fuma-san...

172
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,720
I wonder if he's been kicked out?

173
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,240
Huh?

174
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,907
Kai's oblivious

175
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:28,612
when it comes to himself.

176
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,940
So it's a trial for Fuma, huh?

177
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,631
It would be great if he could pass.

178
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,920
Rei.

179
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,400
- Why are you worrying about others?
- Huh?

180
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,640
Well...

181
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,660
we've already

182
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,420
overcome it, haven't we?

183
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,840
- Not yet.
- Huh?

184
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,780
We've only done a fifth of it.

185
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,499
There's still twice

186
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,382
as much material in the car.

187
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,040
You're right.

188
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,200
We have a long way to go.

189
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,560
But...

190
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,556
But if you get over it,

191
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:16,962
it'll be good, right?

192
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,760
Let's find out. As soon as possible!

193
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:40,007
Sorry for the wait.

194
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Please eat.

195
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,642
I've never made it for

196
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,173
my younger brother or sister,

197
00:12:48,211 --> 00:12:49,751
but it's probably alright.

198
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,140
I'm better now.

199
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,140
It's time for you to go home.

200
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,220
You know what's worse

201
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:07,136
than a one-night stand?

202
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,298
Being discarded after being

203
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:09,384
completely used up.

204
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,780
I spent all night taking care of you.

205
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,490
And now that I'm no longer needed,

206
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,701
you're kicking me out?

207
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,053
I may be shameless,

208
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,826
but I'm still sensitive, you know.

209
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,520
What do you want?

210
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:30,512
You already know.

211
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,920
I won't give it to you.

212
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,260
I'm not going to sleep with you.

213
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,180
No matter what it is,

214
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,400
I can't give you what you want.

215
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,940
I see...

216
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,080
I guess you don't know after all.

217
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,720
Sure, I wanted to sleep with you.

218
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,780
But that's old news.

219
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,340
What I want now is

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,080
stop ignoring me.

221
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,520
Pick up the phone sometimes,

222
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,520
reply to a message here and there.

223
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,080
Don't run away when we meet.

224
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,600
And most importantly,

225
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,980
let me woo you.

226
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,880
That's all I'm asking for.

227
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll back off for now.

228
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,263
But once you're fully recovered,

229
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,552
you'd better be ready.

230
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,060
Push all you want, I'm not interested.

231
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,473
By the way, there's some

232
00:14:43,497 --> 00:14:44,520
jelly in the fridge.

233
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,320
Take care of yourself.

234
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,360
I don't like owing people.

235
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,680
Thanks for everything.

236
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,660
Next time, I won't let you escape.

237
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,700
You'll never catch me.

(Kaminiji University)

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,980
(Faculty of Engineering
Bachelor of Architecture Program)

240
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,240
- Sorry!
- Sorry!"

241
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,105
We relied on you way too much.

242
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:35,128
So you pushed yourself too hard,

243
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,520
especially as your senior.

244
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,337
I'm sorry too!

245
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,040
You're always helping me out.

246
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,100
Kai.

247
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,380
Today, you're just going to sit.

248
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,240
- Huh?
- Geez!

249
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,020
You need to rest and rest!

250
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,160
Now, everyone, let's get to work!

251
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,760
Work!

252
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,340
I'm just a burden, aren't I?

253
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,920
That's not true.

254
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,212
Because Kai has been

255
00:16:07,237 --> 00:16:08,517
working hard all along,

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,760
everyone is able to do this well.

257
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,840
Thank you.

258
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,500
This is all going to be a success.

259
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,000
Honey!

260
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,640
Sorry! You forgot something!

261
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
I didn't really forget anything, right?

262
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,080
You're still a little warm.

263
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,580
Just rest here for a while.

264
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,600
Did you come here to stop me?

265
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,934
If it's something important to you,

266
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:05,129
I won't stop you.

267
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,192
But...

268
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,379
I want a reward for coming

269
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:10,504
to pick you up.

270
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,000
A cute smile would be enough.

271
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,680
Ha!

272
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,680
Oh!

273
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,480
Ha!

274
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,740
Cha!

275
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:41,824
Shoo!

276
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,100
Ha!

277
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,220
Ugh, you're noisy!

278
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,445
You're not going to leave

279
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:49,526
even if I tell you to, right?

280
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,331
So at least be still and be quiet!

281
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,000
Wonderful!

282
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:56,452
You understand the heart of

283
00:17:56,477 --> 00:17:57,679
your future boyfriend.

284
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,860
Just kidding.

285
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
What's this?

286
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:28,040
Whoosh.

287
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,460
A breeze.

288
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,060
It's just three lines.

289
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,380
Why draw it on my hand?

290
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,420
To mark you as mine.

291
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,620
Haa...

292
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,060
You are good at it.

293
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm an architecture student.

294
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,980
Fuma-san.

295
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,820
No matter what you write,

296
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,020
you belong to no one

297
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
but yourself.

298
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,840
How are you not blushing after all this?

299
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,160
Not at all.

300
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,066
I want to change,

301
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,691
can I borrow your clothes?

302
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,460
Mmm.

303
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,600
Hey Kai, have you become an idiot?

304
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,160
Just now you...

305
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,080
were waiting for a kiss?

306
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,240
Huh?

307
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,780
You're making me sleep on the floor?

308
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,120
You came uninvited, it can't be helped.

309
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:10,300
Sharing a bed...

310
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,019
What kind of relationship is that?

311
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,700
Don't come up to the bed after I sleep.

312
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,780
How untrustworthy am I?

313
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,880
I've been a player in the past,

314
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,655
but since sleeping with you,

315
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,249
I haven't touched anyone else.

316
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,020
I'm not an idiot.

317
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,300
Fine, once.

318
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,840
Twice.

319
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,989
Alright, three times.

320
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,678
But no more, I swear!

321
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,400
I haven't seen anyone in two months.

322
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:01,707
Okay. I'll listen to you this time.

323
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,080
This time or another time,

324
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,820
it's me who wins.

325
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,420
It can't be helped.

326
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:14,007
I already lost.

327
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,160
Goodnight.

328
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,080
What are you staring at?

329
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,500
Your palm lines?

330
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,030
Wanna read mine?

331
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,756
Tell me about my love life!

332
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:02,300
Skyrocketing.

333
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,280
Seriously?

334
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,240
So annoying.

335
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,480
Umm...

336
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,780
Do you just have endless time and money?

337
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,999
Well, enough to support

338
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:25,891
Kai for the rest of my life.

339
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,960
I didn't ask for it.

340
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:33,487
If you don't eat,

341
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,040
you won't have energy.

342
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,120
I can do it by myself.

343
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,453
If my siblings saw this,

344
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:46,998
they'd be laughing.

345
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,680
You're close with them?

346
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,280
Want to know?

347
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,000
My brother's a third-year in college,

348
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,340
my sister's a freshman.

349
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,980
We're close, but they're stubborn,

350
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:05,872
persistent, and troublesome.

351
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:07,706
Being an older brother

352
00:23:07,731 --> 00:23:08,753
is a real headache.

353
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
I'm the one with a headache.

354
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,620
Same personality.

355
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,780
The best three siblings, right?

356
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,400
Do you have any siblings, Kai?

357
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,460
I am an only child.

358
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,142
My parents divorced

359
00:23:26,158 --> 00:23:27,501
and I live with my father.

360
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,640
I can't imagine a lively house.

361
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,540
How about you come and meet my siblings?

362
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,340
They'll make you forget loneliness.

363
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,600
No, I'm not lonely.

364
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,305
I've been living alone

365
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,476
since high school.

366
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,640
Is that so?

367
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,573
I stay at my relative's house

368
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:49,949
near the school.

369
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,440
The commute was super easy.

370
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,980
Kai-kun.

371
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,000
Don't call me that.

372
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560
Just ‘Kai' is fine.

373
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,660
The other way feels fake.

374
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:11,900
Mm.

375
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,540
Kai.

376
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,920
Kai.

377
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,380
Kai is already prepared, yes?

378
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,840
Fuma-san,

379
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,560
they're disappearing.

380
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,640
What should I do?

381
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,360
Fuma-san?

382
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,660
No, what should I do?

383
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,140
Huh?

384
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,200
It's nothing.

385
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,520
How to draw better?

386
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,740
You have to practice, right?

387
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,701
I started drawing when I took

388
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,012
the university entrance exam.

389
00:25:10,037 --> 00:25:12,657
What about before that?

390
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,500
When I started living alone at 15,

391
00:25:16,998 --> 00:25:18,146
I was a bad boy who did

392
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:19,376
whatever he wanted to do.

393
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:21,004
Believe it or not, I was a troublemaker

394
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:22,055
in high school.

395
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,908
Did you get that

396
00:25:23,924 --> 00:25:25,798
chest piercing back then?

397
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,840
It's almost closed up.

398
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,380
Ah.

399
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,260
Right. Sorry.

400
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,720
I have to go back to work.

401
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,280
Wait.

402
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,600
Excuse me, I'm off.

403
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,100
It's tastier

404
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,420
eating with someone else.

405
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:54,160
Thanks for the meal.

406
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,780
Haa...

407
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,000
Hey there, Kai-kun.

408
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,920
It's been a while.

409
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,340
You're looking well.

410
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,240
(Can you be the sky
at the end of the line?)

411
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,280
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

412
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
Don't go.
