00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,300
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,680
Let's listen to "Love in The Air"

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,480
How was everyone's morning?

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,241
Today's topic is

5
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,946
"It's too late to regret"

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,523
Everyone must have something they

7
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:12,952
regret but didn't realize it

8
00:00:12,977 --> 00:00:14,177
in time, right?

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,880
Watch me,

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,060
I'm going to make you fall for me.

11
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,560
For example, "I should have said it."

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,320
Dammit.

13
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,280
The future of love...

14
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,920
Why did I say that?

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,580
Finally...

16
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,810
Go back to the beginning.

17
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:36,835
What will you do next?

18
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,740
Here, change your clothes.

19
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,657
Before we say goodbye this morning,

20
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,836
I wish everyone...

21
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,420
- to be cheerful.
- Should fit.

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,420
Then let's listen to this song.

23
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,440
I'm sure.

24
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,700
"Rainstorm"

25
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:00,800
(Boxer shorts, size S)

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Are you kidding me?

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm not that small!

28
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,780
How's the size?

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,500
Awesome.

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,260
Presentation materials for a project.

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:44,920
Could I ever create something like this?

32
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,420
Sure,

33
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,840
if you're willing to work for it.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,180
What are you doing?

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,800
What do you think?

36
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,520
Oww!

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,980
Thought I was going to kiss you?

38
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,600
No.

39
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,280
With how you're going,

40
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,600
it'll take you decades to ‘win' me.”

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,220
It won't take that long!

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
You think so?

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,642
Once you hit your second year,

44
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:31,347
assignments double.

45
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,600
What does that mean?

46
00:02:36,205 --> 00:02:38,320
Meaning, if you want to ‘win' me,

47
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,975
better aim for your first year

48
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:41,643
while you still have free time.

49
00:02:41,667 --> 00:02:42,507
No.

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,000
Still, you have to use your time wisely.

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,040
Even then, it'll be tough for Rei.

52
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,820
Don't look down on me.

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,700
A month.

54
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Huh?

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,457
I'll make you fall for me in a month,

56
00:02:57,482 --> 00:02:58,482
guaranteed!

57
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,620
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,060
This deadline here.

59
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,860
(Special class, submit the assignment)

60
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,140
After that...

61
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,680
(Final exam)
There is a final exam next...

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,380
(Final exam)

63
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:35,905
Then...

64
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,080
(Additional commentary)

65
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,740
Not enough time.

66
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,520
I'll never make it!

67
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,940
Kai.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,920
Don't ignore my calls. I'm worried.

69
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:01,786
Oh, sorry.

70
00:05:01,795 --> 00:05:03,232
A lot of things happened.

71
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,169
Ans you? Did you get home okay

72
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:07,310
after everything?

73
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,580
Yeah, somehow.

74
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,180
Oh, that's a relief.

75
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,287
About all the things you mentioned,

76
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:23,335
What is this?

77
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,860
A lot of things...

78
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,420
A lot of things!

79
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,640
Hello, Fuma Delivery.

80
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,580
I won't ask anything.

81
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,740
Huh? Why? No problem at all.

82
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,032
C'mon, ask me!

83
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,956
‘Why do you look so happy today?'

84
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,840
Hey.

85
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,780
Hey.

86
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,600
You know, as your best friend,

87
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,342
I have to say you should take more

88
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,810
interest in other people.

89
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,540
Right back at you.

90
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,300
Well, well,

91
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,290
if it isn't the top racer

92
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:14,005
and his genius mechanic, right?

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,834
I've already lined up

94
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,530
your next challenger.

95
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,600
It shouldn't be difficult, right?

96
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,786
Let's teach that brat a lesson

97
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:27,194
to be humble.

98
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,620
"Brat?"

99
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,900
Yes.

100
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,180
That brat...

101
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,040
The one whose body only grows.

102
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,747
Mhm.

103
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,000
Mhmmm!

104
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,580
The racer with the ‘special invite'?

105
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,287
I'm the type of person who

106
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:46,236
can't refuse if someone asks me.

107
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,660
So kind.

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,489
That's great.

109
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:51,856
Only hot guys can get in there, right?

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,940
That's me.

111
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,540
How many times do I have to tell you?

112
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,820
- Oh, wait, that's cheating. Me too.
- Who are you calling? This kid...

113
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,720
Hey.

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,820
Baba!

115
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,100
Hmm?

116
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Hmm, what will Eri-chan teach?

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,580
Huh, what should we do?

118
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,290
It's impossible to win over the

119
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,095
legendary Arashi-senpai in a month.

120
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,520
Yeah.

121
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,160
Impossible, right?

122
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,663
By the way, you've changed from

123
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:31,367
Rinka to Arashi-senpai?

124
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,640
Not at all.

125
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,580
I don't like Arashi-senpai at all.

126
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,520
Just want revenge.

127
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,920
Hmm?

128
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,100
Thanks.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,120
In your heart,

130
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,960
who's really in here?

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,680
Huh?

132
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,720
Good morning!

133
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,700
Ow!

134
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,568
Don't joke around.

135
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:25,037
Help me think this through.

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,920
Go see Arashi-senpai every day.

137
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,880
Huh, that's all?

138
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,060
Did you know?

139
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,600
Fortune favors the bold.

140
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Alright.

141
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,680
"Fortune..."

142
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,840
"favors the bold?"

143
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,560
That's right.

144
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,020
People who take action will have

145
00:08:53,045 --> 00:08:54,316
a better chance of success than

146
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,516
those who do nothing.

147
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,485
Alright!

148
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,100
That's so simple!

149
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,860
So innocent.

150
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,980
(Day 1)

151
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,340
Arashi-senpai!

152
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,740
What is it?

153
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,020
Is Arashi-senpai here?

154
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,380
He's out at the design office today.

155
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,360
No clue when he'll be back.

156
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,260
Is that so?

157
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,200
(Day 2)

158
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,840
Excuse me. Where's Arashi-senpai?

159
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,120
Too bad. He just left in the car.

160
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,080
(Day 3...)

161
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,340
Arashi-senpai!

162
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,020
Hello.

163
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,100
You're here every day.

164
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,000
That guy's been busy lately.

165
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,980
I'll come again.

166
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,900
So how's that plan going?

167
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
I haven't seen him at all.

168
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,460
If you can't solve the first problem,

169
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
you can't go to the next one.

170
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,160
Another thing...

171
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
There's the work, too.

172
00:10:52,197 --> 00:10:53,978
If you don't hurry up, you won't be

173
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,384
able to submit it in time.

174
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,500
Yes.

175
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,040
What you said is right.

176
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,700
Arashi-senpai!

177
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,680
Umm...

178
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,300
Raita-san said I could sit here.

179
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,260
See? I'm not in the way.

180
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Sorry.

181
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,120
I'll leave no.

182
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,040
You eaten?

183
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,420
What do you want, Senpai?

184
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,080
Trying to learn about me?

185
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,220
No! I'm just asking for the order.

186
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,700
And what do you like, Rei?

187
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,160
Hamburg and...

188
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,880
Fried rice and...

189
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,700
Uhm, stir-fried vegetables.

190
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,220
Mami-san, I'll have these.

191
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,080
Okay.

192
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,700
Huh?

193
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:40,000
I didn't ask you to order what I like.

194
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,760
Too late, idiot.

195
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,668
You're trying to trick me

196
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:53,777
into answering,

197
00:12:53,802 --> 00:12:55,340
it's still 10 years too early.

198
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
Calling me stupid again.

199
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,960
So,

200
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,540
what's your big plan to ‘win' me?

201
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,720
Can't see it at all.

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,600
Keep your voice down!

203
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,880
The people around will hear everything.

204
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:12,320
Huh?

205
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,600
Embarrassed of the people around?

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,900
You could always back out.

207
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,380
Don't talk like I don't dare.

208
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,739
I'm trying to woo this guy.

209
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:31,122
Support me, please.

210
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,840
Good luck!

211
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,940
- Oh!
- Oh!

212
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,520
Good luck!

213
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
Dammit.

214
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,740
Good luck, idiot.

215
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,440
Don't be mad, I said I'm sorry.

216
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,875
You tricked me, made me angry,

217
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,376
and then I yelled in the store.

218
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,609
And you laughed because

219
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,636
you think it was funny.

220
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,620
I won't forgive you.

221
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,780
I laughed because I thought it was cute.

222
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,220
It's different from mocking.

223
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,660
What?

224
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,100
Wait up.

225
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,200
Let's talk properly.

226
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,060
Talking about what?

227
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,952
Next time, if you want to come,

228
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:37,976
contact me.

229
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,380
Don't waste your time waiting for me.

230
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,680
I told you to use your time wisely.

231
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,660
If I'm at the garage, I'll contact you.

232
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
That means...

233
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,800
- You're starting to like me?
- No.

234
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,040
Just having fun around you.

235
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,660
You're teasing me again.

236
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,951
So today, let's reward

237
00:15:06,976 --> 00:15:08,656
the kid who tried hard.

238
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,827
Try using the word "cute"

239
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:13,053
instead of "stupid".

240
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,920
Too late.

241
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,900
Cute kid.

242
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,220
Good luck.

243
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,240
Cute kid.

244
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,400
Hey.

245
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,560
Hey.

246
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,708
If you're not going to follow me,

247
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:44,919
I'll leave you here.

248
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,240
Arashi-senpai is cheating.

249
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,800
This makes the current rules obsolete.

250
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,556
On the other hand, doing so

251
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:03,036
can have negative effects.

252
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,380
For example, with today's new look,

253
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,197
there may be more strict regulations

254
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:09,822
than we can handle.

255
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,260
Also, when it comes to architecture,

256
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,720
there are other methods

257
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,920
(Arashi: I'll go to the garage early today)
that are added for the same purpose.

258
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,880
Success!

259
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,629
Then next week,

260
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:21,910
we'll continue on page 23.

261
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:23,556
Please prepare yourself.

262
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,360
Then I'll go back first.

263
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,680
Oh, wait, is the work done?

264
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,040
Uh, I have to go outside.

265
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,484
You know, we have to submit the work

266
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,257
by 8:30 tomorrow morning.

267
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,600
Let's not go see Arashi-senpai today.

268
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,780
Don't worry, I told you it's okay.

269
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,020
Easy, easy.

270
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,020
Rei, give me a moment.

271
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,380
Yes?

272
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,700
I have something to talk about.

273
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,840
Do you have time tomorrow?

274
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,520
Mhm, sure.

275
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,700
Mhm.

276
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,320
Maybe spring has arrived for Rei.

277
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,420
Huh?

278
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,260
Huh?

279
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,620
Huh?

280
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,240
That's good.

281
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,220
Yeah, well...

282
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,600
What kind of reaction is that?

283
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,660
Have you forgotten who you like?

284
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,660
It's not like that.

285
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,460
That's already sure.

286
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,840
"Sure?"

287
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

288
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,060
You're good.

289
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,280
Right?

290
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,980
I'm confident about this.

291
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,880
When's the deadline?

292
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,560
Why?

293
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,180
I just thought I'd treat you to a meal

294
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,420
for an idiot.

295
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,860
"Idiot"

296
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,000
means "cute."

297
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,340
It's okay if you don't want it.

298
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,520
Wait a minute.

299
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,560
I'll go.

300
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,520
I'll wait at the motorbike.

301
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,460
Hurry up and follow me.

302
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,400
I'm done.

303
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,180
Mhm...

304
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,780
Haa...

305
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,940
Let's sleep a bit.

306
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,620
If you want to seduce me,

307
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,080
make it more natural.

308
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,340
Yes?

309
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,780
Huh?

310
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,820
What time is it?

311
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,320
Oh no!

312
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm sorry!

313
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,060
I can't accept this work.

314
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:24,060
But I finished it on time.

315
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,882
You and the other students

316
00:20:26,898 --> 00:20:28,831
have the same amount of time.

317
00:20:28,947 --> 00:20:30,538
And everyone else besides you

318
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,296
has already submitted it.

319
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,200
I'm really sorry.

320
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,200
I know I was wrong.

321
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,620
But can you give me another chance?

322
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,701
What do you think it would be like

323
00:20:49,718 --> 00:20:51,490
if you did this after you graduated

324
00:20:51,515 --> 00:20:52,715
and got a job?

325
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,600
Apologizing doesn't mean

326
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:56,444
you'll always get another chance.

327
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:06,020
(Lecture room)

328
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,040
Rei.

329
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,320
How is it?

330
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,120
Rei, are you alright?

331
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,740
No problem, I'm alright.

332
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,720
If you're worried, tell me.

333
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,800
I'm always ready to give advice.

334
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,940
It's really okay.

335
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,040
Mhm...

336
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,218
I haven't slept all night,

337
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:44,427
so I'm sleepy.

338
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Sorry, Rinka.

339
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,992
Can we talk about what you said you'd

340
00:21:47,023 --> 00:21:48,116
talk about yesterday tomorrow?

341
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,040
Mhm.

342
00:21:50,054 --> 00:21:51,120
See ya.

343
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:13,240
Why did I come here?

344
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,460
Rei!

345
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,000
What happened?

346
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I...

347
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,720
messed up completely.

348
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,620
You look like a drenched puppy.

349
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,840
Tell me everything.

350
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,720
Senpai...

351
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm no good.

352
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,700
I couldn't meet the deadline.

353
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,140
I...

354
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,020
Yesterday's assignment?

355
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,440
Mhm.

356
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,780
Then I'm not going to comfort you.

357
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
I don't need you to comfort me.

358
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,480
I know it's my mistake.

359
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,660
Then all you can do is accept it.

360
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Rei.

361
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,680
You shouldn't come here anymore.

362
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,200
Huh?

363
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,700
“Not Just the Rain, but the Storm Approaches”

364
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,840
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

365
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,060
Leaving your lips unguarded…

366
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,720
So careless.

367
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,100
I'll wait until you're ready.
