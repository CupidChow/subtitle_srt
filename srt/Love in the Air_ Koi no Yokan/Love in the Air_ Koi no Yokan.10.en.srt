00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,975
"Episode 10"

2
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:16,850
Strange, isn't it?

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,500
Wondering why Kai and I

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,773
are doing 'flying man' pose,

5
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:21,851
battling in an onsen table tennis match?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,425
Well, it all started...

7
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:25,050
(Three hours ago)
three hours ago.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,750
(Three hours ago)

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,875
Even Kai was cheated on?

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,175
Even if he apologizes,

11
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:35,076
I won't forgive him.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,375
Yeah, let's go.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,635
Forget everything

14
00:00:38,644 --> 00:00:40,324
and just travel together.

15
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,075
- Hey, Payu.
- Hmm?

16
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,750
How are Sky and Rain doing?

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,450
- Huh?
- Huh?

18
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,675
Huh? Did you just call us?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,550
Rei and Kai?

20
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:01,300
Hi.

21
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:10,075
What's going on with these two?

22
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:11,275
Mm.

23
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,900
They seem a little like someone else.

24
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, man. I really want to forget.

25
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,200
This time, it's just the two of us.

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,750
Let's have fun on our getaway!

27
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:23,600
- Yay!
- Yay!

28
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:26,775
What do you think?

29
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:29,775
I think they're really alike.

30
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:31,800
Right.

31
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:34,525
Makes me miss my lover at home.

32
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:53,300
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"

33
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,925
I wonder if those guys work.

34
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,100
They look so high status.

35
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,875
They look like they work out.

36
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,242
Or is there an international

37
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,562
conference somewhere?

38
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,100
Right.

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,525
Ah, a ping-pong player!

40
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:13,900
Hmm?

41
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,975
Those guys earlier.

42
00:03:36,575 --> 00:03:37,600
Hey.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,814
Since we're at it,

44
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:40,226
why don't we just ask directly?

45
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,900
Huh?

46
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:45,700
- Excuse me!
- Geez, you troublemaker.

47
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,775
You two came to visit the hot springs?

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,050
Excuse me?

49
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,175
"Onsen Kanko?"

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,575
It's tourism, right?

51
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,525
We're here for a car race.

52
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,304
I'm a mechanic.

53
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,351
This guy is a racer.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,150
We come here for sport event.

55
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,725
Oh, I thought so!

56
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,275
We're looking for training place.

57
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,400
Oh, a place to exercise.

58
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,225
Let's leave it to ourselves.

59
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,328
If you don't mind,

60
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:23,617
we can be your partners.

61
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,775
What should we do?

62
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:36,950
I don't know. Let's just play.

63
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:42,100
Then, Amemiya Rei

64
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,425
will serve now.

65
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,575
Whoa, how cool!

66
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,570
This is not the time to be impressed.

67
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,350
Precious.

68
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,350
Kai!

69
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:29,825
Kai!

70
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:33,550
Yay!

71
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,975
Kai!

72
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,000
Ah!

73
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,800
- Yay!
- Yay!

74
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Woo!

75
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,550
Oh!

76
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,375
That was so fun.

77
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,076
Of course, Japanese outfit

78
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,764
is perfect for Arashi.

79
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,771
And he even wore a kimono, I'm happy.

80
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
But...

81
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,575
Huh?

82
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:09,550
Arashi also wears kimono?

83
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,725
Fuma too?

84
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:13,700
Mmm.

85
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:15,725
It fits Arashi, right?

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,925
It felt like I was electrified.

87
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,375
What about Fuma?

88
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,425
Mind-blowing.

89
00:06:27,575 --> 00:06:30,075
- It's perfect.
- It's perfect.

90
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:33,992
No, no! We're having a blast

91
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,537
even without them!

92
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,100
Thank you.

93
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,875
Thank you.

94
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,925
Do your best on your match!

95
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,789
Okay, the sport we're going

96
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,132
to play to sweat after this.

97
00:07:04,475 --> 00:07:05,950
Let's relax.

98
00:07:08,925 --> 00:07:09,800
Alright.

99
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:11,250
Thanks.

100
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,375
I bet right about now, Kai's saying...

101
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,350
"Fuma-san, I can't stand
being apart from you!"

102
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:21,400
Something like that.

103
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,804
Rei texted:

104
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:26,689
"It's a place you won't
be able to think of"

105
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,075
"It's somewhere far,
warm, and refreshing,"

106
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,225
"Don't even try to find us."

107
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,475
What kind of hint is this?

108
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,000
Or is it the answer?

109
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,800
Should I say it exceeded expectations

110
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,250
or was it below expectations?

111
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,975
- Adorable.
- Adorable.

112
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,700
Haa...

113
00:07:57,775 --> 00:08:00,875
Ahh, nothing beats a good onsen!

114
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:03,625
Feels amazing.

115
00:08:04,425 --> 00:08:06,503
I can feel my skin getting

116
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:08,191
smoother every second.

117
00:08:09,525 --> 00:08:10,750
Go ahead, touch it.

118
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,000
I already touched it earlier.

119
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,125
Just do it!

120
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,000
Kai, you're annoying. You're like me.

121
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,704
Rei, it takes time

122
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:23,409
to heal a broken heart.

123
00:08:24,275 --> 00:08:25,579
That's why we're here, right?

124
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,666
To enjoy ourselves?

125
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:28,975
That's right.

126
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,250
Okay, then.

127
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,365
Let's make our skin

128
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,901
super soft and smooth.

129
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:37,000
- Oh!
- Oh!

130
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,925
Oh.

131
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,425
During the competition,

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,900
it would be nice if they enjoy Japan.

133
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,850
That's right.

134
00:08:55,975 --> 00:08:57,775
We should enjoy ourselves too.

135
00:08:58,092 --> 00:08:59,287
Next, let's sing karaoke

136
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,519
and take purikura.

137
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,050
Let's do all the fun things.

138
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,975
Mmm!

139
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,300
- Yay!
- Yay!

140
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,585
I really want to go home.

141
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:10,651
I miss my lover.

142
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,325
And you think I don't miss them?

143
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:17,875
Hey.

144
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,849
What do you think is wrong

145
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,068
with these two kids?

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
Yeah.

147
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,575
They're not as cheerful as before.

148
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,278
Just like those at home,

149
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:33,848
I can't help but worry.

150
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,200
I think so too.

151
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,375
Rei…

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,775
Let's just admit it.

153
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:53,625
No,

154
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:55,525
I won't.

155
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,475
Arashi might call it work,

156
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,289
but inviting someone out without me

157
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:04,000
knowing isn't exactly honest.

158
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,500
Huh?

159
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
No.

160
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,237
I was talking about admitting we

161
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:15,529
ate too many onsen manju earlier.

162
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:17,350
Huh?

163
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,925
And let's admit we might not have

164
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:21,605
room for dinner tonight.

165
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,010
You weren't admitting

166
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:26,035
you can't live without Fuma?

167
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,525
Haa. Never mind.

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,400
I admit that I love Arashi.

169
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:36,075
So,

170
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,889
Kai should admit that he loves Fuma

171
00:10:38,913 --> 00:10:40,093
and give up.

172
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:47,050
What's with that reaction?

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,775
Arashi.

174
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,600
Fuma-san?

175
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,875
Why are you here?

176
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,075
Arashi.

177
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:01,300
- Hmph!
- I missed you.

178
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,600
Hey, Rei!

179
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,875
No, you can't!

180
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,325
Listen. We're still supposed to be…

181
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:11,527
- Angry at them!
- Angry at them!

182
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,750
We're not forgiving you that easily.

183
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,100
Do you even understand why we're mad?

184
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,950
And do you know that we are also angry?

185
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,300
Huh?

186
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,507
You guys are wrong to make us angry.

187
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:56,550
- Huh?
- Huh?

188
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,925
Kai!

189
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,475
Hey.

190
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,025
Success!

191
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,775
Hey!

192
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:30,300
Are you okay?

193
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,350
Are you okay?

194
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,125
Hey, you.

195
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,925
That was too much.

196
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,175
I think that's enough.

197
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,700
I don't get it!

198
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,775
Why is Arashi mad?

199
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,750
What's this?

200
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,500
Something I was going to give to you.

201
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,775
You wear it.

202
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,925
Huh, why me?

203
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,075
Wait.

204
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:43,175
Apologize first.

205
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,625
You should be the one apologizing, Kai.

206
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:50,475
What's wrong, Fuma-san?

207
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:55,725
Punishment.

208
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,100
Why am I...

209
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,200
Umm...

210
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,325
I'm wearing it.

211
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:17,507
It's so embarrassing.

212
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,550
And you want me to wear it?

213
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:23,800
That is...

214
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,325
I got it.

215
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,825
If you're that embarrassed...

216
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:02,200
Wait! I haven't forgiven you yet!

217
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,725
No need.

218
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:48,900
Hold on tight.

219
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,312
I want to talk about why

220
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:54,132
we're both angry at each other.

221
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,375
If you can hold on without letting go,

222
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:01,425
then we'll talk.

223
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:04,850
Wait, Fuma-san.

224
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:08,025
Don't let go, no matter what.

225
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,450
My apologies for

226
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,125
the behavior of my junior the other day.

227
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,770
Well, let's hope no one's fallen

228
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:42,910
victim to their tricks.

229
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,075
Arashi.

230
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,225
Not there.

231
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,475
Arashi.

232
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,975
Please...

233
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,300
- Rei.
- Arashi.

234
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:07,825
Rei, what's wrong?

235
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,875
Please...

236
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,875
Huh?

237
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,500
Huh?

238
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,550
Where's Arashi in Japanese outfit?

239
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,925
What's this?

240
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:22,251
Are you saying you saw

241
00:17:22,276 --> 00:17:23,815
someone who looked like me?

242
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,575
Kai!

243
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,225
That's cheating.

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Kai!

245
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,025
Are you alright?

246
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:42,575
Fuma-san?

247
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,500
What's going on?

248
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,600
What is this? What's happening?

249
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,037
Seriously, in this day and age,

250
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:56,342
who still gets tricked by

251
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,404
foxes and tanuki?

252
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,700
You said I'm stupid again.

253
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,325
Stupid means cute.

254
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,178
You should've just said so

255
00:18:08,194 --> 00:18:09,276
from the start,

256
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:11,376
if you wanted me to dress up like this.

257
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,425
I know.

258
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,998
No matter what you're wearing,

259
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:19,350
I love all versions of you.

260
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,000
But most of all, I love your heart.

261
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:27,075
Me too.

262
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,925
I love every single part of you, Rei.

263
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:39,912
Hold on to the edge of the tub

264
00:20:39,936 --> 00:20:41,076
and don't let go.

265
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:42,779
Planning to pay me back

266
00:20:42,788 --> 00:20:44,468
for what you experienced?

267
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,450
It was really tough for me, you know?

268
00:20:48,175 --> 00:20:49,570
But our innocence has already

269
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:50,820
been proven, hasn't it?

270
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,375
That's not the point.

271
00:21:03,075 --> 00:21:04,700
You're right, it's hard to bear.

272
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,800
But if this

273
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:16,825
helps ease your pain,

274
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,575
then it's

275
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,100
the best method.

276
00:21:26,925 --> 00:21:28,025
I'm sorry.

277
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,465
I just wanted to make you

278
00:21:31,473 --> 00:21:32,526
feel better too.

279
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,850
I'll stop now.

280
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,475
You don't have to stop.

281
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:48,700
Touch me.

282
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,150
It's slippery.

283
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,425
It's working wonders already.

284
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,068
I want to visit every fun place

285
00:22:44,084 --> 00:22:45,764
in the world with you.

286
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,332
But honestly, being with you

287
00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:50,941
makes anywhere fun.

288
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:01,400
If I ever treat you poorly again,

289
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,740
you have my permission

290
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,428
- to rip out my tongue.
- Huh?

291
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:10,900
Because it wouldn't be me.

292
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,875
This barbecue party is unexpectedly fun.

293
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,125
Even though we only just started it now.

294
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,275
Then how about we get married?

295
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,600
I'm happy.

296
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,417
But it's not exactly easy

297
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:07,667
for people like us, is it?

298
00:24:08,675 --> 00:24:11,700
But the world will change.

299
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,145
I deserve the right to love cherish

300
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,610
my lover for life.

301
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,025
Fuma-san.

302
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,400
Are you proposing right now?

303
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,406
Maybe not today,

304
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,781
it doesn't have to be now.

305
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:43,493
After you've graduated,

306
00:24:43,518 --> 00:24:45,118
even after you get a job,

307
00:24:45,475 --> 00:24:47,650
even after you get the life you want...

308
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,376
When you're ready,

309
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,798
I'll propose for real.

310
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,525
I might never be ready.

311
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,451
But I'm ready to take care of Kai

312
00:25:04,476 --> 00:25:05,615
for the rest of my life.

313
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:08,775
Fuma-san.

314
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,300
That's unfair.

315
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,750
Until I am

316
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:23,475
ready like you,

317
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,425
give me a little more time.

318
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,892
This isn't the time to be flirty.

319
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,580
Let's go eat some meat.

320
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,650
I don't want Rei to tell me that.

321
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,275
Let's go eat some meat, Kai.

322
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:53,075
- We have to cut some vegetables first.
- Hurry up, let Fuma-san help.

323
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:55,350
- Fuma-san...
- Hurry up and eat some meat.

324
00:25:55,475 --> 00:25:56,850
I'm hungry.

325
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,825
The weather of happiness,

326
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,825
the weather of friendship,

327
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,250
the weather of smiles,

328
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:07,125
and the weather of missing each other.

329
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:10,725
Even the storms that bring rain

330
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,475
and the winds that embrace the skies.

331
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,200
We will be sending love

332
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,808
everyday.

333
00:26:20,275 --> 00:26:22,075
"Love in The Air"

334
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,000
Until we meet again

335
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:25,425
someday.

336
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:30,750
"Love in The Air -Premonition of Love-"
