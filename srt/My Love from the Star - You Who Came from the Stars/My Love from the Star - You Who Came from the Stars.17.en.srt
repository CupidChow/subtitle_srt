I couldn't stop thinking about
when I would go back home.

It always astonishes me.

11

He calculated the astronomical constant and
calculated the lunar and solar eclipse dates.

It also gives us the exact calculation
of the orbits of the five planets.

rather strange to the people?

What do you mean?

15
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:52,490
Like the earth we live on
is rotating.

16
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,630
And that it's round shaped.

17

It's true.

were curious about Earth

32

33

There's no definite answer.

42

The orbit could change due to gravity.

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,670
You are late.

169
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,140
Yeah.

170
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,970
I volunteered at the animal shelter.

171
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,510
I see.

172
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,280
Dad says you're winning an award

173
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,750
for young business leaders.

174
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,850
Well, I'm not so qualified but that’s how it is.

175
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,120
Congrats.

176
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,420
You are amazing.

177
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,690
Oh, yeah.

178
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,190
I'm going to Han-kyung’s grave with mom.

179
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,600
You want to join us?

180
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,730
Oh no, I have plans tomorrow.

181
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,870
I'll go alone later.

182
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,470
He will be sorry to hear that.

183
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,870
He used to like you more than me.

184
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,940
Goodnight.

185
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,170
Okay.

186
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,620
Hey! Stop crying. Let's talk!

187
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,160
Look at me.
You made a wish for me, Grandma.

188
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,430
I've learned how to love.

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,830
It was a terrible thing.

190
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,800
It hurts.

191
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,640
My heart is aching.

192
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,210
Help me.

193
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,090
Where are you going this early?

194
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,960
I feel stuffy. I’ll go jogging.

195
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,600
We need to talk.

196
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,270
I've got nothing to say to you.

197
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,310
You should at least answer my phone call.

198
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,610
What's the point?

199
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,610
You're leaving in a month.

200
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,620
This is why I said it's not going to work.

201
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,120
Yeah! So, I bugged off!

202
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,520
I also said I'll let go.

203
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,760
Then you came out of nowhere to be my manager.

204
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,490
You made me float in the air and kissed me.

205
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,330
Who’s that?

206
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,030
Because you had me worried!

207
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,600
You signed a contract with the wrong man.

208
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,530
How is Jae-kyung a wrong man?

209
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,300
There were rumors about you getting engaged.

210
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,470
I think I might as well get engaged.

211
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,200
What?

212
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,440
Why do you care?
You're leaving in a month.

213
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,140
I'm going to get engaged with just anyone
on the date of your departure to show you.

214
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,710
Do you mean that?

215
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,510
Hello?

216
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,480
Where are you Song-yi?

217
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,080
I am jogging.

218
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,420
Don't work so hard yet.

219
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,250
It's not that hard, where are you?

220
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,490
Stop there!

221
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,890
Professor!

222
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,370
It’s really you.

223
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,070
To see you in this kind of a place!

224
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,040
Who are you...

225
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,570
Don't you know me?

226
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,010
I'm Go Hye-mi

227
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,550
I took your class 2 years in a row

228
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,380
When I first met you,

229
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,450
I said you look like my ex-boyfriend, Sam-dong.

230
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,620
Yeah?

231
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,820
I deliberately got an "F" in your class

232
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,030
just so I could retake it

233
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,300
Don't you really remember me?

234
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,630
Well...

235
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,200
No way, I feel so sad now.

236
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,570
I almost got kicked out of the house
because of that grade.

237
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,840
Oh, I see…

238
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,450
Perhaps...

239
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,750
you can't recognize me because I got prettier.

240
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,290
I lost some weight

241
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,120
and I hear that I look more mature these days

242
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,310
Ah.

243
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,880
You have something on the face.

244
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,420
Wait a minute...

245
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,390
I am okay.

246
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,490
Professor,

247
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,260
are you okay?

248
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,760
Yeah.

249
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,600
I am okay.

250
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,200
Professor, did you buy a cell phone?

251
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,170
You were carrying around a pager before.

252
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,540
You're getting some progress now.

253
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,210
It happened that way.

254
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,910
Then...

255
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,950
Can't you let me know your number?

256
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,250
I will text you later.

257
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,280
That is a bit...

258
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,420
Please? Please?

259
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,860
Please let me know.

260
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,490
Okay? Huh?

261
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,390
010...

262
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,600
Do Min-joon, didn't you say you have something to say to me?

263
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,370
Huh? Yeah.

264
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,100
What are you going to do?
I have time right now.

265
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,540
You want to talk now or
not see me forever? Choose one.

266
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,780
Bye.

267
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,450
Who the heck is that visor lady?

268
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,790
She looks like a fake Cheon Song-yi.

269
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,500
What happens if you don't go?

270
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,270
Can't you not go?

271
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,870
Can’t you?

272
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,050
Okay.

273
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,010
Yeah, I don't know where your home is.

274
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,250
Let's say that your home is somewhere.

275
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,350
But a person doesn't have to live at hometown.

276
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,860
Most of the people in Seoul are not natives.

277
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:09,160
They have their homes in provinces,
but Seoul is like the second home to them.

278
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,130
This is on a different level.

279
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,870
I don't know what level that is.

280
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:20,740
I don't know! And I don't want to know.

281
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,010
You said that you've lived here for centuries!

282
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,310
Why now?

283
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,680
You lived here just fine!

284
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,080
Right after you met me.

285
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,350
Right after I'm about to do something.

286

We haven't even had a good date.

287
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,520
Why now?

288
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:47,370
Can't you just... Stay here with me?

289
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,340
If you won't, then don't get me flustered.

290
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,310
Because you can just leave...

291
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,910
But I have to stay and live here...

292
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,950

293

He was about my age when he died.

307
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,090
That's true.

308
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:25,630
I wondered if it would be possible to live
after losing a child.

309
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,430
Yet this much time has passed.

310
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,940
However

311
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,610
wasn't Han-kyung unable to drink?

312
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,240
Yes, it’s true.

313
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,880
That's right.

314
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,810
Then why did he drink and drive that night?

315
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,750
The next day was my graduation.

316
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,050
He said that he would definitely be there.

317
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,960
He was suffering from depression.

318
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,390
We found out later from the forensic report.

319
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,800
Chemicals were detected.

320
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,700
It was medication for depression.

321
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,570
Because he can’t go well with the girl he liked.

322
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:11,810
So perhaps... that might have been
the choice he made.

323
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,950
The brother I know wasn't that kind of person.

324
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,990
Something... went wrong.

Nice to meet you. Se-mi has told me about you.

What’s reason for you to tell me this?

No!

What are you talking about?

did you try calling dad?

I gave you his number a while ago.

he's your dad,

Hey.

I've been thinking...

I think I overreacted.

586
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:21,890
When I was young,
I was famous for being spontaneous

I have never liked a singer till the end.

588
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:29,700
I liked H.O.T.,

589
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,740
then liked Sechs Kies,

590
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,940
then liked G.O.D.,

591
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,770

If I think about it,

598
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,230
I think

599
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,400
I would be able to forget you right away.

600
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,670
So that there would be no regret.

601
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,940
If I send you away without doing anything,

602
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,940
I think I would have some regrets.

603
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,150

the detective about that hospital?

671
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:08,230
You suddenly appeared in front of me.

672
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,460
That's true.

673
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,200
12 years ago, that day

674
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:15,670
you disappeared really fast

675
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,970
and stood on the other side of the road.

676
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:23,340
That's also true.

677
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,540
At first,

678
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:27,750
I thought you were weird

679
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,880
and dangerous.

680
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:34,620
Even when you were protecting
Song-yi from my brother

681
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,390
I thought that you were planning something.

682
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,460
But I know now.

683
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,560
Why you said those words to me.

684
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,740
The accident that hurt Song-yi a while ago.

685
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,870
I think it was my brother.

686
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,780
I know.

687
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:59,340
I think my sister-in-law
is locked away in a mental hospital.

688
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,450
Help me so that I can get her out.

689
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,720
If I meet my sister-in-law,

690
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:09,860
I would be able to know more things.

691
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,220
Investigate the hospital.

692
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,490
They will probably get my sister-in-law out.

693
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,300
Because she is not in the list of patients.

694
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:20,230
Yes, I understand.

695
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:10,350
Yang Min-joo is not here

696
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,020
I also have many things to ask you.

697
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,060
Yeah.

698
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,800
I got it.

699
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,200
In any case,

700
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,000
thanks.

701
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:35,340
What was that?

702
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,710
Who is it?

703
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,080
Was it that young girl you met at the park?

704
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,050
The one squealing for your number?

705
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,280
No.

706
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,420
Then?

707
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,020
Then a different girl?

708
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,550
I told you it isn't.

709
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,060
I have to practice on my script.

710
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,560
Will you help me, Manager Do?

711
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,340
I can't do acting.

712
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:04,740
You don't have to act.

713
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,570
Just read the script.

714
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:09,040
My other managers used to do this for me.

715
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,440
Scene 71?

716
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,710
Yeah.

717
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,580
Diet? Don't!

718
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,690
I told you!

719
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,690
I don't want even one gram
of you going away.

720
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,460
For me,
you are the perfection

721
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,290
you're the prettiest women
that I know.

722
00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:32,460
Young girls are just noisy and bothersome.

723
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,100
I don't need them...

724
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,800
What's wrong with this line?

725
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:37,870
It's just how it is.

726
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:39,340
Next paragraph.

727
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:43,410
Give a back hug?

728
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,210
What's wrong with the script?

729
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,580
You will do all these when you film?

730
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,010
I have to.

731
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,350
There's no way around it.

732
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,250
Should we try practicing?

733
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,290
Try doing what?

734
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:02,230
Next line.

735
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,070
Aren't you going to do it?

736
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,440
Let's stop.

737
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:20,180
Why?

738
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,850
Where are you going?

739
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,520
Let me go with you!

740
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:37,100
I'm staying right beside you all day long
Did you get tired of me?

741
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,570
My sister was never in a relationship.

742
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:43,540
So, she doesn't know anything.

743
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:48,470
I'm doing this so that I could
get sick of you faster.

744
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:52,480
If we see everything,
then we won't have any more fantasies left.

745
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,280
It's not like I've dated once or twice

746
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,750
The thing between man and woman,
it's all the same.

747
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,590
Even when dad left us, I heard that
it was harder for my sister than my mom.

748
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,160
She piles up regrets and can't let go of love

749
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,820
That's her type.

750
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:08,430
She likes puppies so much
but she doesn't have one.

751
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:10,530
She's scared to lose it

752
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,260
Because she is afraid of that.

753
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,170
I've done my share of playing in the past

754
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,200
So, I won't cry about love and feelings.

755
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:25,110
I'm quite rational and straightforward.

756
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,640
Do Min-joon!

757
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,080
Do Min-joon!

758
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,980
Do Min-joon!

759
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,620
Do Min-joon!

760
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,890
Do Min-joon!

761
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,230
Do Min-joon!

762
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,630
Do Min-joon!

763
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:22,930
Why did you call me like that?

764
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,710
Where did you go?

765
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:30,610
I went out for a walk because I felt stuffy.

766
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:32,110
I was shocked.

767
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,680
I thought you left.

768
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,750
Where would I go?

769
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,020
I have a feeling that you will just go away.

770
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,420
What I'm saying is

771
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,790
you can go.

772
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:49,030
But I was afraid that you would leave
without saying good bye.

773
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,230
I know I'm rational and straightforward.

774
00:55:54,430 --> 00:55:56,300
But if you leave without saying byes.

775
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,700
I won't leave.

776
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:02,410
I'm not leaving you.

777
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,040
I'm going to stay.

778
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,110
What do you mean?

779
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:11,050
I'm saying I'm not leaving.

780
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:14,690
Even after one month or two months.

781
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,690
So,

782
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,730
don't be worried.

783
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,530
Is it okay for you not to go?

784
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,200
What is more important is

785
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,240
if I don't return this time

786
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:36,610
I will most likely disappear.

787
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,080
It's likely that I will die.

788
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:44,780
It's fine.

789
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:48,950
Is it really okay?

790
00:56:49,520 --> 00:57:04,540
♫ You're my destiny ♫

791
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:08,540

00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:37,440
I told you!

797
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,910
Young girls are loud and annoying.

798
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:56,790
♫ Finally I see you at a glance ♫

Kiss.

♫ When you breathe ♫
