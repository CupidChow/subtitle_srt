What’s wrong?

8
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,840
It felt weird just now.

9
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,110
I have seen this somewhere before.

10
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,040
What?

11
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,440
Something like illusion?

12

No, not like that.

13

17

I planned to say yes one second ago.

20
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,370
Actually, I don’t know if love really exists.

21
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,640
If it does, then my parents

22
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,550
and this world will be not that terrible.

23
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,690
I intended to consider as what you said,

24

regarding my feeling to you as love,

25
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,160
making my life meet a big turn.

26
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,829
I can enjoy a wealthy life, thanks to you.

27
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:43,070
And my mom’s wish can be fulfilled.

28
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,640
But… I’m really sorry.

29
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,240
I changed my mind in that second.

30

31

You really have changed a lot.

32
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,100
Why?

33
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,800
You said you planned to say yes just now.

34
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,000
It’s already so hard to consider for me.

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,670
If I told you this before,

36
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,370
you would have definitely said, “Go away!”.

37
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,780
Finally you have made progress.

38

“I planned to say yes.” I only heard this.

41
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,670
You will say yes some day in the future.

42
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:26,540
The first time I had the idea
of protecting someone.

43
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,510
But I failed to do anything, and lost her.

44
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,330
It was my first time to see death on earth.

45
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,940
Do you know why people fear death?

46
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,110
Because of oblivion.

47
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,710
In the world where I exist, even if I disappear,

48
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,680
the world remains the same,

49
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,320
but I will be forgotten.

50
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,090
I was never afraid before.

51
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,990
Even if I will leave the world I lived

52

for another world,

it’s OK that no one will remember me.

54

But now…

55
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,500
I’m kind of afraid.

56
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,140
Because I don’t want her to forget me.

57
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,610
But now I’m going to another world.

Seems that she really doesn’t like me.

70
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,800
I was just so mean as to tempt her with money.

71

I thought when she is having a hard time now,

Since she refused…

76

You should let her go. It’s time to let her go.

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,250
Oh, you just came back.

170
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,920
Didn’t you leave there first?

171
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,820
This is my mom, and my brother.

172
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,590
Nice to meet you. I’m Do Min-joon.

173
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,960
Oh, hi. But, you are…

174
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,430
Oh,

175
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,170
he is the new agent I said just now.

176
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,600
-Wait…
-We are neighbors. It’s convenient.

177
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,740
He graduates from Harvard.

178
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,640
I want to go into Hollywood.
I need an agent who is good at English.

179
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,670
So I hired him especially.

180
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,210
Well…

181
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,740
You must be at ease since you see my agent.

182
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,280
You should leave now as well.

183
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,450
-See you!
-Wait! But… It’s not…

184
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,320
Hands off.

185
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,020
Oops. Oh, sorry.

186
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,130
You're a man who went to America to study.
Why are you still so mean with physical contact?

187
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,360
You can have this kind of physical contact
between friends in America, can’t you?

188
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,970
I don’t have friends there. I don’t know.

189
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:34,370
So you should seriously think about why
you don't have friends in both U.S. and Korea.

190
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,070
Such as your own character flaws.

191
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,310
And…

192
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,250
I didn’t promise you to be your manager.

193
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,250
Don’t tell anyone like that again.

194
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,580
Didn’t you ask me about the salary?

195
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,850
I just asked. I didn’t say I will do the job.

196
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,290
Stop playing cat and mouse with me.

197
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,060
How much? How much do you want?

198
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,400
What?

199
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,500
I’m going to enter the password.

200
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,170
Go on.

201
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,370
I won’t remember even if I see it.

202
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,800
I even always forget my own password.

203
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,300
Agent Do.

204
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,140
Don’t call me that.

205
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,369
Don’t…

206
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,119
Someone sent me the deadee of Han Yoo-ra.

207
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,420
Today it was a dead mouse. And asked me to die.

208
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,330
Come in.

209
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,480
My 15-year acting career collapsed

210
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,620
only in two weeks.

211
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,290
My efforts have been foiled
by an unsubstantiated rumor.

212
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:06,930
And I became a witch who forced a beautiful
young actress to die,

213
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,400
a shameless woman who still lives.

214
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,940
This is what I became.

215
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,740
You are not the murderer. That’s enough.

216
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:22,280
I thought that at first,
but it was a very simple idea.

217
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,490
What people think is different.

218
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,560
What should I do?

219
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,230
What’s wrong?

220
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,330
Shouldn’t I refuse?

221
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,460
What?

222
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,370
You know my friend, Hee-kyung, right?

223
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,000
He proposed to me today.

224
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,180
I need to pay the liquidated damages.
If I don’t extent the contract with the agency,

225
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,740
I will become a poor woman.

226
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,510
My mom has spent all my money.

227
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,480
And I’m a celebrity. I have to live decently.

228
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,150
I’m confused now.

229
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,960
But he told me today

230
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,930
that he will take care of me and my family

231
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,730
to live a wealthy life until he dies.

232
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,010
Then, why did you refuse?

233
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,380
That’s it. Why did I refuse?

234
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,280
How about I say yes to him now?

235
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,950
Seriously?

236
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,320
It is a barbarian's thought to mention property
when talking about marriage.

237
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,020
Who said that?

238
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,690
An ancient book.

239
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,420
Tell me the truth.

240
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,790
You didn’t graduate from Harvard,
but from a Qing School, right?

241
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,160
Why are you so pedantic?

242
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,530
You don’t know the book?

243
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,000
Don’t you know how much mottos it has?

244
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,040
Does it have a motto like this?

245
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,770
“Help your neighbors unconditionally
when they are in trouble.”

246
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,480
Follow me everywhere from tomorrow, OK?

247
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,620
Do I

248
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,390
have to follow you everywhere?

249
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,420
I need to consider that.

♫ We might fall in love ♫

My son, why are you already so tired in the morning?

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,000
Gosh, you lost a lot of weight.

277
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,870
I’m fine.

278
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,140
Take care of yourself while working.

279
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,540
Are you taking the tonic I gave you in time?

280
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,350
Mom, he is not a student anymore.

281
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,250
You care too much about a 30-year-old man.

282
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,050
If he marries someone in future,

283
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:23,260
my dear baby will be taken away by a stranger.

284
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,290
I have to care about him when I still can.

285
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,890
Oh, right.

286
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,400
I bought you a new shirt yesterday.
Go to work in that.

287
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,470
I’ll go fetch it for you.

288
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,470
OK.

289
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,910
Yoo Seo.

290
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,810
What?

291
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,010
When I went to your room yesterday,

292
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,180
I found this.

293
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,990
Hey, you can’t take this away at will.

294
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:01,030
Who is the man on the photo?

295
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,830
I don’t know.

296
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,230
Is this also a confidential document?

297
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,900
I really don’t know that.

298
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,970
I’m still working on it.

299
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,380
Sorry to ask you to come around.

300
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,080
Why to apologize?

301
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,650
Why did you leave suddenly that day?

302
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,950
I got something urgent to do.

303
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,090
Do you know how much I was fined?

304
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,490
Illegal parking fines, late fees, traction fees,

305
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,560
and fine for jaywalking.

306
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,790
They cost me more than 100 thousand won!

307
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,760
But, why do you call me here as reference?

308
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,000
We found you when we confirmed
the CCTV of the day of the crime.

309
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,340
You were also spotted in the CCTV
of Cheongdam-dong beauty salon

310
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,210
during Han Yoo-ra and Cheon Song-yi’s fight.

311
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:55,010
Later we found that you live next to Cheon.

312
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,380
And you are the teacher of the class
which Cheon chose in university.

313
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,990
Are these all accidents?

314
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,930
So, now you think I have something to do
with that case?

315
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,800
Yes. It’s my job to suspect.

316
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,600
I write diary every day.

317
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,440
When I got the summon, I found my diary
to see what I did on the day of the crime.

318
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,010
I had an appointment with an acquainted lawyer.

319
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:29,980
And I went back home around 12 P.M.

320
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,480
What is the supposed time of the crime?

321
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,850
From 11:30 P.M. to 12 P.M.

322
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:41,390
I heard the crime happened on the cruise.

323
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,760
Can I go back and forth to the scene

324
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,070
in 30 minutes from my home in Kangnam?

325
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,710
Can anyone prove that you were home?

326
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:59,750
You can check the CCTV in the elevator.

327
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,360
He is right.

328
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,990
It’s true.

329
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,760
And this is even clearer.

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,200
Just like what he said, it’s impossible to go
back and forth to the scene in 30 minutes.

331
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,670
Even on the CCTV, there's only going home,

332
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,210
no going out.

333
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,950
His alibi is perfect.

334
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,120
Hello.

335
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,890
Yes. The result of
the handwriting identification is out?

336
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,590
I see.

337
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,700
The result of the identification of
Han Yoo-ra’s suicide note came out?

338
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,740
Yes. It shows that it was written by her.

339
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,670
It’s 100% her own handwriting.

340
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:04,940
As the handwriting of Han Yoo-ra's suicide note
was confirmed as her own handwriting,

341
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,150
the criticism of Cheon Song-yi
became increasingly serious.

342
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,220
Is it because of this case that you terminated
your contract with actress Cheon Song-yi?

343
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,050
It’s definitely not because of this case.

344
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,790
The contract expires at the end of the month.

345
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:24,900
We just closed the actual business
without a schedule.

346
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,600
Ms. Cheon has been home recently.
Do you know how she is doing?

347
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,710
In order to relieve the accumulated pressure
and fatigue during this period,

348
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,280
Ms. Cheon is taking a rest at home,

349
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,310
and is further improving her self-cultivation

350
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,780
through reading, music and meditation.

351
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,550
My work!

352
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,660
Hey, Beom,

353
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,060
it’s almost the noon, what are you doing…

354
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,500
I’m on the shooting set.

355
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,300
You are on set?

356
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,510
To help Se-mi.

357
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,940
No… Please don’t go…

358
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,450
Please…

359
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,420
Cut!

360
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,680
OK!

361
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,690
Great! Se-mi!

362
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,750
Alright, that’s all for today.

363
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,360
-Thank you.
-Great job!

364
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,320
Thank you guys. Thank you all.

365
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,660
We can even finish it in one time
with such a complex scene.

366
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,360
After changing the leading role,
the atmosphere of shooting is totally different.

367
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,330
Alright, the dinner is on me today!

368
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:37,500
Song-yi, what’s wrong?

369
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,470
Nothing. I just wondered where you are.

370
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,980
You will have dinner together? Go now.

371
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,540
What should I do today?

372
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,260
First message.

373
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,130
Mr. Do Min-joon, this is President Hong Hae-in.

374
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,600
Well, you have to return
the new magazine on time.

375
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,700
You look like a good guy,

376
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,740
so I didn’t check your ID card
and just borrowed you the new one.

377
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,270
But you still haven’t returned it.

378
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,040
I’m really disappointed.

379
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,080
Hope you can return it as soon as possible.

380
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,650
Second message.

381
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,210
This is Cheon Song-yi.

382
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,890
No manager will leave without any words.

383
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,590
Where did you go? Call me back.

384
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,090
Can’t you buy a cell phone?

385
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:08,290
Cell phone is the basic equipment for an agent,
OK?

386
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,010
Welcome.

387
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,610
I want a phone with good signal.

388
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,280
Every cell phone is getting good signal lately.

389
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,920
Then, the best one.

390
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,860
I’m busy now. What do you want to say?

391
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,490
It’s a very important thing.

392
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,630
You will regret it if you miss it.

393
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,630
Now I’m talking not as your son,

394
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,630
but an employee of S&C Group, to make
a major proposal to our president.

395
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,140
Alright, what do you want to say?

396
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,140
Our S&C is involved in malls, cars,

397
00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:00,310
movies, housing and electronics,

398
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,280
but unfortunately, there is one field
we haven’t got into yet.

399
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,480
It is…

400
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,850
Please turn a page.

401
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:16,560
The heart of Korean wave, Talent Agency.

402
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,900
That’s over.

403
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:20,100
It’s totally different from other agencies.

404
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,370
Please turn another page.

405
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,810
It’s the agency only for one artist.

406
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,970
The hottest star in Korean, the star of Asia,

407
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,140
who doesn’t belong to any agencies now.

408
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:35,380
This woman.

409
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,650
Cheon Song-yi.

410
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,120
I have a date to play golf.

411
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,750
Ms. Cheon Song-yi…

412
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,320
-I said it’s over now.
-For Ms. Cheon!

413
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,350
-For Ms. Cheon Song-yi…
-What a brat.

414
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,690
Dad! Dad!

415
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,030
Stop!

416
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,230
Please let me have an agency, dad.

417
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,730
You really like her that much?

418
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,470
Yes.

419
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,470
Then, arrange a meeting for us first.

420
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,280
I haven’t allowed you to be together yet.

421
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,450
It’s not dad’s turn to decide.

422
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,480
Song-yi has the say of this.

423
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,680
I have been waiting for her answer.

424
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:16,420
Dad, I’ll rely on you about the agency.

425
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:19,690
All I can rely on is your resources.

426
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,590
So, dad, please don’t go broke.

427
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,160
Brat!

428
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,810
It's really cold this winter.

429
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:39,040
-So cold!
-But you can’t neglect to manage your body.

430
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,650
-Of course I can’t.
-If you keep staying home,

431
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,380
something will change a lot.

432
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,990
It’s the love handles.

433
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,350
What can we do with them?

434
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,860
You must be busy…

435
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,020
-and tired recently.
-Gosh!

436
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,490
No! I seem to have put on weight!

437
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,190
-Gosh! How did I…
-And you must not have enough time for sports.

438
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,700
Now, don’t worry.

439
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:03,840
Just put the thin belt around your waist
for 30 minutes, that’s all.

440
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,970
There is such a good thing?
Why did I do so many sports before?

441
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:13,150
No one can do sit-ups every day.

442
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:17,650
In fact, the upper abdomen, lower abdomen
and lumbar movement methods are different.

443
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,220
Now all you need to do is put

444
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,090
a thin belt around your waist.

445
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:23,860
I’m busy! Who is that?

446
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,890
Hello, who is it?

447
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,990
I’m Do Min-joon.

448
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,790
Yes. Go ahead. I’m busy now.

449
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,060
This is my number.

450
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,870
You bought a phone?

451
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,170
Where are you now?

452
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,570
What’s wrong?

453
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:42,770
Shouldn’t we have a meeting? I’m a superstar!

454
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,080
Didn’t you say it’s a meeting?

455
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,310
What’s the topic?

456
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,850
I have no TV play to do recently.

457
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,420
But, such as york, noodles, coffee,
and other fast food,

458
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,690
I’ve done so many advertisements for them.

459
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,200
If I will have another contract in future,
they will come to me again in a crowd.

460
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,530
I have to show everyone a new me then.

461
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,770
So, anyway, I've been be free recently,

462
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:15,040
so I'd like to take this opportunity
to enjoy all kinds of delicious food.

463
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,970
So?

464
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,180
What dinner should we have tonight, Manager Do?

465
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,780
Let me give you an advice.

466
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,550
I want…unicinctus.

467
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,920
I want to try that before I go to training.

468
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,290
Where can we buy that?

469
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,190
Sashimi shop?

470
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,460
Department store?

471
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,830
How about Noryangjin Fish Market?

472
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,900
The price there must be cheaper.

473
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,270
That’s all for this meeting?

474
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,210
For 15 years my dinner has been
either chicken breast or cabbage.

475
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,940
From now on, what I will have for meals
will be my top priority.

476
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,250
I hope you can follow me to care about it

477
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,820
and come up with some creative ideas.

478
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:02,690
No one will come at such a late hour.

479
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,120
-Who is it?
-Delivery.

480
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,730
-I didn’t call for delivery…
-Yes! Hold on.

481
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,260
Open the door.

482
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,460
I didn’t buy anything.

483
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,429
It was me. I’ve been free lately.

484
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,770
So I tried TV shopping.

485
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,440
It brought me to a brand new world.

486
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,570
There are so many things!

487
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,840
Why do you ask them to send to me?

488
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,010
I’m Cheon Song-yi!

489
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,639
Cheon Song-yi won’t receive deliveries.

490
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:24,540
There will be two tomorrow. Help me to receive.

491
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,980
That’s why I hired a manager.

492
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,850
I’m not your…

493
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,690
Are you Manager Do?

494
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,620
Please sign here.

495
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,670
What is this?

496
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,270
Sauce crabs, of course!

497
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,440
Do you have rice?

498
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,780
Rice and sauce crabs are perfect match.

499
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,380
Where are you going?

500
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,780
We should eat together.

501
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,720
I’m not that mean.

502
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,890
I have told you that

503
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,620
I hate to eat with others.

504
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,820
I hate to eat alone.

505
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,800
Come on, I can even fish for crabs in here.

506
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,570
Let me see…

507
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,940
What? It’s all soups left.

508
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,150
They said it’s full of crab cream!

509
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,850
Liars! I’m totally cheated.

510
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,120
This kind of people should sit on the hill.

511
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,860
What?

512
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,920
Well…

513
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,130
Between Taksudong and Hannamdong,
there was a small hill.

514
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:48,890
So?

515
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,860
There used to be a lot of merchants
doing business there.

516
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,370
Because it was very narrow and dangerous,
many thieves hid there.

517
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,000
So, that’s what you say when you’re cheated

518
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,400
or faced with someone who’s misbehaving.

519
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,270
This kind of people should sit on there.

520
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,110
I was thinking that why you didn’t
say your Korean proverbs lately.

521
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:06,240
First it was cofferdam of Bing-Zi year,
now it’s a hill.

522
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,710
Where did you learn these from?

523
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,550
Do you usually watch educational channels
or something?

524
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,420
Oh, right!

525
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,450
It’s time for TV play.

526
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,850
Let’s eat in the living room.

527
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,290
You should eat at the table.

528
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,420
I hate that.

529
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,600
How did you do your makeup?

530
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,130
It’s a terrible makeup, is it?

531
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,000
I think it’s beautiful.

532
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,580
Come on! Don’t do this!

533
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,780
Everyone knows that! Do you have to do this?

534
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,450
She always uses her brain to act,

535
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,720
not her heart.

536
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,950
I should give her some advices
next time I see her.

537
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,950
Eat, or watch.

538
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,590
That, that, that’s not real tears.

539
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,720
It’s water, fake tears.

540
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,660
If she really cried,

541
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:56,190
the tears wouldn’t have fallen so beautifully.

542
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,830
It falls down rapidly between your eyes.

543
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,770
And there will also be a lot of snot.

544
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:01,430
That’s will be really ugly.

545
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:02,230
You know?

546
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,570
That’s how it is like to cry.

547
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,870
I’m not interested in that. Don’t explain it.

548
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,570
Well, hand me the tissue.

549
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,120
It was put here before?

550
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,850
Oh,

551
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,850
yes.

552
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,890
Wasn’t it there just now? I saw it.

553
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,390
You saw it wrong.

554
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:31,200
Well, that will be bad.

555
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,670
The rating is bound to go down.

556
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,530
I brought the rating to 17

557
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,900
with my soulful acting skills.

558
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,910
After Cheon Song-yi left,
the rating will be down by half.

559
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,270
Big news.

560
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:44,240
The audience recently is really calm.

561
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,080
In my opinion, the rating tomorrow will be…

562
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,350
8.

563
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,550
How do you know that?

564
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,760
I've been doing this for fifteen years.

565
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,290
I’m as good as god now.

566
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,890
I can tell that with only one glance.

567
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,630
It won’t be more than 8.

568
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,700
[Congratulations on rating breaking 20]

569
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,280
I was worried actually.

570
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,550
Thanks to our Se-mi.

571
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,580
Cheon Song-yi didn’t even make it to 20.
How did you do that?

572
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,180
There are a lot of news.

573
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:28,250
Yoo Se-mi is discovered twice,
the supporting role shines brilliantly.

574
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,690
Thank you guys a lot.

575
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,790
Let me treat you lunch.

576
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,530
Let’s go to have ribs.

577
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,300
Yoo Se-mi!

578
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,440
Lawyer Jang, why are you walking so fast?

579
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,370
What’s wrong with that?

580
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,180
Are you being angry with me?

581
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,780
Why should I be angry?

582
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,780
Well, I asked you to buy a phone to me.

583
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,550
Now I need to have your number.

584
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,890
Why are you angry?

585
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,620
I have been asking you to buy a phone
for more than ten years.

586
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,260
But you never listened to me.

587
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,520
Now there are only two months left
before you leave.

588
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,130
Why did you buy a phone now?

589
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,160
Well, I think I might need to use it sometimes.

590
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,400
Give it to me.

591
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,170
[Cheon Song-yi]

592
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,940
I think I might call her often.

593
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,910
Look, you are No. 2.

594
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,170
[Lawyer Jang]

595
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,640
Who cares?

596
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,880
I don’t care about my number!

597
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Who said I care?

598
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,350
Do you want me to change it?

599
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,520
I can change you to No. 1.

600
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,250
What? Gosh.

601
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,860
Who said I want you to change? So childish.

602
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,290
Forget that!

603
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,530
Let’s go together.

604
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,600
Hello?

605
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,060
Well,

606
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,630
I’m outside now.

607
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,870
No manager should go outside so frequently.

608
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,870
You have to tell me if you need to go out.

609
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,670
What’s the matter?

610
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,380
Of course there is a matter.

611
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,040
Don’t we have a meeting for lunch?

612
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,210
I want to have udon.

613
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,480
What… I’m hanging up.

614
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,590
Hey! I’m starving!

615
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,460
Song-yi!

616
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,320
You?

617
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,430
Why are you here but not with Yoo Se-mi?

618
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,560
This.

619
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,960
You left it in the car last time.

620
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,430
Oh, right.

621
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,330
I will wait for you.

622
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:25,300
I think I have been used to bad woman.

623
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,410
Se-mi is so kind to me.

624
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,170
That makes me feel uncomfortable.

625
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,840
I miss your violence and rough words.

626
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,350
Alright, wait for me.

627
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,320
When I get back on my feet,

628
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,390
I will be tough to you again.

629
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,560
It’s a pity to throw it.

630
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,230
But it’s more uncomfortable to have it now.

631
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,580
What is this?

632
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,850
I want rice.

633
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:14,950
I really miss the udon here.

634
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,760
What’s going on?

635
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,360
It’s so hard for us to eat together
in the past 30 years.

636
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,360
But we had meal together last time in your place.

637
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,960
So is today…

638
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,230
This is really a strange thing.

639
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,000
Once you start to eat with others,

640
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,540
you will feel lonely to eat alone again.

641
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,640
So, we can often eat together in future.

642
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,310
Yes.

643
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,550
-Please help me to pack up one.
-OK.

644
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,320
Wait.

645
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,620
-Two, thanks.
-OK.

646
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,920
Why do you order another two?

647
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:53,330
I just want to eat more.

648
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:58,530
Thanks.

649
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,040
What’s wrong?

650
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,140
It’s so cold.

651
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,410
Of course, it’s winter.

652
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,810
You feel cold?

653
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,250
You didn’t feel cold before, did you?

654
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:23,690
Maybe it’s really time for me to leave.

655
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,490
My body is changing

656
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,460
little by little.

657
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:32,660
Sit here.

658
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,520
Help me to get out of here.

659
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,690
I’m not crazy now…

660
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,560
-What is this?
-But I think it’s driving me crazy.

661
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,200
Tell me, why did you come here?

662
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,040
That person locked me here.

663
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,310
I found the secret.

664
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,280
What’s that secret?

665
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,840
What’s this?

666
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,710
-I can’t tell you.
-Is this an independent film?

667
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,710
Please help me out of here.

668
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,280
Or something like sneak shot?

669
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,220
-And, you to him…
-Who is the woman talking to Han Yoo-ra?

670
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,460
Maybe he will kill you.

671
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,310
I thought you wouldn’t buy me this.

672
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,570
They are from others. So I take them back.

673
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,810
There are two. You haven’t have lunch yet?

674
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:53,280
Yes.

675
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,850
Great.

676
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,880
We can have it together.

677
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,950
I can eat alone.

678
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,750
Then, let’s eat together.

679
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,020
It’s getting troublesome.

680
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,360
Let’s start it.

681
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,760
Start what?

682
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,970
What’s wrong?

683
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:20,010
It’s just a little trouble.

684
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:22,710
-What’s the matter?
-I want to ask Song-yi out for dinner.

685
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,180
Do you want to join us?

686
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,280
You said that we should have a dinner together.

687
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,410
I’m sorry.

688
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,280
I have an appointment tonight.

689
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,320
Really?

690
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,650
What about tomorrow night?

691
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:34,050
It’s OK.

692
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,150
I see.

693
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,190
I will tell Song-yi and make an appointment.

694
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,600
I’m afraid Song-yi

695
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,300
can’t have the dinner tomorrow.

696
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,010
Where did you buy this? So good.

697
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,810
It has a long history of 50 years.

698
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:59,880
I see.

699
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,650
But it’s worse than that of the time
when they just opened.

700
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,820
Sounds like you have tried that before.

701
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,220
Are you often called an old man?

702
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,250
You look good,

703
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:11,890
but your mind is like an old man.

704
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:16,400
Hello.

705
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,900
The result is out?

706
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,030
Today?

707
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,040
Oh, wait, let me check my schedule.

708
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:27,140
Oh! It’s free at that time.

709
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,170
I will get there in time.

710
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,210
Yes, I still got other work to do.

711
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:31,940
OK.

712
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,410
Manager Do!

713
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,280
We got schedule!

714
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:35,850
What?

715
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:37,850
The clothes I sent to fix are ready!

716
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,790
I haven’t gone outside for a while.
What should I wear?

717
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:43,890
What is that?

718
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,220
Oh, that

719
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,930
is the Teddy bear sent from my fans before.

720
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,930
It’s cute, isn’t it?

721
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,280
What are you doing?

722
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,830
What is this?

723
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,300
Who is watching me?

724
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,000
Why?

725
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,740
They even spend money and time on this.

726
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:37,940
Am I this obnoxious?

727
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,550
Be quick.

728
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,590
Don’t leave.

729
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:57,300
I won’t.

730
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,500
Thanks.

731
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:26,760
I wanted… to call you before.

732
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,590
Are you free now?

733
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,780
I watched the drama.

734
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,180
Really?

735
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,850
I think you got me wrong last time.

736
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:55,390
Nothing is wrong.

737
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:57,760
You got the message from the director
before you went out that day.

738
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,360
And you lied that your mom got hurt.

739
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:04,160
I already knew that you have agreed
with the director.

740
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,570
Why did you lie that you would quit?

741
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,040
Were you afraid that I would stop you?

742
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:16,110
I was afraid you would feel sad.

743
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,940
It was me, not other people.

744
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,610
I was afraid you would feel hurt if your place

745
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:26,720
was taken by someone you don’t recognize.

746
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,220
I don’t recognize you?

747
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,290
Then why did I

748
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:35,160
always mention you to the directors
every time I got a work to do

749
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,760
and ask them to let you in?

750
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,000
You are jealous

751
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,730
and more competitive than anyone else.

752
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:43,140
But you were never

753
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,600
wary of me,

754
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,900
never intended to compete with me,

755
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,010
just wanted to keep me beside you.

756
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,980
You think I don’t know

757
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,450
what this means? Do you take me as a fool?

758
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,250
Although I’m not willing to be like that,

759
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,280
I had no choice.

760
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,320
So I could only stand by your side and smile.

761
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,760
Have you ever though how I was feeling?

762
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,530
I

763
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:12,460
want you, even if just once,

764
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,130
to be jealous of me,

765
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:18,100
to be wary of me,

766
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,610
to be competitive with me.

767
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:21,870
Yoo Se-mi, that is…

768
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:23,240
Let me finish!

769
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,210
I always listened to you.

770
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,550
Now it’s my turn to be listened.

771
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:33,150
What are you looking forward to?

772
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:37,990
Do you want me to thank you
for taking your place?

773
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,960
I spent a lot to get only a little

774
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,170
of the thing you got so easily.

775
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,600
Should I say sorry?

776
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:53,310
I don’t want to apologize at all.

777
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,250
Have you

778
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:05,350
ever regarded me as your friend?

779
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,620
Well, this is what I’m sorry for.

780
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,660
Never.

781
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,470
I fell this time.

782
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:24,740
I was in bad mood in most of the time.

783
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,970
But there is also an advantage which is that

784
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:29,810
I got to know a lot of people clearly.

785
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,410
People who really stand on my side,
and people who pretend to be with me.

786
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,420
We always meet hardships in life.

787
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,690
I think it’s god who gives us the chance
to know the true color of other people.

788
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,260
Hospital gown? Seriously?

789
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,130
Do I really need to stay in hospital?

790
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:00,670
I was just stunned to pass out.

791
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,270
I didn’t even bleed.

792
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,200
Even if there is no obvious injury,
you should be examined.

793
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,670
There may be cerebral hemorrhage,

794
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:07,510
and if there is,

795
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:09,980
there may be acute subdural bleeding.

796
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:11,880
Anyway, they are going to give you a CT
and a MRI later.

797
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
Just wait here.

798
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,150
I have been thinking about this since last time.

799
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:15,180
Agent Do,

800
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,080
do you have a dream to be a doctor?

801
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,290
Just remember that I’m better
than most doctors.

802
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,360
Hello?

803
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,130
You got him?

804
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,900
I will be there right away.

805
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,600
Who is that?

806
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,530
The one who attacked me?

807
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:32,100
Yes.

808
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,800
You said he wore a helmet, right?

809
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,730
That’s him.

810
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,270
He sent me a dead mouse,

811
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:37,500
Teddy bear,

812
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,910
and the photo with blood. It was him.

813
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,840
It’s lucky to catch him.

814
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,240
What a jerk.

815
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,480
Tell him that I won’t compromise.

816
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,680
But…

817
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,190
when this happened just now,

818
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:56,460
I saw you were in the car.

819
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,690
How did you save me?

820
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,990
It was even less than one second.

821
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:07,970
You saw it wrong.

822
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:09,470
Wait, I really saw…

823
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:11,800
I will be right back. Have a rest.

824
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,210
It was just a joke.

825
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,310
Can’t I make a joke?

826
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,850
You were trying to kill someone!

827
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,320
Joke?

828
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:29,290
I was just making fun of her.

829
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:34,590
The victim is an artist, so you interrogate
good citizen under pressure?

830
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,860
I also fell down on the roof just now.

831
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,830
My ankle still hurts.

832
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:39,060
I’m Do Min-joon.

833
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,100
The one who called the police just now?

834
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:46,070
Is he the criminal?

835
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,450
Will he come back late?

836
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:16,540
It’s time for injection now.

837
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,200
OK.

838
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,400
Manager Do,

839
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,810
remember to go to Noryangjin

840
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,370
to buy unicinctus on your way back.

841
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:36,820
All in all,

842
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,930
you sent the deadee with blood

843
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,760
to Cheon Song-yi on last Thursday.

844
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,760
I want to get her to reflect.

845
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,730
She killed Yoo-ra.

846
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:54,110
And you sent a dead mouse last Sunday.

847
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,640
Right?

848
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,440
Because she hasn't been introspective.

849
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,110
And then, 4 P.M. this afternoon,

850
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,380
attack with fish tank.

851
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,350
And there is another thing.

852
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:07,950
Teddy bear.

853
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,190
With a camera.

854
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:11,420
Oh, right.

855
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:13,130
That is also from you, right?

856
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,290
With camera?

857
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,790
That is not me.

858
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,550
I have admitted all the other things.

859
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:40,950
Why don’t I admit that?

860
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:45,020
It was really not from me!

861
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:50,800
Is there anyone else who would
be against Cheon Song-yi?

862
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,200
[Manager Do]

863
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,970
The number you dial could not be connected.

864
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,150
Help!

865
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,790
Manager Do!

866
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,440
Help!

867
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,170

Please help me get out of here.

886
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,100
What is this?

887
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,230
I’m not crazy.

888
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,670
It’s driving me crazy if I keep staying here.

889
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,190
What are you doing?

890
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,120
-=Next =-

891
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,700
What medicine did you give her?
Why did she lose her memory of that hour?

892
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,830
Who is that jerk? I will kill him if I catch him.

893
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,130
That man stopped the car with his bare hands,

894
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,630
then disappeared in less than one second.

895
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:17,700
It’s so clear for a dream.

896
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,170
But it’s too incredible to be reality.

897
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,110
Who is the man showed up suddenly?

898
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:24,040
I don’t know.

899
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,680
There is no clue about it.

900
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,210
Live here for now.

901
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:30,820
It’s weird. Every time I was in trouble,
you would always show up.

902
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,550
The man 12 years ago.

903
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:33,850
I saw that man.

904
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:38,120
What do you think will happen
if I tell Song-yi about this?
