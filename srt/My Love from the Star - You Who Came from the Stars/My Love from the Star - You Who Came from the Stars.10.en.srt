[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Do Min-joon!

3
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,400
Who are you?

4
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,930
What?

5
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,270
Are you the person who saved

6
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,110
Song-yi 12 years ago?

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,190
Are you him?

8
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,660
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,950
Someone took a picture at the scene.

10
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,950
I saw it.

11
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,370
I'm sure it was you.

12
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,210
People can look alike in this world.

13
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,530
Also, if it's 12 years ago,

14
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:44,400
don't you think it's been too long to be sure?

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,100
Exactly. How could you look
the same after 12 years?

16
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,380
How old are you?

17
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,380
You were wrong.

18
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,820
I wish I was wrong more than anyone else.

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,540
I was praying you would say that.

20
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,580
But…

21
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,960
Not just the picture. I had you in my memory.

22
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,300
It was you.

23
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,830
I don't care who’s in your memory.

24
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,940
You can think whatever you want.

25
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,050
You believe it or not. It doesn't concern me.

26
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,720
Do you have anything else to say?

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,810
It doesn't concern me either.

28
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,760
I don't care who you are.

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,620
But if you keep on getting involved
with Song-yi, it will be a different story.

30
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,579
There are many things mysterious
about you and your identity.

31
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,780
The woman I love is now involved.

32
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,680
How could I just stay out of it?

33
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,480
Stop getting involved with Song-yi.

34
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,850
In any way.

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,450
Hee-kyung, I can't come out right now.

36
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,310
I need to confirm something with Do Min-joon.

37
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,920
What?

38
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,700
You thought I was stupid, didn't you?

39
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,460
What are you talking about?

40
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,690
The night I almost died from the car accident...

41
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,630
You said that you didn't come.

42
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,829
But what is this?

43
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:42,590
What are they?

44
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,040
Fragments of my headlights.

45
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,420
And the blood.

46
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,040
They were discovered in your trash can.

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,829
So?

48
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:54,150
You were there that night,

49
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,730
and you stopped my car.

50
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,740
Your hands were hurt by the broken headlights.

51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,730
You treated your hand at home.

52
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,130
And these are now here as evidence.

53
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,210
Explain it.

54
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,880
I…

55
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,740
Didn't think that you were stupid.

56
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,130
But you are stupid.

57
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,779
What?

58
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:21,790
You think your headlights are the only
glass fragments in the world?

59
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:27,030
Remember when the flower pot broke?
You stepped on it.

60
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,260
But they look different...

61
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,020
You said you went to the hospital.

62
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,750
What did the doctor say?

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,500
Did he say that this was normal?

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,810
Isn't it some kind of hallucination?

65
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,780
You said that you went to the police station.

66
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,930
Did anyone see you?

67
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,950
You can call the police station.

68
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,280
You said that you got into a car accident.

69
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,210
You didn't say that you were hurt by glass.

70
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,770
And?

71
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,450
Let me see your hands.

72
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,990
Let's see if it was a wound from broken glass

73
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,700
or a bruise from a car accident.

74
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,470
Let me see that!

75
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,270
What? It’s already healed.

76
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,700
Why were you wearing this?

77
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,010
Was it fake?

78
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,260
Are we done?

79
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,320
Let go of my hand.

80
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,280
But there are so many things

81
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,760
that bother me.

82
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,550
I can't pin-point them exactly.

83
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,990
But something is strange about you.

84
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,880
Cheon Song-yi.

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,090
My peaceful life is a mess after meeting you.

86
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,870
I want you to leave now.

87
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,260
I was going to leave anyway.

88
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,340
As soon as possible.

89
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,950
Don't you want to know where I'm going?

[Fried Chicken]

91
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,150
What were you talking about?

92
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,370
What did you need to confirm?

93
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,120
Nothing.

94
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,100
Let's go.

95
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,070
Hee-kyung.

96
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,120
Wait up.

97
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,740
It's so sweet.

98
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,820
I can't sleep with someone else.

99
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,520
You can't just barge in like this.

100
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,550
Can you tie up your hair?

101
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,659
Do you have a crush on someone?

102
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,770
You make origami when you like someone.

103
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,720
What about you? Do you like someone?

104
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,620
What are you talking about?

105
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,170
You've been looking at the phone all along.

106
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,140
You're waiting for a phone call, aren't you?

107
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,170
I was not!

108
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,500
I do like someone.

109
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,860
He's someone from a different world.

110
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,990
As if he came from another beautiful star.

111
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,610
He has the air of such a man.

112
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,730
I fell in love at first sight.

113
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,100
Just one time?

114
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,120
No, there’s a second meet.

115
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:05,200
At the first sight, I was attracted by his face.

116
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,180
At the first sight, my heart was taken with him.

117
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,180
I didn’t see him again after that rendezvous.

118
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,020
He now lives only in my memory.

119
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,890
I think I might run into him again.

120
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,590
But I couldn't see anyone who looks similar.

121
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,520
Will I see him around this corner?

122
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,110
Excuse me.

123
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,820
Do you remember me?

124
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,570
Who?

125
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,160
I told you that you look so good.

126
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,340
Oh yes! This...

127
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,430
No interest.

[My Love from the Star Record 10]

129
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,940
It’s a fingerprint lock, right?

130
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,180
Other people can't open it?

131
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:39,030
Install the alarms and CCTV when you finish here.

132

Here, there,

and there.

134
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,220
Who searched your place?

135
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,730
Did you call the police?

136
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,490
No.

137
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,950
Mrs. Cheon!

138
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,640
Shall we go get something nice for dinner?

139
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,990
Of course!

140
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,210
That sounds great!

141
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,940
No, I'm tired.

142
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,310
And why did you call mom and Yoon-jae?

143
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,390
You didn’t go to Cheongpyeong, neither a hotel.

144
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,190
You didn't want to go to your mother's place.

145
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,160
Why not mine?

146
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,930
Can you go home? I need to rest.

147

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,080
Yeah, that's good.

151

It's better with Yoon-jae here.

152
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,700

Okay, I will stay too.

Hey!

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,510
Did President Kang call you?

159

No.

160
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,140
That crazy…

161
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,700
Just don’t answer his call.

162
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,800
Don’t even talk to him.

163
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,360
Okay.

164
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,860
The speed of that elevator is 120 m/min.

165
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,890
The height to 23rd floor is about 69 m.

166
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,360
It takes 34.5 seconds to reach directly.

167
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,030
It's physically impossible

168
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,280
for a man to run at the same speed.

169
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,380
It means 1.5 seconds was taken in each floor.

170
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,270
Impossible?

171
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,700
Any other possibilities?

172
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,010
There's another elevator,

173
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,540
but it was under maintenance at the time.

174
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,180
I'm sure I saw him at the 23rd floor

175
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,200
and then he appeared on the 1st floor.

176
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:42,300
So, I witnessed something impossible.

177
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,290
Don't you think that he thought about it?

178
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:04,720
Why did you get so emotional and make a mistake?

179
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,400
I had to take his attention away.

180
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,760
What do you mean?

181
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,720
They were targeting Cheon Song-yi?

182
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,980
Why don't you just tell her?

183
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,410
Tell her that he's dangerous.

184
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,940
And to stay away from him.

185
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,570
He's not someone she can just avoid.

186
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,410
Also, it's better that she doesn't know.

187
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,040
When she finds out his secret,

188
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,270
it will be more dangerous.

189
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,400
What about you?

190
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,600
You've lived 400 years quietly

191
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,590
so that you could safely leave one day.

192
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,700
I had to file your death multiple times
for all these years.

193
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,470
Missing, firing house, drowning, traffic accident...

194
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,850
There were so many causes.

195
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,660
But…

196
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,850
A real death can come.

197
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:04,130
You could really die here before returning.

198
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,810
Any thoughts about that?

199
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,670
I told you that I've got nothing to tell you.

200
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,290
My parents will pass out if they find out.

201
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,540
Please go back.

202
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,360
I have one thing.

203
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,770
Did your sister have a boyfriend?

204
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,760
I said she didn't!

205
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,230
Han Yoo-ra was pregnant.

206
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,370
What?

207
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,330
We checked the hospital records.

208
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,690
If she had a boyfriend,

209
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,900
then we need to know everything about him.

210
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,110
Are you going to tell others?

211
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,350
That's like killing her again.

212
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,210
If you said that she died pregnant
when she was unmarried...

213
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,140
Is that really important?

214
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,980
Your sister could have been murdered.

215
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,200
Han Yoo-ra even quit her anti-depressants.

216
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,570
That means she wanted to keep the child.

217
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,120
It means that she never wanted to die.

218
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,170
It seems that she could have had a man.

219
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,090
She had received expensive gifts.

220
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,670
But she never said who he was.

221
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,290
She just said that he is extremely wealthy
and that they are getting married soon.

222
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,270
Let's check her phone records.

223
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,500
We will find something.

224
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,210
Don't you think it was Do Min-joon?

225
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,960
I don't know.

226
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,970
He is also extremely wealthy.

227
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,910
I always make a right assumption, right?

228
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,210
There are so many rich people in Korea.

229
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:04,280
Mom! Look! A man just disappeared.

230
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,520
Like a fairy.

231
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah okay, let's go.

232
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,190
Have someone follow Do Min-joon.

233
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,200
I need to control him first.

234
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,220
Yes, sir.

235
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,130
Song-yi, is everything all right?

236
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,150
Is Yoon-jae there?

237
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,010
Call me if anything happens.

238
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:42,850
That psycho who tried to kidnap you!

239
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,940
I'll kill him if I ever get my hands on him.

240
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,130
Okay, good night.

241
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,950
Did something happen to Song-yi?

242
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,030
I don't know. There are so many psychos recently.

243
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,990
Do you know Do Min-joon?

244
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,470
How do you know Do Min-joon?

245
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,910
How’s him?

246
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,480
He looks pretty close with Song-yi.

247
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,650
Have you found anything strange about him?

248
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,079
No.

249
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,170
He's Song-yi's next-door neighbor.

250
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,510
They can sometimes meet each other.

251
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah?

252
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
Yeah.

253
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,170
But…

254
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,940
Why are you so interested in Song-yi now?

255
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,930
You like her.

256
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,660
You asked me to help you.

257
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,740
Go sleep.

258
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,910
I know his secret.

259
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,560
What's that?

260
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,450
I can't tell you.

261
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,810
Please let me out.

262
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,520
You should get away from him too.

263
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,530
Or you’ll die.

264
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:41,070
Where did your ex-wife went?

265
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,970
The UK.

266
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,600
Why?

267
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,860
Just being curious.

268
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,280
I was just wondering how nice her life could be

269
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,680
after divorcing someone nice like you.

270
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:59,800
But how come you never call me directly?

271
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,170
You always have someone else...

272
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,230
You're a celebrity.

273
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,660
It's good to have some privacy.

274
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,970
I like privacy,

275
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,090
but I don't like secret dates.

276
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,670
I want to brag to people about us.

He said that Goo Eun Mong was his life book.

I didn't receive the rent yesterday.

What?

300
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,150
You don't have sufficient funds in your account.

301
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,350
Why?

302
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,470
You withdrew most of your cash

303
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,560
to pay for the contract penalty.

304
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,940
I'll get some loans for now then.

305
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,280
You sold most of your real estate properties.

306
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,770
It’s a bit difficult to loan.

307
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,710
You sold your investment goods as well.

308
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,220
The credit load is a bit difficult too.

309

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,070
Excuse me? I'm Cheon Song-yi.

311
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,370
Cheon Song-yi can't get a credit loan in Korea?

312
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,220
Even the A-list stars

313
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,140
are just self-employed in the bank system.

314
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,780
That is to say, when calculating the future income,

315
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,290
your job is regarded as instable.

316
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:52,350
So, you’re very likely to fail at repaying.

317
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,840
And there was no income in the last few months.

318
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,750
But I’ve been a customer for this bank for years.

319
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,670

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,880
Not anymore.

322
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,380
Actually, your credit score is low.

323
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,350
You've used Instant Cash too often.

324

I live in a rented condo with deposit.

Can I get a loan with that?

328
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,540
You can't use your deposit as your line

330

But you may not succeed.

00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,430
I should've refused to replace you.

508
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:31,750
I hated myself for not refusing.

509
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,660
I was not in the right mind.

510
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,370
Hey... stop putting up a show.

511
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,040
Cheon Song-yi!

512
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,910
Shut up, you don't know anything!

513
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:45,580
I knew that you were a good liar.

514
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,130
But I didn't know you'd be like that even to me.

515
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,330
I’ve told you through.

516
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,700
You tried to swallow me whole.

517
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,890
What's the reason for faking to be nice?

518
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,280
Stop it.

519
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,820
No... No...

520
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,670
Song-yi has plenty of right to do that.

521
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,810
Since you said that, what position you put me on?

522
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,560
Coffee... Oh!

523
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,000
Are you okay?

524
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,490
Oh... What to do?

525
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,520
You have to wear this at shooting today.

526
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,700
Ah... Is it hot?

527
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,480
I'm fine.

528
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,890
Song-yi, are you okay?

529
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,710
Song-yi...

530
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,950
Song-yi...

531
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,620
Forget it.

532
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,950
Are you okay, Professor?

533
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,410
It got on you.

534
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,140
What should we do?

535
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,350
I'm okay.

536
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,750
You've done here?

537
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,890
Let's go now, Manager Do!

538
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,640
Let's go.

539
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,240
That professor and Song-yi,

540
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,040
when did they get so close?

541
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,370
You said that you didn't have an ideal type.

542
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:02,500
I guess Yoo Se-mi is your ideal type.

543
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,030
Nonsense.

544
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,160
Were you just embarrassed?

545
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,650
You said you hate it when people touch your body.

546
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,300
Earlier when Se-mi was wiping for you,

547
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,699
you were still.

548
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,670
It seemed like you were enjoying it too.

549
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,900
Anyway,

550
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,750
earlier in front of President An,

551
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,420
you did well, Manager Do.

552
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,270
If you're Cheon Song-yi's manager,

553
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,820
it's right that you have the knowledge.

554
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,100
-Cheon Song-yi.
-Yes?

555
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,199
What?

556
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,409
Get your head screwed on straight as you live.

557
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,489
What?

558
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,690
Whether you know the world or not,

559
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:40,330
the world won't take it easy on you.

560
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,420
Even if you crash unceasingly,

561
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,770
even if you say you feel like
you could die from how unfair it is,

562
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,389
the world doesn't even care.

563
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:50,739
You're on a cliff's edge right now.

564
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,080
If you take a wrong step,

565
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,420
you'll fall down into abyss.

566
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,630
And disappear without a trace.

567
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,200
-So...
-So...

568
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,710
I'm asking Manager Do to stay next to me.

569
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,500
Why do you trust me?

570
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,840
Don't trust me either.

571
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,750
I...

572
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,540
Can't stay by your side always.

573
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,800
Why?

574
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,680
Perhaps...

575
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:26,810
Because I'm poor...

576
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,980
That's why you won't stay by my side?

577
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,430
Because I might not be able to pay you?

578
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,870
No way.

579
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,480
I'm Cheon Song-yi.

580
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,360
Do you think I'll take away your salary?

581
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,720
I won't.

582
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,190
Well, I may not be able to give you much now.

583
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,800
Instead, I won't make you do a lot of work.

584
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,110
All you have to do

585
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,670
is stay by me from time to time when

586
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,030
I tell you to.

587
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:49,530
You can't do that either?

588
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,100
You can't?

589
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,070
Go inside.

590
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,900
What about your fever?

591
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,010
You don't have a fever now?

592
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,890
No.

593
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,410
What about dinner?

594
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,900
You have to eat dinner. I do too.

595
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,500
Same with Yoon-jae.

596
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,120
Since he's at home,

597
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,470
shall we eat together?

598
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:19,610
No.

599
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,280
Okay then, have it your way.

600
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,850
Mom left a radish kimchee for you.

601
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,960
Okay.

602
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,130
What?

603
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,210
Cheon Yoon-jae, go next door.

604
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:46,960
Why?

605
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,590
What do you mean why?

606
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,720
I'm indebted to my next-door neighbor,

607
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,550
so if we have something good to eat,
we should share it together.

608
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,740
Go give him some kimchee and come back.

609
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,610
You can go yourself.

610
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,350
You go give it to him.

611
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,210
Hey, you punk!

612
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,110
You are too old indulge yourself in E.T.

613
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:10,180
Are you in elementary school?

614
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,170
Go and tell him!

615
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,600
That I'm the one giving it to him!

616
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,480
That I'm home!

617
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,610
My sister told me to bring this.

618
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,540
Did you give it to him?

619
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,430
Can you not tell by looking?

620
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,610
-What did he say?
-What do you mean?

621
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:38,590
He took it because I gave it to him.

622
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,600
-Did you tell him it was from me?
-Yes.

623
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,440
But he didn't say anything?

624
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,110
He didn't!

625
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,320
Did you tell him I'm at home?

626
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,890
Why would I need to say that?

627
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,750
Why didn't you bring back the container?

628
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,390
Because he didn't give it back to me.

629
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,830
Oh my god.

630
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,520
That container is eco-friendly. It's expensive.

631
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,610
Kimchi containers are kind of a strange item.

632
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,700
Once time passes, you can't ask for it,
but I don't want to give it away.

633
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,660
Go and bring it back.

634
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,360
I'm getting really angry.

635
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,300
If it's a waste, you go and bring it back!

636
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,300
Me?

637
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,740
If you said so, I will...

638
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,690
Is this too much?

639
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,070
What is it this time?

640
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,910
I came to get the kimchi container.

641
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,540
Wait.

642
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:40,950
You were about to close it on my fingers!

643
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,480
What are you doing?

644
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,890
You didn't change your password.

645
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:52,880
Don't change it.

646
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,990
I keep forgetting mine,

647
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,270
but I never forget yours.

648
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,420
It's weird.

649
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,190
Oh you cleaned.

650
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,590
Did you water the plant?

651
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,920
It was withering,

652
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,330
So, I was going to water it anyway.

653
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,140
It came back to life.

654
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:13,210
That radish kimchi, it's really good.

655
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,470
Even if my mom doesn't look like it,

656
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,350
she makes a really delicious kimchee.

657
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,680
Leave it out for a day,

658
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,100
and put it in the refrigerator tomorrow.

659
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,470
Okay.

660
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,490
Now leave.

661
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,440
Go?

662
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,020
Didn't you come to get the container?

663
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,800
Oh, that's right.

664
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,090
I came to get this.

665
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,380
Okay! I'll go now.

666
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,500
There's no more calls about my bags?

667
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,520
No more calls after I said no discounts.

668
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,550
You should try lowering about 20,000 Won.

669
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,040
While I'm telling you nicely,
change the number that you put up on the website.

670
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,330
All right.

671
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,290
You're so cheap.

672
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:52,330
I’ll go. I'm going!

673
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,320
Have you gone crazy?!

674
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,830
What have I just done?

675
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:10,510
What am I going to do?

676
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,910
What am I going to do?

677
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,040
Did I just want to stay in that house?

678
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,680
Come to your senses!

679
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,100
So I...

680
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,120
I'm Cheon Song-yi.

681
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,660
Why do I have to... to that kind of man.

682
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,610
To Do Min Joon, that guy.

683
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,690
The height. I like it.

684
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,470
He has great figure.

685
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,340
His face and his eyes.

686
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,270
It seemed like he's been working out to stay fit.

687
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,290
But still.

688
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,300
What am I lacking to

689
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,940
that Do Min-joon?

690
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:52,980
He graduated from Harvard

691
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,590
and became a professor.

692
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,240
Even though it was his first kiss…

693
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,280
Oh my Goodness.

694
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,570
Am I rethinking about the kiss with him?

695
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,740
Perhaps...

696
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,610
Am I missing him?

697
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,100
No... no... no!

698
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,020
This is really clean.

699
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,720
No phone records...

700
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,640
No credit card records either.

701
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,570
Not even one paparazzi.

702
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,450
There is not a single

703
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:30,110
sign of a man...

704
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,240
How did she have a child?

705
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,540
Oh.

706
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,200
Aren’t you the actress

707
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,100
Yoo Se-mi?

708
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,370
Yes. Thanks for your work.

709
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm right!

710
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,320
But what brings you here?

711
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,110
Hey!

712
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,260
You even have your busy younger sister
bring underwear for you.

713
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:07,140
Thank you.

714
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,330
Mom is worried.

715
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,020
Drop by the house sometime.

716
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,960
Yes.

717
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,560
Oh, right.

718
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,680
Yes?

719
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,580
Could it be that Han Yoo-ra...

720
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,330
Are you still investigating that case?

721
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,710
Wasn't that ruled out as suicide?

722
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,360
People stopped paying attention to that now.

723
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,680
You should wrap it up.

724
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,230
Have you heard of

725
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,250
her relationship with a man?

726
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,960
Man?

727
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,130
Are you seeing someone?

728
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,890
-What?
-That Han Yoo-ra…

729
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,420
Han Yoo-ra said about marrying a man from S&C.

730
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,960
There are only two sons in that family.

731
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,220
If it's Han Yoo-ra,

732
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,220
I only know her as our department store's model.

733
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,590
Why?

734
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,330
I think this case

735
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,900
has Han Yoo-ra's man involved.

736
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:02,820
Have you heard of anything or know anything?

737
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:06,140
I'm not so sure.

738
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,370

739
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,350
-Hello.
-Jae-kyung. Come see me for once.

740
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,130
Please come listen to me.

741
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,700
You know I'm not crazy.

742
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,650
The people here don't believe me.

743
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,280
You can take me out of here.

744
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,910
Excuse me, who…

745
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,480
Jae-kyung!

746
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,250
Why are you answering my phone?

747
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,870
Sorry.

748
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,590
But who was that?

749
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,680
-She was asking you to take her out.
-She's a crazy woman.

750
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,030
She said... she's not crazy.

751
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:02,160
I always meet strange people at work.

752
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,060
You don't need to know.

753
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,430
Don't worry about it.

754
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:08,140
Okay.

755
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,770
I understand.

This is Do Min-joon.

759
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,870
Yes, what's the matter?

760
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,450
I would like to meet up.

761
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:35,180
There's something I need to give you.

762
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,340
Yes.

763
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,660
Where should we meet?

764
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,290
Meet up with me for a bit.

765
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,420
Do Mana-

766
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,520
Do Min-joon.

767
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,450
What have you done to me?

768
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,870
Like what?

769
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,260
You did do something to me.

770
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,700
Yes, you did.

771
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,260
Or there's no way for me to be like this.

772
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,230
Say it so that I would understand.

773
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:20,470
I clearly tried to seduce you in 15 seconds.

774
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,180
Did I get seduced instead?

775
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,700
What?

00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,720
What do you think of me?

777
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,510
No, no, no! Don't answer that!

778
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,490
You're dead if you do!

779
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,170
Because I'm extremely embarrassed.

780
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,150
I will say it with my back turned,

781
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,400
so you just need to listen.

782
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,860
I'm not usually like this.

783
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,670
Of course, I admit that I should thank you a lot.

784
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,300
But still, am I the one
who can't tell this feeling apart?

785
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,870
No, I'm not.

786
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:04,920
I should be more grateful to Hee-Kyung.

787
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,580
But why should I be thinking about you?

788
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,310
I'm a woman whom others keep thinking of.

My fashion look,

the lipstick that I use,

I was always the topic of others…

Why would I... keep thinking of your words...

Why would I... keep thinking of you…

[Cheon Song-yi Was A Thug]

813
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,460
What is this?

814
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,350
A rumor that Cheon Song-yi was a school thug?

815
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,920
Hey, a blogger claims that she’s close with

816
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,630
Cheon Song-yi's schoolmate's neighbor.

817
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:07,400
That person clearly heard.

818
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,000
Cheon Song-yi was a thug in high school.

819
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,430
She bullied some kids.

820
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,030
They all died if they get caught.

821
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,320
If she is close with

822
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,820
Cheon Song-yi's schoolmate's neighbor,

823
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,920
that sounds like an authentic info.

824
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,390
With that past,
did she harass that nice Han Yoo-ra again?

825
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,060
It seems like it.

826
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,430
Are you sure?

827
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,660
Are you sure I was a bully?

828
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,700
That they would be dead if they get caught...

829

Are you sure about that?

00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,650
Just because a person is staying still,
they think I can't react.

Nonsense rumors just spread.

832
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,000
This won't do. I should do a press conference.

833
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,680
Do it!

834
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,610
Right?

835
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:51,950
I was just hiding.

I should tell them all. A press conference!

00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:15,280
You may look like you'll cry right away.

845
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,130
You're good.

846
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,650
Don't wear any accessories.

847
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,070
But it’s been a while since last shooting.

848
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,270
You're not there for a photo shoot.

849
00:49:27,270 --> 00:49:29,910
Your clothes should be black, top and bottom.

850
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,110
Gaunt-looking make-up is even better.

851
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,780
Gaunt-looking?

852
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,020
It's better if you look dead tired.

853
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,670
Would that suit me?

854
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:36,620
Don't you want sympathy?

855
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,670
Ah?

856
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,870
And prepare a handkerchief.

857
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:40,500
Why?

858
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,900
You will cry in the end.

859
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,610
Though you try to cry in the press conference,

860
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,730
but don’t really do it.

861
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,850
It might seem low-leveled.

862
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,810
But you need to

863
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:53,510
pour it out

864
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,020
in the last five minutes.

865
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:55,980
Hey, you seem like a pro.

866
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,310
Of course.

867
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:00,110
Where will you hold the press conference?

868
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:01,310
Don’t know.

869
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,910
Should we do it at a hotel?

870
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,120
Renting the biggest room.

871
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,760
Will your agency do it?

872
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,070
I have no agency now.

873
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:10,860
Then do you have money?

874
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,610
I'm poor. Like really poor.

875
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,680
I don't understand why you live like this.

876
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,170
Hello.

877
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:22,060
You're selling Cheon Song-yi's shoes?

878
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,310
Yes, that's right.

879
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,120
How much are you thinking about to pay?

880
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,790
150,000 Won, shipping included?

881
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:29,670
That's a bit troublesome.

882
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,800
You're trying to get it for nothing.

883
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,470
She personally went to Milan to get that.

884
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:37,220
It's not fake!

885
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,300
It looks like somebody got knocked out.

886
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:21,830
Who’s that?

887
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,900
How would I know?

888
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,630
How could this thing happen in our neighborhood?

889
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,820
Hey, you should eat rice.

890
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:30,540
Wait a bit.

891
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,640
I'll order something for you.

892
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,570
Forget it. I’m done here.

893
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,570
Where did you go in the whole day?

894
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,900
I am busy.

895
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,070
By chance, did anyone call me?

896
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,280
Did someone come for me?

897
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,470
For example, someone from next door.

898
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:49,070
No.

899
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,790
A woman have said something like that.

900
00:52:56,790 --> 00:52:59,140
But why isn't there a call in the whole day?

901
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,990
I'm never going to deal with him again!

902
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,740
Oh.

903
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,540
Where is my purple hair band?

904
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,050
I cherish that a lot.

905
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:18,860
I guess I left it at Manager Do's house.

906
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:20,740
What should I do?

907
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,820
Manager Do.

908
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,520
Do Min-joon.

909
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:40,490
Hasn't come back yet?

910
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:42,460
Hasn't he come back yet?

911
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,030
Do Min-joon.

912
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,910
Are you here?

913
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,750
He isn't here.

914
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,440
It is cold. Where did he go?

915
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,920
Did he go on a date?

916
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,810
Is that you

917
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,170
who hurt Detective Yoo?

918
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,070
Didn't I tell you?

919
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:57,280
The reason why you and Cheon Song-yi are alive

920
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,320
is because I am letting you guys live.

921
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,690
So be grateful.

922
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:07,320
I hate the ungrateful ones the most.

923
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,760
Is this what you want?

924
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,740
Will you stop everything

925
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,310
if I just give it to you?

926
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:19,930
Yeah, I will.

927
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:23,730
Then, I should give you something in return.

928
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,770
Do you know what this is?

929
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:42,690
It's anesthesia used to capture animals.

930
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,380
It makes people like you fall asleep with one shot.

931
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:50,850
Inside of this, I mixed Zoletil and Rompun well.

932
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,570
So you can collapse

933
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,080
without pain with one shot.

934
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:01,650
I don't usually do this kind of thing.

935
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,620
But you provoked me.

936
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,700
So I want to send you away myself.

937
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:12,870
Your death will be disguised as suicide.

938
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:18,020
After killing Han Yoo-ra and even assaulting
the detective in charge of the case,

939
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:20,560
you could not bear the pressure.

940
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,100
So you chose to kill yourself...

941
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,670
Around this time,

942
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:28,810
your computer probably has a will.

943
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:46,500
Never again in front of that person,

944
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:50,470
or any others actually, show your true self.

945
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:54,060
Are you going to lose everything that you’ve
protected so hard all this times?

946
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,290
You need to be taken care of first.

947
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:06,660
Then it’ll be easier to clean up Cheon Song-yi.

948
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,980
Well, the order… It doesn't matter a lot.

949
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,430
Leave well.

950
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,110
What did I tell you?

951
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,920
Didn't I tell you that you can never kill me?

952
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:01,750
Doctor,

953
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,610
please answer me.

954
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,510
Can the feeling of dependence change to love?

955
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,260
Even though I can't say it is impossible,

956
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:13,570
it is possible for you to get confused of

957
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,940
your desire to rely on someone with love.

958
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,770
I rely on chicken and beer.

959
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:19,300
I have chicken and beer when I'm depressed.

960
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,340
However, my heart flutters

961
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:25,130
when I see him instead of a chicken leg.

962
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,920
He makes me flutter.

963
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,380
Should I give you another example?

964
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,280
When I see brand-new bags, my heart flutters.

965
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:34,330
My heart beats fast.

966
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:38,420
However, just because I don't see them,
my lips don't get dried.

967
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,230
Or when other girls are carrying them around,

968
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:45,960
I don't have the urge to kill the girls.

969
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,180
[Neuropsychiatry]

970
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,390
But he’s different.

971
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,170
My heart flutters

972
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,900
and my lips get dried.

973
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:59,440
If I don't see him, I feel anxious.

974
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:03,480
When some girls try to seduce him, I just...

975
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,250
I am sorry.

976
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,620
I am sorry. I am sorry, Doctor.

977
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,320
The girl that got coffee on that man
and then wiped it off.

978
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,220
I want to break her hand completely.

979
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,310
What is this feeling, Doctor?

980
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:31,140
Let's just change the medication

981
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,550
to something stronger.

982
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:36,280
You should take the medicine timely.
