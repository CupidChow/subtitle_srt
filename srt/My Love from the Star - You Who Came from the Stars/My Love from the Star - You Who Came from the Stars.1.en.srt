54
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,610
Yes, as you asked.

He’s a very smart person.

78

She even doesn't know it’s Mocha or cotton.

90

Mun Ik-jeom would never think

I don’t think it deserves to be a topic.

103
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,820
I agree with you.

104

People always think they know everything.

105
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,760
I didn’t know it’s cotton before yesterday.

Any reasons?

You can talk to me.

118

I don’t want to.

It’s about renewing contract with President An.

I heard you’ve been friends for long.

129

Of course. Please.

133
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,610
You’d better go back and take a rest.

134

Isn’t the post for fun?

138

Mr. Do Min-joon,

144
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,940
the dinner party, will you…

145
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,410
No, I won’t.

146
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,320
We’ve worked in one office for over a year,

147
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,390
but we never have a meal together.

148
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,730
Mr. Do, do you know my name?

149
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,530
You don’t know?

150
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,390
What? You almost see each other every day.

151
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,700
Then do you know mine?

152
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,170
How about

153
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,460
mine?

154
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,230
I’m leaving now.

155
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,300
Song-yi, let’s stop using SNS.

156
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,030
I said no.

157
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,880
I have 20,000 friends, you know?

158
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,640
They are just followers,

easily to become antis.

Dear all, garlic pizza has a garlic taste.

162
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,650
Am I the only one thinks it’s strange?

163
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,560
You were despised by many people

164
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,880
for not knowing garlic’s meaning.

165
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,650
It won’t be a problem if you don’t post text.

166
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:12,030
Many texts make people feel awkward.

167

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,940
I don’t care about the malicious comments.

169
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,030
Song-yi,

170
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,180
let me get this straight.

171
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,160
You can’t chat with the fans by yourself.

172
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,080
It makes you ridiculous.

173
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,120
It’s better for you to keep mystery.

174
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,580
Shut your mouth and drive the car.

175
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,210
Stop following me.

176
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:49,160
But you don’t know where your home is.

177
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,090
Why not?

178
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,620
You think I can’t find my home just because
I was confused by garlic?

179
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,110
The room number is 2301, right?

180
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,470
You are right. But we can’t leave you alone.

181
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,570
Let me send you upstairs.

182
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,840
No, thanks.

183
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,610
Song-yi…

184
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,500
Enough, I will go upstairs on my own.

185
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,950
The earrings…

186
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,700
We have to return it to the sponsor.

187
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,090
Is it okay?

188
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,220
Can I leave now?

189
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,820
It really doesn’t matter?

190
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,830
She met a psycho

191
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,770
in the elevator last time.

192
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,910
You didn’t see what the psycho suffered?

193
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,720
He was beaten with her bag

194
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,670
into a jelly.

195
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,110
Honestly, I felt sorry for a psycho.

196
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,680
Hey.

197
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,110
Why don’t you press it?

198
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,450
I mean the floor.

199
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,910
Yes, I’m Cheon Song-yi.

200
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,590
When did you begin to follow me?

201
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,990
How can you get my address so quickly?

202
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,640
What do you want? Sign for you?

203
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,620
Or will you leave if I take a photo with you?

204
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,040
You look young. I know youth are energetic.

205
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,780
But you’d better focus on studying at your age.

206
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:16,650
Or you can take exercises to release yourself.

207
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,320
If you follow me with some dirty thoughts,

208
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,180
you’d better stop now.

209
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,720
I’ve dealt with this kind of things before.

210
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,420
You psycho!

211
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,110
Hey! Are you going to my house? Hey! Where…

212
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:36,350
Damn! A neighbor?

213
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,190
You live here?

214
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,840
I moved here today. 2301.

215
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,500
I scared you just now?

216
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,710
You really don’t know

217
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,890
who I am?

218
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:55,060
Should I know?

219
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,550
No, I didn’t mean that.

220
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,510
But why are you looking at me?

221
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,960
I’m going to press the password.

222
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,880
Sorry! Sorry!

223
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,700
Why did he treat me like that?

224
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,360
He really doesn’t know me?

225
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,100
It’s impossible.

226
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,980
Is he from North Korea

227
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,230
or another world?

228
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,660
Everyone in South Korea knows Cheon Song-yi.

229
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,100
Even nobodies can be called national actors.

230
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,840
Only actors known across the country

231
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,390
can be called national actors.

232
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:51,190
It’s ridiculous
if he is known with only several works.

233
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,950
National actors should be
as popular as Cheon Song-yi is.

234
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,900
All our children were underage stars.

235
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,760
But now only Song-yi and Se-mi are still stars.

236
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,880
Song-yi has a new soap opera, right?

237
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,140
Yes. Director Bong wants to work with her.

238
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,660
It’s hard to reject it.

239
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,310
Hope she can do a good job.

240
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,640
Oh. Se-mi will act together, right?

241
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,450
Really? It’s not mentioned in the report.

242
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,200
No big deal.

243
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,840
She seems to act as a friend of Song-yi.

244
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,940
News only refers to the leading role.

245
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,420
Oh.

246
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,830
Song-yi moved today. Don’t you help?

247
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,720
What? Moving?

248
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,690
So you don’t know your daughter moved today?

249
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,510
Of course I know

250
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,710
she moved into her new house today.

251
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,450
I intended to help.

252
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,780
But she let me take a break and didn’t allow.

253
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,750
Where is her new house?

254
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,680
It’s Seocho-dong.

255
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,970
Gold Apartment in Daechi-dong.

256
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,910
Yes. I know it’s Daechi-dong.

257
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,890
It’s a slip of the tongue.

258
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,700
Please stop.

259
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,270
Get on. Let me send you back.

260
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,500
No, thanks.

261
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,590
You’d better get a driving license.

262
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,530
Or you can ask Song-yi for a driver.

263
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,570
It now looks miserable.

264
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,460
Song-yi tried to have a driver for me,

265
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,670
but I refused because I don’t want to bother.

266
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,970
It’s easy to take a taxi.

267
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,200
Well. Keep safe.

268
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,340
Okay, thank you. Bye.

269
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,100
How can she act rich
while relying on her daughter?

270
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,830
Your daughter is a supporting role. So are you.

271
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,510
How dare you show off before the leading role?

272
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,990
It’s ridiculous.

273
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,930
Bad girl. She should have told me she moved.

274
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,320
I have no common sense?

275
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,480
Bah.

276
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,370
The ID must be a primary school student.

277
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,680
Do you have a brain?

278
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,860
Why are you so stupid?

279
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,030
Gosh!

280
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,180
Don’t the students need to go to school?

281
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,520
Or are they trained to scold others?

282
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:16,740
Hello!

283
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,540
Hey, you!

284
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,860
You made me awkward, you know?

285
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,410
Why didn’t you tell me you moved?

286
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,720
You asked not to contact.

287
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,800
You said to break off our relation.

288
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,660
So,

289
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,260
when did you become so obedient?

290
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,400
Every time you asked for money

291
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,480
to start a restaurant or clothes shop.

292
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,280
It’s been years.

293
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,550
Then let’s talk about the recent ones.

294
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,820
The health spa.

295
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,280
The dessert shop.

296
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,270
Bad girl. That’s a small amount of money.

297
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:54,070
Listen carefully.

298
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:58,550
I gave you priceless face and figure.

299
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,860
Without me,

300
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,960
you will never be so beautiful.

301
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:10,540
To be honest, you never acted well.

302
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,460
You get jobs because of the beauty
inherited from me

303
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,620
but not of your acting skills.

304
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,060
You should understand all that.

305
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,020
I take after my dad.

306
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,710
Of course not.

307
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,400
You dad is ugly.

308
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,290
It’s proved to be true.

309
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,690
Yes, right.

310
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,060
You married him because of money, right?

311
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:35,850
So you left him when he has none.

312
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,870
You will never know. You don’t understand.

313
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,550
Like dad,

314
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,720
I hate you being like this so much.

315
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,680
Don’t mention dad again.

316
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,610
I’m running out of money. Give me 5,000,000 Won.

317
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,880
You should listen to me to do auto transfer.

318
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,930
One more thing, give Yun-jae a call.

319
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,820
He hasn’t come home for two days.

320
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,410
He is so bold as to run away from home.

321
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,800
[Cheon Song-yi]

322
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,030
Look at this.

323
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:34,190
Yun-jae, take a look. Quickly.

324
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,750
It’s similar, right?

325
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,470
How about we make a naked one next time?

326
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,190
Hey. What’s wrong?

327
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,790
Delete it

328
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,640
before I get back.

329
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
Fine.

330
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,710
What’s wrong with him?

331
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,470
She likes Cheon Song-yi?

332
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,260
Don’t scold me

333
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,740
She’s a cruel woman

334
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:45,210
How about hating me

335
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,810
Stop missing me

336
00:26:53,810 --> 00:27:00,530
Don’t come for me again

337
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:06,620
You may be hurt again

338
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,580
-Don’t say I’m a cruel woman
-You are the cruelest person.

339
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:17,800
-Don’t scold me that way
-I should scold you for this.

340
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,400
Forget the sadness in a short time

341
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:26,460
Forever…

342
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,150
May I help you?

343
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,460
You know what time it is now?

344
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,310
Now?

345
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,910
About ten o’clock.

346
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:56,460
It’s late. Would you stop singing?

347
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,010
You heard it?

348
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,990
I moved here for its effective sound insulation.

349
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,770
Anyway, please excuse me.

350
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,800
You sang badly.

351
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,360
It’s not singing but disturbing residents.

352
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,750
What?

353
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,490
Disturbing others is a crime.

354
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,320
You will be punished if I inform on you.

355
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,840
So are you going to inform on me

356
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,940
because I sang some songs?

357
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,680
We are neighbors.

358
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,960
I mean according to common sense…

359
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,070
So you mean I don’t have common sense?

360
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,680
I didn’t mean that.

361
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,230
You mean I have neither common sense nor ideas?

362
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,770
No idea, no brain, stupid.

363
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,890
So you mean I have no brain and I’m stupid,

364
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,170
am I right?

365
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,570
I only had a half cabbage and an apple today.

366
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:47,110
But I felt enough,

367
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:50,370
because I was scolded enough.

368
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,900
I didn’t expect I’d be scolded even at night,

369
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,200
just because I sang some songs.

370
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
So I can’t even sing a song?

371
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,500
I was scolded a whole day.

372
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,830
What should I do to release?

373
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,900
I’ve made apologies all day long, but…

374
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,320
Enough. Unnecessary to apologize.

375
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,380
I don’t want to talk to you.

376
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,530
What have I done wrong?

377
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,140
You think you are knowledgeable

378
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,930
and understand everything?

379
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,300
You said you like me the most.

380
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:58,390
But now you scold me like this.

381
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,220
You are really changeable.

382
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,860
[Record of the last three months on Earth]

383
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,180
You are going too far.

384
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,990
You said we should wait here at five a.m.

385
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,320
Se-mi got up at two  to prepare it

386
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,080
and arrived here at 4:30.

387
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,280
Now, it’s nine o’clock.

388
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,060
Director said it’s not ready.

389
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,290
What can I do?

390
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:45,090
Hey. You treat her this way

391
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,290
just because she’s not the leading role?

392
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,420
Will you let Cheon Song-yi wait for so long?

393
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,510
Why are you mentioning Cheon Song-yi?

394
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,820
Se-mi only finished three scenes yesterday.

395
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,340
One in the morning, one at five in the afternoon,

396
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,140
and the third at 12 at night.

397
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,430
Cheon Song-yi always has a tight time schedule.

398
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,560
So be the leading role.

399
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,480
Just cancel it if you don’t want to wait.

400
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,570
What?

401
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,970
Forget it, Mr. Mun.

402
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,620
Assistant director, I’m sorry.

403
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,200
Mr. Mun is kind of sensitive today.

404
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,250
Take me a push-over?

405
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,380
I still have a lot of things to do. So bored.

406
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,560
What a disgusting guy!

407
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,090
It’s been that way for some time.

408
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,570
I’ve used to it.

409
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,160
Cheon Song-yi should be here at eight.

410
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,080
Song-yi may come late

411
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,990
or not come.

412
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,730
Why?

413
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,510
Didn’t you watch the news?

414
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,360
It’s the back-to-school season for actors.

415
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,720
But they go school as stars instead of students.

416
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,030
According to an anonymous,

417
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:00,740
actor Cheon Song-yi has been absent for months.

418
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,310
So we come to her school.

419
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,250
Anonymous

420
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,600
Who is the bastard?

421
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,850
-That’s not the point.
-Have you seen Miss Cheon recently?

422
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,210
Yes. I saw her yesterday.

423
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,310
Where?

424
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,490
On TV.

425
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,440
A lot of ads every day, right?

426
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,760
Have you seen her at the campus?

427
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,910
Never.

428
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,250
Didn’t she finish school?

429
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,900
I’ve been busy with filming.
How can I go to school?

430
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,750
They are going too far, right?

431
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:29,390
Her company stated it’s because she was busy.

432
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,770
-Right.
-But,

433
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:34,330
during her busy afternoon,

434
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,370
she posted her picture of enjoying coffee.

435
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,770
It seems busy work didn’t bother her.

436
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,990
Entering school with the convenience,

437
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,280
but she didn’t obey the rules as a student.

438
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,840
Should we just approve her improper action?

439
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,800
SBC news. I’m Ha Jae-u.

440
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,060
Song-yi, don’t read any posts on line.

441
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,610
I’ve told Director Park in advance.

442
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,610
Your parts are arranged at nights and weekends.

443
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:09,139
Song-yi,

444
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,870
go to school today.

445
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,719
If I go to school now,

446
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,659
people will consider it superficial.

447
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:18,940
People will scold you for being superficial,

448
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,260
if you go to school.

449
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,719
But if not,

450
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,199
they will say you don’t change.

451
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,489
Go to school.

452
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,730
Damn!

453
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,600
It’s about time that Hee-kyung arrives.

454
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Almost.

455
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,380
I asked him to come back after finishing school.

456
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:51,810
Good for nothing but as a follower of a girl.

457
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:55,179
How is the buying plan for the shopping center?

458
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:57,830
That household still refuses to move?

459
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:01,890
Yes. We are trying to persuade them.

460
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,290
Solve it before the shareholders’ meeting.

461
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,100
We have a way.

462
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,980
What’s it?

463
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,840
The house owner just passed away.

464
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,150
What?

465
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,620
He had a traffic accident while driving.

466
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,090
Really?

467
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,560
It’s wonderful.

468
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,800
I shouldn’t take pleasure in others' calamity.

469
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,380
Things are easy now.

470
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,900
Yes, right.

471
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,140
His son wants to sell the house for money.

472
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,580
Does he?

473
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,750
Congratulations, dad.

474
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,280
Call Hee-kyung for dinner.

475
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,610
Okay.

476
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,060
Please excuse me.

477
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:54,960
But as you know, she is more important.

478
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,230
She must be sad now.

479
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,590
I have to go please her.

480
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,780
-Thank you.
-See you.

481
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,690
Be careful.

482
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,640
-Hee-kyung.
-Cheon Song-yi.

483
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,800
Wow! More beautiful than before.

484
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,440
You are my goddess.

485
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,780
When did you return?

486
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,980
30 minutes ago.

487
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,780
Haven’t seen for six months. Happy to see me?

488
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,780
I don’t have time to be happy.

489
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,050
I’m going to school.

490
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,590
Let me drive you there.

491
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,850
You are in a good mood.

492
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:59,220
It’s good. Take the opportunity to study.

493
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,800
After graduation, let’s get married next year.

494
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,790
Stop there. I will take a taxi.

495
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,530
What’s wrong? You don’t want to get married?

496
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,700
I didn’t say that.

497
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,390
So you will get married?

498
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,430
Of course.

499
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,360
Then marry me. It’s good.

500
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,120
And marrying earlier is much better.

501
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,410
I will surely marry, but not next year.

502
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,600
-Why?
-I can’t film love plays if I get married.

503
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,680
They will let me play aunties.

504
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,890
No, they won’t.

505
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,870
You are so beautiful.

506
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:27,990
You’ll still have romantic comedies.

507
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,110
If not,

508
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,450
I will ask my dad to invest one.

509
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,570
I don’t want romantic comedies,

510
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,270
but love plays of passion.

511
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,730
-Passion?
-Yes.

512
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,650
You don’t like that of passion?

513
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,440
Of course not.

514
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,870
Sure, love plays of passion.

515
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:46,970
Nobody likes flat plays.

516
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,890
Kisses will happen.

517
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,180
I can understand.

518
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,520
I’ve born in America, you know?

519
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,160
I am totally open-minded.

520
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,570
I won’t mix real life with acting.

521
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,880
I don’t care if you understand it or not.

522
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,580
It’s okay if my future husband can understand.

523
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,900
Your future husband is me.

524
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,410
I’ve told you hundreds of time years ago.

525
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,160
It’s not about English that you dislike.

526
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,510
Don’t pretend not to understand.

527
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,960
Cheon Song-yi is coming.

528
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,160
-Cheon Song-yi.
-No photo.

529
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,140
-Excuse us. No interview today.
-Excuse us, please.

530
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,800
No photo.

531
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,640
Please excuse us.

532
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,240
Make way, please.

533
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,890
Please don’t. Thank you.

534
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,240
No photo, please.

535
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,480
Excuse us. No photo.

536
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,820
Make way please.

537
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,660
Thank you.

538
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,850
Excuse us.

539
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,270
Excuse us. No photo.

540
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,470
Please take your phone.

541
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,110
Hey, no photo.

542
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,130
I want to become the book.

543
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,400
I want to become the chair.

544
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,260
I want to become her hair.

545
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,630
Show me the picture.

546
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,450
Is the nose a fake one?

547
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:22,290
Yes. Of course.

548
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,740
It’s impossible to be real.

549
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,810
And the jaw.

550
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,060
Nobody would be born with that perfect face.

551
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,350
Everyone can look good after surgery.

552
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,080
Hey.

553
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,020
You will be more beautiful.

554
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,790
You will be nicer.

555
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,430
Just go for the surgery. We can compete then.

556
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:38,730
Please calm down.

557
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,660
We are here not for making trouble.

558
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,340
Hope the class can start quickly and end soon.

559
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,730
Hello.

560
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,550
Why is the young guy

561
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,720
here today?

562
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,130
You know him?

563
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,620
Yes, my neighbor.

564
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,560
-Really?
-Jeong Ka-jeong.

565
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,690
It’s good.

566
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,130
This is not an acting class.

567
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,710
I heard it’s very strict.

568
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,670
-Go Yeong-min.
-You’ve failed once.

569
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,590
It a must to earn the credit again.

570
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,940
What?

571
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:16,070
Have you bothered the teacher?

572
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,940
Go Tae-yeong.

573
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,020
You didn’t have much time to bother him.

574
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,390
-Gwon Yu-jeong.
-Yes, I’ve already bothered him.

575
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,040
You look young. I know youth are energetic.

576
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,550
But you’d better focus on studying at your age.

577
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,180
Or you can take exercises to release yourself.

578
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,980
What’s wrong?

579
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,550
So are you going to inform on me?

580
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,720
So you mean I have no brain and I’m stupid,

581
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,350
am I right?

582
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,860
For blowfly,

583
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:55,900
the female eats the male during mating.

584
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,720
The male wants to mate very much,

585
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,910
but it doesn’t want to be eaten.

586
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:08,830
It’s controlled by instincts.

587
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,340
So the male fly will bring some meat

588
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,500
as a gift.

589
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,280
When the female feels hungry during mating,

590
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,790
it can eat the meat.

591
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:28,190
Then the male will be safe.

592
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,320
However, some cleverer males

593
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,390
usually find out ways.

594
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,130
For example, the male ties meat on a branch,

595
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,680
so the female needs more time to untie it.

596
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,820
The male thinks it’s useful.

597
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,910
Some evil males may pack the meat.

598
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,170
Some even give her big

599
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,940
but empty pack.

600
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,820
Even the female knows she was cheated,

601
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,890
but now she is useless.

602
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,920
After being cheated for several times,

603
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,010
the females shake the pack

604
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:11,270
to confirm if the pack is empty.

605
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,070
Cleverer males

606
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:17,520
put their feces in it,

607
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,220
because it weighs the same as the meat.

608
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,600
Professor.

609
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,400
Excuse me.

610
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,100
You are really young.

611
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,800
What a big surprise!

612
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,400
I’m so happy.

613
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,990
Happy?

614
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,540
Yes, of course.

615
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,370
About last night…

616
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,620
You were shocked, right?

617
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,140
I was also seriously shocked.

618
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,710
Sometimes, I’m manic depressive.

619
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,380
Maybe it happened again yesterday.

620
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,040
It’s as often as getting a cold for modern people.

621
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,100
What’s your point?

622
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,530
It seems the report you just assigned

623
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:24,530
is a large amount of work.

624
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,810
So?

625
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,040
I…

626
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,680
What do you think makes Asia integrated?

627
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,050
I think it’s Hallyu.

628
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,350
It’s the culture.

629
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:37,190
The key is…

630
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,570
I…

631
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:48,710
I mean…

632
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,560
To be honest,

633
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,950
I’m really busy with filming.

634
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,890
I come to school

635
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,270
because of yesterday’s news.

636
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,550
Writing a report is too difficult for me.

637
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,130
So,

638
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,590
please help me.

639
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,900
Thank you very much.

640
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,510
Our first meeting wasn’t that happy.

641
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:12,370
But it’s a rare destiny.

642
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:13,810
We are neighbors.

643
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:15,730
And now you are my teacher.

644
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,430
Everything is possible.

645
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,030
If you can help me this time,

646
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:22,510
I will repay you when you need.

647
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,350
This is the way of the world.

648
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,700
What’s wrong?

649
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,680
This is not the way of the world.

650
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,960
What?

651
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,530
Sir.

652
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,630
Once I help you this time,

653
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:43,810
there will be next time.

654
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,750
It will then happen

655
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,910
again and again.

656
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,850
This is the way of the world.

657
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,510
And,

658
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,720
there is no chance for you

659
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,820
to repay.

660
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,190
Lifetime

661
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,890
is not long enough

662
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,490
to let mankind become sensible.

663
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,830
So you are now

664
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,390
teaching me a lesson?

665
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,970
Darn it! You will regret it.

666
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,680
It’s no doubt that you are younger than me.

667
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,010
You really go too far.

668
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,440
You even don’t know Cheon Song-yi.

669
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,520
I don’t know the recent actors.

670
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,590
The kids have very bad taste. It’s so annoying.

671
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:50,050
Yes, you are right.

672
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,480
Old singers were better.

673
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,290
Songs as well.

674
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,360
Bae Ho.

675
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,790
Yes.

676
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,570
Nobody can catch up with Bae Ho.

677
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,610
TV plays as well.

678
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,870
I don’t watch TV now, so I have no idea.

679
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,120
I don’t understand why everyone watches it.

680
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,270
Is it interesting?

681
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,290
The old plays were more interesting.

682
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,650
“Lady”. “The Journey”.

683
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,960
Every word is a gem!

684
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:20,270
Is the new law firm going on well?

685
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,640
Many cases are for free.

686
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,970
It seems you need to apply for

687
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:29,540
death registration for me three months later.

688
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,940
Really?

689
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,910
You originally did it every ten years.

690
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:37,510
Now only two years have passed.

691
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,170
Anything wrong?

692
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,000
You are very competent.

693
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,620
There is no problem.

694
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,390
It may be the last time to apply.

695
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,110
What?

696
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,540
Three months later.

697
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:58,970
I will return to my original place.

698
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,120
Thank you

699
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,230
for all your help.

700
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,690
It’s a surprise.

701
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:13,650
You are my only friend.

702
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,010
Thank you.

703
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:32,830
So you’ll stay for long and not go back?

704
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,650
I’m not good at studying.

705
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:36,380
Going abroad is wasting money.

706
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,480
Yes, it’s time to serve our country.

707
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:44,050
For this reason…

708
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:57,590
Se-mi.

709
00:47:59,180 --> 00:47:59,890
Yes.

710
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,010
Please give witness

711
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:04,310
to my proposal.

712
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,300
I’ve been waiting for 15 years.

713
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,870
It’s a long time.

714
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,010
Do you remember this photo?

715
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:36,410
You don’t like photos. This is the only one.

716
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:37,860
But I’m getting old

717
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:40,020
and you look the same.

718
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,010
It’s been 30 years. We both were young before.

719
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:45,400
Now you still look young.

720
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:51,910
That’s why I fear of making friends.

721
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,630
Mankind is easy to get old

722
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,720
and has a short life.

723
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,580
I’m the only one

724
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:05,820
keeps the same young

725
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:08,560
and good-looking.

726
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,730
Even if I’m leaving,

727
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,290
may you live a long life.

728
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,190
But,

729
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:24,500
I’ve been always curious

730
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,160
why you didn’t return

731
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,830
once you came here.

732
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,100
There was an accident.

733
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,340
I couldn’t leave

734
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,500
because of an accident.

735
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:46,570
A kid. She would have died.

736
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,090
Who is she?

737
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:55,080
She was the first one who gave me a gift.

738
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:08,770
It’s a gift for you.

739
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:11,130
I painted it.

740
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,600
You sat and hung in the air

741
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,760
when you came here,

742
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,940
like a star.

743
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,100
But,

744
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:33,060
are you really an emissary from the netherworld?

745
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,640
But

746
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,640
something weird happened.

747
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,210
Yes?

748
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,380
What’s it?

749
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,420
In the winter 12 years ago,

750
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,230
it was the Christmas eve.

751
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:04,250
I was working in a hospital in Gyeonggi-do.

752
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,890
It happened for the first time.

753
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:30,120
You mean she and the girl you saw 400 years ago

754
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,150
looked exactly alike?

755
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,680
Yes.

756
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:36,870
And then,

757
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:40,530
have you gone there to check it?

758
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,850
Hee-kyung,

759
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:53,390
at the Christmas eve 12 years ago,

760
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:56,420
you gave me a ring too, right?

761
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,540
Yes.

762
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,880
But you refused.

763
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,630
Now I won’t take it either.

764
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:04,550
Sorry.

765
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,960
It’s not the first time.

766
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,610
It won’t hurt me now.

767
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,320
But,

768
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,400
tell me the reason.

769
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,390
Why

770
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,470
not?

771
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:31,160
The reason.

772
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,810
Do you still remember the face of the man?

773
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:39,480
Who?

774
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,020
Song-yi, merry Christmas.

775
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,590
Why are you here again?

776
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,660
It’s bored.

777
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,440
Get out of the way.

778
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:06,560
Song-yi!

779
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,530
Wait!

780
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:12,650
Cheon Song-yi

781
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:13,860
Don’t follow me!

782
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,960
I want to stay alone.

783
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,690
Cheon Song-yi!

784
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,290
Song-yi!

785
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,110
Don’t you remember?

786
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,660
I didn’t see it clearly.

787
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,780
It’s been long. I can’t remember even I saw him.

788
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,020
I saw him.

789
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,120
Very carefully. But now I can’t remember.

790
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,530
Why do you always think about it?

791
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:18,840
Song-yi said the man was her first love.

792
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:23,000
How could it be? They didn’t talk to each other.

793
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,960
They only stayed together for seconds.

794
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,340
She even can’t remember his face.

795
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,860
It’s a little exaggerated to call him first love.

796
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:36,230
I just want to get a chance

797
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:39,760
to say thanks

798
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,190
and ask for the reason.

799
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:46,210
That’s it.

800
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:48,170
Nothing else.

801
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:53,320
I went there that night.

802
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,500
[Seongbae cross]

803
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,390
Cheon Song-yi

804
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,470
Cheon Song-yi

805
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:12,650
Don’t come. I hate you.

806
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,520
Who are you?

807
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,760
A ghost?

808
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:20,040
Or

809
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,110
the emissary from the netherworld?

810
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,090
Is it a dream

811
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,240
that night?

812
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,930
Are there really two persons that look so alike?

813
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:01,750
If it’s not a dream,

814
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:08,110
I want to see her again before leaving.

815
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,690
It should be impossible.

00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:45,660
-=Next=-

817
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:49,470
Special for what?

818
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,940
Cheon Song-yi.

819
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,140
I’m a star in the society,

820
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,590
but an ordinary student in the school

821
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:55,490
Cheon Song-yi,

822
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,750
copying, piecing together,

823
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:58,490
duplicating and pasting.

824
00:57:58,490 --> 00:57:59,410
Zero score.

825
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:00,510
How old are you?

826
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,610
I have to answer you?

827
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,850
Cheon Song-yi is human.

828
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,650
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

829
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:05,890
What a bad guy!

830
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,050
I’ll help you look for the kid

831
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,250
you met 12 years ago.

832
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,280
If it’s necessary, we will finally meet, right?

833
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:16,390
Open sesame!

834
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,030
Professor Do!

835
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,360
What an impolite guy!

836
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,170
Being young and talented makes you supercilious?

837
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,590
It’s useless to be talented.

838
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:31,130
It’s cold-blooded!

839
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:33,390
He probably hasn’t served in the army.

840
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:36,270
The army is the best choice for that cruel guy.

841
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:40,170
He is the one who should have a rough time.

842
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:41,990
After being taught a lesson, he would be a man.

843
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,960
-A real man!
-Yes, right.

844
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,560
Be a soldier?

845
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,470
Have you ever seen a soldier
in the war of America and Korea in 1871?

846
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,920
No bulletproof vest, but cotton-padded coats.

847
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,140
The 29 layered coats for bullet proofing.

848
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:59,860
After liberation, I thought life would be easy.

849
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:04,170
But the war separated the country into two.

850
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:07,180
Later, I joined all air, sea and land forces.

851
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,480
Because I have to update my ID every ten years.

852
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,440
And thus I need to serve in the army again.

853
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:16,690
People talk about PSY since he served twice.

854
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,000
But I’ve served 24 times from Joseon Dynasty.

855
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,110
It means I stayed in the army for 49 years

856
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,990
and 7 months during the 400 years.

857
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,880
Can you believe it?

858
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:29,900
He should be sent to the Marine Corps!

859
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,050
Marine Corps!
