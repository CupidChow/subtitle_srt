[English subtitles are available.]

2
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,320
Three.

3
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,920
One. Two. Four. Eight.

4
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,220
Ten. 16.

5
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,990
Bet on it.

6
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,830
Don’t come without betting.

7
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,160
Guess it.

8
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,560
Come on.

9
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,470
This one.

10
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,970
Okay.

11
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,840
-What?
-Empty.

12
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
It’s here.

13
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,650
Excuse me.

14
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,760
Bet on it. Come on.

15
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,790
All is here.

16
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,090
It’s the money for my daughter’s medicine.

17
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,630
If I lose again, I will kill myself.

18
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,930
Let’s begin.

19
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,670
This one.

20
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,180
The result is…

21
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,320
Give me the money.

22
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,709
Hanging, falling into the river,

23
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,840
starving, and crying,

24
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,410
all sorts of strange way of death.

25
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,020
Why did mother-in-law ask me to copy this?

26
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,060
She asked me to follow my husband and die?

27
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,030
Of course not, I’m only 15.

28
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,690
It’s sad for me to be a widow at such a nice age.

29
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,200
Sir, you are the one who saved me last time.

30
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,800
I didn’t recognize you for you changed dress.

31
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,380
But what are you doing here?

32
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,250
You saved me again?

33
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,470
Thank you very much!

34
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,940
May I have your name?

35
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,740
I’m Seo Ui-hwa.

36
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,880
The hairpin is an important material.

37
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,680
Its official name is crystal bamboo-like hairpin.

38
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,820
The head was made of crystal.

39
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,690
The body part was rolled with copper sheet.

40
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,530
It was originally of crystal.

41
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,900
But it was broken and lost

42
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,160
for some unknown reasons.

43
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,500
It’s supposed to be made in early 1660s.

44
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,110
We know little about the owner of the hairpin.

45
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:17,380
All exhibits in this room are for reference

46
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,210
and were donated by an anonymous insurer

47
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,750
when the university was founded in 1914.

48
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,420
There are many precious materials.

49
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,290
We’ve tried every means to look for the donator,

50
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,429
but failed.

51
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,610
[My Love from the Star Record 2]

52
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,740
Just a moment, please.

53
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,150
I lost my head when we were in the school

54
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,220
and didn’t make myself clear.

55
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,950
But I can stand if I stopped

56
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,820
in mid-sentence.

57
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,920
Since you are here, I’d like to finish.

58
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,530
I’m talking to you. Why don’t you say a word?

59
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,070
In a word,

60
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,570
how old are you?

61
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,240
I have to answer you?

62
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,970
Look, you are always so impolite.

63
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,940
I look young, right?

64
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,080
Actually, I will be 30 soon.

65
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,550
I don’t know why you can be a professor
at such a young age.

66
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,120
After all, you should be polite to me.

67
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,490
Cofferdam in Bin-Zi year.

68
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,660
[“Year” has the same pronunciation
with the words scolding female.]

69
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,930
What do you mean? I tried to be nice.

70
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,860
But you are…

71
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,400
You are scolding me?

72
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,130
The 13th year of Gojong is Bin-Zi year.

73
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,540
What?

74
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,640
The year was of severe drought.
All cofferdams in Paldo in Joseon were dry.

75
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,310
So people called it dry cofferdam.

76
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,850
Are you going to talk about the world beginning?

77
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,750
What do you mean? What’s it?

78
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,450
Dry cofferdam

79
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,750
was then used to refer to disrespect.

80
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,820
[“Cofferdam” has similar pronunciation
with “disrespectful” in Korean.]

81
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,490
So when people meet the cocky,

82
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,160
they say

83
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,760
the cofferdam in Bin-Zi year.

84
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,540
So you didn’t scold me with modern words

85
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,040
but with words in Joseon Dynasty?

86
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,710
Wait a minute. Hey… You…

87
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,980
Hey.

88
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,150
Why is there such a madman?

89
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,780
My goodness!

90
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,090
I don’t care

91
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,160
the so-called cofferdam in Bin-Zi year.

92
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,150
Will it be like 12 years ago?

93
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,590
You are foreseeing a future accident later?

94
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,560
Or maybe it’s because you will leave,

95
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
and it has a kind of signal?

96
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,630
What signal?

97
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,440
Because only three months left on earth,

98
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,240
so you will help people in danger

99
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
with your ability

100
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,340
before leaving.

101
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,650
Help people in danger?

102
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,820
Things will be different?

103
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,150
What?

104
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:25,560
I once did that.

105
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,070
Here. I bet my daughter.

106
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,770
How much will it be?

107
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,740
Why are you here again?

108
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,710
Get out if you have no money.

109
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,140
I sold my house. My wife left because of this.

110
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,980
Now I only have my ill daughter.

111
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,320
I bet her to get the money back.

112
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,250
You must be crazy.

113
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,420
Father.

114
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,190
You should have stopped when you won.

115
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,060
Father.

116
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,090
You shouldn’t have won that time.

117
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,700
Now you have no money. You deserve it.

118
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,070
Father, please don’t.

119
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,470
You beggar.

120
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,340
Father.

121
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,280
But nothing changed.

122
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,250
The end was the same.

123
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,220
The bad thing became worse.

124
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,530
What special?

125
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,460
Cheon Song-yi Special.

126
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,070
I’m extremely special.

127
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,740
People know it even I don’t take that Special.

128
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,440
Yes, everyone in the country knows it.

129
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,810
Someone may doubt

130
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,950
you go to school for show.

131
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,150
Now they’ll believe it if you show your daily life.

132
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,420
And you’ll have a kind image.

133
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,390
Why should I be close to people?

134
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,990
Will I be the head girl?

135
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,290
Song-yi,

136
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:10,730
-President An took great care to arrange it.
-Forget it. I don’t take it.

137
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:13,770
Han Yoo-ra will take it if you don’t.

138
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,300
What?

139
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,570
Her dresser said that. They’re waiting for it.

140
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,640
Then there will be a Han Yoo-ra Special.

141
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,510
Are they crazy?

142
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,580
Listen, she is not special at all.

143
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,380
It shouldn’t be called Han Yoo-ra Special

144
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,350
but Han Yoo-ra Normal.

145
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,290
Wow, your English is better.

146
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,690
It’s useful to learn English from the “America”.

147
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,370
I said so because I’m worried about Han Yoo-ra.

148
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,270
People will laugh at her.

149
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:55,570
When I won Dae Jong Award for Best Actress,

150
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,640
she only got the Best Popularity Award.

151
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,910
But you won no Blue Dragon Award

152
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:03,020
and Han Yoo-ra got the award for Best Actress.

153
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,790
President An’s birthday is coming.
I’d give him a gift.

154
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:14,590
Tell him I will take the Special.

155
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,400
Really?

156
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,130
If people ask,

157
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,470
I can be close to people some time.

158
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,070
I will take it.

159
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,980
She will take it?

160
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,310
Yes, you are right.

161
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,880
She refused at first. What’s going on?

162
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,320
I have no idea.

163
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,090
You really want to take it, right?

164
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,990
What should we do now?

165
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,490
Shut up!

166
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,930
Nice to meet you! Miss Han.

167
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,230
You don’t have an acting role recently?

168
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,170
Why? I have a play.

169
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,110
The play that Cheon Song-yi stars in,

170
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,710
am I right?

171
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,080
What role?

172
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,480
Well, you’re close to Cheon Song-yi, right?

173
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,350
Yes.

174
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,890
You know the Special she takes?

175
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,790
I heard of it.

176
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,760
She didn’t like that kind of documentary.

177
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,360
Why does she accept it this time?

178
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,300
Yes, I have no idea, either.

179
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,900
In fact,

180
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,440
Song-yi doesn’t care about me.

181
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,340
But she is very concerned about you.

182
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,540
What do you mean?

183
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,580
For her,

184
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,350
I’m never her rival, so we can be friends.

185
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,420
But she takes you as her rival.

186
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,460
What do you mean?

187
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,490
If she doesn’t want the dress,

188
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,660
but you want it, she will keep it.

189
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,160
If you want the play

190
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,930
she originally doesn’t want, she will accept it.

191
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,840
She is that kind of people.

192
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,410
Is Song-yi a bit childish?

193
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,780
What’s it?

194
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:16,450
So she accepted the Special because I want it?

195
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,480
Maybe not.

196
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,010
Cheon Song-yi is coming.

197
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,310
Hi.

198
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,580
Hello. Everyone.

199
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,480
Thank you for coming early.

200
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,850
Please look here.

201
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,420
Will you go there by bike?

202
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,730
I often go out by bike if I don’t have work.

203
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,330
As you know, I’m the green ambassador.

204
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,800
I see.

205
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,940
I didn’t have time to make up in the morning.

206
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,270
Are you beginning now?

207
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:15,370
The program is so real.

208
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,680
Make it as without makeup.

209
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,180
That’s much harder.

210
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,120
A real expert solves difficulties.

211
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,320
It’s because of the HDTV.

212
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,890
It shows clearly everything on the face.

213
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,130
If I really don’t do make-up,

214
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,630
I am going to die.

215
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,100
Make it as perfect

216
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,970
as PS, you know?

217
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,010
I came out directly after getting my face washed.

218
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,310
I only used some emulsion.

219
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,980
You are still very beautiful.

220
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,350
Really?

221
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,090
How do you usually take care?

222
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,120
Nothing special.

223
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,060
Smiling, eating well, and keeping optimistic

224
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,700
are the most important things.

225
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,900
I insist on health care products,

226
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,870
Wine, omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid.

227
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,910
I often take anesthetics as well.

228
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,920
To be honest, it’s really effective.

229
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,420
It makes me feel in a good mood.

230
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,720
Excuse me.

231
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,090
Hold on please. PD.

232
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,860
It’s a misunderstanding.

233
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,900
Song-yi, what do you mean by anesthetics?

234
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:44,560
What’s wrong?

235
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,470
I ate it every day. The anti-aging one.

236
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,870
That’s vitamin, bought from Australia last time.

237
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,940
Yes. But are they different? Aren’t they the same?

238
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,080
Not the same. You may get caught for this.

239
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,350
Are you mad at me?

240
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,390
No, that’s impossible.

241
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,450
Please wait a moment.

242
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,030
PD, Song-yi mixed vitamin with anesthetics.

243
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,730
She is cute, right?

244
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,300
You will cut this part, will you?

245
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,070
It’s interesting.

246
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:26,540
Yes. It’s a pity to cut it.

247
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:30,410
It may destroy her.

248
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:30,910
You know?

249
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,780
Excuse me. No photo, please.

250
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,190
Are you usually close to the classmates?

251
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,660
Of course.

252
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,920
I’m a star in the society,

253
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,360
but an ordinary student in the school

254
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,200
I have a good relationship with the classmates.

255
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,630
The guy in blue fleece is Lee Hyun-soo.

256
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,500
Hi, Hyun-soo.

257
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,400
Me?

258
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,370
Yes, Lee Hyun-soo.

259
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,340
Let’s have dinner together some time.

260
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,580
With me? Why?

261
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,680
I will call you.

262
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,780
Really? That’s great.

263
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,850
At the direction of six o'clock, Ha Yeong-a.

264
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,720
Yeong-a.

265
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,490
Professor.

266
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,560
You are so young
that I’d like to call your name directly.

267
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,630
How are you?

268
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,100
Please cut this part.

269
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,370
Cheon Song-yi.

270
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,810
Yes?

271
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,510
Maybe you are not clear about my rules

272
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,480
because you didn’t come to my class before.

273
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,080
Copying, piecing together, duplicating
and pasting are strictly forbidden.

274
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,720
Your report includes all.

275
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,460
Song-yi, nobody would know this.

276
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,770
I copied all the parts and re-arrange them.

277
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,630
Very professional, right?

278
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,270
It would never be found.

279
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,540
No, I didn’t copy.

280
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,710
Introduction in Chapter one is from
the essay in 1999.

281
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,680
Davison’s principle under thinking conditions

282
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,520
centered on psychical philosophy.

283
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,790
You just copied it without any change.

284
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,460
“Love is about conditions but not choices.”

285
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,320
“Psychic reaction is the nature.”

286
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,160
Every single word is unchanged.

287
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,460
The cases and indicates

288
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,730
are from the essay published in 1996.

289
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,840
“Study on the level of attitude measuring love”.

290
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,670
This part was copied technically.

291
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,980
The conclusions are totally the same

292
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,150
as the empiricism of love published in 1959.

293
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,050
The academic report was copied technically too.

294
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:33,190
Journalist Kim Gi-seok’s report in Dec. 1953.

295
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:35,260
The title is “Phenomenology of Love”.

296
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,400
“Love is lost and love is doubled”.

297
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,270
So the report gets zero.

298
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,170
Any different opinions?

299
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,420
So scary.

300
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,790
What a bad guy!

301
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,720
Hey, did you see Cheon Song-yi’s expression?

302
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,960
It’s unbelievable.

303
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
I recorded it.

304
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,860
The expression Mr. Do mentioned “zero”.

305
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,630
Great. Post it to the forum quickly.

306
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,260
Number of the viewers will explode.

307
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,730
Title: Song-yi Gets Zero!

308
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,640
The speed of comments is LTE LTE.

309
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,640
The stupid Cheon Song-yi

310
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,740
begins to pirate.

311
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,470
She really has no brain.

312
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,980
You mean I have neither common sense nor ideas?

313
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,980
No idea, no brain, stupid.

314
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,950
Cheon Song-yi even played tricks.

315
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,050
Yes.

316
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,750
How humiliating!

317
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:40,590
I only had a half cabbage and an apple today.

318
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,160
But I felt enough,

319
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,730
because I was scolded enough.

320
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,360
Come on. Keep posting it.

321
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,000
OK. Post it here.

322
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,700
What are you doing?

323
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,270
It dropped itself.

324
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,610
What’s wrong with the phone?

325
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:56,440
[Song-yi Gets Zero!]

326
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,680
Cheon Song-yi was so embarrassed in the class.

327
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,350
The professor should be appraised.

328
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,560
Cheon Song-yi is human. Everyone makes mistakes.

329
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,090
Cheon Song-yi, you can’t stay here like this.

330
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:23,340
Song-yi.

331
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,740
You said nobody would know.

332
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,510
Is he nobody?

333
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,340
How did he know it?

334
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,080
I really don’t understand.

335
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,080
Get out. I want to be alone.

336
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,450
Song-yi, are you all right?

337
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,950
You can hit me as usual.

338
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,820
I’ll feel better in that way.

339
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,790
Just leave me alone.

340
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,790
Stay out please.

341
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,420
Hello.

342
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,160
What a coincidence!

343
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,660
So what are you doing here?

344
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,700
It’s a shopping mall.

345
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,600
Shopping of course.

346
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,800
Many things are cheap. You can pick some, too.

347
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,770
You have the mood? Don’t you need to take a look?

348
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,770
Where?

349
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,210
You even don’t know it?

350
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,880
What?

351
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,010
I heard there is Cheon Song-yi Special.

352
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,080
The families will be interviewed too.

353
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,020
You don’t need to go for the interview?

354
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,590
You are her mother any way.

355
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,430
Oh, you mean the interview?

356
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,990
Of course, we’ve agreed.

357
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,930
Song-yi will have dinner with Yun-jae and me.

358
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,970
I’m not sure whether son-in-law Lee will come.

359
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:03,740
Son-in-law Lee?

360
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,240
I mean Hee-kyung.

361
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,340
They aren’t dating. But you call him son-in-law?

362
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,050
It’s because Song-yi didn’t agree.

363
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,850
Once she agrees, they will get marry soon.

364
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,450
But she is too picky.

365
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,430
I feel really sorry for son-in-law Lee.

366
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:32,700
After all, he’s the son of S&C.

367
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,080
Who is the one gave zero to Song-yi?

368
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,480
[Song-yi~]

369
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,620
Would you like to have some drink?

370
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,390
I’d have latte.

371
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,120
Hot cocoa.

372
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,260
Camomile tea.

373
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,060
Mocha coffee.

374
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,030
Americano.

375
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,230
[Song-yi~
Song-yi, where are you?]

376
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
New?

377
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,340
Yes?

378
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,000
Latte for director. Hot cocoa for Mr. Kim.

379
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,140
Camomile tea for Mr. La. Mocha for Mr. Choi.

380
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,410
I like Americano.

381
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,980
Didn’t you hear us?

382
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,180
Ah. Milky tea please.

383
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,420
[My Song-yi~
Song-yi, where are you?
I’m almost done.]

384
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,320
Newbie?

385
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,760
Thank you.

386
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,700
[My Song-yi~
Song-yi, where are you?
I’m almost done.
I will come for you soon.]

387
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,500
Listen…

388
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,430
Hello.

389
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,900
Yes, Se-mi.

390
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,470
-It’s OK. Go ahead.
-You…

391
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,940
Where are you going?

392
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,610
-What’s he doing?
-Director.

393
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:52,740
I’m good at dealing with people like this.

394
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,750
Let me deal with him in my way.

395
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,980
What date is it today?

396
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,920
Ah.

397
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,490
Yes, my birthday.

398
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,030
Treat me dinner if you feel sorry for me.

399
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,100
Of course, we are best friends.

400
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,570
I’ll treat you the most expensive dinner.

401
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:14,770
Really?

402
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,670
Call Cheon Song-yi to go together.

403
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,840
Song-yi is busy today.

404
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,040
Many people are talking about her.

405
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,910
Staying alone is better for her.

406
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,950
Really?

407
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,420
Yes. I know Song-yi better than you do.

408
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,820
OK. When will you finish? I’ll pick you up.

409
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,890
About eight o’clock.

410
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,760
Yes.

411
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,240
Here we are.

412
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,980
Miss?

413
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,290
Here you are.

414
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,330
One billion. Don’t bargain. Just buy it.

415
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,760
Buy at one billion. And sell at 1.2 billion.

416
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,470
OK.

417
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,740
What’s up!

418
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,070
What’s up!

419
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,770
Why are you so late?

420
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,180
I really can’t bear it.

421
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,840
I have to find something better.

422
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,380
[Bigbang.
Even SOLO activities rank top of the song list.]

423
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,590
[Cheon Song-yi, humiliating forever?
It’s zero humiliation this time!]

424
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:43,260
She becomes the trending topic again.

425
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,860
Oh my god. All are evil posts.

426
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:56,470
I’m Cheon Song-yi’s middle school classmate.

427
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,940
It seems you misunderstand her.

428
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,210
She isn’t getting too big for she’s famous.

429
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:06,880
She has always been so rude.

430
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,550
What makes you so happy?

431
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,850
What?

432
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,970
What brings you here all at once?

433
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,470
I moved here.

434
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,570
Why?

435
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,510
You don’t agree?

436
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,780
No, it’s impossible.

437
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,550
Here, enjoy it.

438
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,620
It’s okay to eat noodles like this?

439
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,490
No acting tomorrow?

440
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,790
A cup of liquor first.

441
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,670
I saw the news on internet.

442
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:07,940
You are so sad because of “zero”?

443
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,780
You used to get zero during senior high school.

444
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,250
You once got four for math, right?

445
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,380
I taught you to guess, but you didn’t listen.

446
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,880
It’s not about “zero”. Bok-ja. I...

447
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,890
Excuse me. I changed my name ten years ago.

448
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,260
Can you call me Hae-in?

449
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,170
I really can’t understand.

450
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:40,440
Why do people say like me before me

451
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,210
but speak ill of me behind my back?

452
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,880
Because you do things the others don’t like.

453
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,320
I don’t know. I’m not one of them.

454
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,520
Bad guy!

455
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,190
What?

456
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,770
My turn to draw?

457
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:12,400
Hold on. I didn’t discard. A moment.

458
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,110
Excuse me.

459
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,750
I win.

460
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,550
I win again.

461
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:27,290
What?

462
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,890
Oh my god!

463
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,890
We can never win.

464
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,160
Kid, where did you learn it from?

465
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,730
Are you his father?

466
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:39,230
What?

467
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,200
Oh, yes.

468
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,710
Are you Kim Mu-chan?

469
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,580
I win.

470
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:01,250
Kim Mu-chan,
did you take all time to play Mahjong?

471
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,690
Why are you so skillful?

472
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,540
Are you Kim Mu-chan’s grandson?

473
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,710
That’s my deceased father.

474
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,540
Is this…

475
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,679
The kid is my son.

476
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,590
Grandson and grandfather look alike.

477
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,690
How is it possible?

478
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,030
They both are skillful in Mahjong.

479
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,130
Not skillful. I won every time.

480
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:52,340
Your grandfather was defeated every round.

481
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,710
Really?

482
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,950
But he’s the top one in the capital as I know.

483
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:07,720
Nonsense. I’m the top one.

484
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:12,560
It seems he bragged.

485
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,100
But he never lied as I know.

486
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,300
You mean I’m lying?

487
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,270
Listen, I was the top one in the capital.

488
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,480
I’m the only one clear about what had happened.

489
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,080
Have you ever seen

490
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:38,450
your grandfather winning?

491
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,750
I can even remember his name. Kang Sam-sig.

492
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,990
He was stubborn and always made a scene.

493
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,130
It’s been 60 years. But he never changed.

494
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,670
You can see a lot of interesting things for living long.

495
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,340
It’s like everything happened yesterday.

496
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,600
Is it?

497
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:05,240
Nobody would think life is long.

498
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:09,550
Everyone thinks life is but a span.

499
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,850
I’ve lived here for 400 years.

500
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:17,520
But I can take away only few things.

501
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,130
Last time you mentioned

502
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,860
the kid you met 12 years ago.

503
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,160
I’m helping you look for her.

504
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,330
There are three middles schools.

505
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:34,240
We only need to check the graduation photos.

506
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,210
But I’m not sure about it.

507
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,310
Don’t bother.

508
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:42,680
But you said you want to see her before leaving.

509
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,880
I’m just curious.

510
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,390
If it’s necessary, we will finally meet, right?

511
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,430
If we can’t meet, it means it’s unnecessary.

512
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,100
It’s the truth I get with living here for long.

513
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:04,100
Two. Eight. Three. Two.

514
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,430
Password error.

515
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,870
How is it possible?

516
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:13,210
Two. Eight. Three. Two.

517
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,910
Password error.

518
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,740
Why? What’s wrong?

519
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,520
Listen. Don’t drop again.

520
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,390
Why don’t you listen to me?

521
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,160
You make me like a ghost!

522
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,260
And the clothes are white too.

523
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,270
One more time.

524
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:49,570
Two. Eight. Three. Two.

525
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,810
Input Forbidden.

526
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,210
Forbidden?

527
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,980
How dare you!

528
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,190
Open sesame!

529
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,220
Open sesame!

530
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,330
Open sesame!

531
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:13,670
Open sesame!

532
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,000
It really opens.

533
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,040
Of course.

534
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,310
I opened it.

535
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,010
Ah, the scolder from Joseon.

536
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,680
-I didn’t scold everyone.
-Scolder.

537
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,720
Why are you in my house?

538
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,880
It’s my house.

539
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,190
Happy now?

540
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,060
You gave me zero and made me lose face.

541
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
So are you happy now?

542
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,990
In my opinion,

543
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:44,500
your heart must be black.

544
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,130
I was thinking you must be a cold-blooded guy.

545
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,240
-Listen, Cheon Song-yi.
-What’s it?

546
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,300
You are not the only one

547
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,970
who can scold people in Joseon language.

548
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:57,180
Damcoffer in Bin-Zi year.

549
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,380
-Cofferdam!
-So annoying!

550
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:03,620
It’s my house!

551
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,660
Why didn’t you say it earlier?

552
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,830
You haven’t reached her from the day?

553
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,830
Yes, she didn’t answer the phone all the time.

554
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,440
God!

555
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,550
Hello?

556
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,150
Hello? Who’s that?

557
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,980
Why do you have Song-yi’s phone?

558
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,290
Get her!

559
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,650
What’s wrong with her?

560
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,420
Why didn’t she return her own house?

561
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,960
She came to your house by mistake.

562
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,200
You should have sent her back.

563
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,000
She got drunk and should be taken good care.

564
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,570
I was going to send her back.

565
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:33,310
But you called. I also let you enter my home.

566
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,640
Can’t you be polite?

567
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,850
Damn it!

568
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,060
Damn!

569
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,500
You sure you didn’t do anything wrong to her?

570
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,260
Hurry. Clear her away from my room.

571
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,900
What? Clear away?

572
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,140
Look at what you’ve said.

573
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,740
You think Song-yi is the rubbish?

574
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,640
How can you use the word “clear away”?

575
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,510
No,

576
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,680
I can’t just let you go.

577
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,780
Give me your mobile phone.

578
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,720
Give your phone to me.

579
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,190
You know Cheon Song-yi, right?

580
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,750
She is the most popular actress in SK.

581
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,960
Now she got drunk and entered into your house.

582
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,890
You may take some photos or do something else.

583
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,400
How can I trust you and just take her back?

584
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,930
-You are right.
-So…

585
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,600
If she is really that popular and great,

586
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,340
how can I trust you and let you take her away?

587
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,650
-What?
-She is the most popular actress in SK.

588
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,380
But she’s dead drunk.
I’m not sure what you’ll do to her.

589
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,850
What are you talking about?

590
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,750
-I’m her boyfriend.
-So annoying!

591
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:57,820
Stop fighting. I’m sleeping.

592
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,590
Cheon Song-yi.

593
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,700
You know you are sleeping in others’ house?

594
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:05,330
Which place is this?

595
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,230
That’s what I want to ask for.

596
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,800
Come on. One. Two. Three.

597
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,410
-Wake up.
-I see. Go home.

598
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,550
Be careful. This way.

599
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,500
Home.

600
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,100
What do you come? Leave.

601
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,470
I’m worrying about you.

602
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,240
What were you thinking about?

603
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,310
How could you get into others’ house?

604
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:53,580
What should we do if he did something bad?

605
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,980
He looks like a bad guy.

606
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,290
I’m tired.

607
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,520
I’m sleeping. Leave quickly.

608
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,520
I’ll leave after having some coffee.

609
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,820
Oh, no.

610
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,590
Do you have some beer?

611
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,520
It’s getting colder.

612
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,720
When should I get back?

613
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,220
Oh my god!

614
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,230
It’s so late.

615
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,100
Are you crazy?

616
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,970
You are still awake?

617
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:27,240
-Hey, I’m leaving now!
-Quickly!

618
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,910
Hey, I’m warning you.

619
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:30,110
Don’t hit my head back.

620
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:32,480
Hey. I feel hurt!

621
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,580
Damn it! My head back.

622
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,890
Ah! Damn!

623
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,600
Hello.

624
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,030
Se-mi?

625
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,930
I’m sorry. I forgot it.

626
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,740
No.

627
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:01,110
Cheon Song-yi got drunk and went to next door.

628
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,440
It’s okay.

629
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,910
I’d like to tell you I’m delayed by the work.

630
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:13,050
Well, let’s have dinner together next time.

631
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:16,620
Ah! I have to continue now.

632
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,090
See you.

633
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,070
Jae-kyung.

634
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:38,480
Are you late getting off work?

635
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,610
No, I’m out for voluntary activity.

636
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:44,580
You are really Gandhi in the tycoon world.

637
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,550
Nowadays, nobody will be a volunteer

638
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,550
for free in the country.

639
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,720
It’s still hard to see you even if you’re home.

640
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,530
It’s because I’m busy with my unregulated girl.

641
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:55,890
Your girl?

642
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,460
It’s you following after her all day long.

643
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,700
I have someone I can follow after.

644
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,000
Do you have one?

645
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
You work all the time and never get married?

646
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,840
As the heir of S&C, will you give up for that?

647
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,680
How’s your work?

648
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,380
People don’t know your real identity.

649
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,350
Behave yourself.

650
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:16,750
You were a leader at the beginning.

651
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,350
But I’m just a new employee.

652
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,050
I thought Han-kyung would inherit the company,

653
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,220
so I never went to the class about inheriting.

654
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,020
Vet was originally my dream.

655
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,660
You know it.

656
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:31,300
Yes, I know.

657
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,030
You’ve made a lot of efforts

658
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,630
after that.

659
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,440
So you will…

660
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,640
You are perfect.

661
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,140
I can’t catch you up.

662
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:45,880
And I don’t want to catch either.

663
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,720
Go back first.

664
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,720
I will answer the phone.

665
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,120
Okay.

666
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,490
Help me. Please let me out.

667
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,800
I was wrong. I won’t do it again.

668
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,400
I swear.

669
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,430
You are not that bad.

670
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:12,440
Of course I’m not a bad guy.

671
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,210
Compared to the people I killed before,

672
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:19,750
I want to kill people, but I want to save more.

673
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,910
You are the latter.

674
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,520
So I don’t want you to beg me

675
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,320
but appreciate.

676
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,710
Oh.

677
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,710
The professor gave Song-yi zero.

678
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,980
Where is Cheon Song-yi?

679
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,450
Why?

680
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,150
Will you change the mark?

681
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:38,120
Where is she?

682
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,160
Song-yi.

683
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,230
Did you get hit on your face?

684
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:19,400
What’s wrong?

685
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,970
It’s badly swollen.

686
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:23,640
I drank some liquor and beer yesterday.

687
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,740
And some noodles.

688
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,310
-Oh, I had a lot.
-It’s hard to wear make-up.

689
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,740
You’d better not film today.

690
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,250
No. I can’t.

691
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,180
I’ve a bit…

692
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,310
Hold on.

693
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,840
Nice to meet you.

694
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,540
Hey!

695
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,080
Change a beauty room.

696
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:08,750
Are you talking to me?

697
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:13,390
Are you too stupid to understand me?

698
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:15,120
Anybody else is here?

699
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,720
Why will I change a beauty room?

700
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,990
It’s because meeting you

701
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,890
makes me in a bad mood.

702
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,630
Me too.

703
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:26,600
How about changing it?

704
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,800
I’m your senior. How dare you!

705
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,740
Excuse me. You are the elder.

706
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,640
But I talk back.

707
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,040
But we have to be sensible.

708
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,180
You are indeed years elder than me.

709
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,410
-But you are not a senior.
-What?

710
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,080
I made my debut when I was 15.

711
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:43,050
It’s been 12 years now.

712
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,750
But it’s just five years for you.

713
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:48,650
I have no idea about “being canonical”.

714
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,290
So I never show off.

715
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,330
If we have to care for it,

716
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:56,460
I’m the senior.

717
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,430
It’s said you originally refused your Special.

718
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,840
But you accepted it after learning I wanted it.

719
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,100
Yes.

720
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,170
How did you know that?

721
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,040
You feel inferior to me?

722
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,040
Of course not.

723
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,580
Being inferior means I’m not as good as others.

724
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,910
I understand this even I’m a bit stupid.

725
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,850
I feel superior in front of you.

726
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,120
Do you?

727
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,420
You really feel superior,

728
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,360
so you even accepted

729
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,830
the weird and corny plays?

730
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:35,600
People are scolding you all the time, you know?

731
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,770
Yes.

732
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:41,410
Why are they just talking about me and my plays?

733
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:44,480
Seems they don’t have any other topics.

734
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,640
It’s good.

735
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,050
Appraising me or scolding me,

736
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,120
it’s better than the series with a rating of 4%.

737
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,150
People even don’t know who the actress is.

738
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,920
Are you judging my series?

739
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,360
Oh.

740
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,230
Your series only had a rating of 4% last month.

741
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:03,530
That’s the play I refused.

742
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,370
The bad results even made me feel sorry.

743
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:09,900
You…

744
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,240
Rating doesn’t mean everything.

745
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,470
Everyone is appraising my excellent work.

746
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,310
[Useless: fans fascinated by the operas.]

747
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,310
Many are fascinated by the opera, you know?

748
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:21,710
Of course I know finally they became useless.

749
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,550
The boss spent his entire fortune on the series

750
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:27,220
also became completely useless.

751
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:30,190
You’d better treat him a dinner at least.

752
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:32,160
That’s the right thing you should do.

753
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,460
Hey. You…

754
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,530
One more thing,

755
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:36,660
I know another thing. Should I tell you?

756
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:42,500
I know you keep spreading rumors about me.

757
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,770
I intended to sue you for libel,

758
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:47,710
but I’m trying to control myself.

759
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,270
You know?

760
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,080
So, enough is enough.

761
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:15,270
I heard you’re trying to seduce the son of S&C.

762
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:16,670
Is it a rumor?

763
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,470
Not a rumor. It’s true.

764
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,640
But you made it wrong.

765
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,310
He is the one trying every way to seduce me.

766
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,020
I see.

767
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:34,020
That’s why your mom who relies on you

768
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,090
has the rumor of showing off by using S&C.

769
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,690
She said the son of S&C will be her son-in-law.

770
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,300
Is it a bit early?

771
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,570
Don’t get families involved in.

772
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,240
Why?

773
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,570
I may become a member of the family, too.

774
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:57,940
So don’t make too much trouble.

775
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,450
If you can’t have it, just give up early.

776
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,390
I don’t want it. It doesn’t mean I can’t.

777
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,060
It seems you don’t know me.

778
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,760
I won’t think of relying on others.

779
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,100
Because I can support myself.

780
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,370
What?

781
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,530
You…

782
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,810
What’s going on?

783
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,980
Why are you here?

784
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:34,380
Let’s go out.

785
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,480
Who says you can go out?

786
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,650
Hey.

787
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,390
You didn’t see I was talking to her?

788
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,290
None of your business. Get out…

789
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,840
It’s really ridiculous, you know?

790
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,240
How do you know I’m here?

791
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:09,980
What?

792
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,450
Well.

793
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:17,720
Is it because I went into your home by mistake?

794
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,490
Are you here to settle it?

795
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,160
It’s my mistake.

796
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,630
But it’s forgivable.

797
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,370
Everyone in the world drinks

798
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,270
and may get drunk.

799
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:33,170
A drunken man may make a mistake.

800
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,640
Who is she?

801
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,110
Why do you take my photo without my permission?

802
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:41,050
Who is she?

803
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:43,120
I have to answer you?

804
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,520
What are you doing?

805
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,820
Are you crazy?

806
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,130
Who are you?

807
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:07,340
Things will happen, whether you want it or not.

808
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:13,110
It’s named “destiny” by earthmen.

809
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:35,570
First love?

810
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:39,270
It’s really not a good question.

811
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,040
Experienced dating for a few times,

812
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,910
but no one can be called first love.

813
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:52,220
There was an accident when I was young.

814
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,850
An uncle saved me.

815
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:57,190
But I can’t remember his face.

816
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,430
He’s tall and warm.

817
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:03,060
Female I like…

818
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,200
None.

819
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,200
Actually I have the type I dislike.

820
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,000
The drunken woman is the most hateful one.

821
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,640
The obnoxious drunk is more hateful.

822
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,570
The ignorant and arrogant woman

823
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:16,070
is very hateful.

824
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,910
I know a woman

825
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,550
with all these bad things.

826
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:23,820
The most awful one.

827
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,480
The greatest one.

828
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,320
It’s a very short moment,

829
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,820
but it’s mysterious and soft.

830
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,930
I still remember him.

831
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:38,030
Maybe he remembers me, too.

832
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:44,570
I can recognize him once I see him.

833
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,270
It’s like destiny.

834
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:50,980
CUT!

835
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:51,910
OK!

836
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,480
Thank you.

837
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,990
What an unlucky guy!

Who is the man

840
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,430
held your hand and took you out?

841
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:13,900
You know the feeling now?

842
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,600
I think he wants to chase me.

843
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,840
Reincarnation or doppelganger？

844
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,240
You care about her.

845
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:20,840
Stomach…

846
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,540
I’m a star, the National Goddess.

847
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,340
I feel so sick.

848
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,550
You think I will accept your request?

849
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:29,510
You can’t leave.

850
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:32,050
Stay beside me when I wake up.

851
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:34,520
The owner of the shoes may die?

852
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,790
Will you get involved like 12 years ago

853
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,060
or just let it be?
