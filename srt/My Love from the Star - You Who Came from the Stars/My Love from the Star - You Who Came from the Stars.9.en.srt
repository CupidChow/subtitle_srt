2
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,890
Harry Harlow, the famous American psychologist,
ever did an experiment.

3
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:46,760
He took orangutan cubs, which share 95%
of human genetic identity,

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,460
away from mother orangutans,

5
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,960
and locked them in a room where there were
two monkey dummies inside.

6
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,670
One dummy was wrapped with iron wires,
hung with a milk bottle.

7
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,840
The other was wrapped with soft cloth,

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,640
without milk bottle.

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,940
Which dummy did the cubs prefer?

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,980
The one with milk bottle.

11
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:19,620
Before the experiment, it was assumed
the cubs preferred the one with milk bottle.

12
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,660
Unexpectedly,

13
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,530
the cubs had a strong attachment to the one
wrapped with soft cloth.

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,300
It demonstrated the importance of contact.

15
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,140
Give me 15 seconds.

16
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:36,110
What 15 seconds?

17
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,110
If I’m still a porcelain, puppy or tree
in your eyes after 15 seconds,

18
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,450
I'll admit that I'm not attractive.

19
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,990
Go.

20
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,610
Gazing is also a kind of indirect contact.

21
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,710
When people look into their lovers’ eyes,

22
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,410
dopamine is secreted in their brain,

23
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,280
which makes them happy.

24
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,100
When they kiss, heart will beat twice
as fast as usual.

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,530
The average breath will also rise
by over 20 times per minute.

26
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,070
Blood pressure will rise instantly.

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,650
So, they’ll be nervous, short of breath,

28
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,350
and feel dizzy,

29
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,090
mistakenly thinking they’re in love.

30
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,520
But it’s just a joke played by intimate contact,

31
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,990
and a smokescreen of hormone.

32
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,760
Don’t be fooled by it.

71

It isn’t good. Let’s go to hospital.

89

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,790
He has a bad fever.

96
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,330
How many degrees?

97
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,630
About 50?

98
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,270
He’d be dead if it’s 50 degrees.

99
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:40,710
Come on. Use your brain, OK?

100
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,510
Anyway, he feels very hot. What should I do?

101
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,280
He’s unwilling to go to hospital.

102

Who is it?

103
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,350
Does it matter?

104
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,420
Tell me what to do.

105
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,690
You raised three nephews. Aren’t you good at it?

106
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,720
Of course I know. Since he has a fever...

107
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,790
What?

108
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,790
Undress him.

109
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,860
Is it necessary?

110
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,900
Have you stripped him?

111
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,440
Not yet.

112
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,040
Strip him and do a full-body massage
with a warm towel.

113
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:20,050
A full-body massage?

114
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,910
Do I have to do that?

115
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,850
That’s effective.

116
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,790
I even took my nephew’s diaper when I did that.

117
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,090
Honey, he isn’t a kid.

118
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,400
Isn’t he? A big boy? How old is he?

119
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,799
Wait.

120
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,400
What... is that?

121
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,040
Obviously, it’s a man’s...

122
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,440
I’m hanging up.

123
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,280
Right. I gotta save him first.

124
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,550
What are you doing?

125
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,480
This is the most effective way to reduce fever.

126
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,820
Would you strip off?

127
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,590
Stop it.

128
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,990
Go out.

129
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,330
Lucky of you.

130
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,160
I dreamed to be Helen Keller,

131
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,300
you know, the Lady with the Lamp.

132
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,930
That’s Florence Nightingale.

133
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,970
Don’t mind the details.

134
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,570
The point is that I dreamed to be a nurse
and I’m nursing you.

135
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,610
You need a full-body massage with a warm towel.

136
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,880
If you don’t want me to do it,

137
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,620
do it yourself.

138
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,720
Go out, please.

139
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,190
Could it be that you’re embarrassed?

140
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,830
Not your fault.

141
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,400
I warned you

142
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,130
I’m charming,

143
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,530
and attractive.

144
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,670
I know.

145
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,440
After all, you are a man.

146
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
You can’t control yourself by will.

147
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,980
Even so, ki... ki...

148
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,750
Whatever. You fell ill after that.

149
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,120
What am I then?

150
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,990
Could it be...

151
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,030
Your first kiss?

152
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,800
First kiss?

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,730
Of course not.

154
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,370
As a grown-up, what have you done?

155
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,140
Gosh. You took advantage of me.

156
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,250
But now I’m the one who feel guilty.

157
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,690
Anyway, reduce the fever first.
Bear it even if it's cold.

158
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,420
How could you be sick suddenly?

159
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,400
So cold.

160
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,550
Alas. Gosh.

161
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,320
Why are you calling me?

162
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,090
Why not call that brat?

163
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,360
Why not call that brat you like?

164
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,100
Have you slept?

165
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,180
Call me if you haven’t.

166
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,740
Oh. What’s wrong?

167
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,670
Yoo Seo. I’m curious about something.

168
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,710
What?

Do Min-joon.

171
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,050
How old is he?

172
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,720
I heard he's a university lecturer.

173
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,520
What did he do before?

174
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,530
Does he have any brothers,

175
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,830
twins or the like?

176
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,370
Why do you ask about this?

177
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,870
What’s his relationship with Cheon Song-yi?

178
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,040
Have you found anything?

179
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,050
You’re Cheon Song-yi’s best friend.

180
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,780
Don’t ask me. Go to ask your friend.

181
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,250
I’m not her friend.

182
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,960
That’s strange.

183
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,630
Since you’re not, why are you curious
about their relationship?

184
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,130
Can't you just answer me?

185
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,540
That man is kind of weird.

186
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,510
How so?

187
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,290
What are you doing there?

188
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,660
Oh. You wake up.

189
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,530
Do you feel better?

190
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,200
I’m worried, so I want to stay with you.

191
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,710
It’s too cold with the window open.

192
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,310
Why can’t it be unzipped?

193
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,580
How to unzip it?

194
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,020
I’m fine now. You may leave.

195
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,550
Excuse me? What did you say?

196
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,020
“I’m fine now. You may leave”?

197
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,820
Did I mishear or are you out of mind?

198
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,160
How could you say that?

199
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,030
You’re ungrateful to someone who’s been

200
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,730
looking after you all night long, aren’t you?

201
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,830
You’re ungrateful. Did you come back to life?

202
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,470
It's so hard to open it.

203
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,770
Shut your mouth. Alright?

204
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,510
The zipper is broken. It can’t be unzipped.

205
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,040
Try it outside.

206
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,580
Just stay like this. Don’t bother me.

207
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,750
What? Are you kidding?

208
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,620
Unzip it!

209
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,250
Come on!

210
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,450
Mr. Do Min-joon!

211
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,620
Do Min-joon!

212
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,490
Hey!

213
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:49,060
Huh. I looked after you. Are you so ungrateful?

214
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,060
You can't do this.

215
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,300
You can’t treat me like this.

216
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,400
I looked after you when you’re sick.

217
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,600
Shouldn’t you say thanks to me first?

218
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,970
You can’t treat me like this.

219
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,880
Keep my heartfelt advice in mind.

220
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,280
Unzip it for me!

221
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,680
I'll count to three.

222
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,120
I’m done with it. I don’t know what I will do.

223
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,890
One, two, two and a half.

224
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:21,390
Two and a half and a half.

225
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:25,530
Half and a half...

226
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,170
Be quiet. Annoying.

227
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,680
Get me out. OK?

228
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,950
Hey, what are you doing? Get me out!

229
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,350
Ah! Let go!

230
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,750
I... I’m gonna rip you apart!

231
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,860
Hey, I’ll kill you when I get out!

232
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,990
It’s scary when I’m furious!

233
00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:02,430
Ah... Ah...

234
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,140
Damn. You swooped over me and
got me infatuated yesterday.

235
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,380
But now you make me down.

236
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,109
You demon! You jerk! Damn it!

237
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,790
[Do Min-joon]

238
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,890
Oh, it’s freezing.

239
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,060
It’s easier to get hungry when it's cold.

240
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,430
What? Hasn’t Professor Do come?

241
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,470
He got lessons to teach today.

242
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,170
What's going on? He’d never be late.

243
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,770
I met the assistant professor on the way.

244
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,440
He said he wouldn't come today.

245
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
He’s sick.

246
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,980
Can he be sick? It’s the first time.

247
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,870
Who is it?

248
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,210
Mr. Jang?

249
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,710
Ms. Cheon Song-yi?

250
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,410
Hi, glad to see you again.

251
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,920
Mr. Jang.

252
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,690
Happy New Year.

253
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,560
Yeah. Happy New Year.

254
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,060
Mr. Jang.

255
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,700
Could you get me out of it?

256
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,840
Have Do Min-joon called you at midnight?

257
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,710
Yeah.

258
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,710
Why did he get sick suddenly?

259
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,350
He’s so sick but still won’t go to hospital.

260
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,550
He didn’t have to.

261
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,180
Why?

262
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,930
Eat some, even if you feel unwell.

263
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,430
My throat hurts and I can’t swallow.

264
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,700
What’s going on exactly?

265
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,670
It also happened over 30 years ago
when you worked in bank,

266
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,910
when you first met me.

267
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,850
A clerk who hated you made you drink coffee
with his saliva.

268
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,590
You fainted and was sick for one week.

269
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,090
Min Gyeong-uk.

270
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,530
I still remember his face clearly.

271
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:48,270
You don’t dine with others for fear of that.

272
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:53,340
Did you dine with Cheon Song-yi?

273
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,570
Well...

274
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:01,180
No. You dined with me last time as well.

275
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,750
It’s OK, isn’t it?

276
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,020
What happened on earth?

277
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:15,460
Could it be... that?

278
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,560
That...

279
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
What?

280
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,670
Alas, I want to rest.

281
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,040
Why didn’t you bear it?

282
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,610
Why did you risk your life?

283
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:35,580
Take a rest then.

284
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,290
Why did you do that when you’re about to leave?

285
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,520
Sorry for that.

286
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,400
Is it OK if you don’t leave?

287
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,500
If you leave when you’re deep in love,

288
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,100
not only you who will leave,

289
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,740
but those who stay will feel very sad.

290
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,780
Alas. How could it be?

291
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,320
It’s terrifying that someone died suddenly.

292
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,320
Yeah. The wall should be repainted.

293
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,730
Didn’t you talk to the person live here?

294
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,960
We seldom met.

295
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,770
He’s a night owl.

296
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,400
Don’t spread it. Or the house price will go down.

297
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,840
OK.

298
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,810
This guy is crazily obsessed with Han Yoo-ra.

299
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,980
-Detective Park.
-Yes?

300
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,880
What’s this?

301
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,990
Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

302
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,220
It’s one month ago.

303
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,130
Was the woman pregnant?

304
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,900
The autopsy report doesn’t show this result.

305
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,970
NFS report only shows medicine records.

306
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,500
If her belly isn't big,

307
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,070
the early pregnancy is hard to find by autopsy.

308
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,270
And the autopsy only concerns suicide or murder.

309
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,510
So, the pregnancy wasn’t checked additionally.

310
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,350
Gotta check the bill of treatment.

311
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,350
This case is so dramatic.

312
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,490
So, Han Yoo-ra did have a boyfriend,

313
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:31,430
who went to the Death Experience Pavilion
with her, right?

314
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:36,030
Could it be... that man,

315
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,800
Do Min-joon?

316
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,500
How so?

317
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,240
It’s gossiped that

318
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,370
Han Yoo-ra and Cheon Song-yi fought fiercely

319
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,210
for a man in the beauty room?

320
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,450
We have checked the CCTV there.

321
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,310
There’s none about that.

322
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,950
Yeah. But they argued indeed.

323
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,190
And a man showed up,

324
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,790
Do Min-joon.

325
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,190
Let’s sort it out.

326
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,030
Do Min-joon and Cheon Song-yi are neighbors
and fall in love.

327
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,730
But Han Yoo-ra has an affair with Do Min-joon.

328
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,470
Because this man is handsome and rich.

329
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,540
Cheon Song-yi finds it out.

330
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,440
She lost her temper and made a scene.

331
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,850
So, he chose Cheon Song-yi.

332
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,520
But Han Yoo-ra was pregnant.

333
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,820
So, Do Min-joon, the gentleman-faced beast,

334
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:32,260
got on the boat to get rid of Han Yoo-ra.

335
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,990
Do Min-joon had alibis for that day.

336
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,900
That’s a little bit weird.

337
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,170
We have no evidence. Don't jump to conclusions.

338
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,940
No physical evidence, but love evidence. Man.

339
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,310
You know nothing. Nagging you is no use at all.

340
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,750
Sorry to bother you.

341
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,180
Remember to let him take the rest of porridge.

342
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,580
Yes, sir.

343
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,450
Rest assured. Good day.

344
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,090
No matter how he has offended you,

345
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,490
don’t spit into his porridge for revenge.

346
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,400
I do want to do that.

347
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,900
I’m joking, sir.

348
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,670
Do not do that. It’d be a big trouble.

349
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,000
Records upon the last three months on Earth.

350
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,440
What is that?

351
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,910
What do you mean the last three months?

352
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,110
Are you going somewhere else?
Or do you have incurable disease?

353
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,110
I told you no question.

354
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,980
Hey, it won’t be.

355
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,860
Yoo-ra is in early pregnancy.

356
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,760
Yes.

357
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,860
Why isn’t it shown on the autopsy report?

358
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,000
It’s early pregnancy,

359
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,500
so the autopsy by the NFS didn’t find it out.

360
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,640
It’s found by chance in hospital's diagnosis.

361
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,510
My friends

362
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,310
and your friends are almost all here.

363
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,940
You may expect

364
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,250
what I will tell them.

365
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:40,490
Hearing the words, even you will be shocked.

366
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,530
It depends on how you deal with my depression.

367
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,430
I stopped medicine not long ago.

368
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,700
The prosecution takes it as a murder case,
and is looking for Han Yoo-ra’s boyfriend.

369
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,970
Cheon Song-yi may also be summoned to testify.

370
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,610
If she tells the prosecution your relationship
with Han Yoo-ra...

371
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:06,240
I’m going somewhere first.

372
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:12,620
I said I’d pay you back.
Are you afraid I cheat you?

373
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,320
I’m Cheon Song-yi’s mom. No need to worry.

374
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,090
OK. Goodbye.

375
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,730
It’s been a while, Mrs. Cheon.

376
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,400
Yeah, Mr. Kang.

377
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,070
You called frequently months ago to sign
with Cheon Song-yi,

378
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,110
while you’re out of touch lately.
I’m so disappointed.

379
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,610
You want some coffee?

380
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,250
Really?

381
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,320
So much contract money? Why?

382
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,830
Right. Song-yi deserves this price.

383
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,130
But I have conditions.

384
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,700
What conditions?

385
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,400
Her works have been too pure and innocent.

386
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,240
Ah?

387
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,970
She is a big girl now.

388
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,240
What do you mean?

389
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,110
Break new ground

390
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:15,150
and change her image.

391
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,580
She may take photos like phone wallpapers first,

392
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,720
and try to shoot blue movies.

393
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,960
But I won’t ask her to do things too disgusting.

394
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,000
Mrs. Cheon.

395
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Don’t call me Mrs. Cheon!

396
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,100
I don’t know nasty perverts like you.

397
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,170
Go to ask your mother why I’m furious

398
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,040
and how a mother feels.

399
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,240
You shrew.

400
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,680
You see your daughter as a cash cow.

401
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,810
Stop pretending as a good mother.

402
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,080
What? Isn’t the money enough?

403
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,820
Just be honest and tell me. You’ll say yes
with some more money. Right?

404
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,020
For money, you will accept any conditions.

405
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,220
You, Cheon Song-yi’s mother, even trade her soul

406
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,630
for money.

407
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,690
What?

408
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,300
I offer you the most money.

409
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,630
I’m the only one who gives her the chance

410
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:08,170
to make money with her appeal.

411
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,940
Darn it.

412
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:17,380
Your daughter’s acting career is over.

413
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,250
Your cash cow is dead.

414
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,150
Come to your senses.

415
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,310
What happened? Did I fall asleep?

416
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,090
Do you feel better?

417
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,700
Hasn’t your hand recovered? How bad is it?

418
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,370
It’s fine.

419
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,010
Your dad looked after you and just left.

420
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,650
He’s worried about you.

421
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,320
You’re closer to your dad than mom.

422
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,020
Me too.

423
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,220
Where is your dad?

424
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,620
I don't know.

425
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,690
I haven’t seen him for 12 years.

426
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,700
I miss him, but he never comes to see me.

427
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:54,140
I was too ignorant and made him sad
when we parted.

428
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,410
Sis. I’m hungry.

429
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,280
Where are mom and dad?

430
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,620
You can leave if you want.

431
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,490
I repeat it again. I’ll raise the kids.

432
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,060
You raise Yun-jae. I raise Song-yi.

433
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,090
Why do you raise Song-yi who can make money

434
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,130
yet I raise the useless Yun-jae?

435
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,470
Right. I’ll raise Song-yi who can make money.

436
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,670
You’ll ruin her if you raise her.

437
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,570
I make Song-yi become a child star.

438
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,340
I accompany her to the studio day and night.

439
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,710
So I will bring her up

440
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,750
and make her succeed.

441
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,920
I can do that, too.

442
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,380
I can also accompany her to the studio
day and night

443
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,790
and make her succeed.

444
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,350
You can do it, so can I.

445
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,420
Am I nuts?

446
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,020
She makes countless money.

447
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,630
How can I give the cash cow to you?

448
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,030
Song-yi.

449
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,370
That’s not what I meant. No.

450
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,040
Don’t touch me!

451
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,410
-Song-yi.
-Don’t call my name.

452
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,180
From now on, you are no longer my dad.

453
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,880
Don’t show up in front of me again.

454
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,490
If you call my name again,

455
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,360
I’ll...

456
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,090
kill myself!

457
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,130
Looks like I’ve grown up.

458
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,770
I get to understand what my dad said.

459
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,670
He was angry and said that.

460
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:42,480
Now I’m angry that I spent too little time
with dad.

461
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:48,120
It’s too short and he shouldn’t
have loved me so much.

462
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,830
Then I ran out and almost got killed

463
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,430
by a truck on the street.

464
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,430
An uncle saved my life.

465
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,340
It's really weird.

466
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,000
I saw the truck right in front of me.

467
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,340
In a flash, I crossed the street

468
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,540
and lied in that man’s arms.

469
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,150
Who was that man?

470
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,620
Was he a human or ghost?

471
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,950
He’s in black,

472
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,190
like a deity.

473
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,090
Ridiculous.

474
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,160
Yes, I know.

475
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,460
I think it’s ridiculous, too.

476
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,260
But that’s true.

477
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,100
Not just me, Hee-kyung saw it as well.

478
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,440
Go to bed.

479
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
[Lee Jae-kyung]

480
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,470
What? It’s Jae-kyung.

481
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,480
Why does he contact me so frequently?

482
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,340
No!

483
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,680
No. How come it fell suddenly?

484
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:55,520
The number you dial...

485
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,130
Song-yi.

486
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,230
Cheon Song-yi.

487
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,670
Are you there?

488
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,700
No?

489
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,480
Lucky of you.

490
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,980
Jae-kyung’s been strange lately.

491
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,850
How so?

492
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,590
It seems he’s into me.

493
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,290
He even came to my home last time,

494
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,790
and told me to take good care of myself.

495
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,060
He keeps calling me for dinner.

496
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,530
Alas. What should I do?

497
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,660
I really don’t like this.

498
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,700
Will he and his brothers turn against each other?

499
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,440
What if Hee-kyung and Jae-kyung fall out
because of me?

500
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,780
You think all the men in the world love you?

501
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,240
Except you.

502
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,550
Right.

503
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,680
You can’t be excluded.

504
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,350
Last night,

505
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:01,320
you did make me feel lost.

506
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,530
What kind of girl is your type?

507
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,960
I don’t have that thingy.

508
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,330
I do.

509
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,600
I wish

510
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,310
someone could be with me forever,

511
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,739
not like my dad who disappeared suddenly.

512
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,480
Someone could accompany me

513
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,190
by my side all the lifetime.

514
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:39,489
So, Hee-kyung is the right man.

515
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,060
What’s wrong with you?

516
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,830
I gotta prep for tomorrow’s class.

517
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,240
Who are you?

518
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,510
That’s my question to you.

519
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,780
Who are you? How come you came out of
Song-yi’s home?

520
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,250
As I know, no one is at her home now.

521
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,550
Yeah. She isn't at home.

522
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,560
I thought she was, so I went in.

523
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,160
If you see her,

524
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,130
you may tell her. Badly, I didn’t see her.

525
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:55,000
Also, we’ll meet again very soon.

526
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,270
Tell her that as well.

527
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,720
What’s the matter?

528
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,520
Enough.

529
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,330
What?

530
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,180
Do you have

531
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,920
the USB?

532
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,650
You’d better give it to me,

533
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,920
for you, also for Cheon Song-yi.

534
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,400
You should know this.

535
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,330
A boy like you

536
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:04,600
is unable to handle me.

537
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,110
You live now

538
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:13,110
because of my mercy.

539
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,450
So does Cheon Song-yi.

540
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,920
So,

541
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,820
you should be grateful to me.

542
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,990
If you dare to touch Cheon Song-yi,

543
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:05,860
your true colors will be exposed to the world.

544
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,700
I am

545
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,670
a man of my word.

546
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,240
Also,

547
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,340
you should know this.

548
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,350
You

549
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,810
are

550
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,150
unable to kill me definitely.

551
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,270
I wish

552
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,980
someone could be with me forever,

553
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,320
not like my dad who disappeared suddenly.

554
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,190
Someone could accompany me

555
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,220
by my side all the lifetime.

556
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,730
If you’re in love and you leave,

557
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,360
not only you,

558
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:15,000
but those who stay here will be deeply hurt.

559
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,800
Are you Professor Do Min-joon?

560
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:49,230
Nice to meet you.

561
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,170
You are...

562
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,370
Oh, I... I’m Yoo Se-mi,

563
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,840
an actress.

564
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,480
Oh.

565
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:06,250
Sorry. I heard you got classes today

566
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:08,420
and took the liberty of coming here.

567
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,260
I wonder if you know

568
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,160
I’m Cheon Song-yi’s friend.

569
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,560
I wanna talk with you about her.

570
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,700
Are you free now?

571
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,010
Sorry. You must be busy.

572
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,780
What do you want to know?

573
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,810
Well, has Song-yi told you about me?

574
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,880
No. How did she put on makeup?

575
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,320
That’s awful, isn’t it?

576
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,850
Her acting skills are terrible.

577
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:43,220
She doesn’t take it seriously at all.

578
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,690
I’m gonna give her some advice when we meet.

579
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,930
Well...

580
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,970
I’ve heard a lot of you from her.

581
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:59,440
She said you helped her so much.

582
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,910
She seems to rely on you.

583
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,150
Actually, she and I

584
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:12,020
have been best friends since junior high.

585
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,790
But after that bad thing was exposed,

586
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,890
a misunderstanding occurred.

587
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:22,830
Now there’s an estrangement between us.

588
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,800
I’m trying all means to make up.

589
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,240
Do you know about her character?

590
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,400
Yes,

591
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,710
I do.

592
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,840
It isn’t that simple.

593
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,140
It isn’t.

594
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:43,280
I know it isn’t going well for her.

595
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,380
I still want to help her.

596
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,020
But

597
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,290
if she finds out I'm like this,

598
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:53,990
she’ll hate me more.

599
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,100
Can you do me a favor?

600
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,730
I’m worried about her

601
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:02,970
that if anything bad happened to her.

602
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:07,870
After all, I can’t contact her directly.

603
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:15,310
Can I contact you when I want to know?

604
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,720
Yes.

605
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,130
Do you know Song-yi lately

606
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,660
or have you known her for long?

607
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,240
We first met when she moved here.

608
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,540
Oh, I see.

609
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,510
It’s so good

610
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,980
that she has a man like you by her side.

611
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,030
Song-yi. Take this.

612
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,130
Hey, are you insane?

613
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,330
What to do?

614
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,900
Thanks.

615
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,210
I’m gonna eat it.

616
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,410
Sorry, Se-mi.

617
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:18,210
It’s my habit. I can’t help...

618
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:21,350
It’s fine. You’ve been with Song-yi for long.

619
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:23,820
It happens.

620
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,820
Thank you so much.

621
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,490
You must feel bad since that happened to her.

622
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,320
And you have to come to me now.

623
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,690
-No.
-No.

624
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,500
Anyway,

625
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,100
you worked with superstars like Song-yi.

626
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,840
Now you work with me. You must feel unfair.

627
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,640
If there’s anything I should know,

628
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,210
just tell me.

629
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,250
It isn’t like that.

630
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,520
You are an angel.

631
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,390
Honestly, compared to Song-yi,

632
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,790
it’s better to work with you.

633
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,190
Really?

634
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,530
Of course.

635
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,030
Really?

636
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,530
Of course.

637
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,840
Much better.

638
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,140
Angel?

639
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,140
Hey.

640
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,280
How could you say that?

641
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,180
And you?

642
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,980
“Of course. Much better.”

643
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,160
Darn it. Just work for a living, how...

644
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,190
You prefer mom or dad?

645
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:41,790
That’s indeed the hardest question.

646
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,700
When I was a kid, I told my dad I liked him,

647
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,800
and told my mom I liked her.

648
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,670
Deep down, I like my grandma the most.

649
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,870
Why?

650
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,510
It’s my grandma who brought me up.

651
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,940
I was on Song-yi’s side deep down today,

652
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,810
but lied that I liked Se-mi.

653
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,810
So did I.

654
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,150
-Guys.
-Hey, bro.

655
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,180
Hello.

656
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,720
Where is Se-mi?

657
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,550
Over there.

658
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,330
Sorry.

659
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,800
Please do it again.

660
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,530
Come on. Do it again.

661
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,000
Ready.

662
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,840
Action.

663
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,740
Ah, sorry.

664
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,110
I’m not in right mood.

665
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,380
What's going on?

666
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,920
-What’s wrong with him?
-Director. Please do it again.

667
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,850
He is annoying.

668
00:45:39,850 --> 00:45:43,160
Shoot the kiss scene over and over.

669
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,460
Hi, compared to Cheon Song-yi,

670
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,830
Yoo Se-mi is better.

671
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:51,100
That lass is so soft.

672
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,000
Who are you?

673
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,610
Oh. Se-mi.

674
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,710
Do you feel tired?

675
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:08,910
Are you cold?

676
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,060
Why did you meet Yoo Se-mi?

677
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,660
Why did she go to you?

678
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:27,000
I’ve told you

679
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Yoo Se-mi’s worried about you.

680
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,400
Worried about me?

681
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,840
That’s funny.

682
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,140
She isn’t my friend anymore.

683
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,180
That is speechless.

684
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,610
What is she up to?

685
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:40,050
What does she want to know?

686
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,150
To ask about how miserable my life is?

687
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,880
I heard you’ve been friends for long.

688
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,220
Does it have anything to do with you?

689
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,520
She seems a nice person.

690
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,460
Do Min-joon. Which side are you on?

691
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,890
On my side or Yoo So-mi’s?

692
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,360
We're not talking about this.

693
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,430
No? Don’t you think

694
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,800
I hate her for a reason?

695
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,900
Yeah.

696
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,770
Everything happens for a reason.

697
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:07,210
People around you leave also for a reason.

698
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:08,840
What?

699
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,440
I end up like this.

700
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,640
Is it my fault?

701
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,440
You should think about it.

702
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,880
Before you complain people aren’t on your side,

703
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,080
you should think first why you fail
to turn them on your side.

704
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,620
Maybe your loneliness

705
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,490
is all your fault.

706
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:22,290
I’m not lonely. Who said I’m lonely?

707
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:23,760
If not,

708
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,730
why did you come to me?

709
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,490
You neither came to friends nor your families.

710
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:30,630
Why did you come to a stranger’s home?

711
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:32,200
Did you know about me?

712
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,230
Why did you rely on me?

713
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,970
You are lonely,

714
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,800
unaccompanied,

715
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,610
and have nowhere to go.

716
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:42,010
Get out!

717
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,940
This is my home.

718
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,880
Shut up! Get out!

719
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,460
Have you received my message?

720
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,030
Yes.

721
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,660
Why didn’t you call me?

722
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,130
I was scared.

723
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:12,100
I thought a lot after I answered your call.

724
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,880
I’ve been so numb.

725
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,550
It’s you who speak it out that I love Song-yi.

726
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,210
My letter

727
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:25,350
was also forwarded to Song-yi by you.

728
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,920
Because Song-yi

729
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,090
always calls you out and talks to you
when she feels tired.

730
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:38,060
You must be upset every time I do so.

731
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,600
I'm sorry.

732
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,600
But

733
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,070
I’ll continue to be sorry for you.

734
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:54,310
Because I know the feeling of liking someone
who doesn’t like you back

735
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,550
very well.

736
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,690
Because I know how painful you feel.

737
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:07,690
Thinking of these, I feel upset too.

738
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:15,000
I love another woman. What can I do for you?

739
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:21,340
All I can do for you is refusing you.

740
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,610
So, I’m sorry.

741
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,680
Contact me when you’re ready.

742
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:38,020
Because I don’t wanna lose a good friend.

743
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,430
Hee-kyung.

744
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,180
Do Min-joon, the man who lived next door
to Song-yi.

745
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,850
Don’t you think you’ve seen him before?

746
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,890
Why do you say this suddenly?

747
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,010
What... is it?

748
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,470
I told you

749
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:32,580
I know the man

750
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,150
who saved Song-yi

751
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,720
in that accident 12 years ago.

752
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:41,120
This is the photo I took at the time.

753
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,660
What do you think?

754
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,760
I think it’s the same person.

755
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,600
How is it possible?

756
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,530
It's been 12 years.

757
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,800
Your look changed. So did mine.

758
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,040
I don’t know the reason.

759
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,440
The point is that

760
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:07,410
the man who looks exactly like the one
12 years ago

761
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,480
is with Song-yi again,

762
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,860
while Song-yi doesn’t know he is that man.

763
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:30,700
Do you remember what that man looked like?

764
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,440
I did see him.

765
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:34,710
I did see him, but I can’t recall it.

766
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,140
Saying he’s my first love is too much.

767
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,110
I mean I want to see him again if I can.

768
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:44,780
Thank him for saving my life.

769
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,190
But why did he save me?

770
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:51,320
I just want to ask him.

771
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,790
That's all.

772
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,200
I asked you to leave and you left?

773
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:12,440
So hungry.

774
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,420
Chicken and beer. Take away.

775
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,160
Why are you here?

776
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,800
Why are you at Do Min-joon’s home?

777
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,740
Where is Do Min-joon?

778
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,610
What's wrong with you?

779
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:42,710
Go out!

780
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,040
I said go out!

781
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,240
Let me go first!

782
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,980
I had nowhere to go, so I came here.

783
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:52,220
The day I was discharged, someone
turned my house upside down.

784
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:55,820
I was scared, but I had nowhere to go.

785
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,260
Didn’t you?

786
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,690
You could go to your mom’s place or a hotel.

787
00:52:58,690 --> 00:52:59,760
I’d rather not go to my mom’s place.

788
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,090
I’m an actress. How can I go to a hotel?

789
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:03,600
Don’t you know my situation?

790
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,230
Anyway, you shouldn’t be here.

791
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,630
Go to my place if you have nowhere to go.

792
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:07,830
What nonsense is that?

793
00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:09,740
Or I’ll buy you a house

794
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,170
to live in.

795
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,600
Not here, anyway.

796
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,210
You can go anywhere else but not here.

797
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:17,780
Hee-kyung. Calm down.

798
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,380
My villa is in Changpyeong.

799
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,220
There is a house maid who can cook,

800
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,150
as well as many guards.

801
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:29,090
You can live there for now.

802
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,390
Go and live there, Song-yi.

803
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,130
Please.

804
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:35,890
You have a hard time lately, right?

805
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:39,100
Go and have a rest.

806
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,770
Listen to me.

807
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:47,570
Wait in the car.

808
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,740
I’m gonna pack up.

809
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,510
Thanks.

810
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,650
Alright.

811
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:04,120
Taste the emptiness that all my things are gone
when you are out.

812
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,900
What’s the matter?

813
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,520
I’m Cheon Song-yi.

814
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,750
Anyway, thanks for taking care of me these days.

815
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,220
I’m going to Hee-kyung’s villa in Changpyeong.

816
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,730
I shouldn’t write where I’m going.

817
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:16,260
It’s like I want him to find me there.

818
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,330
That’s embarrassing.

819
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:18,730
No, I won’t write.

820
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,190
What’s the matter exactly?

821
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,470
Do Min-joon.

822
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,580
Who... are you?

823
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,920
What?

824
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:26,230
Are you the man who saved Song-yi
12 years ago?

825
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,360
I didn’t use my ability much

826
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,530
to save people.

827
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,560
Because the exposure of my ability

828
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,500
means the exposure of my identity.

829
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,430
Those who can still accept me normally

830
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:04,140
after knowing my identity,

831
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,470
rather than take advantage of me,

832
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,510
are not many.

833
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,880
I don’t know

834
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,980
the limit of my ability either.

835
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,250
As for teleportation,

836
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:16,010
if I know the exact location,

837
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,980
it can be done within 300 km or so.

838
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,890
The time freeze

839

My physical condition matters the most.

When I first met Lawyer Jang,

842
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,960
I nearly got him killed

843
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,370
due to my bad condition.

Please help me.

00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,930
Without the money, my mother can’t
have the operation.

851
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,300
She suffered so much for my study

852
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:08,400
and my judicial examination.

853
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,770
Please help me

854

I can’t live without my mother.

Wait!

861
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:28,050
Who are you?

862
00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:32,850
Are you a ghost?
