00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,160
It’s seems you don’t have a friend.

173
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,400
Do you have a family?

174
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,630
Is it lonely

175
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,720
by living like an island?

176
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,240
A dozen reporters are waiting at the door.

177
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,930
More than half of people

178
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,340
living downstairs know you.

179
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,250
A lot of people

180
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,430
like the manager, assistants and fans are around you.

181
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,940
But now you are here alone.

182
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,310
I’m not alone because you are with me.

183
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,010
If they take a picture, it’ll be exciting news.

184
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,740
The idiots.

185
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,250
Everyone, I’m Cheon Song-yi. Now I’m like this.

186
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,500
One meter distance.

187
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,360
So mean.

188
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,220
Thank you for your treat.

189
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,430
It doesn’t matter.

190
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,300
Please enjoy.

191
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
Thank you.

192
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,800
Nothing found from the investigation, right?

193
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,090
Maybe it’s not suicide,

194
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,480
but people take it as suicide.

195
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,980
Many actresses can’t get well with their peers.

196
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,030
Nobody will kill herself because of that.

197
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,640
Moreover, Han Yoo-ra got Lo Soo-yeong’s bouquet.

198
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,720
The one commits suicide wouldn’t do that.

199
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,730
How did you know it?

200
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,090
Did you see that?

201
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,450
I heard it from those who went to the wedding.

202
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,410
That’s not the point.

203
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,830
The point is that Cheon Song-yi
has nothing to do with the case.

204
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,680
So what?

205
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,860
People hope it’s related to her.

206
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,530
You are a new one.

207
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,360
People don’t care about the truth.

208
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,470
They just want a punching bag.

209
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,250
Someone should be responsible for the case.

210
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,120
What about Cheon Song-yi?

211
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,730
What if she is innocent?

212
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,810
Who will be responsible for her?

213
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,720
Which media are you from?

214
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,390
It seems I met you before.

215
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,600
Maybe

216
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,260
you are not clear about it.

217
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,630
Wow, the chicken is delicious.

218
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,260
Lee Hee-kyung is eating chicken there.

219
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,920
Let’s buy

220
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,670
some chicken and beer, okay?

221
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,850
I’ll have it when I feel blue.

222
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,240
Go to sleep. Don’t bother me.

223
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,520
But…

224
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,640
What’s that?

225
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,160
What do you mean by last three months?

226
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,800
Sorry to read your diary,

227
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,340
but where are you going?

228
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,420
Or is it because you are sick?

229
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,240
No question.

230
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,950
My goodness.

231
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,850
Maybe I can’t fall asleep on sofa.

232
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,400
I have insomnia.

233
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,320
Artists are always sensitive.

234
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,110
So many artists have insomnia.

235
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,810
Moreover, I’m not used to new beds.

236
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,200
Give me some books.

237
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:03,470
There was a ceramic rabbit.

238
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,390
He fell in love with a girl

239
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,089
and saw her dying in front of him.

240
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,250
The rabbit swore he would never love someone.

241
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,000
I

242
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,390
love you.

243
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,080
So I want to grow up quickly

244
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,750
and then you can see the beautiful grown me.

245
00:18:52,290 --> 00:19:01,420
[But answer me,
how can the story have a happy ending without love?]

246
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,430
I’ve found everywhere

247
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,480
yesterday,

248
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,460
but I really didn’t find a note or letter.

249
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,450
[Envy]

250
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,690
What’s wrong?

251
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,740
[Detective Park]

252
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,330
Hello.

253
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,630
Han Yu-seon. Han Yu-seon.

254
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,940
What do you get?

255
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,440
What is it?

256
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,980
Jae-kyung.

257
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,610
You are early.

258
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,280
You spent the night outside.

259
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,910
Shh.

260
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,410
I went to Cheon Song-yi’s. So many reporters.

261
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,690
She can’t get out. But I can’t do anything.

262
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,150
I’ve told you.

263
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,150
The event is under investigation. Wait and see.

264
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,630
It’ll be troublesome if people recognize you.

265
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,970
Why did you go?

266
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,330
If it’s not suicide,

267
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,590
did Han Yoo-ra die because of Song-yi?

268
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,100
What will happen to Song-yi?

269
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,760
It’s none of your business.

270
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,700
I’m leaving now.

271
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,030
Okay.

272
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,890
I’m leaving too.

273
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,680
Stop.

274
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,430
The girl has nothing to do with you.

275
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,000
You can’t do anything.

276
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,930
Darling.

277
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,680
What did he do when I went to the police station

278
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,380
on a wheelchair three years ago?

279
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,370
He followed her since the girl

280
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,200
went to Milan for the posters.

281
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,870
I should have split up with him at that time.

282
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,260
What’s your meaning of being alive? Why?

283
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,220
For love, dad.

284
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,640
I seldom begged you.

285
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,340
But can you help her?

286
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,330
Do what?

287
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,810
Rich people can solve any problems

288
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,440
no matter with money, or power, or strength.

289
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,770
Please help her.

290
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:51,060
When I feel her hardships,

291
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,830
I’m really painful.

292
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:01,660
I think that’s heartbroken people mentioned.

293
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,710
Consider it as helping me.

294

295
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,950
Yes.

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,250
Take my new golf club.

297

We don’t have such a son.

Darling, please calm down.

299
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,970
Get back and clean yourself up.

300
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,490
I can’t just let it be.

301
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:25,230
She must be very sad now.

302
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,570
You are smelly.

303
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,270
Good morning.

304
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,680
I see. You can’t feel good

305
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,420
since you were too exciting to sleep well.

306
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,540
sorry.

307
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,680
What are you doing? It’s horrible.

308
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,560
Help the legs to be thinner

309
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,930
because I ate instant noodles last night.

310
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,720
One more person slept here,

311
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,810
but the room changed a lot.

312
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:05,660
Really?

313
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,990
It becomes much brighter

314
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,630
because I’m here, right?

315
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,350
I hate the room in a mess.

316
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,350
Get up and tidy it up.

317
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,930
By the way, 1111.

318
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,120
What?

319
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,510
The password of my house is 1111.

320
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:25,260
I changed it into the simplest one.

321
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,370
It’s useful by doing this.

322
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,960
Blood circulation helps me become smarter.

323
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,680
Are you crazy?

324
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,370
Oh. Ah.

325
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,080
Dad.

326
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,410
Ah!

327
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:17,580
Excuse me. I should ring the doorbell first.

328
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,380
I saw the shoes of a woman,

329
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,730
but I didn’t expect it’s Cheon Song-yi.
I was shocked.

330
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,360
Mr. Jang. Are you scared?

331
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,800
I’m Cheon Song-yi from next door.

332
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,040
He’s an enthusiastic person.

333
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,370
I had some trouble yesterday.

334
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,810
He helped without hesitation

335
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,950
and let me live here temporarily.

336
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,510
Please don’t think too much.

337
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,680
Oh. I see.

338
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,560
What’s that?

339
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,250
These are

340
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,190
dishes cooked by my wife

341
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,210
for him.

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,920
What are they?

343
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,760
I don’t have a meal with my dad.

344
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,210
He already came here.

345
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,950
You can be impolite but not unfilial.

346
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,720
Am I right, Mr. Jang?

347
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,730
Yes, I think so.

348
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,380
Just have a meal together.

349
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:38,110
I haven’t had a meal at home for a long time.

350
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,760
Thank you. Dad.

351
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,220
Mrs. Jang is very skillful.

352
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,450
The dishes are delicious.

353
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,880
Shut your mouth and eat.

354
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,240
How could I eat with my mouth shut?

355
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,910
Am I right, Mr. Jang?

356
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,700
Yes, I think it’s difficult too.

357
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,630
You really don’t regard yourself as an outsider.

358
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,980
You’re too young to understand.

359
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,440
You are my neighbor.

360
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,890
A neighbor is like a friend

361
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,220
We are not outsiders.

362
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,790
You really didn’t live long.

363
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,850
Longer than you.

364
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,910
You’d better show me your ID.

365
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,240
The fish can’t be turn over during eating.

366
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,340
What?

367
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,740
People said turning over the fish during eating

368
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,080
will cause ship on the sea turn over.

369
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,340
Who said such ridiculous words?

370
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,150
My dad.

371
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,430
So, put it there and enjoy it.

372
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,820
You’ve watched that all night, anything?

373
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,340
I’ve contacted the CCTV company.

374
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,090
They said the record can’t be edited.

375
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,930
But if someone take away the record on purpose,

376
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,720
they can create a fake record.

377
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,870
But this is the original copy.

378
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,990
It seems there is no sufficient proof.

379
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:34,190
No matter how, the case is almost settled.

380
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:34,910
What?

381
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,150
Reading documents for all day will never help.

382
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,710
We have to get out for clues.

383
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,680
Han Yu-seon contacted me in the morning.

384
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,250
I just came back from her.

385
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,680
She gave me this.

386
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,990
Suicide note.

387
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,370
It’s suicide. You don’t need to insist.

388
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,460
I was scolded by her family because of this.

389
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,360
This is the autopsy.

390
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,330
Amitriptyline and chlorpheniramine

391
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,890
[Forensic Report]

392
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,030
are found in blood test.

393
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,350
All are sedative, analgesic and antidepressant.

394
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,140
She took the medicines in the long term.

395
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,770
Medicine was not related to her death.

396
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,010
The direct cause of death is drowning.

397
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,890
Since we have found the suicide note,

398
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,510
the case can be settled now.

399
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,260
Please the related office

400
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,040
to identify the handwriting.

401
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,410
Keep all this in secret before getting the result.

402
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,510
Will the family accept it?

403
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:46,500
Yu-seon cried when seeing
her sister’s handwriting.

404
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,340
That’s solid evidence.

405
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,830
We didn’t find the suicide note yesterday.

406
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,720
But it appears all in a sudden today.
It’s suspicious.

407
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,260
So you think she was murdered?

408
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,730
Generally, if one was murdered,

409
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,810
there must another one

410
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:09,600
who can gain benefit from the death.

411
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,370
But in this case,

412
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:19,230
we can’t find the people who can
gain benefit from Han Yoo-ra’s death.

413
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,320
Over!

414
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,250
Good.

415
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,560
It’s well prepared.

416
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,610
You’ve provided sufficient data

417
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,670
[When will Ms. Cheon speak for Han Yoo-ra case?]

418
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:29,100
on the information and plan in 2014

419

of the five countries in Western Europe.

420
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,300
Who did it?

421
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,880
It’s me.

422
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,450
Damn it!

423
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,700
I finished it with Lee Hee-kyung’s help.

424
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:53,440
Lee Hee-kyung has worked here only for 15 days.

425
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,890
We’ve gained a lot in this short period.

426
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,620
Oh.

427
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,360
Lee Hee-kyung.

428
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,400
You don’t look good. Anything’s bothering you?

429
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,590
I’m fine.

430
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,030
By the way, why can’t I see Mr. Yoo recently?

431
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,330
I sent him to Gyeong-num

432
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,160
He even did that kind of thing.

433
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,540
What? Why?

434
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,050
It doesn’t matter.

435
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:30,570
He was indiscreet. I wanted to punish him early.

436
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,430
Anyway,

437
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:34,000
let me know

438
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,590
if anything or anybody is wrong.

439
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,890
Fighting.

440
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,240
Fighting.

441
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,760
Mr. Yoo looks like a good person.

442
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,240
What a pity!

443
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,140
Generally,

444
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,960
if the families didn’t agree on an autopsy,
and there’s sufficient evidence,

445
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,090
the case can be confirmed as suicide.

446
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,740
The detective is a new one.

447
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,700
He has been trying to investigate.

448
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,750
But he still hasn’t found useful evidence.

449
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,310
What’s his name?

450
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,620
Our detective Yoo Seo looks thinner.

451
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:17,500
Did you investigate over night?

452
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,140
I’m fine.

453
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,710
You should have been a presenter.

454
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,790
Your face fits the job.

455
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,730
Why do you have to be a detective like your father?

456
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,240
I have to go out, mom.

457
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,250
Tell me, what is your first case?

458
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,730
Actress Han Yoo-ra Case.

459
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,080
What?

460
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,710
Really?

461
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,970
Hey.

462
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,080
Why didn’t you tell me early?

463
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,380
Mom, why are you shouting?

464
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,650
Your brother.

465
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,490
He is in charge of Han Yoo-ra suicide case.

466
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,820
It’s not proved to be suicide.

467
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,930
Why? It’s reported on TV.

468
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:07,320
People are scolding Cheon Song-yi.

469
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,550
What is the probable result?

470
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,670
It’s under investigation. I can’t disclose it.

471
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,270
We are families.

472
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,270
I won’t tell anybody else.

473
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,050
Tell me.

474
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,350
No, mom.

475
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,470
It’s serious. All lights were broken.

476
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,670
Did they fight?

477
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,780
Yes.

478
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,160
-Right?
-Yes.

479
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,230
Cheon Song-yi pushed Han Yoo-ra
and broke the light, right?

480
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,650
It seems right.

481
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,220
It seems?

482
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,150
Are you telling the truth or not?

483
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:49,070
We were in the dressing room and…

484
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,190
So you didn’t see it with your own eyes?

485
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,530
Then why were you so sure while on TV?

486
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,280
Can we see the CCTV?

487
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,730
What’s it?

488
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,960
Han Yoo-ra was the one throwing things.

489
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,320
The lights were broken themselves.

490
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:14,560
Hold on. This is the man on the ship, right?

491
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,710
Toothbrush, floss, hand cream,

492
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,450
false eyelashes.

493
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,620
I can’t understand why she needs these
while staying at home.

494
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,040
Phone chargers are sold here.

495
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,410
Why are you laughing?

496
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,680
You asked for tuna,

497
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,060
-is it of this brand?
-Hello. Darling.

498
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,160
Fermented soy sauce or traditional soy sauce?

499
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,130
Yes, I see. Darling!

500
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,210
What’s wrong?

501
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,330
Recently,

502
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,600
we are very close.

503
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,200
We’ve known each other for over 30 years.

504
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
It's the first time for us to have a meal together.

505
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,100
It seems you misunderstood me.

506
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,180
I don’t mean something else,

507
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,150
but to confirm

508
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:08,370
if Ui-hwa has something to do with the woman,

509
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,530
or they are just alike.

510
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,810
I’m telling the truth…

511
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,949
False eyelashes. Over there.

512
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,920
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

513
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,290
I’ll be right there.

514
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,520
Send me a message.

515
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,670
-Go together
-Follow.

516
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,420
I don’t know.

517
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,010
You are back.

518
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,190
Stop that. It looks like a crazy ghost.

519
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,250
Did you buy a phone charger?

520
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,150
OK.

521
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,400
Are the reporters still outside?

522
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,480
-Yeah.
-How many?

523
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,330
Several.

524
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,220
Are they homeless seriously?

525
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,550
So boring to stay at home.

526
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,130
Where are you going?

527
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,410
Nothing special.

528
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:42,570
I’d see if our National Goddess is alright.

529
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,390
Is she still sexy and beautiful at night

530
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,490
and pure and sweet during daytime?

531
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:47,640
Will you come together?

532
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,010
The bottle is broken.

533
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,850
Why is it broken all in a sudden?

534
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,230
Stop standing here. Clean it up.

535
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,210
The splinter may hurt me.

536
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,230
Should I do it?

537
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,440
Yes. Remember the rubber gloves.

538
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,350
You got a message.

539
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,760
I can read it later.

540
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,420
It may have lots of messages
since it’s powered off last night.

541
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,910
[Beom]

542
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,600
It’s annoying.

543
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,970
Pick up the phone.

544
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,560
You are so wordy.

545
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,310
Beom.

546
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,280
It’s out of power.

547
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
What’s wrong?

548
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,810
Seems Han Yoo-ra’s sister found the note.

549
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,380
The detective said they can’t confirm it.

550
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,830
But the reporters are in a mess.

551
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,040
If things continue, you will be ruined.

552
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,180
What should we do?

553
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,810
I’m hanging up.

554
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,180
What’s wrong?

555
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,210
I’m leaving.

556
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,530
I have to tell the reporters

557
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,020
it's not because of me.

558
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,500
I can’t hide here.

559
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,840
I didn’t do anything wrong.

560
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,440
Are you alright?

561
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,620
Of course.

562
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,500
Why?

563
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,160
It’s not me.

564
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,530
God knows.

565
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,050
Han Yoo-ra knew it too.

566
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,890
So I’m fine.

567
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,520
I don’t mean that.

568
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,740
Don’t move.

569
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:48,240
It shouldn’t have been because of me.

570
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,270
If it’s really because of me,

571
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,380
what should I do?

572
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,730
It’s not because of you.

573
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,690
Stop having a bee in your head.

574
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,720
Don’t move.

575
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,680
Stay here.

576
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:17,370
Take a rest, okay?

577
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,650
It’s not a bad place.

578
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,110
You don’t trust me?

579
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,060
I’m sorry.

580
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,730
But I have to go to the class.

581
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,590
Hey, kids.

582
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,770
Will you come in or not?

583
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,880
Wait a second.

584
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,650
I’m talking about it.

585
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,690
Because of you,

586
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,590
I can’t focus

587
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,400
on study.

588
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,070
Did I fall in love with you?

589
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,010
I’m sorry.

590
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,840
But I can’t accept it.

591
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,180
I have to do exercises,

592
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,920
the diary,

593
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,300
and the homework.

594
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:55,400
It’s not the right time for love.

595
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,610
Good luck.

596
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,530
Is life originally so hard?

597
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,010
How about meat sauce noodles?

598
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,750
Seafood noodles are better.

599
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,880
-Half meat sauce and half seafood.
-Half meat sauce and half seafood.

600
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,810
Life can be easy if you want.

601
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:27,420
But if you would live hard,

602
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,870
it’ll be extremely hard.

603
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,860
Excuse me. NS for wound cleaning.

604
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,990
Injector for wound cleaning.

605
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:35,420
Ethyl alcohol and wipes.

606
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,870
Spun cotton and cotton ball.

607
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,240
Disposable adhesive tape.

608
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,320
Or medical bandage.

609
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,740
May you speak slowly?

610
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,430
Purified water for wound cleaning.

611
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,400
It’s easy for life if you only love yourself.

612
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,240
When you begin to love others,

613
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,610
life will become hard.

614
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,670
Why so many?

615
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,450
A bandage will be enough.

616
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:05,090
Disinfect it first.

617
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,170
Disinfect?

618
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,280
Hey.

619
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,380
Give it to me.

620
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,750
It’s okay.

621
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,550
And

622
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,770
the reporters have left.

623
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,960
Thank you

624
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,380
for allowing me to live here

625
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,740
and telling me it’s not because of me.

626
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:05,050
It gets into the heart.

627
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,800
That’s it.

628
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,890
No time for preparation.

629
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,660
It unexpected, unconsciously, and inexplicably

630
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,630
enters into the heart.

631
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,410
Why do you know so much?

632
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,590
In a word,

633
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,320
I understand you.

634
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,260
First love is confusing.

635
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,250
You will always think a lot.

636
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:42,040
Sometimes, you may think you are crazy.

637
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,990
Am I crazy?

638
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,900
What am I doing?

639
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,100
We really didn’t say anything.

640
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,440
We were just playing quietly

641
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,860
and posted comments online.

642
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,640
You just posted comments quietly?

643
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,850
They beat you without telling you the reason?

644
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,980
And you were all beaten in this way?

645
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,210
Yes.

646
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,860
So I think it’s ridiculous.

647
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,250
He said something when he started to beat.

648
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,820
“Do you know Cheon Song-yi?”

649
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,280
Yes.

650
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,080
He may be a huge fan of Cheon Song-yi.

651
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,370
Name?

652
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,720
Non?

653
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,480
Are you really a huge fan of Cheon Song-yi?

654
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,410
Why are you staring at me?

655
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,680
Why did you do that?

656
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,810
Is it really because they scolded Cheon Song-yi?

657
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,610
You are still young.

658
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,310
Is an actress worthy of your fighting?

659
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,170
You like Cheon Song-yi?

660
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,240
She hasn’t been completely done this time.

661
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,010
She got hair pulled by others for a man.

662
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,140
It’s obvious she has a bad personality.

663
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,280
Generally,

664
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,980
family education is important.

665
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,370
You can’t say that.

666
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,780
Who are you?

667
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,370
They are kids.

668
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,290
But you are adults.

669
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:47,500
How can you talk in that way?

670
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,190
She got hair pulled by others for a man.

671
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,350
Have you seen it yourself?

672
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:53,720
Do you have evidence?

673
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,340
Strictly speaking, you are spreading rumors.

674
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,580
Who are you?

675
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,790
A huge fan of Cheon Song-yi.

676
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,530
Yun-jae, did you have dinner?

677
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,710
Are you crazy?

678
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,120
Don’t be like that, brother-in-law.

679
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,030
Your mom called me.

680
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,790
She said

681
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,690
it's bad for her to be recognized.

682
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,110
So I came here on behalf of her.

683
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:32,660
Wake up.

684
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,550
She has some other plan.

685
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,330
What’s it?

686
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:40,030
Try all the way to make a match.

687
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,050
This is the happiest thing for me.

688
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:44,290
Don’t misunderstand it.

689
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:47,000
You will never have a chance
if it’s not because you’re rich.

690
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:51,040
So I feel lucky to be rich.

691
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,070
Normally, our family won’t go broke.

692
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:58,120
In the case, your mom will like me forever.

693
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,100
Your sister is hard, you know?

694
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,780
I will be responsible for you and your mom.

695
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,390
So, call me

696
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,730
no matter what happens.

697
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,990
God.

698
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:10,650
Stop being like that.

699
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:12,780
You naughty boy.

700
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,100
Yun-jae.

701
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,390
Have dinner together.

702
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,980
Enjoy.

703
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,640
I didn’t prepare it well.

704
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,190
It’s great.

705
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:25,350
Thank you, Mrs.Cheon.

706
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,900
It’s a feast?

707
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,260
Do we have something to celebrate?

708
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,110
I called Song-yi just now.

709
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:38,740
She doesn’t sound well.

710
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,690
I intended to take some porridge to her,

711
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,230
but she said she will go to sleep early.

712
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,990
She will begin to work tomorrow.

713
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,680
So fast?

714
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,140
She should take more rest.

715
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:55,120
She is a responsible person.

716
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,940
Song-yi gets

717
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,080
all good things

718
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,300
from me,

719
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,110
not just beauty and willpower.

720
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:07,400
Yun-jae.

721
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,660
Hey.

722
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,360
I know my daughter well.

723
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,880
She looks strong,

724
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,910
but she is soft in the mind.

725
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:18,860
I know.

726
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,400
I mean it’s an opportunity for you.

727
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,390
What?

728
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:23,960
Goodness.

729
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,680
You can’t be so naïve.

730
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:29,070
For a woman,

731
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:33,770
she will easily love the man

732
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,870
who protects her

733
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:37,800
when life is hard for her.

734
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,920
Do you understand?

735
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,520
So,

736
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:45,960
take the opportunity.

737
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,390
Understand?

738
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:15,680
Hae-sin will cancel the ad
to be taken this morning.

739
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,430
They just offered the final report.

740
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:20,280
I’m going crazy.

741
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,450
They tried every way to beg us to be the model.

742
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,380
We finally agreed,

743
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,510
but they refused us.

744
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,480
Why are they

745
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,170
so…

746
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:35,930
Here you are. Why don’t you take more rest?

747
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,630
I have the Hae-sin ad in the morning.

748
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,120
About it…

749
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,990
-Tell them I can’t go.
-What?

750
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,250
I used

751
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,300
the magic cream.

752
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,390
But it makes my skin tight.

753
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,330
Tight?

754
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,520
Completely tight.

755
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,540
They gave me that kind of thing

756
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,650
but said it’s good.

757
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,390
Nobody will buy the products.

758
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,920
Yes. They are impolite.

759
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,130
Tell them

760
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,670
I won’t be the model for their products.

761
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,350
No way.

762
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,250
I won’t take that ad.

763
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,150
I refuse them

764
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,610
But Song-yi.

765
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:28,370
The leading role

766
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,630
is an orphan driven out from the rent house.

767
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:35,020
Is this a bit luxury?

768
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,460
Kid, you’d better give up this prejudice.

769
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:38,880
Orphan can wear beautiful clothes too.

770
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,770
The leading role does so many work,

771
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,100
but she can’t pay for the rent,

772
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,200
all because of clothes and bags.

773
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,020
In this case, we have to work very late.

774
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,390
What are they doing?

775
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:50,860
It doesn’t work.

776
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,590
We didn’t receive any information.

777
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,740
Why didn’t you tell us in advance?

778
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,220
It’s decided just now.

779
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:56,360
It’s a leading role.

780
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,950
Why don’t you…

781
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,540
You are going too far.

782
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,660
I didn’t do anything wrong.

783
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,460
The seniors made the decisions.

784
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,570
I’m just telling their decision.

785
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,860
What will we do?

786
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,280
There is a scene about studying abroad.

787
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,950
So, deal with it as she’s going abroad?

788
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:15,960
Yes.

789
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,310
Please say something and let her accept it.

790
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:21,120
What should I say?

791
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:23,370
What should I do?

792
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,050
I really don’t know.

793
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,530
Beom, start the car.

794
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,140
What?

795
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,050
I read the play.

796
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,360
Maybe something bad happened to the writer.

797
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,100
The scripts are not acceptable.

798
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:47,300
I don’t want to continue.

799
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,810
Tell them,

800
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:51,260
Cheon Song-yi can’t accept the play.

801
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:54,590
Cheon Song-yi refused it.

802
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,130
You, make it clear.

803
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,570
Tell them I will never come here.

804
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,080
I refused them.

805
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,990
I will never work with the photographer.

806
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,270
Don’t come. Tell them one more time

807
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,530
I am not willing to take it.

808
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,270
I refused them.

809
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,460
Anything else need to refuse?

810
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,140
I’ve refused people all day long. Hungry now.

811
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,390
Do we have some plan tomorrow?

812
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,230
No.

813
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,770
It’s great.

814
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,150
Order chicken and beer for me.

815
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,870
Buy it now and it will arrive when we get back.

816
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:40,870
Okay.

817
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:47,580
Hello. No 2301, Building A, Gold Apartment.

818
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,510
Chicken and beer…

819
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,090
You can’t?

820
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,730
I see.

821
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:57,180
What?

822
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,790
Even chicken refused me?

823
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,850
Now a woman like me can’t have some chicken?

824
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,380
No, Song-yi.

825
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,400
They are too busy and no more order.

826
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,820
It’s Cheon Song-yi.

827
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:47,400
You have work tomorrow. Don’t eat that.

828
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,990
You received my message?

829
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:53,640
My brother is the detective for your case.

830
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:58,380
They don’t have any evidence now.

831
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,960
Everything will be fine after the case.

832
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,990
Thank you.

833
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,590
You are the best.

834
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,720
They are going too far.

835
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,380
How can they change the leading role
all in a sudden?

836
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,730
What do they want?

837
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,580
Se-mi, something urgent about
changing the leading role.

838
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,590
Will you come to the TV station?

839
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,790
What’s wrong? Who is that?

840
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:32,980
Mom slipped down on the ice surface.

841
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,710
Ankle fractured.

842
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,300
Go take a look.

843
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:43,000
Go.

844
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,610
I’m bored to be here.

845
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:48,500
I agreed to sleep with you.

846
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,070
Sorry.

847
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,820
Are you okay by yourself?

848
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,440
Of course. Let’s go.

849
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,130
[Jae-kyung]

850
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:10,390
Jae-kyung.

851
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:11,700
Song-yi.

852
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,490
Where are you?

853
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,440
Home now?

854
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,720
Yes.

855
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,610
Why are you calling at this time?

856
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:21,230
I heard you moved to Gold Apartment.

857
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:23,590
From Hee-kyung.

858
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,690
Yes.

859
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:28,630
I visited a friend living there.

860
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:30,880
I want to see you before leaving.

861
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,290
I will go downstairs soon.

862
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:35,890
Not necessary.

863
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:39,930
Is it room 2301?

864
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,040
How did you know it?

865
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:48,470
It’s said many reporters were out of your house.

866
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:52,460
All people living there know your address.

867
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,670
My friend knows too.

868
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:57,450
Right.

869
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,930
May I come and have a cup of coffee?

870
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:03,980
And I have to tell you something.

871
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:28,940
Mr. Do Min-joon.

872
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,500
Yes, who are you?

873
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,780
I’m from Yeongdeungpo Police Station.

874
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,790
What’s the matter?

875
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:40,550
Have some questions to ask

876
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,300
about Han Yoo-ra’s death.

877
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,520
We should have invited you to the office
as a witness.

878
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,540
But the case is urgent

879
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,490
and we don’t have too much time.

880
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,060
Let’s talk. Just a moment.

881
00:55:57,410 --> 00:55:58,800
I see.

882
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,980
Where will we go?

883
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,040
I heard you are a professor.

884
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,070
Lecturer.

885
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,690
Teaching in college is the professor.

886
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,820
I went to the college during the day

887
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,040
to confirm something.

888
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,470
It’s said you won’t continue the classes.

889
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,190
Will you leave?

890
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,940
Personal affairs.

891
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,720
You graduated from Harvard?

892
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:39,310
You are my first Harvard passenger.

893
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:01,030
What a stubborn traffic jam!

894
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,300
May I come in?

895
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:36,350
Sure.

896
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,580
Please come in.

897
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,790
I have a question.

898
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,460
Where were you on the day of the event?

899
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,620
How did you get on the ship

900
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,800
without an invitation?

901
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,000
Really a murderer?

902
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:02,870
Hey.

903
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:05,380
Do Min-joon.

904
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,890
If they take a picture, it’ll be exciting news.

905
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,460
The idiots.

906
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:28,380
Everyone, I’m Cheon Song-yi.

907
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,350
Now I’m like this.

908
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,500
One meter distance.

909
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,930
So mean.

910
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,900
Distance of one meter.

911
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,810
Get closer.

912
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,700
Whose girl is she?

913
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,540
So beautiful.

914
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:57,180
It’s beautiful.

915
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,290
What a beauty!

916
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,660
-=Next=-

917
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,940
My daughter is badly wounded, can you see?

918
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,380
What on earth are you doing?

919
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:14,200
You only need to hide when you make a mistake.

920
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,300
Do you intend to get the second career?

921
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,370
How about being my manager?

922
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,430
What do you think about Song-yi?

923
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,110
Don’t think.

924
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,990
Cheon Song-yi is my girl.

925
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,900
You thought you were ready for leaving

926
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,450
without hesitation,

927
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:29,090
but one people is left there.

928
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:31,530
The one who I thought has disappeared forever

929
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,580
appears again in front of me

930
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,490
after a long time?
