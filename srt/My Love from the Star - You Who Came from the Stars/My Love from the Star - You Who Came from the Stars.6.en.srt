1
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,020
Let me ask you a question first.

2
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,910
Where were you on the day when
Han Yoo-ra died?

3
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,950
How did you get on the cruise?

4
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,600
You didn’t even get the invitation.

5
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,370
You are really the murderer!

6
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,280
Hey!

7
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,400
Mr. Do Min-joon!

8
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,340
Hey! Do Min-joon!

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,820
Hey! Do Min-joon!

10
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,360
Hey! Do Min-joon!

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,680
Hey! Stop there! Stop!

12
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,650
Please don’t follow me.

13
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,700
The guards are chasing me.

14
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,360
Please go back to where you’re from.

15
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,920
I…

16
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,759
I said I would protect you.

17
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,630
I…

18
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,450
I don’t want to see you get hurt.

19
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,759
So… Let’s go together.

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,850
Hey! Stop there!

21
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,890
[My Love from the Star Record 6]

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,040
Those journalists came in a crowd.

23
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,760
How can we stop them?

24
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,810
Who are you?

25
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,240
Well, I…

26
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,330
I live here. Room 2302.

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,830
Looks like you have just been on this job.

28
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,210
The former staffs know me.

29
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,000
Well, thank you.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,430
Have you ever seen him before?

31
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,820
No.

32
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,510
He seemed to fall from the sky.

33
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,050
Wait!

34
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,980
Stop!

35
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,380
What tea do you like? I got some good tea.

36
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,790
It came a long way here from Costa Rica…

37
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,960
But there isn’t any left.

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,130
Do you like instant coffee?

39
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,170
It’s also great to have a cup of instant coffee
in such a rainy day.

40
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,610
What are you doing here?

41
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:21,010
I'd like to see
what the actress's evening dresses looks like.

42
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,200
Sorry for my rudeness.

43
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,280
Let’s enjoy the coffee.

44
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,260
Are you… alright?

45
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:36,990
What?

46
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:42,220
There are many rumors about Han Yoo-ra.

47
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,350
Jae-kyung… Are you OK with that?

48
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,500
What?

49
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,090
Why do you ask this?

50
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,260
Actually, I know your relationship with Yoo-ra.

51
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,580
You are going to announce your wedding, right?

52
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,230
How do you know that?

53
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,570
I heard that.

54
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,090
What?

55
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,560
I heard the talk between you two.

56
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,900
What did you hear? How much of it?

57
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,550
You had a quarrel in the restroom, right?

58
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,570
Because of the announcement of your wedding.

59
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,250
I can tell that you’ve been together for long.

60
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,990
Have you told this to anyone else?

61
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,909
No. Who can I tell this to?

62
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:49,380
I’m just thinking that…

63
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,360
You have that relationship with Yoo-ra.

64
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,070
But she turned to be like that now.

65
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,630
I’m afraid you will feel sad about the quarrel.

66
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,980
I want to comfort you.

67
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,750
Looks like you have heard all of it that day.

68
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,420
It gets more troublesome.

69
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,840
What?

70
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,870
You said you have insomnia, right?

71
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,020
How do you feel recently?

72
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,550
It will be more serious when I get sensitive.

73
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,690
I will have some sleeping pills then.

74
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,650
Take care of yourself.

75
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,820
I came when I think of Yoo-ra to be like that.

76
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,050
Thank you, Jae-kyung.

77
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,510
What? Why are you here?

78
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,300
I haven't been able to get in touch with you…

79
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,700
Who is here?

80
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,870
Who is he?

81
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,190
What?

82
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,040
Is he the brat next door?

83
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,710
I’m asking you!

84
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,930
Your brother! Idiot.

85
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,440
What?

86
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,600
Jae-kyung?

87
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,800
Why are you here?

88
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,300
I was visiting someone, and dropped by.

89
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,190
Even if so, you are still a man.

90
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,430
I can’t accept that you two stay together alone.

91
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,270
Hey!

92
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,390
I have seen my friend and checked her safety.

93
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,900
I’m leaving now.

94
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,020
OK, Jae-kyung.

95
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,290
Remember to take him with you.

96
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,480
I just came here!

97
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,290
Jae-kyung, you can go back first

98
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,340
and tell mom that I won’t go home…

99
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,050
I’m sorry. It’s our job.

100
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:46,040
You know, Cheon Song-yi asked for
more control of outsiders.

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,030
The protests of the residents were like a river…

102
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,870
Can I leave now?

103
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes. Of course.

104
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,480
What happened?

105
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,980
Why did all the lights on the stairs light up?

106
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,170
Did anything go by there?

107
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,780
Nothing can be that fast.

108
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,490
Unless it’s a ghost.

109
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,300
Maybe they are out of order.

110
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,570
It’s scary.

111
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,299
I need to thank you for that day in hospital.

112
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,430
Thanks to you, I almost got beaten.

113
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,580
Where is Cheon Song-yi?

114
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,820
What?

115
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,810
Where is Cheon Song-yi?

116
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,230
Is she your friend?

117
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,020
Your lover?

118
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,050
You rang the doorbell just now?

119
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,360
Song-yi!

120
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,910
Song-yi! Open the door!

121
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,000
Why did so many men come to me today?

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,680
Are you all right?

123
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,310
What are you talking about?

124
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,600
Hey! You boy next door!

125
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,120
Open the door!

126
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,470
Why is he outside?

127
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,210
What’s wrong?

128
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,930
Has anyone come to your house besides him?

129
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,910
What? Jae-kyung?

130
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,880
Who is that?

131
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,690
The brother of the one who is knocking the door.

132
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,140
Different from him, Jae-kyung is excellent.

133
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,410
And he is the heir to S&C Group.

134
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,760
Why do you ask this?

135
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,310
Cheon Song-yi!

136
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,200
Open the door! Cheon Song-yi!

137
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,390
Hey! Brat! Open the door!

138
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,950
Let me open the door first.

139
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,990
Which woman

140
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,250
will open the door to anyone?

141
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,450
What?

142
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,290
You don’t even know who they really are.

143
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,750
How could a woman be so careless?

144
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,380
You are right.

145
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,830
I don’t even know what kind of man you are.

146
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,030
How careless I am!

147
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,230
I don’t mean me. All the other men except me.

148
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,420
Why are you an exception?

149
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,540
Get out! Now!

150
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,940
Wait! I don’t like being touched by others.

151
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,630
Save it.

152
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,450
Song-yi, are you OK?

153
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,800
Did he do anything bad to you?

154
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,630
I’m not a man who will do that.

155
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,370
I told you last time.

156
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,660
You are just a jerk like how you look to be.

157
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,270
I have really seen everything in my long life.

158
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,880
It’s my first time to be described like this.

159
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,920
No way. There must be many people who said that.

160
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,950
Guys. I’m really tired today.

161
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,810
Do me a favor. Go home.

162
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,520
OK.

163
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,790
You can leave now.

164
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,120
So do you!

165
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,490
Hey. We haven't seen each other for days.

166
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,730
Just a cup of coffee…

167
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,870
Hey, you.

168
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,760
A word.

169
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,690
I got something to ask you.

170
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,010
Do you own that apartment?

171
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,060
Or a rental? Monthly?

172
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,220
Why are you asking this?

173
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,970
If it’s your house, I want to buy it.

174
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,440
Double price. How is it?

175
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,640
I’ll leave if that’s all you want to say.

176
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,420
I don’t know how you feel about Song-yi.

177
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,080
But I hope you can give up.

178
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,750
Why?

179
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,820
Because, she is my woman.

180
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,370
Your woman…

181
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,160
Does she admit that?

182
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,140
Well… She…

183
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,210
Haven’t… yet.

184
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,450
But she will, soon.

185
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,840
I didn’t want to say this at the beginning.

186
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,490
My relationship with her is special.

187
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,490
I have been loving her since middle school.

188
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,920
We went to tutoring class together.
I bought her flowers for graduation.

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,150
Her first to drink was also with me.

190
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,080
I did all these before.

191
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,100
And I will do more things with her in future.

192
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,140
I’ll take care of her in this life

193
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,970
until we die.

194
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,820
Jealousy is the lowest, clumsy and childish

195
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,370
emotion among human feelings.

196
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,850
Because this is from the fear that
the other’s love will turn to another people.

197
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,590
This kind of emotion, like anger,

198
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:32,000
starts in early childhood.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,080
When you see your mother
holding other children happily,

200
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,930
you will have a bad temper,
spit out the finished food,

201
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,050
or suck your fingers. That's an example.

202
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,720
We usually call it degradation.

203
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,910
Even when grown up,

204
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,220
when people with weak self-esteem
fall in love with others,

205
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,660
they will experience this degradation process,

206
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,270
and they will express their feelings of jealousy

207
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,840
by making clumsy behaviors and words

208
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,420
in fear of lover being taken away by others.

209
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,630
Professor, won’t you feel jealous
when you fall in love with someone?

210
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,360
Did you hear me?

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,560
So, don’t hang around

212
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,280
Song-yi again in the future.

213
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,850
I came to see her for some reason.

214
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,800
What is it?

215
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,590
She left a purple hair band in my home.

216
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,310
I came here to tell her to take it back.

217
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,730
What?

218
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:28,050
Why did she leave that thing in your home?

219
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,820
Did she get drunk and go to a wrong place again?

220
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:34,590
No, not like that. Don’t get it wrong.

221
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,010
She stayed in my place for one night in sober.

222
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,630
Alas, I need to give it back to her now.

223
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,270
You look very cool.

224
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,160
So I think you will never feel jealous.

225
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,830
Just like what I said,

226
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,450
jealousy is the lowest and childish emotion.

227
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,220
Only people with weak self-esteem will have that.

228
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:59,220
So I have never felt jealous.

229
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,480
The final exam will be next week.

230
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,900
I hope everyone will present.

231
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,250
Go away! Cheon Song-yi!

232
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,220
You killed Yoo-ra! How cruel you are!

233
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,970
What place do you think this is?

234
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,650
Song-yi, we can do nothing now.

235
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:32,000
Many journalists and Yoo-ra’s fans are out there.

236
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,280
And the families of Yoo-ra won’t let us in.

237
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,190
We’d better go back now.

238
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,120
I want to return the things of Yoo-ra.

239
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,000
What’s wrong? Anything happened?

240
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,390
My daughter is hurt so much, can’t you see that?

241
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,550
How did you deal with that as the agency?

242
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,440
Say something!

243
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,480
Madam, we also lost a lot for the matter.

244
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,590
Weren’t the things you lost earned by Song-yi?

245
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,820
What did you do when she earned you money?

246
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,500
You said you wanted to work with her forever,

247
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,590
and we are family.

248
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,760
Now you got loss, so you want to get rid of us?

249
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,130
Madam, madam,

250
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,100
please calm down.

251
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,510
The contract will expire at the end of this month.

252
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,770
Gosh. So what?

253
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,080
Oh, Song-yi is here.

254
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,100
Let’s continue in front of her.

255
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,450
The contract is going to expire, and then?

256
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,130
So, we won’t renew the contract for now.

257
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,670
That’s OK.

258
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,740
-What?
-Hey!

259
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,150
For old times' sake, I wanted to renew.

260
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:04,840
But the way you handled the accident
was so terrible.

261
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,740
That’s not good enough to be my agency.

262
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,970
So, I have to consider that.

263
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,730
Really?

264
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,480
I will be responsible for the damages.

265
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,510
Are you… really going to do this?

266
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,850
Cheon Song-yi! What’s on your mind?

267
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,380
Why are you responsible for this?

268
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,460
Just deal with it according to the contract!

269
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,960
I will have a long rest. Don’t disturb me.

270
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,560
OK. Got it. Have a good rest.

271
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,800
Don’t come with me.

272
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,930
You are not my manager now.

273
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,760
It’s great, isn’t it?

274
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,100
Yes.

275
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,700
She left here herself!

276
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,010
Hey you! Are you insane?

277
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,140
Do you know how much the damages are?

278
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,780
Where will you get the money?

279
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,210
They got the loss because of me.

280
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,560
How could I put all the blame on President An?

281
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,700
You make me feel strange.

282
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,710
When did you become so kind?

283
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,240
Can’t you be that kind to me?

284
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,280
Now all the TV shows and commercials
are breaking off with you.

285
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,020
Where can you get so much money?

286
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,910
Se-mi, it’s been a while.

287
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,859
What brings you here?

288
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:30,040
We’re here to see President An.

289
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,890
The TV play changed suddenly.

290
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,230
So we got a lot of to prepare.

291
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,740
Changed?

292
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,560
Don’t you know that?

293
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,350
The play has finished halfway.

294
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,860
It’s hard to reselect the leading role.

295
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,390
So the story was changed to that
after Song-yi goes abroad to study,

296
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,760
Se-mi develops the relationship with the hero.

297
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,820
What?

298
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:55,190
Mom, don’t say that.

299
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,160
Song-yi, don’t get me wrong.

300
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,330
Director suggested like that. But I refused.

301
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,840
What? Really?

302
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,400
Yes, mom.

303
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,100
Sorry that I didn’t tell you.

304
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,050
I wanted to tell you before President An.

305
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,840
What’s wrong with you?

306
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,750
It’s such a rare chance for you!

307
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,890
How can I do that?

308
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,450
I can’t do that though it’s a rare chance.

309
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,040
Song-yi was wronged.

310
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,870
As her best friend, I can’t take her place.

311
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,340
Only if I can wait, there will be another chance.

312
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,770
I can do nothing if there is no chance for me.

313
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,770
You are more reasonable than your mom.

314
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,440
So, Song-yi, don’t worry.

315
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,220
I’m here just to say this.

316
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,470
You can do that.

317
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,510
What?

318
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,130
My place will be taken away anyway.

319
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,540
I quit not because of you, but the situation now.

320
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,390
So, just do what you like.

321
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,800
That’s right.

322
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,590
You are more reasonable than your mom.

323
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,330
Even if you say that…

324
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,000
It’s OK. Just do it.

325
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,010
Song-yi…

326
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,730
President An is waiting. Go now.

327
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,800
Your mom broke her ankle.
Is it OK for her to wear high heels?

328
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,390
What’s wrong? Whose message is that?

329
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,960
It’s… my mom. She fell down on the ice.

330
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,060
Her ankle was broken.

331
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,550
What ankle?

332
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,170
Broken?

333
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,360
Is that real?

334
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,510
Did you really say that to the director?

335
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,610
Let’s go to see the director to explain.

336
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,290
Don’t bother.

337
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,180
I have promised him that I will do it.

338
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,830
What?

339
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,140
Then why did you…

340
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,590
Yes, I lied just now.

341
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:20,440
I feel guilty for Song-yi.

342
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,680
I hope she can allow me to do that. So I lied.

343
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,310
But, mom.

344
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,440
You saw her face just now.

345
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,870
It’s not a good expression.

346
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:41,590
I have always been kind to her.

347
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:48,720
Because she never treated you as a friend,
but her foil.

348
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,030
So you have to try your best this time

349
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:56,380
and let her know how it feels that
her foil becomes more popular.

350
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,470
Do Min-joon!

351
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,360
Do Min-joon! Aren’t you home?

352
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,190
Why are you always away when I need you?

353
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,270
Where did you go?

354
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
He just disappeared.

355
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,880
My innocent car was impounded.

356
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,010
I even was fined for running a red light.

357
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:57,050
I've never driven illegally in my life.

358
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,270
The reference person can’t be brought back.

359
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,250
Let's call him here in formal order.

360
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,340
But, it’s really weird.

361
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,860
He was right in front of me,
but he disappeared like a wisp of smoke.

362
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,740
Maybe he ran into one of the buildings.

363
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,260
But the time is really limited.

364
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,380
Is it that…

365
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:26,070
Think about it. He also disappeared in the CCTV.

366
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,560
Does he…

367
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,130
Have superpower?

368
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,880
Mr. Park…

369
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,970
Fine.

370
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,860
I must be confused by the rain yesterday.

371
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,160
Who on earth is that guy?

372
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,490
I have done some research about him.

373
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,990
He is really not a normal person.

374
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,170
Really?

375
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,530
He has a surprising fortune.

376
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,020
He can be called a zillionaire.

377
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,180
Got it!

378
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,670
I first sort out his real estates.

379
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,080
It surprised me a lot when I did that.

380
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,770
How did you invest it?

381
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,120
I have been living for more than 400 years.

382
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,680
Of course, I have saved so much.

383
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,370
Was your family an official before?

384
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,570
Why do you have so many houses in Kangnam?

385
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:38,390
I stated to invest real estates in 1753.

386
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,400
A man called Yun Seong-dong
was a famous agent in Hanyang.

387
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,710
That way.

388
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:51,070
Over there.

389
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,250
Although it looks desolate here, planting

390
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,940
mulberry trees here will produce big harvests.

391
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,890
I wanted to plant mulberry trees.

392
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,030
So I bought the land in two hundred bags of rice.

393
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,220
I didn’t expect there to have a lotte world.

394
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,060
There. And there.

395
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,150
People who worked for the government

396
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,850
said something wrong to the King and got fired.

397
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,470
So he reluctantly decided to sell the land.

398
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,020
Really, really, really urgent sale!

399
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,890
I wanted to build a pavilion in a scenic spot.
So I bought that pear garden,

400
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:33,060
where the Apgujeong Apartment is now.

401
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,740
At that time, Kangnam did not belong to Hanyang,

402
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,340
so the land price was naturally very cheap,
which couldn’t be compared to the Kangbuk.

403
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,390
So was Samsung-dong.

404
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:50,540
At that time, it was divided into fengen village,
wu tong village and grkshe village.

405
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,200
But there were not more than
two hundred people living there.

406
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,050
It was absolutely a desolate place.

407
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,960
A wasteland of wastelands.

408
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,280
Anyone who lived there at the time would think
it a miracle when sees the Samsung-dong now.

409
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,720
It's completely groundbreaking.

410
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,620
What did my ancestors do?

411
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,390
Why didn’t they buy some lands as well?

412
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,770
Let’s deal with these properties step by step.

413
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,970
The antiques and artwork

414
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,970
will be taken out when I get back.

415
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,380
So many expensive items will arouse suspicion.

416
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,940
OK. I got it.

417
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,120
But, now we start to sort them out.

418
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,960
It makes me really feel that you are leaving here.

419
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,180
To me, I have been waiting for over 400 years.

420
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,610
I thought I was well prepared to leave.

421
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,790
I could leave without anything to miss.

422
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,710
What about now?

423
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,560
I’m running out of time.

424
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,880
But there is still a person,

425
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,480
and the unsettled confusions and feelings.

426
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,890
The strange situation, similar to 400 years ago,

427
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,480
frightens me.

428
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,990
I used to believe that death could be an end.

429
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,570
It doesn’t seem like that now.

430
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,460
Buy a cell phone if you can.

431
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,780
I can’t reach you in an emergency.

432
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,270
Did the person I thought had disappeared forever

433
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:46,630
reappears in front of me after a long time?

434
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,270
Here you are.

435
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,450
I've never seen any volunteers
on time every week like you.

436
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:03,330
Volunteering here is the happiest thing I can do.

437
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,720
Why don’t I come to do that?

438
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,320
A rich boy volunteers at a pet rescue center.

439
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,600
If the reporters know this, it's gonna be
a big news, but you won't let me tell.

440
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,810
What’s wrong with that little guy?

441
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,070
He was dumped on the highway.

442
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,290
Distemper.

443
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,480
Hard plantar disease. And red rash is obvious.

444
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,530
What about the diagnostic test?

445
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,000
Positive reaction.

446
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,270
The same goes for blood tests.
Both lymphocytes and neutrophils are high.

447
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,750
X-ray examination revealed pulmonary sclerosis
caused by bronchopneumonia.

448
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,780
The central nervous system can’t be saved either.

449
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,610
We can only do euthanasia now?

450
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,650
Yes.

451
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,240
It should be done tonight.

452
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,770
With magnesium sulfate?

453
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,290
Anesthesia first.

454
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,770
By the way, these days they use propofol.

455
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,330
Many celebrities got into troubles because of it.

456
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,490
Yes.

457
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,280
Let me.

458
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,090
Do you want some papaya tea?

459
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,000
Later,

460
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,500
your pain

461
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,630
will be over.

462
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,100
Goodness!

463
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,900
It’s not my birthday today. Why bother?

464
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,030
It was also the hardest day you ever had.

465
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,600
That’s right.

466
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,790
She already had a bad temper when in my stomach.
I suffered a lot.

467
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,440
What are you going to do with Song-yi?

468
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,460
She has no work now. She is totally free.

469
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,110
I want to have dinner together with her.

470
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,870
You can have dinner every day.

471
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,260
Forget this. Do something special.

472
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,820
Just, special…

473
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,280
Let me give you a hint.

474
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,610
I have a very important thing to do.

475
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,580
So, can I take paid vacation?

476
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,640
Paid vacation?

477
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,000
Sure, of course.

478
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,710
I’m sorry.

479
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,600
I promised to sign the contract at 3 o 'clock.

480
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,050
Come on. It’s OK.

481
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,450
Just leave it to us.

482
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,120
Because it’s my first time to work on that.

483
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,680
I really want to see it myself.

484
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,510
See it?

485
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,280
How about… we delay it?

486
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,610
The customers are from England.

487
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,710
Their schedule says it can only be today.

488
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,750
Then ask them to fly here again next time.

489
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,890
It will just cost them 12 hours.

490
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,480
We’ll delay it so that you can see it next time.

491
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,160
Can that work?

492
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,410
Thank you.

493
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,380
4 P.M. Final exam. Must be present.

494
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,750
If not, you will get an F.

495
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,060
Look at the handwriting. What a boring guy.

496
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,130
Cheon Song-yi! Happy birthday!

497
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,370
Don’t forget to leave your night to me.

498
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,800
You brat.

499
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,370

In a traffic accident, both parties

I’ll have to force you out if you don’t.

566

It’s not an accident. You did that on purpose.

567
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,700
You knew someone is in the car,
and you knew the people would get hurt.

But you still hit it on purpose.

If the woman in the car is slightly injured,

574
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,190
that's assault and battery.

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,110
This semester is over. What are you going to do?

666
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,120
Do you want to have the second job?

667
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,480
What?

668
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,350
Like a part-time job in holidays.

669
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:53,660
How about to be my manager?

670
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,920
-Don’t make nonsense.
-What’s wrong?

671
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,360
Don’t you like to be a manager?

672
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,860
It’s so cool to be called

673
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,060
legal representative.

674
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,300
If you don’t like that,

675
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,570
how about bodyguard?

676
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,340
Pff.

677
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,570
I don't know how to do anything myself.

678
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,840
From the age of 12 to now

679
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,550
I have always been doing what I’m asked

680
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,210
to do in front of the cameras.

681
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,480
That’s all I have done.

682
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,750
I've never done anything with my own hands.

683
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,020
I like coffee so much.

684
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,220
But after I lost my manager, I haven’t
even had coffee recently

685
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,630
because I don’t know how to order.

686
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,460
How much is it?

687
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,230
Coffee?

688
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,200
No.

689
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,970
The job.

690
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,430
Don’t you want me to work for you?

691
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,310
That brat…

692
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,880
Who does he think he is?

693
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:00,020
Why do you come together?

694
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,920
Well, we met some trouble before.

695
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,560
Since you are here, enjoy the dinner with us.

696
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,730
What dinner?

697
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:09,700
Alright, you can leave now.

698
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,030
Hey, you…

699
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,140
Don’t hang out too late.

700
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:14,940
Send her back home when it’s over.

701
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,670
I know.

702
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,140
Why are you bossing me around?

703
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,410
I can see to it myself.

704
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,190
Why is no one else here?

705
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,930
You didn’t rent the whole amusement park

706
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,560
for tonight, did you?

707
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,300
I didn’t!

708
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,470
It’s too much for me

709
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,230
no matter how rich I am.

710
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,870
Maybe because it’s so cold today.

711
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,110
There really aren't many people here.

712
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,770
Then, why did you call me here?

713
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:56,710
Well, there.

714
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,420
Didn't you say that you would come and

715
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,830
play that every birthday when you were a kid?

716
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:14,700
It’s moving!

717
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,800
It’s moving!

718
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,870
-Is this really that exciting?
-Yes!

719
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:22,000
I feel like a star every time I’m on this.

720
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,470
I can see everything from here.

721
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:27,940
You can’t even sleep for your work.

722
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,310
Are you really OK to be busy like that?

723
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:31,950
You can stop your job if you don’t want to.

724
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:33,180
I will tell your mom…

725
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,220
It’s OK.

726
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,720
I’m happy to do that.

727
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,950
If I can’t make money,

728
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,620
mom won’t be angry to you again like before.

729
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,930
My girl, don’t worry about money.

730
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,860
I’ll deal with that myself.

731
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,930
If you are tired, just quit the job.

732
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,460
Don’t say that.

733
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,270
I think it’s interesting.

734
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,100
I can see many celebrities in TV station.

735
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,310
Last time I saw Won Bin! Won Bin!

736
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,810
The man in Autumn Fairy Tale! Dad, you know?

737
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,480
He is so handsome!

738
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,310
Won Bin and I, who is more handsome?

739
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,050
Dad,

740
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,820
even if I’m your daughter,

741
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,320
I can’t lie this time.

742
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,390
Hey.

743
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:15,590
Do you dare to answer?

744
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,630
Who is more handsome?

745
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,460
Who?

746
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,760
Dad, it’s you!

747
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,970
Yes.

748
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,910
I always came to play that on every birthday

749
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,410
with my dad.

750
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,140
But, how did you know that?

751
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,950
Of course I know everything of you.

752
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,520
Let’s go.

753
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:26,260
This…

754
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,970
What's wrong with me?

755
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:38,040
Why do I feel so sad when I see this?

756
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:59,060
It was like a sad dream.

757
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,360
From now on, it will become the story

758
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,400
like the unreal legend,

759
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,070
like the distant stars.

760
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:12,940
Lord,

761
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:16,410
you look pale now.

762
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:17,910
Catch them!

763
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,350
Go! Go!

764
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,010
My late grandma once said

765
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,810
that it’s better to say goodbye early,

766
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:58,320
because when it comes to the last moment,

767
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:04,390
there is no way to say goodbye properly.

768
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:12,730
Do you remember

769
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,070
what I said to you last time

770
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:18,640
when the first snow fell?

771
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:25,050
I want to grow up quickly.

772
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:30,890
I want you to see me into a beautiful lady.

773
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,370
Before I met you,

774
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:51,310
I had no hope for the future.

775
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,610
I was full of complaints and despondency.

776
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:02,680
After I saw you,

777
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:09,990
I had my first hope for the future,

778
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,270
and wanted to live sincerely.

779
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:34,780
Thank you. I mean it.

780
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:41,360
You must return safely to the place

781
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,490
where you were before.

782
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:48,500
I won’t forget you.

783
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,030
I can’t forget you.

784
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,370
No matter what place I will go to after I die,

785
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,340
I will never forget you.

786
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,610
Catch them!

787
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:07,280
Catch them!

788
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,550
Catch them!

789
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,530
I want them alive!

790
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,410
He is using witchcraft!

791
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,310
Shoot arrows!

792
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:34,880
Kill him!

793
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:07,410
I once wanted time to stop forever.

794
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:12,880
The moment when my loved one died.

795
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,430
Don't want to see. Don't want to believe.

796
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,170
I can do nothing.

797
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,880
The moment when I felt so powerless.

798
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:29,120
I have been restless these days.

799
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:31,790
Thank you.

800
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:34,200
I’m happy to be here.

801
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,640
I have prepared to be beaten by you

802
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,070
before I’m going to say the next thing.

803
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,940
I like you to be in the situation like now.

804
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,250
To be honest, I’m happy

805
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,650
that you could be in trouble.

806
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,220
What?

807
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,760
Because finally I can do something for you.

808
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,390
I can get the chance to step into your life.

809
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,860
Am I bad?

810
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,300
Yes.

811
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,800
So bad.

812
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,440
But,

813
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,640
can you regard this as my love to you?

814
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,640
I’ve been trying to tell you my feelings casually

815
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,120
because I’m afraid that you will turn me down
if I make it so serious,

816
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,750
and I can’t face you anymore.

817
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:35,520
Can this selfish thought

818
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,460
be regarded as my love to you?

819
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,730
You said you felt comfortable to cry before me.

820
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:49,400
You said I had seen all the sides of you
since childhood.

821
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,810
You feel at ease when you are with me.

822
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,420
Can that be regarded as the love between us?

823
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,020
Please just regard it as love

824
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,490
and be with me.

825
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:10,030
You, and your family, as long as

826
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,860
I’m still alive, I will take care of you.

827
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:20,470
You can do everything you want.

828
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,540
I can help you to do it.

829
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,220
If you don’t want to answer now,

830
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,120
you can tell me later.

831
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:42,320
No.

832
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,630
I will tell you now.

833
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,280
My answer is…

834
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,190
I once wanted time to stop forever

835
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:55,930
only for a word that I don’t want to listen.

836
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:23,630
What is this?

837
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,760
Song-yi,

838
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,130
please take care of yourself…

839
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,770
What’s going on?

840
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,580
[TO the next manager]

841
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:48,950
Don’t let Song-yi drink more than three glasses.

842
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,620
She will turn into a dog.

843
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,950
She will really bite others.

844
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,230
Stop her from playing SNS.

845
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,960
She’ll destroy your dream if she starts to talk.

846
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:06,700
At last, it’s the work she can’t take.

847
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,370
No medical TV play.

848
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,370
She can’t remember the medical terms.

849
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,910
No court TV play.

850
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,980
She can’t memorize the long lines.

851
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,910
No history TV play.

852
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,880
She hates the Joseon Dynasty.

853
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,880
This guy really knows me well.

854
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,390
But, why do I hate the Joseon Dynasty so much?

855
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,820
That’s weird. I just hate it.

856
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:30,430
Really weird.
