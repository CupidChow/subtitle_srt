1
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,187
- Hello, everyone.
- Hello.

2
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,256
Match to Marry: With Parents.

3
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,426
As time goes by, the emotions between
the contestants and their mothers...

4
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,962
- continue to grow deeper.
- Yes.

5
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:06,666
Last week,
the secret conversations between them...

6
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,334
were impossible to look away from.

7
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,369
With issues like age,

8
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,172
and questions about when and how life
should unfold after marriage coming up,

9
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:14,907
it felt like a moment...

10
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:20,279
that forced everyone to face reality.
That's how I saw it.

11
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:23,950
We still have Min Cheol's mother's
secret conversation left,

12
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,252
and this one doesn't look easy either.

13
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,220
Let's take a look.

14
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:32,725
(Jang Min Cheol's mother is waiting
for the secret conversation.)

15
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,594
I'm really curious...

16
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,563
about who Min Cheol's mother chose.

17
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:38,798
- Me too.
- Exactly.

18
00:01:39,832 --> 00:01:41,000
- Hello.
- Welcome.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,268
Have you been waiting long?

20
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,203
(Secret conversation request
Min Cheol's mother chose Kim Hyun Jin.)

21
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:46,939
- Hyun Jin.
- It's Hyun Jin.

22
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,944
I came here to support Min Cheol,

23
00:01:51,944 --> 00:01:53,112
and since Min Cheol has said
he's interested in her...

24
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,681
and they've already talked twice,
I thought I should try as well.

25
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,483
So she was the first person
who came to mind.

26
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,152
Should I pour you a drink?

27
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,019
Okay.

28
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,154
I'll get up and pour you a drink.

29
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,455
You don't have to stand.

30
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:04,857
There.

31
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,027
- I'm not really sure either.
- There.

32
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,264
- All right.
- There.

33
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,199
You must be thirsty. Shall we drink first?

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,100
Cheers.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,668
Cheers.

36
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,636
Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,872
(It's the first time the two meet alone.)

38
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,040
She must be really nervous.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,442
So nervous.

40
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,412
I'd like to ask you a few questions now.

41
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,781
And...

42
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,550
well,

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,323
even if some unexpected topics come up...

44
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,391
Unexpected topics?

45
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,326
What kind of questions
is she going to ask?

46
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:43,062
This really felt like
stepping into a tiger's den.

47
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,297
I remember thinking,

48
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,364
"I need to stay focused."

49
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,336
This is a very practical question.

50
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:54,574
If you were to get married,
when would you want to have a baby,

51
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,943
and once you do,
how would you raise the child?

52
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,778
And how many children
would you like to have?

53
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,313
- That's what I'm curious about.
- I see.

54
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,148
What kind of plan I have?

55
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,549
How you see things playing out.

56
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:07,120
I'm thinking about two or three children,

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,087
and the reason...

58
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,690
is that I was very happy
growing up as the third child.

59
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,024
- Really?
- Yes.

60
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,026
If possible,

61
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:17,029
I'd like to have children a bit earlier,

62
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,365
when I'm at my healthiest and strongest.

63
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,534
That's great.

64
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,703
That really puts my mind at ease.

65
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,570
Really?

66
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,838
(Fortunately, she liked her answer
to the first question.)

67
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,006
That puts my mind at ease.

68
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,510
And next is also a very realistic topic.

69
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,344
Yes.

70
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,046
It costs a lot to raise a child.

71
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:35,882
That's right.

72
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,818
So I'm curious
how you're preparing for that.

73
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,156
Whenever I receive my salary
or any income,

74
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:48,127
I save more than half of it,

75
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:51,731
since we also need to prepare for housing.

76
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,699
You're doing well.

77
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,369
She seems very practical and put-together.

78
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,472
May I ask about your father's job?

79
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,140
Even if he's retired now?

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,443
He originally worked in the public sector,

81
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,978
and now he's working in a different field,

82
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:10,550
while also enjoying some leisure time.

83
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,851
I see.

84
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:15,922
Ultimately, the reality...

85
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,525
is that things like parents' assets
or debts...

86
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,527
tend to get passed down.

87
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,628
They carry over.

88
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:24,230
Yes, that's right.

89
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,366
So I'd like to know
whether there's a situation like that,

90
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:29,068
and if there is,

91
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,505
as long as the parents can handle it,
there's no issue.

92
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:33,840
Right.

93
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,744
As far as I know,
there shouldn't be any problems with that.

94
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,045
- Really?
- Yes.

95
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:40,580
Okay.

96
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,882
That's good.

97
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,020
Let me ask a more specific question.

98
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,456
I would be
your future mother-in-law, right?

99
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,992
I might make things difficult,

100
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:55,395
or clearly express what I want.

101
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,464
In that kind of situation,
what would you do?

102
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,101
(A question that isn't easy to answer)

103
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,503
I...

104
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,340
This really feels
like a very in-depth interview.

105
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,408
Seriously.

106
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,243
It's suffocating.

107
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,077
I feel it too.

108
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,347
I...

109
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:20,052
For example,

110
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,855
if you wanted me to call you more often,

111
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,759
I would call you directly
and say something like,

112
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,296
"I'm sorry I'm quite busy,
but please understand."

113
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:33,933
I'd approach you more warmly
and affectionately.

114
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,168
That sounds good.

115
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,469
That's probably how I would handle it.

116
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,703
- Just hypothetically.
- Yes.

117
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:40,273
I think you'd do well
if you handled it that way.

118
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,274
Right.

119
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,411
I really didn't expect to go through
such an intense interview here.

120
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,814
But she answered very well.

121
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,949
I was a bit taken aback,

122
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,119
but I answered as best as I could.

123
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,856
The fact that she thinks through things
in such detail...

124
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,358
made me feel...

125
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,962
that this might reflect a genuine desire
to find a truly good daughter-in-law.

126
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,531
That must have been exhausting.

127
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,700
All my energy has been drained.

128
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,136
I came back
and was sitting here for a bit, and...

129
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:10,970
Min Cheol's mother?

130
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,505
She called me over.

131
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,273
Min Cheol's mother really has
her eye on you, doesn't she?

132
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,476
She asked me detailed questions.

133
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,777
Like what?

134
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,612
When I want to get married,

135
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,582
how many kids I want,

136
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,318
and how I would raise them.

137
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:25,985
(Gasp)

138
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,954
And things like...

139
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,690
whether we have any debts.

140
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,291
Wait, I forgot to ask about debts.

141
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,026
And?

142
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:38,097
She also asked what I would do
if I had conflicts with my mother-in-law.

143
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,333
(What?)

144
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,402
Personally, I don't like people...

145
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,571
who are overly blunt and probing.

146
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,708
- And my daughter...
- She looks really upset.

147
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,810
is not even at the stage
of talking about marriage yet,

148
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,013
but she asked so many things so directly.

149
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,216
So I thought maybe I should've asked...

150
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,985
more blunt questions myself.

151
00:06:58,985 --> 00:06:59,919
What?

152
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,021
Wait a second.

153
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,357
That's what she regrets?

154
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,060
I really should've asked more sharply.

155
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,295
I asked gently,

156
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,165
but my girl came back looking like
she'd been through something intense.

157
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,402
- Eun Na Rae, come sit here.
- Why?

158
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,873
I met Han Gyeol.

159
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:22,375
Good.

160
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,510
I asked him about his feelings,

161
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,680
and he said he's still interested in you.

162
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,484
He said that after hearing about you,
he got even more interested.

163
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,020
- Really?
- He said you seemed to live diligently.

164
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,455
But that's not exactly true.

165
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,991
I said the age gap was too big,
so it wouldn't work.

166
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,228
But he said, "Let's see what we can do,"
so that passed.

167
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,731
Then he mentioned
your routine as a freelancer,

168
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:47,633
and that it's not the kind of routine
he prefers.

169
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,969
But if handled well,

170
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,472
that could also turn
into something positive.

171
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,441
And then,
I said you don't have financial awareness.

172
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,943
(Laugh)

173
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,010
I told him everything.

174
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,081
You did great, Mom. You're the best.

175
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,218
How did you do it? That's impressive.

176
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,085
Really?

177
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,255
How did you get in second place?

178
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,759
They're so pure.

179
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,527
She didn't mention
the biggest issue, though.

180
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,498
She left out the issue
about marrying quickly and having kids.

181
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,767
But that's the most important part
for Han Gyeol.

182
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,102
(Sigh)

183
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,103
Mom.

184
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,037
You're back.

185
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,242
Answering her questions must've been hard.

186
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,211
(Completely drained)

187
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:36,516
She talked about
all the good points she sees...

188
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:41,254
and all the things she's worried about.

189
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,855
The things she's worried about...

190
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,157
are basically the same things
we're worried about, aren't they?

191
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,592
- They are.
- Of course.

192
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,661
The number one concern is age.

193
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,330
On that front,

194
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,766
well...

195
00:08:54,934 --> 00:09:00,039
I think your dad might feel a bit uneasy.

196
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,944
Me too, of course.

197
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,748
A seven-year gap
isn't a small difference, Han Gyeol.

198
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,516
- No, it isn't.
- Right.

199
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,453
Honestly,

200
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:17,990
there aren't many parents who would be
fully supportive right from the start.

201
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,726
If we'd met outside of this show...

202
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,027
The age alone would've made it a no.

203
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,095
We probably wouldn't have met at all.

204
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,996
I wouldn't even have gone on a blind date
after hearing that.

205
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,331
So it wouldn't have happened.

206
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,700
But when I said
that I didn't grow uninterested...

207
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,370
when I heard about the age,

208
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,340
she seemed relieved.

209
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,942
I knew it.

210
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,510
Look at her.

211
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,511
What about her job?

212
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,882
I told her that her job
was actually my bigger concern.

213
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,418
Even if she earns more as a freelancer,

214
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,820
I still find that part not satisfying.

215
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,055
I know.

216
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,328
Even if she's a freelancer making more
than I do, it still feels a bit lacking.

217
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,996
As a freelancer right now,

218
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,633
her income isn't stable.

219
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:03,703
And on top of that,
since she's been focused on studying,

220
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,839
it doesn't seem
like she's saved up much money.

221
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,708
And number three was exactly that.

222
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,779
That she doesn't have much savings.

223
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,713
I figured that might be the case.

224
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,915
I couldn't ask how much exactly, though.

225
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,552
She was getting too specific,
even bringing marriage into it.

226
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,454
Since everything feels urgent for them,
that's why.

227
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,555
About that...

228
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,557
They're saying she could marry right away.

229
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:28,461
If I said I was ready for that,

230
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,532
I think she'd be willing to say yes
even immediately.

231
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,801
But then again,

232
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,270
your dad and I...

233
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,738
Well...

234
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,907
Do you want me to say no, Mom?

235
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,811
Others are a bit less intense,

236
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,815
but her mother was talking...

237
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,084
like she could come to us tomorrow
and lay it all out.

238
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:54,353
It makes me think,
"What if we can't keep up with that pace?"

239
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,756
I see that too now.

240
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:57,790
That pace.

241
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,459
That part really matters.

242
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,160
So I'm conflicted.

243
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,229
Work-wise too.

244
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,966
If it were just one issue,
that'd be one thing, but there are others.

245
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,201
There are two major concerns.

246
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,703
You need to think...

247
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,874
about whether those issues...

248
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,709
Yeah.

249
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,244
can be overcome or not.

250
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,079
This is such a headache.

251
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,816
(Realistic issues have become obstacles.)

252
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,384
If I had to weigh them,

253
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,786
age.

254
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,655
That's probably the biggest concern.

255
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,491
It's in order.

256
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,427
Then job, then everything else.

257
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,998
It feels like carrying an assignment
around with me.

258
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,833
Honestly, I wanted to avoid it.

259
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:47,273
I could see how strong her desire was
to get her daughter married quickly.

260
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,674
So it feels burdensome.

261
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,111
She said age was the biggest concern.

262
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,047
Do you think she can support her son?

263
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,982
Not at all.

264
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,153
I don't think she'd support him at all.

265
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,354
From what I can tell,

266
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,857
she's someone
whose thinking is very fixed.

267
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,325
So there's no way.

268
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,962
Honestly, if I
were in Han Gyeol's mother's position,

269
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:13,099
I think I'd feel
just as conflicted as she does.

270
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:13,833
Right.

271
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,767
It can't really be helped.

272
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,170
Make something delicious for dinner.

273
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,504
Thank you.

274
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,107
(This space is open for
filming purposes only, with permission.)

275
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,141
You should take that out.

276
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,643
(Jin Joo naturally approaches Min Cheol.)

277
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,878
Then let's start
by taking the easy part first.

278
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,382
Did we say we'd speak casually?

279
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,684
Is it okay to drop honorifics?

280
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,120
I'd love that. I'm totally fine with it.

281
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,321
Can I drop them?

282
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,089
Can I drop them too?

283
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,490
Do we drop them or not? What should we do?

284
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,392
You can drop them. You're older than me.

285
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:41,294
I'm fine with it.
I actually really like it.

286
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:42,962
- Then what about me?
- Drop them too.

287
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,930
Okay.

288
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,534
Wait, a pot.

289
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:49,569
Let's...

290
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,071
Should we do it here?

291
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,005
- Wait.
- Why?

292
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,074
- I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
- Come here.

293
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,044
Let's make Korean army stew.

294
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:58,978
(With Han Gyeol leading,
the two cook together.)

295
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,280
- I was a bit worried.
- Worried?

296
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,349
- No.
- "Ladies, show us your cooking skills."

297
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,218
No! Then what do I do?

298
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,354
(Grins)

299
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,556
- He likes her.
- He likes her.

300
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,791
You can't help it when you like someone.

301
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,893
He likes her. What can you do?

302
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:18,865
I was worried they'd say something like,
"Today, the ladies will be cooking."

303
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:19,732
Is that so?

304
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,870
I'm terrible at cooking.
I'm totally panicking.

305
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,405
- Se Hoon, please.
- Please.

306
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,773
- Save us.
- What's wrong?

307
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,107
Is that okay?

308
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,710
(They ask Se Hoon,
the restaurant business owner, for help.)

309
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:32,645
What's the problem?

310
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,814
Korean dipping paste,
red chili paste, and soybean paste. Done.

311
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,951
Wait, try adding half a spoon
of those two.

312
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,086
Add these?

313
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,521
Try half a spoon of soybean paste.

314
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,889
Half a spoon of Korean dipping paste.

315
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,491
And half a spoon of soybean paste.

316
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:50,963
(They add various pastes
following Se Hoon's advice.)

317
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,566
Unbelievable.

318
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,168
- Is it okay? Is it better?
- Is it much better?

319
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,104
- You really do know how to cook.
- That's it.

320
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,439
Korean dipping paste,
red chili paste, and soybean paste. Done.

321
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,107
(Successfully saves the stew
thanks to Se Hoon)

322
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,508
That's amazing.

323
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,743
That's all it takes for Korean food.

324
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,612
- So we just call them now?
- We should bring the mothers.

325
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,513
Just bring them?

326
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,583
(Seung Hak heads out
to fetch the mothers.)

327
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,685
Mom.

328
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,622
(Silence)

329
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,093
Where did the mothers go?

330
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,095
Are they doing foot baths?

331
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:26,099
(No one in the foot-bath room either)

332
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,400
They're not in the foot-bath room either.

333
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,738
(I need to report this quickly.)

334
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,172
The mothers aren't here.

335
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,073
They're not?

336
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,308
Not a single one of them is here.

337
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,543
He says there's no one at the lodging.

338
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,446
Really? Then what's going on?

339
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,381
I guess they went somewhere.

340
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,816
Did they go out to eat?

341
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,154
I kind of wish the mothers...

342
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,022
would stay somewhere else tonight.

343
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:50,857
Really?

344
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,694
So we can relax a bit
and be more comfortable?

345
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,129
The mothers could go to a hotel.

346
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,663
(30 minutes earlier)

347
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:58,765
Thirty minutes earlier.

348
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:03,169
(Careful)

349
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,505
What should I pack? I'm so flustered.

350
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,306
(Laugh)

351
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,274
Pajamas.

352
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:09,876
Wait.

353
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:11,677
The mothers suddenly disappear.

354
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,981
It must be a surprise.

355
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,083
Good thing I brought a small bag.

356
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,685
It doesn't seem
like they're leaving for good,

357
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,523
since they didn't take their suitcases.

358
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,191
(A group midnight escape)

359
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,260
It's like a spy movie, right?

360
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,762
The kids have no idea.

361
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,797
It's a midnight escape.

362
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,998
A full-on midnight escape.

363
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:34,067
(The mothers step away from the lodging
for their sons and daughters.)

364
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,034
This is fun.

365
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,070
I'm so excited.

366
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:40,139
Honestly,
the kids might like it even more.

367
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,276
(Laugh)

368
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,610
It was really nice...

369
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,013
that they cleared out the lodging.

370
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:51,217
So we can have
quality time together earlier on.

371
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,186
Things might get wild tonight.

372
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:56,355
Don't you think everyone
will be more proactive now?

373
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,857
There's nothing
but things to look forward to.

374
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:01,427
The atmosphere will change a bit, right?

375
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,629
You can focus entirely
on the person you're interested in.

376
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,531
I think that alone
will make a big difference,

377
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,467
and they'll probably talk a lot more.

378
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:10,136
- They can't miss this chance.
- Of course.

379
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,239
They need to make a decisive move now.

380
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,173
They really do.

381
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,578
(A night shared only among
the contestants, without the mothers)

382
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:23,716
(The men head off somewhere.)

383
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,419
(In separate locations,)

384
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,623
(the women wait for their dates.)

385
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,259
The men's choice.

386
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,095
(Tonight's dates are matched
based on the men's choices.)

387
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:43,202
(Jin Joo, who received 0 votes
from the men's mothers)

388
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,605
Who will come to Jin Joo?

389
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,839
Min Cheol?

390
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,577
I even thought,
"What if no one comes at all?"

391
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:54,113
I really hoped the person I wanted
to talk to would show up.

392
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,182
Jang Min Cheol.

393
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,018
I was afraid I'd be hurt
if he didn't come,

394
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,287
so honestly,
I tried to keep my expectations low.

395
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,726
Because I wanted to talk
to Min Cheol one more time,

396
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,530
I was hoping he'd come.

397
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:14,100
(Hyun Jin and Jin Joo
are waiting for Min Cheol.)

398
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,269
They're both waiting for Min Cheol.

399
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,806
I actually agonized over this decision.

400
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,844
I'd already gone on a one-on-many date
with Hyun Jin based on my mother's pick,

401
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,913
so part of me thought
I should go to Hyun Jin.

402
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,981
But Jin Joo kept coming to mind too.

403
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,151
I wondered if I was being wishy-washy.

404
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,457
So the question became,
who would he choose?

405
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,259
(Men's-choice date
Jang Min Cheol chooses Kim Jin Joo.)

406
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,863
- Jin Joo.
- He chose Jin Joo.

407
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,032
What?

408
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:48,134
(Startled)

409
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,537
Why?

410
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,305
Really?

411
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,043
Let's have a drink.

412
00:17:58,711 --> 00:17:59,979
I think this one's new.

413
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,890
(Clean)

414
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,258
This is good.

415
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,127
It kind of tastes like lemonade.

416
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,129
- It is good.
- Yeah.

417
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:21,934
Did you have fun?

418
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,303
Earlier today?

419
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,706
I don't remember.

420
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:32,111
The one-on-many setup felt a bit awkward.

421
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,312
But I guess it was fun,

422
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,581
since all four of you are pretty outgoing.

423
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,417
One-on-one is much better.

424
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,852
That's why...

425
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:43,823
I came.

426
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,260
I didn't really get a chance
to talk one-on-one with you today.

427
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,127
Yeah.

428
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,431
You came, pretty boldly today.

429
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,598
I had to.

430
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,499
"I had to."

431
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,202
The men got to choose the dates today.

432
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,971
I didn't get to talk with you much today,

433
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,275
and I figured you were probably
pretty disappointed today.

434
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:05,178
- Is this a sympathy vote?
- No, not at all.

435
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,047
I've got enough to worry about myself.
What are you talking about?

436
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,954
Jin Joo got zero votes
when the men's mothers made their picks.

437
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,391
So she seemed pretty down.

438
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,296
Neither side's mothers chose us.

439
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,630
Yeah.

440
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:31,104
(Jin Joo's mother chose Seo Han Gyeol.)

441
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:36,275
(Min Cheol's mother chose Kim Hyun Jin.)

442
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,777
That hurts.

443
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,946
(The two are split
by the mothers' choices.)

444
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:40,880
Really?

445
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,283
What if your mother is against me?
What would you do?

446
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,184
Hypothetically speaking.

447
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:49,088
I know I'm skipping a lot of steps
with this question.

448
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,925
Did you have feelings for me
from the start?

449
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,561
I pickd you for the best first impression.

450
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,996
I mean, on Day 1 and Day 2.

451
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,766
Was there someone else
your feelings leaned toward, besides me?

452
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,168
Yeah.

453
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:03,403
So there are two people.

454
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,572
Then, how do you feel now?

455
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,375
I feel the same.

456
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,446
The intensity and everything?

457
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,915
It's the same, but there is one thing.

458
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:16,849
Your mother's choice.

459
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:22,388
So today, I wondered,
"Should I go talk to his mother?"

460
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,023
That's what I even thought about.

461
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,191
You even thought that far?

462
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,529
Like, "What kind of daughter-in-law
are you looking for?"

463
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,399
But it wasn't easy because
it already felt like I was rejected.

464
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,169
You might've felt it yesterday too.

465
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,572
That sense of being turned down.

466
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:46,179
I think I'm drawn to people
who are honest.

467
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,780
And Jin Joo is really honest.

468
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,683
That's probably her charm.

469
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,220
When I'm with Jin Joo,
I feel both excited and at ease.

470
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,054
So...

471
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,658
my interest in her grew a bit more.

472
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,562
(Who came to see Hyun Jin?)

473
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:05,465
- Hyun Jin.
- Hyun Jin was waiting for Min Cheol.

474
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,633
- Hyun Jun?
- Hyun Jun.

475
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,135
I thought you weren't coming.

476
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,504
Really? I actually got lost.

477
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,872
- Really?
- Yeah.

478
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:13,940
I was wandering around.

479
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,743
Thank you so much for coming.

480
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:19,045
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

481
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,815
It's our first time like this,
just the two of us.

482
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:23,883
Right.

483
00:21:24,317 --> 00:21:25,785
We never really got to talk before.

484
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,186
So I was really glad to see you.

485
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:33,359
I thought you had
absolutely no interest in me.

486
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:37,830
But you realized today
after talking with my mother?

487
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,731
Yeah.

488
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:42,168
Because I thought it was a definite no.

489
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:43,736
What did your mother say?

490
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:45,438
My mom?

491
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:46,672
"Hyun Jun seems really nice."

492
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,644
But since we haven't done
a one-on-one date yet...

493
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,578
Right.

494
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,515
I felt a bit regretful about that too.

495
00:21:55,815 --> 00:22:00,486
So why did you choose me today?

496
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:04,157
I felt like we needed to talk,
and I also had fun earlier today.

497
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,427
And I thought if today passed,
I might miss my chance.

498
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:08,461
Today?

499
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,229
And today was the first day
the information of the women was revealed.

500
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,864
Right.

501
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:14,534
So I think a lot will change
starting tomorrow.

502
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,468
Yeah?

503
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,969
Like the overall pace.

504
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,338
Do you think it'll change for you?

505
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,607
I think it might.

506
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:24,343
After the secret conversation,

507
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,081
it feels like he shifted a little.

508
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,350
Is it okay to have expectations?

509
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:33,920
Do you have expectations?

510
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,222
Well, if you let me...

511
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,857
Go ahead. Have some expectations.

512
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,925
Really?

513
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:40,893
Then I'll raise them a bit.

514
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,428
Anyway, we're talking like this...

515
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,163
You're still in my top five, anyway.

516
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,666
Isn't being in the top five a good thing?

517
00:22:46,666 --> 00:22:47,867
That's kind of a pointless thing to say.

518
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,203
I was hoping he'd say something smoother.

519
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,205
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.

520
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,777
I don't think it's like,
"This feels so nice!"

521
00:22:57,777 --> 00:23:00,580
That kind of feeling.

522
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,651
I wanted to talk to Min Cheol
one more time,

523
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:07,253
so...

524
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,689
I don't think
my feelings have really changed.

525
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:14,627
Will Han Gyeol come?

526
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:20,199
After learning a bit about
Han Gyeol's feelings through my mom,

527
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,468
I wanted to hear directly
what those feelings were.

528
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:27,407
(Eun Na Rae waits for Han Gyeol.)

529
00:23:28,141 --> 00:23:32,178
(Who came to see Eun Na Rae?)

530
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,781
- Hi.
- Hi.

531
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,048
- Have you been waiting?
- A little. It was cold.

532
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,917
(Seo Han Gyeol chooses Cho Eun Na Rae.)

533
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:40,653
As expected,
Han Gyeol came to see Eun Na Rae.

534
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:41,988
I thought no one was coming.

535
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,489
- Really?
- Yeah.

536
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,258
Why wouldn't you think I'd come?

537
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:50,997
How was I supposed to know?

538
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,566
In a way,

539
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,436
it's the first time
Han Gyeol chose me for a date.

540
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,905
It made me really happy.

541
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,708
Want to cheers?

542
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,776
Anyway,

543
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,445
why did you come?

544
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,114
- Why did I come?
- Is that too blunt?

545
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,715
What do you mean, why?

546
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,384
I came because I wanted to go on a date.

547
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:12,285
I mean,

548
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,987
what kind of feelings did you come with?

549
00:24:15,822 --> 00:24:17,557
Is it strange for me to come here?

550
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,926
Yeah.

551
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:20,960
- Is it?
- Yeah.

552
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:24,497
- It doesn't feel natural.
- It doesn't?

553
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,500
I came because I wanted to talk more.

554
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,003
To talk together.

555
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,805
I see. That's nice.

556
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:34,507
I came because I wanted to talk.

557
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,512
There were so many things I didn't know,
and I wanted to talk them through.

558
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:42,281
Your mother came to me...

559
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,883
and mentioned a few things
that concerned her.

560
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:45,685
Like what?

561
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,520
Nothing too specific.

562
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,855
Things like age,

563
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,490
and then...

564
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,726
He started asking
very realistic questions.

565
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:56,963
See? It's already making you like this.

566
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:57,830
No, but...

567
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,598
We don't have to rush it like this.

568
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:01,534
Still, I think these
are really important issues.

569
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,703
They are important.

570
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:06,539
And because they're important,

571
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,375
I'm not planning to brush them aside.

572
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,310
But for me,

573
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,614
in just half a day,

574
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,517
"Everything's sorted out."

575
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:20,820
This is not possible.

576
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:22,722
Is that really that funny?

577
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,192
- Everything feels so if you like someone.
- That's true.

578
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,761
I think I need some time.

579
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,397
- That's so funny.
- I guess I just thought...

580
00:25:31,397 --> 00:25:37,303
maybe I should put it off a little.

581
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:39,138
These aren't things
only I should worry about,

582
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:42,442
and I'm not the only one deciding.
We should think them through together.

583
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:45,344
That's true.

584
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:47,013
Yeah, that's true.

585
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,651
I don't think I'm at the point yet...

586
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:56,556
where I can say,
"I could date this person,"

587
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,525
but I do think I've already concluded
that she's a good person.

588
00:26:00,293 --> 00:26:03,796
But before that, marriage...

589
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,265
Having to think about marriage
before thinking about dating...

590
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:11,838
feels very unfamiliar to me.

591
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:14,574
(And the one who chose Myo Jin...)

592
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,508
Hi.

593
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,176
(Seung Hak)

594
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,046
- Seung Hak went to Myo Jin.
- Right, Seung Hak was there.

595
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,481
Seung Hak finally showed up.

596
00:26:21,481 --> 00:26:23,916
We missed you, Seung Hak.

597
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,918
(Lee Seung Hak chooses Kim Myo Jin.)

598
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,787
- Were you alone?
- Yeah.

599
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:30,156
I didn't really hesitate over anyone else.

600
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:32,992
I think I've just kept feeling
more drawn to you, Myo Jin.

601
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,661
Is there something you wanted to ask?

602
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,029
Have you, to some extent,

603
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,600
sorted your thoughts out a bit?

604
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,068
- Sorted my thoughts?
- Yeah.

605
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,504
Yeah, somewhat. I've gotten things sorted.

606
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:47,306
How do you feel, Seung Hak?

607
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:49,709
Honestly,

608
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,778
I've felt pretty much the same
the whole time.

609
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,881
He's been single-minded about Myo Jin.

610
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:57,884
So I wanted to talk more with you today.

611
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,188
After the information was revealed,

612
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:04,190
did your feelings change at all?

613
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,260
You turned out
to be younger than I expected.

614
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,696
That did affect me a little,

615
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:13,666
since I tend to prefer someone older.

616
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:17,003
The moment it was clear you were younger,

617
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:19,305
and I started thinking of myself
as the "older one,"

618
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,608
the excitement dipped a bit.

619
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,777
That did happen.

620
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:25,912
So...

621
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,980
That can happen.

622
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,982
But, well...

623
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,288
What I'm curious about is this.

624
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:38,424
You said there were two people
you were interested in, right?

625
00:27:39,459 --> 00:27:41,694
Can I ask if I was one of them?

626
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:47,100
Yeah, you were.

627
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,268
"Were?"

628
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:52,138
So before the age reveal, he was included.

629
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,507
You were.

630
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,175
"You were." That sounded past tense.

631
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,577
Why did I say it like that?

632
00:27:57,577 --> 00:27:59,178
Anyway, that's how it was.

633
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:02,215
But honestly, there is someone
I'm more curious about now.

634
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,586
Right now, there's someone
I'm more curious about.

635
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,421
And actually, this is...

636
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:10,389
How do you feel about that?

637
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,392
Is it kind of...

638
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,395
too much pressure if I do this?

639
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:16,396
Do what?

640
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:17,764
If I keep...

641
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:21,334
not talking to anyone else, but just you.

642
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:26,506
You can do what you want to do,

643
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:29,142
but I do think it'd be okay
to talk to someone else at least once.

644
00:28:30,343 --> 00:28:34,213
And even after that,
if you still come back to me,

645
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:36,916
I'd honestly be really grateful.

646
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,086
I understand what you mean.

647
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:44,090
Should we do a quick cheers?

648
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,525
Cheers.

649
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,462
If you don't show...

650
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:52,331
clear interest in someone,

651
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,367
but they go all in, single-mindedly,

652
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,103
that can feel a bit burdensome.

653
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,604
At this point,

654
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,442
it almost feels like they should have
a farewell drink and part ways.

655
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,812
Lately, every night,

656
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,881
I'm hanging out with Tae In.

657
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,384
I've been like that with Eun Na Rae.

658
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:12,552
- Who?
- Eun Na Rae.

659
00:29:12,552 --> 00:29:13,820
Really?

660
00:29:14,887 --> 00:29:15,955
Not Myo Jin?

661
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:17,824
- Yeah.
- Why?

662
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:19,726
Not "why,"

663
00:29:19,726 --> 00:29:21,360
- But really?
- Yeah.

664
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,528
I just assumed you would've...

665
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:23,863
Changed my mind?

666
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:26,632
No, not changed.
I thought you'd gone to Myo Jin.

667
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:27,700
- You did?
- Yeah.

668
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:30,303
You must've had a pretty good time with...

669
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:31,137
Hello.

670
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,538
Hi.

671
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:33,539
(Someone comes
to Se Hoon and Han Gyeol's room.)

672
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,507
Someone came by.

673
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:35,842
- Myo Jin.
- Myo Jin?

674
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:39,378
Well...

675
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,549
Be brave and tell us.

676
00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:44,550
Se Hoon?

677
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,553
Actually, I wanted to talk with Se Hoon.

678
00:29:47,553 --> 00:29:48,387
Really?

679
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,023
Yeah, so I came over. Is that okay?

680
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:54,327
Of course it is. Go ahead.

681
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,364
- Let's talk again later.
- We can talk later again later.

682
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,466
- Yeah, don't worry, go ahead.
- Okay.

683
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:04,404
Myo Jin worked up the courage
to come to Se Hoon.

684
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:07,440
I was curious.

685
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,741
Thanks.

686
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:12,678
I wanted to know
how you're feeling and all that.

687
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,350
Who were you planning to talk to?

688
00:30:19,452 --> 00:30:21,554
It was either you or Tae In.

689
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,456
Really?

690
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,759
You were actually very clearly
one of the people...

691
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,861
I was considering too.

692
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:29,729
Really?

693
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:30,596
Yeah.

694
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:33,900
When I heard information about you,
there were a lot of unexpected things.

695
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,936
But you didn't ask me a single question.

696
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:37,837
Yeah.

697
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:40,807
I kind of missed the timing.

698
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:45,111
You asked other people so many questions,

699
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:48,514
so I was starting to feel
a bit disappointed.

700
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,549
But that happens.

701
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,118
So you were disappointed.

702
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:53,219
I guess I was.

703
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,222
I thought the work you do...

704
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:58,024
would be more science
or engineering-related.

705
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,025
- Really?
- Yeah.

706
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,993
Very, like...

707
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,297
what people might call "AI-like."

708
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:05,331
A bit mechanical.

709
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:06,899
Now I'm AI too?

710
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,000
No.

711
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,302
That's wild.

712
00:31:11,738 --> 00:31:15,341
They're the same age, so it kind of feels
like a friendship between them.

713
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,576
Right, they're the same age.

714
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,312
I'm kind of the complete opposite.

715
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:20,513
Really?

716
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:23,182
Maybe I should show
a more messy side of myself.

717
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:25,351
And you don't drink much either.

718
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:26,652
Right.

719
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,020
I can't really drink.

720
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:30,857
That's a bit of a downside,

721
00:31:30,857 --> 00:31:33,092
because everyone else
gets super hyped drinking...

722
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:36,095
and gets really close. I envy that.

723
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:38,631
Do you usually go to bed early, then?

724
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:41,634
Normally around midnight to one.

725
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,302
You live pretty regularly, right?

726
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,204
Yeah, more or less.

727
00:31:45,204 --> 00:31:47,974
From Monday to Friday, it's like that.

728
00:31:47,974 --> 00:31:49,275
I'm the total opposite.

729
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,310
- Really?
- Pretty much.

730
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,211
No routine at all?

731
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,446
You could say none.

732
00:31:53,446 --> 00:31:57,283
So you're often up late at night too?

733
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:00,153
Then it's hard to know
when a good time to contact you is?

734
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:01,421
You live that busy of a life?

735
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:04,924
That busy?

736
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,460
(The two are different in many ways.)

737
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,361
Okay.

738
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:12,799
They really seem
to have a lot of differences.

739
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,601
Even their daily routines
are completely different.

740
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,037
(Knock, knock)

741
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:19,338
Who is it?

742
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:23,910
Here?

743
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,178
Yeah.

744
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:26,712
Wait, what?

745
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,115
Hello.

746
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,250
Min Cheol.

747
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:33,419
- Is he there for Jin Joo?
- Wait.

748
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,955
He asked to meet?

749
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,192
If you need to meet him, go ahead.

750
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:42,628
Of everyone else,
the two of them were together.

751
00:32:44,297 --> 00:32:46,299
The two of you are going on a date, right?

752
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,433
(Nods)

753
00:32:48,568 --> 00:32:49,502
Go on.

754
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:52,672
Things here just totally...

755
00:32:52,672 --> 00:32:54,507
(The mood turns awkward
with Min Cheol's arrival.)

756
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,908
It got awkward.

757
00:32:56,943 --> 00:32:58,478
That really surprised me.

758
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:02,915
This feels like some kind of drama.
What is this situation?

759
00:33:02,915 --> 00:33:06,085
I thought,
"I might become the villain here,"

760
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:10,556
but in the end,
I felt I needed to talk more with Jin Joo.

761
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,725
So I just thought,
"Well, there's no helping it."

762
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,798
- Darn it. This is so annoying.
- Poor her.

763
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:20,566
Of course, it's annoying.

764
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:22,835
That was intense.

765
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,605
(Peeking)

766
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:28,674
(Hyun Jin watches Jin Joo leave.)

767
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:32,345
He's mean.

768
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:34,881
"He's mean." Poor her.

769
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:38,885
(A chaotic night with tangled emotions)

770
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,287
(The morning of Day 4)

771
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:53,366
(The men are getting ready
early in the morning.)

772
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,736
(Spraying cologne)

773
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,738
(Today is Free Choice Day.)

774
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:01,207
I should go out on a date.

775
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:05,578
(Seung Hak is the first
to visit the women's lodging.)

776
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:06,446
Hello.

777
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,783
Who does Seung Hak
want to go on a date with?

778
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:13,820
Myo Jin, are you heading out?

779
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,155
Yeah, I am, but could I...

780
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,223
take a moment to get ready?

781
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:17,990
Sure.

782
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:20,727
Just once,

783
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:24,163
he could throw a curveball,

784
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,798
but it's straight fastballs only.

785
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,170
(Seung Hak chooses Myo Jin again today.)

786
00:34:32,004 --> 00:34:33,239
Who did you go to?

787
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,440
Myo Jin.. What about you, Se Hoon?

788
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,541
You go first.

789
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,943
Then I should head back.

790
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,078
So you were planning
to talk to Myo Jin too.

791
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:40,980
Yeah, I wanted to talk to Myo Jin again.

792
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,282
But you go first, Seung Hak.

793
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:47,620
Myo Jin looked really tired yesterday,

794
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:51,591
and there was a lot I was curious about,
but I don't think I got to ask everything.

795
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:54,394
Hi, Myo Jin.

796
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:55,595
Hello.

797
00:34:56,496 --> 00:34:59,031
I heard you're going on a date
with Seung Hak.

798
00:34:59,031 --> 00:34:59,832
That's right.

799
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,705
Hang out with Seung Hak.
I'll head out and come back.

800
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:07,907
Then let's go on a date too, Myo Jin.

801
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,343
What?

802
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,012
- What's this?
- Nervous.

803
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,882
Your nose sounds stuffy too.

804
00:35:15,882 --> 00:35:17,150
Yeah.

805
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:19,585
Make sure you dress warmly.

806
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:20,319
What's this?

807
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,721
A honey stick.

808
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:22,955
My goodness.

809
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,624
Thank you so much.

810
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:25,625
My goodness.

811
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:29,929
Seung Hak, did you talk with Tae In too?

812
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,465
- Let's go out and eat separately,
- Okay, then.

813
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:35,301
and switch back on the way back.

814
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,536
That's fun.

815
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,738
You said we should be proactive.

816
00:35:39,372 --> 00:35:41,174
Should I be even more proactive, then?

817
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:46,079
I wanted to have
a deeper conversation with Myo Jin,

818
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,683
but Seung Hak said
he was going on a date with her first,

819
00:35:50,683 --> 00:35:53,853
so I came up
with a rather ambitious plan...

820
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:56,189
to switch things around at a set time.

821
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,324
What time did you wake up?

822
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,927
Today, around 8:30.

823
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,696
Did you go to bed late yesterday?
Around four?

824
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:07,400
I talked a bit more
with the women last night.

825
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:13,673
How did you feel
after our one-on-one yesterday?

826
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,074
You went straight
to the interview after that.

827
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,176
When I said I hadn't talked
to anyone else yet,

828
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:20,379
it sounded like you were saying,

829
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:24,884
"Try talking to someone else,
and then decide."

830
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:27,353
So are you going to talk to someone else?

831
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,988
No. I don't plan to.

832
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:29,989
Really?

833
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,227
Honestly, I feel like
I've pretty much decided already.

834
00:36:34,227 --> 00:36:35,595
- Really?
- Yeah.

835
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:38,364
- So...
- That's interesting.

836
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:40,566
being told all of a sudden...

837
00:36:40,566 --> 00:36:44,270
to go talk to someone else...

838
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,005
doesn't seem like it'll change anything.

839
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,175
That's such a classic...

840
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,711
unyielding determination of an athlete.

841
00:36:52,345 --> 00:36:55,448
"I'm sticking to the path I chose."

842
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:56,482
I think that's admirable.

843
00:36:56,482 --> 00:36:58,151
Yes, it is.

844
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:00,119
Do you usually fall for people quickly...

845
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,320
like that?

846
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,855
Are you the type to fall fast?

847
00:37:02,855 --> 00:37:03,856
I'm not.

848
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,825
- You're not?
- No.

849
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:09,695
It's just that you're the person
I want to get to know the most here.

850
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,936
Earlier, actually, Se Hoon asked...

851
00:37:16,936 --> 00:37:19,539
if we could switch
because he wanted to talk to you,

852
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:21,374
and I was just...

853
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:22,542
How did that make you feel?

854
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:27,480
If he wanted to get to know you too,

855
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,515
I can't be the only one
being selfish, right?

856
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:30,783
You can be selfish.

857
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:32,652
Is that so?

858
00:37:35,855 --> 00:37:38,124
That might be true.

859
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:40,760
(Smiles)

860
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,662
Just follow your heart.

861
00:37:42,662 --> 00:37:43,463
Okay, then.

862
00:37:45,264 --> 00:37:48,067
He's in a full bulldozer mode.

863
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:50,169
But at the same time, yesterday,

864
00:37:50,169 --> 00:37:54,240
I told him to talk to someone else too
and kind of gave a rejection line, right?

865
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,341
After saying that,

866
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:59,011
when I saw him again with my mind at ease,

867
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:01,280
he suddenly looked really cute to me.

868
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:03,282
He looked cute?

869
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,851
If someone looks cute, the game is over.

870
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:07,587
Is there any food you don't eat?

871
00:38:08,688 --> 00:38:09,956
Cilantro.

872
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,858
Right, you mentioned cilantro before.

873
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:14,127
Other than that, meat.

874
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:18,931
I can't really eat
a lot of beef, pork, or chicken.

875
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:22,502
Do you eat a lot of other things?
You don't seem like you do.

876
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:26,873
I like sashimi and raw foods
like beef tartare.

877
00:38:26,873 --> 00:38:28,641
- Things like that.
- Right, you told me.

878
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:30,476
You're more of a meat person, right?

879
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:31,611
I just eat what's there.

880
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:35,915
I'm more
of a "whatever's on the table" type.

881
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,451
But even then, you must have preferences.

882
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:41,187
Is there something you really love?

883
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:42,488
Probably meat.

884
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,257
Right? That figures.

885
00:38:44,257 --> 00:38:46,626
Then among beef, pork, and chicken?

886
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,195
There's nothing I dislike.

887
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:51,297
I don't dislike any of those.

888
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:54,167
That's so funny.

889
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:57,837
This should give us some energy.

890
00:38:58,504 --> 00:38:59,439
Nice.

891
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,706
Enjoy your meal.

892
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,541
Enjoy your meal.

893
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:05,044
This Cheongyang chili is the kick, right?

894
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:07,146
- Exactly, it's so good.
- It's really good.

895
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:11,284
Are you good with spicy food?

896
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:13,553
I like spicy stir-fried noodles.

897
00:39:13,553 --> 00:39:15,121
- You like spicy food.
- Can you eat spicy stir-fried noodles?

898
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:16,756
My lips swell up like crazy.

899
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:17,590
Really?

900
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,193
I didn't like spicy food much
when I was younger...

901
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:21,828
because my friends
used to call me "Korean blood sausage."

902
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:23,529
- Were your lips thicker back then?
- Yeah.

903
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,430
So they've gone down now?

904
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,133
- No, they're about the same.
- The same?

905
00:39:27,133 --> 00:39:29,202
Maybe a little less? Anyway, back then...

906
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:30,369
Right, because back then,

907
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,139
when you're a baby, your face is smaller
but your lips stay big.

908
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:34,440
So you must've been like Atashin'chi.

909
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:36,442
Yeah.

910
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:37,510
Majolica and things like that.

911
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:39,512
You really like that.

912
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,247
Don't like it too much.

913
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:45,685
"He's cute."
I just don't know whether this cuteness...

914
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:48,354
is the kind you feel
toward someone younger,

915
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:51,390
or the kind you feel
toward a younger guy you're attracted to.

916
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,760
Honestly, I'm not sure myself.

917
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,164
But somehow, I grew a bit more interested.
Isn't that funny?

918
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,566
The weather is so nice today.

919
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:01,534
The best.

920
00:40:01,534 --> 00:40:02,568
(Seo Han Gyeol and Cho Eun Na Rae's date)

921
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:04,270
And then here...

922
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,338
Sorry.

923
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:06,205
It's okay.

924
00:40:06,205 --> 00:40:07,273
(Polite hand gesture)

925
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:09,742
- It's worse in my car.
- No.

926
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,277
It doesn't bother me at all.

927
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:12,078
Sorry.

928
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:18,351
When did you start
wanting to be an announcer?

929
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:19,719
Since middle school.

930
00:40:19,719 --> 00:40:20,853
- Really?
- Yeah.

931
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:24,223
Then your high school dream
was the same as mine.

932
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,458
Announcer.

933
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,926
I wanted to be an announcer too.

934
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:28,394
(The two once shared the same dream.)

935
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,129
(They arrive at the restaurant
before they realize it.)

936
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:31,064
Why? Does it not fit?

937
00:40:31,064 --> 00:40:33,132
Well, it could fit.

938
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,936
Did you do any clubs in school?

939
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,838
Yeah, I did. A dance club.

940
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:40,506
Dance club? Wait.

941
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:42,642
We weren't in the same club, were we?

942
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:44,277
I was in a dance club too.

943
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:48,648
As far as I know,
there were two or three main ones.

944
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:51,551
Mine was called Jazz Dance,

945
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,419
but it wasn't really jazz.

946
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:55,388
Just...

947
00:40:55,388 --> 00:40:57,190
Why? Was it the same one?

948
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,024
Yeah.

949
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:01,227
(Could they be from the same club?)

950
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:02,929
Come on, don't lie.

951
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:03,830
I'm serious.

952
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:07,667
- You're lying.
- This is crazy.

953
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:08,668
Don't lie.

954
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:09,936
I'm serious.

955
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:12,138
No way, senior.

956
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:18,311
Is this really happening?

957
00:41:21,047 --> 00:41:21,881
No way.

958
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,516
I'm from the ninth cohort.

959
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:26,419
- Was it ninth?
- I'm 16th.

960
00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:28,054
Right, because I'm seven years older.

961
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:30,957
I can't believe this.

962
00:41:30,957 --> 00:41:32,658
My thoughts suddenly got
really complicated.

963
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:38,064
But I also feel a bit different now.

964
00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:38,765
Different how?

965
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:40,500
I suddenly feel so much
like a junior, right?

966
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,368
Yeah, you really do.

967
00:41:44,804 --> 00:41:45,772
I suddenly...

968
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,877
I've been talking to you so casually,

969
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:54,647
and now all my seniors' faces
are flashing by.

970
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:55,948
Right?

971
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,586
(The two get to know each other
a bit more.)

972
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,255
- Want to walk?
- Yeah, sure.

973
00:42:02,255 --> 00:42:02,989
Let's go.

974
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,557
Let's sit here for a bit.

975
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:08,561
Over there.

976
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:12,131
It's so pretty over there.
I want to go there.

977
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:15,368
I want to take a boat or something
and go all the way over there.

978
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:17,470
The weather is amazing today.

979
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:22,241
Is there a boat going by over there?
Probably not, right?

980
00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:23,509
Doesn't look like it.

981
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,745
- Where?
- Boats probably can't pass through here.

982
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,548
It's nice.

983
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,984
- Gimcheon is nice.
- Yeah.

984
00:42:33,186 --> 00:42:37,723
This was probably
our fourth date together,

985
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:40,193
and today was the most fun.

986
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:42,628
It feels very natural.

987
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:45,331
I can feel us getting closer
and more comfortable,

988
00:42:45,798 --> 00:42:50,369
and I think we both feel
that we're focusing on each other...

989
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,473
to some extent.

990
00:42:53,473 --> 00:42:54,640
Throughout the date,

991
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,676
my energy felt a bit low.

992
00:42:57,376 --> 00:43:01,981
We mostly talked about our personalities
or things like that,

993
00:43:01,981 --> 00:43:07,653
and nothing really came up
that sparked that fluttery feeling.

994
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:10,656
It's comfortable, sure.

995
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:17,330
But maybe it's just comfortable
and nothing more.

996
00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:21,134
We're almost there.

997
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:22,502
Which way do we go?

998
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:23,569
Over there.

999
00:43:24,837 --> 00:43:28,808
(Se Hoon is waiting for Myo Jin.)

1000
00:43:30,076 --> 00:43:31,778
- Hello.
- Hello.

1001
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,012
Hello.

1002
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:34,380
Did you enjoy your meal?

1003
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,548
What did you eat?

1004
00:43:35,548 --> 00:43:36,416
It's a secret.

1005
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:37,950
Okay.

1006
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:40,720
- Come on over.
- Let's go, Myo Jin.

1007
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,487
Let's go.

1008
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:42,455
This is it.

1009
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,224
The flowers in the vase are pretty.

1010
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:46,492
Yeah, they're really pretty.

1011
00:43:49,195 --> 00:43:52,432
Since we're both a bit tired,

1012
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:54,534
instead of sitting around in a café,

1013
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:56,235
let's just take
a comfortable drive somewhere.

1014
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:57,303
Sounds good.

1015
00:43:57,303 --> 00:43:58,971
Let's ask them to put it in a to-go cup.

1016
00:43:58,971 --> 00:43:59,972
- Should we?
- Yeah.

1017
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:03,376
Let's get it to go.

1018
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:06,245
Nice and easy.

1019
00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:07,213
There's something I wanted to say.

1020
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,849
On the first day,
you made me feel really comfortable.

1021
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,618
I was pretty tense,

1022
00:44:12,618 --> 00:44:15,121
but you were funny and easygoing.

1023
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:17,957
But the more I talk to you,

1024
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:22,895
maybe because of your job too,

1025
00:44:22,895 --> 00:44:26,299
the more we talk,

1026
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:28,868
the more your style
feels a bit challenging.

1027
00:44:28,868 --> 00:44:30,937
You know what I mean?
You've heard that before, right?

1028
00:44:30,937 --> 00:44:32,739
- No.
- You haven't?

1029
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:36,642
But there's a certain tension.

1030
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:38,478
Really?

1031
00:44:38,478 --> 00:44:39,812
That could be a good thing.

1032
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:44,917
What kind of person do you usually like?

1033
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:50,123
Do you have a type you're drawn to?

1034
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:55,528
My usual type.

1035
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:58,931
Can I be really honest?

1036
00:44:58,931 --> 00:45:00,366
Yeah, be completely honest.

1037
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,610
In the past, if I had to say,

1038
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:16,349
I think I mostly dated people like Tae In.

1039
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:17,183
But...

1040
00:45:17,984 --> 00:45:19,352
when I think about marriage,

1041
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,590
about marriage at my age
and looking further ahead,

1042
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:29,762
I think for a long time now...

1043
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:33,366
I've felt I should meet someone
with a personality like yours.

1044
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:35,034
I think I know what you mean.

1045
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:38,104
Do you?

1046
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:39,105
Yeah, a little.

1047
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:40,273
That's a relief.

1048
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:45,678
Still...

1049
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,848
How should I put it? It feels kind of...

1050
00:45:48,848 --> 00:45:50,116
Strange.

1051
00:45:50,116 --> 00:45:51,484
It didn't feel just purely good.

1052
00:45:52,118 --> 00:45:53,386
Because people say things like,

1053
00:45:53,386 --> 00:45:56,355
"This person is dating material,
that person is marriage material."

1054
00:45:56,355 --> 00:46:00,226
I'd honestly never actually
heard that in person.

1055
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:03,396
I don't think "marriage material"
was nice to hear.

1056
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:07,166
Since Tae In and I
are so different in nature,

1057
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:09,669
I can see
how someone might think that, though.

1058
00:46:12,004 --> 00:46:13,873
I'm definitely going to eat
Dubai chocolate with you.

1059
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:16,375
Dubai mochi bread?

1060
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:18,644
No way, really?

1061
00:46:19,178 --> 00:46:20,012
Chewy cookie.

1062
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,614
Chewy cookie.

1063
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:23,549
(Why are they reacting like this?)

1064
00:46:23,549 --> 00:46:24,350
This one...

1065
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,885
Dubai chocolate.

1066
00:46:25,885 --> 00:46:27,153
(First-come-first-served date on Day 2)

1067
00:46:27,153 --> 00:46:28,888
So I haven't tried the Dubai chocolate
donut, and it's driving me nuts.

1068
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:31,090
But on Instagram Explore,
it's all Dubai chocolate,

1069
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,725
Dubai towel chocolate cake,

1070
00:46:32,725 --> 00:46:33,793
And Dubai chewy pie.

1071
00:46:33,793 --> 00:46:34,494
Chewy pie.

1072
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,028
(Finally trying Dubai chocolate together)

1073
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:37,463
I've never seen Dubai mochi bread before.

1074
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:38,865
Me neither. This is my first time.

1075
00:46:38,865 --> 00:46:39,732
Right?

1076
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,067
This one first.

1077
00:46:42,602 --> 00:46:43,636
The brand new one.

1078
00:46:44,904 --> 00:46:45,705
Unbelievable.

1079
00:46:45,705 --> 00:46:46,572
Hold it and eat it.

1080
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,242
Tell me what you think first.

1081
00:46:52,445 --> 00:46:53,246
Good.

1082
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:55,581
I want to try it too.

1083
00:46:56,582 --> 00:46:57,350
I'm so happy.

1084
00:46:58,117 --> 00:46:59,318
The texture is amazing.

1085
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:07,660
You can really taste the kataifi.
I'm going to pass out.

1086
00:47:08,761 --> 00:47:10,863
If I pass out, what are you going to do?
Will you take care of me?

1087
00:47:10,863 --> 00:47:12,265
- No.
- You'd just leave me?

1088
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:14,267
I'd eat all of this.

1089
00:47:17,703 --> 00:47:19,172
I feel like I'm just eating nonstop.

1090
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,108
But we should savor it.

1091
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:22,875
Okay.

1092
00:47:26,846 --> 00:47:28,881
The Jin Joo I see is someone...

1093
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:30,249
who...

1094
00:47:30,249 --> 00:47:34,420
isn't overly expressive
or overly affectionate.

1095
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,888
She's that kind of person.

1096
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:38,224
But when she likes something,
she reacts like a little kid.

1097
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:40,727
Honestly, her expression was brighter
looking at that chocolate...

1098
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:43,429
than when she looks at me.

1099
00:47:44,797 --> 00:47:48,334
But somehow, those sides of Jin Joo...

1100
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,538
draw me in.

1101
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:57,910
There's this invisible chemistry,
something I can't really explain in words.

1102
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,913
He makes it sound so nice.

1103
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:04,550
- As expected of an SNU graduate.
- That was impressive.

1104
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,353
He said it so nicely. It's so persuasive.

1105
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:10,089
(Hyun Jin is sitting alone in her room.)

1106
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:11,958
- Hyun Jin.
- She couldn't go out?

1107
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,292
No one came to get her?

1108
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:17,263
Anyway, the last thing I saw...

1109
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:21,801
was that Jin Joo and Min Cheol
were on a date together.

1110
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:24,003
- Who's that?
- Jin Joo.

1111
00:48:24,003 --> 00:48:25,505
Jin Joo.

1112
00:48:25,738 --> 00:48:28,508
It looks like they coordinated
their outfits, right?

1113
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:29,575
- Top and bottom match.
- Yeah.

1114
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,744
That's wild.

1115
00:48:32,311 --> 00:48:36,315
I'm not sure if "disappointed"
is the right word,

1116
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:43,656
but I realized that Min Cheol's interest
in Jin Joo had grown.

1117
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:48,861
(After everyone's free dates end)

1118
00:48:49,028 --> 00:48:50,229
(Knock, knock)

1119
00:48:50,229 --> 00:48:50,997
Yes?

1120
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:53,933
(Someone comes to Jin Joo's room.)

1121
00:48:53,933 --> 00:48:54,700
What is it?

1122
00:48:55,268 --> 00:48:56,869
Stay here for just 15 seconds.

1123
00:48:57,403 --> 00:48:58,304
I want to show you something.

1124
00:48:59,572 --> 00:49:00,773
Is this some kind of surprise?

1125
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:02,108
What is he going to show her?

1126
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:05,711
What?

1127
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,385
(Min Cheol comes out holding flowers.)

1128
00:49:12,385 --> 00:49:14,287
They were the flowers she gave me...

1129
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:16,689
when she picked me
for the first-come-first-served date.

1130
00:49:18,057 --> 00:49:20,259
(On the morning of Day 2,
Jin Joo gave Min Cheol flowers.)

1131
00:49:20,259 --> 00:49:21,394
Am I getting these?

1132
00:49:22,328 --> 00:49:24,297
They wilted a bit along the way,

1133
00:49:25,264 --> 00:49:27,667
so I thought, "Let's save them,"
and put them in water.

1134
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:29,202
And they bloomed beautifully.

1135
00:49:29,202 --> 00:49:30,136
He brought them back to life.

1136
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:31,671
I really wanted to show them to Jin Joo.

1137
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:33,139
They're the flowers you gave me.

1138
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,407
Why are they blooming so beautifully?

1139
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:36,109
- That's sweet.
- I put them in water and they bloomed.

1140
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:38,010
Are you giving them to me?

1141
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,378
Yeah, you keep them now.

1142
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:42,982
What happens if I kill them?

1143
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:44,484
Then you're a murderer.

1144
00:49:47,487 --> 00:49:49,255
What's that noise outside?
Someone banging something?

1145
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:50,156
It's punishment day today.

1146
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:53,526
You're coming in, right? Come in.

1147
00:49:53,526 --> 00:49:54,660
Yeah.

1148
00:49:57,296 --> 00:50:01,000
I'm grateful, because honestly,
most people wouldn't even think...

1149
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,236
to try to save flowers like that.

1150
00:50:03,236 --> 00:50:04,937
He's so thoughtful.

1151
00:50:04,937 --> 00:50:07,540
And he's emotionally sensitive.

1152
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,008
It made me see him differently.

1153
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:11,511
I'm not that type at all.

1154
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:15,314
I'm the type who dries flowers out
and kills them.

1155
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:21,287
(Evening quietly arrives.)

1156
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:22,722
Let's go.

1157
00:50:24,624 --> 00:50:25,558
What's that?

1158
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:26,392
What's that?

1159
00:50:26,392 --> 00:50:27,160
Ramyun.

1160
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,861
- That's some good ramyun.
- Ramyun?

1161
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:29,729
What is this?

1162
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:30,830
Let's add it.

1163
00:50:32,432 --> 00:50:33,800
Please add the ramyun.

1164
00:50:34,767 --> 00:50:35,868
Just put it in?

1165
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:38,171
Should we add the seasoning too?

1166
00:50:38,604 --> 00:50:39,705
Yeah, add the seasoning.

1167
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,542
- This looks so good.
- Seriously.

1168
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:45,945
- I think it's ready now.
- That looks amazing.

1169
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:46,746
Let's go.

1170
00:50:47,747 --> 00:50:48,948
That looks so good.
I was really craving ramyun.

1171
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:49,916
Who wants the egg?

1172
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:51,050
- Me.
- Okay.

1173
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,218
Thank you.

1174
00:50:52,218 --> 00:50:53,586
I've never seen you
speak up like that before.

1175
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,022
Good work, and thank you for the meal.

1176
00:50:56,022 --> 00:50:57,123
Thank you for the meal.

1177
00:50:57,123 --> 00:50:58,124
Thank you.

1178
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:00,793
Even if you cook it a bit longer,
the noodles stay springy.

1179
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:01,627
So springy.

1180
00:51:01,627 --> 00:51:03,896
The broth is really rich.

1181
00:51:03,896 --> 00:51:04,964
Right?

1182
00:51:04,964 --> 00:51:07,100
What kind of noodles are these?
They're so chewy.

1183
00:51:08,534 --> 00:51:10,570
(Ramyun frenzy)

1184
00:51:10,837 --> 00:51:12,872
Hey, didn't you say
you were supposed to cut back on carbs?

1185
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:13,773
I'm doomed.

1186
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:17,677
(After dinner)

1187
00:51:18,511 --> 00:51:19,679
(Eun Na Rae and Han Gyeol
go out for a walk.)

1188
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,013
I'm kind of...

1189
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,251
lost in my thoughts.

1190
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:26,252
You've been thinking a lot?

1191
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:28,221
I figured you might be, so I came.

1192
00:51:29,122 --> 00:51:30,123
Want to have a beer?

1193
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:30,957
Sure.

1194
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:37,096
I don't know, everything just feels
kind of difficult for me.

1195
00:51:37,096 --> 00:51:39,465
It does. It's hard for me too.

1196
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:42,835
Did you not have fun today? I did.

1197
00:51:42,835 --> 00:51:45,138
To be honest,
I didn't really have that much fun.

1198
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:47,874
- Just...
- Why not?

1199
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:52,879
I don't know how it felt for you,
but I felt really comfortable.

1200
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:56,015
But...

1201
00:51:56,015 --> 00:51:57,450
just comfortable, and nothing else.

1202
00:51:58,718 --> 00:52:00,153
That's how it felt to me.

1203
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:02,789
By comfortable,

1204
00:52:04,023 --> 00:52:06,659
do you mean it's because
you don't find me attractive?

1205
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:09,062
Well,

1206
00:52:10,029 --> 00:52:12,165
what I'm trying to say is
that there's no tension.

1207
00:52:12,799 --> 00:52:15,401
It felt like the spark between a man
and a woman was a bit lacking.

1208
00:52:16,602 --> 00:52:19,305
That was how it felt to me.

1209
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,841
- That can happen.
- Yeah.

1210
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:26,946
But by my standards,

1211
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:29,749
today was the most fun.

1212
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:33,352
They felt it differently.

1213
00:52:34,787 --> 00:52:40,293
I like someone I can date comfortably.

1214
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:41,794
Yeah.

1215
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:45,198
But I thought you felt the same way I did.

1216
00:52:45,198 --> 00:52:46,899
So I'm kind of surprised right now.

1217
00:52:46,899 --> 00:52:48,301
I'm really surprised too.

1218
00:52:48,301 --> 00:52:49,235
Really?

1219
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:51,270
So you thought I didn't feel that way?
Did you think...

1220
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:53,773
I thought you felt pretty similarly.

1221
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:57,443
Did you think I acted that way
because I wasn't that interested?

1222
00:52:57,443 --> 00:52:58,277
Yeah.

1223
00:52:58,277 --> 00:52:59,145
- Really?
- Yeah.

1224
00:52:59,145 --> 00:53:00,513
Actually,

1225
00:53:01,314 --> 00:53:04,617
I think that's how I act
when I like someone.

1226
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:07,954
I see. I had no idea at all.

1227
00:53:07,954 --> 00:53:09,021
Really?

1228
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:10,957
If we hadn't talked about it,
I wouldn't have known.

1229
00:53:10,957 --> 00:53:13,126
(Eun Na Rae thought
the comfort came from indifference.)

1230
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:14,961
I said I wanted to spend...

1231
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:18,898
most of the remaining time with you.

1232
00:53:21,367 --> 00:53:22,468
That makes me shy.

1233
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:24,537
I did say that.

1234
00:53:25,438 --> 00:53:27,707
Maybe we don't even need
to talk about practical things yet.

1235
00:53:27,707 --> 00:53:30,343
Before that, we should talk more
about things like this.

1236
00:53:30,343 --> 00:53:32,011
What kind of practical things
do you want to talk about?

1237
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:36,249
Your mother told me...

1238
00:53:36,816 --> 00:53:40,787
that you don't really have much saved up.

1239
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:42,688
"You don't really have much saved up."

1240
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:44,090
And...

1241
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:47,760
that you kind of lack financial awareness.

1242
00:53:49,662 --> 00:53:50,863
Like investing and things like that...

1243
00:53:50,863 --> 00:53:51,898
My mom really went there.

1244
00:53:52,465 --> 00:53:53,666
- Are you okay?
- This is driving me crazy.

1245
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:55,234
But honestly, it's not completely wrong.

1246
00:53:55,234 --> 00:53:55,935
I mean, yeah.

1247
00:53:55,935 --> 00:53:58,071
But it depends on
how you define the criteria.

1248
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:01,340
Then if we got married,
could you live on an allowance?

1249
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,141
I could.

1250
00:54:02,141 --> 00:54:03,476
I'm not really
that kind of person, though.

1251
00:54:03,476 --> 00:54:04,644
That would actually be ideal.

1252
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,546
- I'd love that.
- Why?

1253
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:08,448
I love living within a fixed budget.

1254
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:11,184
If you told me to manage all the money...

1255
00:54:12,485 --> 00:54:13,719
I don't think I could let you do that.

1256
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:15,922
- No, I'm actually really confident.
- Really?

1257
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:17,423
What I'm confident about...

1258
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:19,559
is saving.

1259
00:54:19,826 --> 00:54:21,127
But for me,

1260
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:24,030
my income is not very high right now.

1261
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:25,765
Since my earnings aren't that big...

1262
00:54:26,532 --> 00:54:28,401
I've always thought my partner...

1263
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:31,104
should be someone who works.

1264
00:54:31,904 --> 00:54:35,208
But honestly,
if income fluctuates this much,

1265
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:38,010
from my perspective,
it can start to feel like...

1266
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:42,248
doing housework at home
is actually more valuable...

1267
00:54:42,248 --> 00:54:45,852
in terms of creating value.

1268
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:47,086
But saying something like that...

1269
00:54:49,288 --> 00:54:51,224
right to her face?

1270
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:54,694
Are you saying
you want a stay-at-home spouse?

1271
00:54:55,228 --> 00:54:56,229
What I mean is...

1272
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:59,165
This is definitely something
that could make someone angry.

1273
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:01,734
It's something
that could feel really offensive.

1274
00:55:01,734 --> 00:55:03,770
Because it can sound...

1275
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,639
like he's completely dismissing
someone's entire career.

1276
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:09,842
The moment you say it,
it's automatically a minus.

1277
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:13,946
Are you saying
you want a stay-at-home spouse?

1278
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:15,348
What I mean is...

1279
00:55:15,815 --> 00:55:17,984
I'm asking whether it's possible for you.

1280
00:55:17,984 --> 00:55:19,218
To be blunt.

1281
00:55:21,687 --> 00:55:23,356
For a few years.

1282
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:26,926
Maybe I could do that.

1283
00:55:26,926 --> 00:55:27,927
- You could?
- Yeah.

1284
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:29,295
Really?

1285
00:55:29,295 --> 00:55:32,532
I don't think I can say...

1286
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,902
it would be absolutely impossible.

1287
00:55:37,904 --> 00:55:39,605
I'd never thought about it before,

1288
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:45,378
but I'm thinking about it now
because I'm taking this that seriously.

1289
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:49,082
That's why I'm even thinking
about things like this.

1290
00:55:49,082 --> 00:55:51,017
Honestly,
even couples who've dated for a year...

1291
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,820
don't usually talk about things like this.

1292
00:55:54,987 --> 00:55:56,122
Most couples.

1293
00:55:56,722 --> 00:55:58,324
Unless they're right on the verge
of marriage.

1294
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:00,259
Why am I sitting so formally right now?

1295
00:56:01,661 --> 00:56:02,862
(Holding her hand)

1296
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:04,597
- Should we go?
- I...

1297
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:06,699
haven't saved much.

1298
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:12,905
I grew way more interested in him
after that talk.

1299
00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:14,173
(What?)

1300
00:56:14,173 --> 00:56:16,075
Wait, what?

1301
00:56:16,075 --> 00:56:17,176
What is this?

1302
00:56:19,545 --> 00:56:22,515
(The group is shocked
by the unexpected answer.)

1303
00:56:22,515 --> 00:56:23,816
I'm honestly so shocked right now.

1304
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:24,884
I mean...

1305
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:27,220
This kind of plot twist...

1306
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,154
I'm genuinely in shock.

1307
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:30,757
To be honest,
I was even a little angry at first.

1308
00:56:30,757 --> 00:56:32,658
- No.
- "He's even saying that?"

1309
00:56:32,658 --> 00:56:35,261
It's completely understandable
to see it that way,

1310
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:38,965
because you could think, "This guy is
taking our relationship that seriously."

1311
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:41,501
You really could see it that way.

1312
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:42,735
(Unable to process)

1313
00:56:42,735 --> 00:56:44,570
Sorry, just a second.

1314
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,806
This is more shocking...

1315
00:56:48,408 --> 00:56:49,575
than "Divorce Camp."

1316
00:56:49,575 --> 00:56:51,043
Honestly, recently,

1317
00:56:51,043 --> 00:56:53,045
out of everything I've been filming,

1318
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:55,348
this scene right now...

1319
00:56:58,151 --> 00:56:59,685
has shocked me the most.

1320
00:57:01,754 --> 00:57:03,790
There's not much
that surprises me anymore,

1321
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,759
since I've seen all kinds of things.

1322
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:08,294
I usually don't get shocked easily.

1323
00:57:09,228 --> 00:57:11,898
But this is the most shocked I've been
in a long time.

1324
00:57:11,898 --> 00:57:13,566
(Eun Na Rae's way of thinking
even shocks Jang Hoon.)

1325
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:17,970
This person...

1326
00:57:18,671 --> 00:57:21,574
I grew way more interested in him
after that talk.

1327
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:24,510
The way he tries
to immediately resolve conflict...

1328
00:57:25,244 --> 00:57:28,281
after listening...

1329
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:32,518
and responding as rationally
and logically as possible...

1330
00:57:33,152 --> 00:57:34,087
felt kind of...

1331
00:57:34,787 --> 00:57:36,456
very manly.

1332
00:57:36,856 --> 00:57:38,691
Unbelievable.

1333
00:57:42,762 --> 00:57:44,030
So I thought,

1334
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:48,134
"Wait, he's kind of cool. He's a man."

1335
00:57:48,134 --> 00:57:51,504
That's honestly how it felt.

1336
00:57:51,504 --> 00:57:53,139
I think it's possible to see it that way.

1337
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:54,874
He's much younger,

1338
00:57:55,308 --> 00:57:58,277
but he's seriously thinking
about their relationship...

1339
00:57:58,277 --> 00:58:02,081
all the way through marriage
and beyond that.

1340
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:05,485
If Eun Na Rae likes it, I'm happy for her.

1341
00:58:06,552 --> 00:58:09,822
The fact that she speaks honestly
even when it's difficult,

1342
00:58:10,523 --> 00:58:11,824
that she doesn't avoid the conversation.

1343
00:58:12,692 --> 00:58:14,360
I think that's a really good thing.

1344
00:58:15,194 --> 00:58:18,598
Being able to talk things through and
changing the circumstances are different.

1345
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:20,666
I also felt...

1346
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:25,338
like every possible conflict
was waiting ahead of us.

1347
00:58:26,305 --> 00:58:27,473
Unbelievable.

1348
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:29,642
That's incredible.

1349
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,146
(Late at night, Myo Jin and Se Hoon
head back to the lodging together.)

1350
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:34,013
You're tired, right?

1351
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,251
No. How should I put it?

1352
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:43,856
I don't know. You probably don't either,
but I really don't.

1353
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:48,061
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1354
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:59,472
(Somewhat awkward atmosphere
between the two)

1355
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:02,141
You're conflicted too, right?

1356
00:59:02,975 --> 00:59:03,776
Me?

1357
00:59:04,744 --> 00:59:05,812
Conflicted?

1358
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,648
I still don't feel any real certainty,

1359
00:59:09,482 --> 00:59:13,052
so I think I need some time
to find that certainty.

1360
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:17,156
What about you?

1361
00:59:17,156 --> 00:59:18,257
Me?

1362
00:59:18,257 --> 00:59:21,961
I'm a bit confused too.

1363
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:23,296
Actually,

1364
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:25,765
what I want to ask you is this.

1365
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:32,772
Among the people you're at least
a little drawn to, am I one of them?

1366
00:59:38,177 --> 00:59:41,314
For now,
the person I'm most curious about is you.

1367
00:59:41,314 --> 00:59:43,282
I'm curious,

1368
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:45,685
so I want to keep talking
and see where it goes.

1369
00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:47,887
I want to talk through the things
I'm curious about.

1370
00:59:47,887 --> 00:59:49,789
That's the kind of feeling it is.

1371
00:59:50,556 --> 00:59:53,192
Normally, for me,
saying "Let's talk more" would be easy,

1372
00:59:53,192 --> 00:59:55,728
but with you, somehow, it feels difficult.
Why do you think that is?

1373
00:59:56,562 --> 00:59:57,764
Are you really the same age as me?

1374
00:59:59,932 --> 01:00:01,367
It's difficult because she likes him.

1375
01:00:01,367 --> 01:00:03,069
If you don't like someone at all,

1376
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:05,204
- it'd be super easy.
- Yeah, it wouldn't be difficult.

1377
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:07,306
With Shin Gi Ru, for example,

1378
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:12,812
even when we're filming together,
I can joke around...

1379
01:00:12,812 --> 01:00:15,681
and say whatever,

1380
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:17,316
and I feel completely at ease.

1381
01:00:17,316 --> 01:00:18,217
I get it.

1382
01:00:18,551 --> 01:00:20,019
I'm curious about how you feel too.

1383
01:00:20,019 --> 01:00:23,756
When you look at me,
what kind of feelings do you have?

1384
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:26,059
Is it just a sense of stability?
Something like that?

1385
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:29,028
It's not really
a strong sense of stability.

1386
01:00:29,028 --> 01:00:30,463
Really?

1387
01:00:30,463 --> 01:00:33,032
- It doesn't exactly feel like stability.
- Because earlier,

1388
01:00:33,032 --> 01:00:34,967
the way I understood it
was that you were saying...

1389
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:38,438
I'm more like a marriage-type partner.

1390
01:00:38,438 --> 01:00:40,473
You know how women say,

1391
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:42,909
"This person is good for dating,
and this person is not."

1392
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:44,610
I meant you're my ideal type.

1393
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:49,282
Like the kind of future spouse
I ideally imagine.

1394
01:00:49,282 --> 01:00:54,053
I think you're pretty close to that.

1395
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,923
Then when you're with me,
do you feel butterflies?

1396
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,272
- That question makes my heart flutter.
- Straight to the point.

1397
01:01:00,272 --> 01:01:01,807
I felt butterflies when we were driving.

1398
01:01:03,475 --> 01:01:05,144
I felt them at the café too.

1399
01:01:05,144 --> 01:01:05,978
Really?

1400
01:01:07,646 --> 01:01:09,348
If I don't feel butterflies,
it really shows on my face.

1401
01:01:09,915 --> 01:01:11,050
- Really?
- Yeah.

1402
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:15,354
But since you don't really talk
about your feelings...

1403
01:01:15,354 --> 01:01:18,991
I honestly wanted to talk about it,
so I came to you first.

1404
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:21,660
But for me right now, it's kind of...

1405
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:25,864
I want us to banter comfortably,
back and forth.

1406
01:01:25,864 --> 01:01:27,633
But am I actually comfortable right now?

1407
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:28,600
I feel like I sort of am.

1408
01:01:30,002 --> 01:01:32,838
I also want to feel more at ease.
But somehow,

1409
01:01:33,772 --> 01:01:36,408
it feels like there's a bit of hesitation
on both sides.

1410
01:01:36,408 --> 01:01:37,843
Where do you think
that hesitation comes from?

1411
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:40,613
Because we're being cautious.

1412
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,747
Why are we being cautious?

1413
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:48,320
I worry that if you see the lighter,
more easygoing side of me,

1414
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,189
you might think less of me.

1415
01:01:51,557 --> 01:01:53,659
Then let's do this.

1416
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,197
Let's just go on a date tomorrow,

1417
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:04,169
because I don't want us
to leave any regrets.

1418
01:02:04,169 --> 01:02:07,973
Can we just go on a date
and follow wherever our hearts lead?

1419
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:08,874
We can.

1420
01:02:08,874 --> 01:02:10,309
Yeah, could we try it that way?

1421
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,477
Of course, why not?

1422
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,345
Let's just take it easy.

1423
01:02:13,345 --> 01:02:14,146
Yeah.

1424
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:15,981
We can.

1425
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:18,017
That works.

1426
01:02:18,017 --> 01:02:20,119
I think I'd like that.

1427
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:25,090
(Jin Joo heads somewhere.)

1428
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:27,526
What? Are you going to sleep?

1429
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:28,761
Are you going to sleep?

1430
01:02:28,761 --> 01:02:29,728
No, I'm just going to brush my teeth.

1431
01:02:30,596 --> 01:02:32,031
Should I wait outside?

1432
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:34,266
No, you can wait there.

1433
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:38,103
Things seem to be going well
between Jin Joo and Min Cheol too.

1434
01:02:38,103 --> 01:02:39,538
They suddenly feel lighter.

1435
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:40,973
Today actually feels okay.

1436
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:45,177
When do you like being with me the most?

1437
01:02:46,312 --> 01:02:48,080
I like it when it's just the two of us
in the car.

1438
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,214
- Just the two of us?
- Yeah.

1439
01:02:50,883 --> 01:02:52,418
- Because we can talk more comfortably?
- Yeah.

1440
01:02:53,752 --> 01:02:55,254
And one more thing.

1441
01:02:55,254 --> 01:02:57,256
We were talking among the women,

1442
01:02:57,256 --> 01:03:01,060
and someone said you can tell
when men like someone just by their eyes.

1443
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,862
I felt something like that from your eyes.

1444
01:03:04,296 --> 01:03:06,565
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong,

1445
01:03:07,833 --> 01:03:10,135
but when it was just the two of us,
I felt that.

1446
01:03:11,603 --> 01:03:13,272
And I think that's when I started
to feel more certain about you.

1447
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:16,275
I liked that.

1448
01:03:19,178 --> 01:03:22,581
But did you talk properly
with both your first choice...

1449
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:24,550
and your second choice?

1450
01:03:25,317 --> 01:03:26,919
I did. I talked with them enough.

1451
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,054
I think it's important
to talk things through.

1452
01:03:30,422 --> 01:03:32,024
You think I need to talk more?

1453
01:03:33,892 --> 01:03:35,227
- What about you?
- Me?

1454
01:03:36,328 --> 01:03:39,965
I don't think I'd be the one
to create the situation first.

1455
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:42,768
But with me,
you did create that situation.

1456
01:03:42,768 --> 01:03:45,270
I only did that with you.

1457
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:49,441
I really like this unpolished,
natural side of you.

1458
01:03:51,176 --> 01:03:53,279
Show me more of your unfiltered side too.

1459
01:03:59,451 --> 01:04:04,290
(Day 5,
The second morning without the mothers)

1460
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:06,859
Where did the women go?

1461
01:04:06,859 --> 01:04:09,495
I don't know. Are they talking separately?

1462
01:04:10,296 --> 01:04:12,498
(A sudden notification sounds
through the house.)

1463
01:04:12,498 --> 01:04:16,001
We will now begin the men's choice date.

1464
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,506
Men, please stand next to the woman...

1465
01:04:20,506 --> 01:04:23,309
you would like to go on a date with.

1466
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:28,213
It's the men's choice date today.

1467
01:04:29,882 --> 01:04:32,184
But I think it's better to be chosen
than to choose.

1468
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:33,886
Having to decide is work too.

1469
01:04:33,886 --> 01:04:35,187
Still, getting zero votes would hurt.

1470
01:04:36,588 --> 01:04:39,291
I'm suddenly nervous. Why is that?

1471
01:04:41,093 --> 01:04:42,761
I kind of want to put a hat on.

1472
01:04:42,761 --> 01:04:43,796
You're unsettled.

1473
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:50,636
(The men hesitate
before making their choices.)

1474
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:59,445
(First, Kim Hyun Jun)

1475
01:05:00,446 --> 01:05:05,951
(Hyun Jun walks forward
without hesitation.)

1476
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:10,022
Was it the left side?

1477
01:05:10,723 --> 01:05:11,724
The left?

1478
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:16,495
(Kim Hyun Jun chooses Kim Tae In.)

1479
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:23,836
(Second, Jang Min Cheol)

1480
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:26,405
From what I see,

1481
01:05:26,405 --> 01:05:28,140
it feels like Min Cheol
would go to Jin Joo.

1482
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,175
I think he'll go to Hyun Jin.

1483
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:33,279
Will it be Jin Joo or Hyun Jin?

1484
01:05:36,815 --> 01:05:41,787
(Kim Hyun Jin or Kim Jin Joo)

1485
01:05:41,787 --> 01:05:44,957
(Who will Jang Min Cheol choose?)

1486
01:05:49,595 --> 01:05:51,030
- She's surprised.
- She's surprised.

1487
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:52,631
Looks like he went to Hyun Jin.

1488
01:05:52,631 --> 01:05:54,166
Seems so.

1489
01:05:57,786 --> 01:06:02,925
(Jang Min Cheol chooses Kim Hyun Jin.)

1490
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:04,693
He went to Hyun Jin.

1491
01:06:04,693 --> 01:06:07,062
Of all places, right next to her.

1492
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:13,903
This is so funny.

1493
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,575
I had two things on my mind.

1494
01:06:20,175 --> 01:06:23,779
First, before going to Jin Joo,

1495
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:26,682
I wondered how certain I really was
about my feelings.

1496
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:30,185
And my memories with Hyun Jin
were really good too.

1497
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:33,556
I wanted to check whether there was
anything I might be overlooking.

1498
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:35,457
I wanted to confirm
how I feel about Hyun Jin.

1499
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:43,365
I kind of expected it, honestly.

1500
01:06:43,365 --> 01:06:47,069
When we talked yesterday, we said if
there's someone else we're curious about,

1501
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:49,905
we should get to know them too.

1502
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:52,474
So it wasn't completely unexpected.

1503
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,311
And I understand it.

1504
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,646
But still, it was hard.

1505
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:07,423
(Third, Seo Han Gyeol)

1506
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:13,362
(Who will Seo Han Gyeol choose?)

1507
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,867
(Seo Han Gyeol chooses Cho Eun Na Rae.)

1508
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:19,802
Did you sleep well?

1509
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:21,770
You look pretty today.

1510
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:24,506
He said she looks pretty today.

1511
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,409
As expected, he went to Eun Na Rae.

1512
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:30,913
Did you not expect this today too?

1513
01:07:33,515 --> 01:07:34,550
Did you or not?

1514
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,753
I wasn't sure.

1515
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:38,888
- You weren't sure?
- Yeah.

1516
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,322
You always say you're not sure.

1517
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,523
They seem to suit each other really well.

1518
01:07:41,523 --> 01:07:44,860
They really look cute together.

1519
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,929
I thought he would come,

1520
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:50,466
but while I was waiting, I got so nervous.

1521
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:53,269
"What if he doesn't come?"

1522
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:58,340
So I was really, really happy
and relieved when he came.

1523
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,512
- Are you still not sure yet?
- Yeah.

1524
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:04,813
- Even at this moment?
- Yeah.

1525
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:13,656
When you choose,
is it one person per person?

1526
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,858
So no overlapping choices?

1527
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:17,359
This?
I don't think they mentioned that.

1528
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,694
- They didn't say that?
- They didn't.

1529
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,899
- That must be so nerve-racking right now.
- Yeah.

1530
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:30,472
(Fourth, Lee Seung Hak)

1531
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,908
(Grins)

1532
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,445
- Hi.
- Hi.

1533
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,147
(Lee Seung Hak chooses Kim Myo Jin.)

1534
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:39,615
Denim on denim today.

1535
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,416
Yeah.

1536
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:42,384
Here too.

1537
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:43,719
Seung Hak too.

1538
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:46,055
- Seung Hak has been single-minded too.
- Yes.

1539
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:47,923
Did you sleep well?

1540
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:48,891
Yeah.

1541
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,927
I slept with earplugs in,

1542
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:54,897
so I didn't hear my alarm...

1543
01:08:54,897 --> 01:08:56,699
and woke up after eight.

1544
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,134
Is that why things got delayed?

1545
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,636
Sorry.

1546
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,738
- No, just kidding.
- I'll apologize.

1547
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:07,776
Se Hoon.

1548
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:13,315
It all depends on who Se Hoon chooses.

1549
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:23,192
(Last, Moon Se Hoon)

1550
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:27,229
(Turn)

1551
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:32,935
Goodness.

1552
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:40,042
(Who will Moon Se Hoon choose?)

1553
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,977
On Match to Marry: With Parents,

1554
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:45,481
we are looking for people who want to find
a match together with their parents.

1555
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:48,617
Please don't hesitate to apply below.

1556
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,619
We look forward to your applications.

1557
01:09:51,253 --> 01:09:53,122
(The contestants head out on dates
chosen by the men.)

1558
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,524
- You're here.
- Hello.

1559
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,726
(And the mothers' surprise appearance)

1560
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:59,461
You should've let us go on dates too.

1561
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,197
Why did you make us do matchmaking?

1562
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:03,699
(An unexpected meeting
between mothers as well begins)

1563
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,769
Hyun Jin is actually
very good with adults.

1564
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,370
My son is a great cook.

1565
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:09,772
Tomorrow would be fine,

1566
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,440
or even next month.

1567
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:14,310
I started wondering
if this was really right.

1568
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:15,177
If it's about age...

1569
01:10:15,177 --> 01:10:16,946
I said I'd talk about that, didn't I?

1570
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:18,414
This feels off.

1571
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,716
I think, in the end,
the problem might be me.

1572
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,751
(Entangled relationships
ahead of the final choice)

1573
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:23,886
Is it complicated?

1574
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,921
Honestly, I think it is.

1575
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:27,289
Still complicated?

1576
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,991
I feel like it doesn't have to be anymore.

1577
01:10:29,792 --> 01:10:30,726
Are you crying?

1578
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,261
What's even going on?

1579
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,762
