00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:11,080
[Lake] You said it

188
00:14:11,163 --> 00:14:12,748
Don&#39;t give up

189
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:20,381
help me

190
00:14:23,342 --> 00:14:24,301
of course

191
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,513
[Sooyoung] I already have a method in mind.

192
00:14:29,264 --> 00:14:31,308
[Chasing the sound of rain]

193
00:14:34,353 --> 00:14:36,188
[Hosu] Are you going to find Yoo Seong-pil?

194
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,606
[heavy music]

195
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:40,317
The consultant Yoo Seong-pil, played by Choi Gun-woo?

196
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:41,610
[Sooyoung] Yes

197
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,364
Because that will be Choi Gun-woo’s decisive weakness.

198
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:47,825
[sigh]

199
00:14:47,908 --> 00:14:50,327
What and how do you find that person?

200
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,912
I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s dead or alive

201
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:53,414
dead

202
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:55,582
[Sooyoung] To be exact, I killed him.

203
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,042
Choi Geon-woo

204
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,799
[Lake] How do you know that?

205
00:15:05,217 --> 00:15:06,593
Are you sure?

206
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,430
I found it

207
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:12,808
[Sooyoung] Witnesses who secured decisive evidence

208
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,476
[Meaningful music]

209
00:15:15,185 --> 00:15:17,187
[Sooyoung] Please share one weakness.

210
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:19,106
[Geonwoo] What does that mean?

211
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,275
[Suyeong] Seohosu is in full swing

212
00:15:21,358 --> 00:15:23,902
I need it to get him out of school.

213
00:15:24,486 --> 00:15:26,530
I&#39;ll say I found it

214
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:29,783
But there&#39;s just one thing I regret

215
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:31,702
I guess I should go out in person

216
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:34,038
I&#39;m going to say I need to find out.

217
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,666
[Geon-woo] Will he come out obediently?

218
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,252
what

219
00:15:41,712 --> 00:15:45,466
It will depend on how critical the weakness is.

220
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:48,135
So, pass over my weaknesses?

221
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:49,553
[Swimming] No

222
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:50,971
It can be fake

223
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,515
There are plausible circumstances

224
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,269
If only I could fool you

225
00:15:58,103 --> 00:15:59,104
[laughter]

226
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:03,942
[Hosu] But the timing is a little too good.

227
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:07,237
I suddenly have a student who offers to give me information.

228
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:08,947
[Meaningful music]

229
00:16:09,031 --> 00:16:09,990
[Suyeong] Why?

230
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:13,911
Are you anxious?

231
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:16,830
If you don&#39;t believe me

232
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:18,582
I can go out alone

233
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,292
no

234
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,752
How can I go alone?

235
00:16:21,835 --> 00:16:22,920
Let&#39;s go together

236
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,547
Anyway, if it stays like this

237
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,674
Even if I stay still, I die

238
00:16:28,258 --> 00:16:29,760
I should try something

239
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:32,554
of course

240
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:34,431
[Lake] I should try it

241
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,683
You&#39;re trying to protect me

242
00:16:41,146 --> 00:16:42,606
[Sooyoung] I’ll go first

243
00:16:42,689 --> 00:16:45,400
- I&#39;ll stop by the bathroom and then go. - [Hosu] Yes.

244
00:16:47,027 --> 00:16:48,153
[Meaningful sound effects]

245
00:16:48,237 --> 00:16:49,905
[Steps moving away]

246
00:16:51,573 --> 00:16:53,575
[Geonwoo] Did the West Lake go over?

247
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,953
[Swimming] Yes, it was easy?

248
00:16:58,372 --> 00:17:00,249
[Geonwoo] It looks like you trust Sooyoung a lot.

249
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,919
Then, as soon as you hand over Seo Ho-su,

250
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:07,172
I will tell you the address where Minyoung is located.

251
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,424
[Sooyoung] But before that

252
00:17:09,508 --> 00:17:11,176
Let me make one thing clear.

253
00:17:12,344 --> 00:17:14,471
This is the place where Minyoung is.

254
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:17,307
What if I go and it’s not there?

255
00:17:17,808 --> 00:17:19,226
How can you believe that?

256
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,352

Why do I lie?

Use me again or whatever you do

260
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:30,195
You can threaten me with Minyoung.

[Meaningful music]

262
00:17:32,197 --> 00:17:34,366
Ah, um

263
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,370
[Geonwoo sighs] Let’s think about it.

264
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,707
What value is Sooyoung without a chef?

265
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,168
Should I take advantage of your weaknesses?

266
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:46,253
- [Interesting and suspenseful music] - Minyoung?

267
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:48,172
It&#39;s just a burden to me

268
00:17:48,255 --> 00:17:50,674
The moment I catch the chef, I won&#39;t have him around anymore.

269
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:52,968
There is no need or reason

270
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,094
Isn&#39;t it?

271
00:17:56,388 --> 00:17:57,556
Yes

272
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:05,230
[Geonwoo] What value is Sooyoung without a chef?

273
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:06,690

[Kyunglim] I heard it

278
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,714
I heard you told teacher Seongpil that you were still thinking about it?

279
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,675
So

280
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,596
[Suyeong] Does that mean I can go to all the universities here?

281
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,015
[Kyunglim] Then, of course

282
00:18:40,098 --> 00:18:43,143
Is there a university that top students from Jeonghan High School can&#39;t go to?

283
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,103
So let me know

No matter what you had at school

300

That&#39;s not more important than Minyoung.

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:20,378
Are you saying we&#39;re just going to live like we do now?

364
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:23,131
What&#39;s wrong with that?

365
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,050
To other kids, it&#39;s just everyday life.

366
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:46,947
[Students laughing]

367
00:23:47,614 --> 00:23:49,616
[Sooyoung] Let’s take a picture of friendship today

368
00:23:50,867 --> 00:23:52,577
The weather is nice too

369
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,502
- [Upbeat music] - [Students] Smile, smile

370
00:24:00,585 --> 00:24:01,795

373
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:07,676

[camera shutter sound]

390
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:44,838
[Dahyun] You two are dating

391
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:48,258
How about taking a sweet photo like a couple?

392
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:51,928
Ah, ah, no, no, it&#39;s over.

393
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,180
Let’s just take a quick picture and get into it [laughter]

394
00:24:56,057 --> 00:24:58,310
[Jinwoo] Hey, who is doing V?

395
00:24:59,644 --> 00:25:00,687
Look at me

396
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:03,106
I have to do it like this

397
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,192
your left hand, me right hand

398
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:08,445
[Sooyoung laughs] What are you saying?

399
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:11,656
[Sooyoung clears her throat]

400
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,824
[Dahyun] Filming?

401

[camera shutter sound]

402
00:25:14,868 --> 00:25:16,453
Okay, now it&#39;s the last time

One, two, three

404
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:19,831
[camera shutter sound]

405
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,297
[Heejin] Eunseo Lee, what on earth is she doing?

406
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:31,301
[Lake] I think you are taking a picture?

407
00:25:31,384 --> 00:25:33,053
Are you asking because I don&#39;t know that?

408
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,431
[Heejin] No, why are you acting like that when it’s raining?

409
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:38,725
[Hosu] I guess my friends asked me to take a picture.

410
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:43,563
[Heejin] If you just look

411
00:25:43,646 --> 00:25:45,648
Do you know that she&#39;s secretly suffering from princess disease?

412
00:25:46,608 --> 00:25:48,234
I just stand in the center because it’s pretty

413
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:52,489
Is that a compliment?

414
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,158
no it&#39;s not

415
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:08,713
[nervous music]

416
00:26:09,756 --> 00:26:11,007
[Geonwoo] Are you doing well?

417
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:12,384
[Tap sound]

418
00:26:13,635 --> 00:26:15,845
Why is the teacher here…

419
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,263
[Laughing] Hey

420
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:19,349
Why are you here, teacher? Huh?

421
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:20,850
[Geonwoo] It’s a classroom.

422
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:21,976
Ah, guys

423
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,687
Well, something happened suddenly today.

424
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:27,148
There was a consulting class in the 5th period.

425
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:28,942
It was changed to Korean

426
00:26:29,025 --> 00:26:31,027
Why don&#39;t you talk to your friends who aren&#39;t in class?

427
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,654
- [Students] Yes - [Geonwoo] Yes

428
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:36,157
[Geonwoo laughs slightly]

429
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:37,700
Lake, see you again

430
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:50,713
[Suyeong] If possible, please come to the classroom.

431
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:53,550
The lake must be blinded by revenge right away.

432
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:56,845
I will try to get out of school somehow.

433
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:59,556
[Geonwoo] Do you think you have a lot of resentment towards the chef?

434
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,683
but

435
00:27:01,766 --> 00:27:04,310
It was too much to lie that I could wake Minyoung up.

436
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,813
You&#39;re lucky

437
00:27:07,397 --> 00:27:09,107
[Suyeong] I wish it was a little later

438
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:12,068
I might not have been able to get past Seo Lake back then.

439
00:27:15,655 --> 00:27:18,158
- [Dark music] - [Chairman] It&#39;s a shame.

440
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,952
I wanted to kill you in front of you

441
00:27:24,372 --> 00:27:25,748
I

442
00:27:25,832 --> 00:27:28,376
I guess I couldn&#39;t control the water.

443
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,336
I died too easily

444
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,840
Like the flowers planted in the flower garden last time

445
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,968
Can you please check?

446
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:39,053
[Chairman] Check it out.

447
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,014
Because the smell is so bad

448
00:27:41,097 --> 00:27:43,183
&#39;Cause I just can&#39;t go

449
00:27:54,736 --> 00:27:56,321
[Emphasized sound effect]

450
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:04,287
[Chief Heo] If our Geon-woo waits, well, we should wait.

451
00:28:04,996 --> 00:28:06,122
[Chairman] And this

452
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:08,291
This is the cell phone he used.

453
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:10,919
I brought it separately to give it to you.

454
00:28:11,002 --> 00:28:12,086
Because it&#39;s locked

455
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:14,714
- I didn&#39;t open it separately - [Meaningful music]

456
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:29,145
now

457
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,314
Please hand over the chef.

458
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,485
[dark music]

yes

466
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:00,635
I even checked my phone

467
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,304
The chef

468
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,182
I will take you there myself tomorrow evening.

[Washing machine operating sound]

470
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:15,525
[Aunt] Perhaps

471
00:29:15,608 --> 00:29:18,611
What will you do if you find out who the chef is?

472
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:21,197
[aunt’s laughter]

473
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,448
Just like you did to me

as much as possible

477
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,920
I need to take revenge more cruelly.

478
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:40,633

[breathing in relief]

483
00:29:57,984 --> 00:29:59,652
[Suyeong] But for about a day

484
00:30:00,361 --> 00:30:01,446
today

485
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:04,407
If it&#39;s the same day

486
00:30:05,742 --> 00:30:07,911
I think the chef would be grateful.

487
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,084
[Aunt] You know that?

488
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:18,046
Have you almost reached your sales target number of customers?

489
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:22,508
[Sooyoung] Already?

490
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:24,135
[Aunt] Oh

491
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:27,639
I&#39;m thinking of talking to the chef today.

492
00:30:27,722 --> 00:30:29,724
Now wake Choi Minyoung up.

493
00:30:29,807 --> 00:30:33,353
How about sending you out of school too?

494
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,814
The timing is just right.

- I&#39;m your older sister - [Sigh]

00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,472
you are my younger brother

00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:32,954
This place is too much for me

00:31:56,811 --> 00:31:57,854
today

515
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:02,442
I got caught in too much rain

516
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,321
[Sooyoung] So

517
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:10,658
Will you come to my sister’s dream today?

I can&#39;t sleep

Well, I&#39;m nervous too

[Lake] Of course I’m looking forward to it.

If only this thing goes well

532
00:32:52,283 --> 00:32:54,535
Choi Gun-woo is also completely finished.

533
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:58,581
We are finally liberated

Why are you so naive?

00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,130
[Lake] Huh?

536
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,760
[Suyeong] Is it the end? Is it liberation?
