00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,517
Damn it!

3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,728
Damn it, shut up already.

4
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,730
Shut up!

5
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,609
Min Young

6
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,527
How are you?

7
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:12,947
Shut up!

8
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,075
You're not my sister.

9
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,202
Min Young

10
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,286
How are you?

11
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,083
I don't want to wake up.

12
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,771
My sister

13
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,273
My sister

14
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,651
She doesn't think about me.

15
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,444
I'm worried.

16
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,780
She's just like that.

17
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,117
She only cares about herself.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,243
Min Young

19
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,620
How are you?

20
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,957
My sister should be like this.

21
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,437
Min Young

22
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,818
How are you?

23
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,781
What about you?

24
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,827
How are you?

25
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,955
Even when we're like this.

26
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,583
Even when I bother you.

27
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,628
Even when I give you a hard time.

28
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,090
Are you still not mad at me?

29
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,767
Min Young

30
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,730
How are you?

31
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,567
That's right.

32
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,903
It's you.

33
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,008
So I don't have a problem either.

34
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,509
How about Min Young?

35
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,638
He's fine.

36
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:08,057
I'll send you a picture now.

37
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,226
Wait a minute.

38
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,016
Nowadays, the kids say that

39
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,894
If they become close to you, they study well.

40
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,230
So they should become close to you.

41
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,732
What bullshit!

42
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,484
That's why I told them

43
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,152
She's on the other side.

44
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,571
Something is fishy about her.

45
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,657
And I'm sure she's up to something.

46
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,205
Exactly, what am I doing?

47
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,665
I'm trying to find out.

48
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,125
Just by finding out.

49
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,503
I'll kick you out of school.

50
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,547
...but before that, I'll give you a warning.

51
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,715
Midterm exams are coming up.

52
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,634
Don't even think about it.

53
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,387
It's a matter of life and death for me.

54
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,111
Your damn life is so easy, right?

55
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,656
Do you think you can have whatever you want?

56
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,324
Don't be mistaken.

57
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,994
If I decide, there's nothing you can do.

58
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,249
You'll hear good news soon.

59
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,554
Su Ho Soo

60
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,973
Huh?

61
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,725
Aunt wants to ask you something.

62
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,731
What?

63
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,816
We haven't seen her in a long time.

64
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,736
We saw her in the laundry room too.

65
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,904
Yeah.

66
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,781
What question do you have?

67
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,683
I think Shef can't answer now.

68
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,359
Can you explain?

69
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,487
Why the previous Sunday?

70
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,865
Li Won Soo told the customers

71
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,617
Should we go to your house?

72
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,035
And at that particular moment?

73
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,829
Which particular moment?

74
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,420
Precisely the moment when Shef was in danger.

75
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,300
What are you saying?

76
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,636
Li Won Soo told the customers

77
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,348
To take a picture of you.

78
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,810
And bring out the student who is there.

79
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,355
Huh?

80
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,697
But Aunt

81
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,533
However you think about it, it doesn't make sense.

82
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,662
That this substitute is Shef.

83
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,331
Li Won Soo figured out Shef's identity

84
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,085
But she's still alive.

85
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,547
They just had a meal together.

86
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,966
They go to class together.

87
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:00,845
They jump together.

88
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,931
Not for now.

89
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,647
But I think you should be careful with your words.

90
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,608
If Shef finds out

91
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,944
It will be bad for you.

92
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,479
Stop it!

93
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,606
We haven't seen each other in a long time.

94
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,247
Please be friends with me.

95
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,585
I took some tests yesterday.

96
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,254
I only got one correct.

97
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,131
What do you think I thought?

98
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,676
"Did I fail?"

99
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,971
"I'm relieved."

100
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,390
You became a positive thinker.

101
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:10,975
You said it yourself.

102
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,643
Don't worry, I won't give up.

103
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,276
Help me, please.

104
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,196
Definitely.

105
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,408
Actually, I have a plan.

106
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,083
Do you want to find Yoo Seung Pil?

107
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,212
Is it the same person who took Choi Gun Woo's place?

108
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,505
Yes.

109
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,259
Because that can be Choi Gun Woo's weakness.

110
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,222
How do you plan to find him?

111
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,807
We don't even know if he's alive or not.

112
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,309
Dead.

113
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,477
Actually, Choi Gun Woo...

114
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,937
He was killed.

115
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,694
How do you know?

116
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,488
Are you sure?

117
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,325
Because I found a witness.

118
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,703
I found solid evidence.

119
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,082
Tell me one of your weaknesses.

120
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,001
What do you mean?

121
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,170
So Hwa Soo is always at school.

122
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,797
I have to bring him out.

123
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,425
I'll tell him that I found him myself.

124
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,678
But I have to personally...

125
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,597
Go and investigate.

126
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,933
And make sure.

127
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,561
Do you think he will come with you?

128
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,147
Well...

129
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,361
It depends on how important that weakness is.

130
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,030
So you want me to tell you my weakness?

131
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,448
No.

132
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,866
Even if it's fake, it's okay.

133
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,410
But it has to be believable.

134
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,164
So that he falls for it.

135
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,837
But it's a little strange that...

136
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:07,132
A witness is found in these exact circumstances.

137
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:09,885
What is it?

138
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,806
Worried?

139
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,725
If you don't believe me...

140
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,477
I'll go alone.

141
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,187
No.

142
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,647
How can I let you go alone?

143
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,815
We should go together.

144
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,442
Because if we don't do something...

145
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,569
We'll die.

146
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,655
We have to try ourselves.

147
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,449
It's obvious.

148
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,326
We have to try ourselves.

149
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,578
You're doing this to protect me.

150
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,501
You go first.

151
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,295
I have to go to the bathroom.

152
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,470
Hwa Soo said he's coming?

153
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,848
Yeah, it was like drinking water for him.

154
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,144
He definitely trusts you a lot.

155
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,814
Just by handing over Hwa Soo to me...

156
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,067
I'll tell you where Min Young is.

157
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,319
But before that...

158
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,071
We have to make something clear.

159
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,366
If I go where you said, but...

160
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,202
Min Young is not there, then what?

161
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,121
How can I trust you?

162
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,668
Why should I lie to you?

163
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,046
So you can use me again.

164
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,090
And threaten me with it.

165
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,261
Umm...

166
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,265
Let's think about it this way.

167
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:41,602
Without Shve, what benefit do you have for me?

168
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,063
That I want to use your weakness against you?

169
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,148
Min Young.

170
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,067
He's just an extra for me.

171
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,569
Once I get Shve, I have nothing to do with him.

172
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,863
There's no reason to blink an eye on him.

173
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,989
Don't you agree?

174
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,451
That's right.

175
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:05,125
Without Shve, what benefit do you have for me?

176
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,585
That I want to use your weakness against you?

177
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,808
On that side.

178
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,185
Can we talk for a moment?

179
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,981
Mr. Yu said that...

180
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,609
You told him you're still considering it.

181
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,570
So...

182
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,491
Can I go to all these universities?

183
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,910
Of course.

184
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,038
Is there any university where top students like Jong Han can't go?

185
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,998
Then tell me.

186
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,959
Both students...

187
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,879
And teachers and parents are curious.

188
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,005
That's what you want.

189
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,217
Which field and university do you want to go to?

190
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,762
Anywhere it's possible.

191
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,431
Anywhere I can.

192
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,850
I'll go.

193
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,822
Don't hesitate anymore.

194
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,495
To get Min Young back.

195
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,164
You have to stay calm.

196
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,167
Just like how Hwa Soo fooled you.

197
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,335
You're also fooling yourself.

198
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,589
So don't feel guilty.

199
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,219
That's right.

200
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,389
Everything you had in this school.

201
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,100
None of them is more important than Min Young.

202
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,061
You're Min Young's sister.

203
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,481
And the only member of his family.

204
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,443
Well.

205
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,072
I'll go back to my old life, what could happen?

206
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,868
But still.

207
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,165
You had some really good things.

208
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,378
Nineteen years old.

209
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,671
Third year of high school.

210
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,009
You had everything for the first time, didn't you?

211
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,014
Don't say anything anymore.

212
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,394
Don't cry.

213
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,687
Don't show it.

214
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,731
It's not like that.

215
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,625
Smile.

216
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,116
On that side.

217
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,498
Where were you? You didn't answer your phone.

218
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,960
Why? Did something happen?

219
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,089
After midterms.

220
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,091
The day you had 200 days left until the college entrance exam.

221
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,968
Let's go out and take a friendly picture, shall we?

222
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,137
Yes. Let's go.

223
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,680
Let's go together.

224
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,516
I'll book a nice place I know.

225
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,066
Just a moment.

226
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,652
On that side, did you cry?

227
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,821
What happened? Why did you cry?

228
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,239
Did something happen?

229
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,325
Hey, why are you crying? - What happened? -

230
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,618
Who? Who made our dear one cry?

231
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,037
Why are you crying?

232
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,496
Are you okay? - Don't cry. -

233
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,670
If

234
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,006
They told you that you'll die tomorrow.

235
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,717
What would you do?

236
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,801
What is it?

237
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,055
Why don't you take a microphone and tell everyone that I have an incurable disease?

238
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,724
I'm sorry.

239
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,147
Well.

240
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,107
The dream I have when eating a cookie.

241
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,069
I'm trying to achieve it.

242
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,287
If the conditions

243
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,247
Are a bit complicated, so what?

244
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,041
Why should the conditions matter?

245
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,751
I'm supposed to die tomorrow.

246
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,341
It might be a bit difficult.

247
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,804
I still remember when

248
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,014
What was your dream?

249
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,808
Good clothes.

250
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,976
Good food.

251
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,021
Making friends, dating, and studying.

252
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,273
You said you wanted to live like you are now.

253
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,026
What's wrong with that?

254
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,945
For others, these things are part of their daily life.

255
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,511
Let's take a picture today.

256
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,472
The weather is nice too.

257
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,397
Smile, smile.

258
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,690
I'm taking it.

259
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,483
One, two, three.

260
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,571
Got it. Let's show the V sign.

261
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,406
V, V.

262
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,658
One, two, three.

263
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,287
Is it good? - Come on, come on. -

264
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,538
Come soon, come.

265
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,000
Hey, what is it? What is it?

266
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,918
Well, that's it. This is the last one.

267
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,420
One, two, three.

268
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,048
I'm here. I'm here.

269
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,937
One, two, three.

270
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,733
You two pose.

271
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,153
How about taking a couple picture?

272
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,823
No, no, no. That's too much.

273
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,075
Take a normal picture quickly, then let's go inside.

274
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,205
Hey, when will V sign be shown?

275
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,582
Let's see.

276
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,001
We have to do this.

277
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,087
You're left-handed, I'm right-handed.

278
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,340
What are you saying?

279
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,719
I'm taking it.

280
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,348
Well, this is the last one.

281
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:18,516
One, two, three.

282
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,192
What is Lee On Soo doing over there?

283
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,196
I think they're taking pictures.

284
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,948
Did you think I don't know?

285
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,326
Why is she taking pictures in the rain?

286
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,620
Her friends must have asked her to.

287
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,458
If you pay attention, you'll see.

288
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:45,543
Princess syndrome is hers.

289
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,129
Just because she's pretty, she's always at the center.

290
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,384
Is that the definition?

291
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,053
No.

292
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,902
How are you?

293
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,740
...What are you doing here?

294
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,158
Hey.

295
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,244
What kind of talk is that to your teacher?

296
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,745
This is a classroom.

297
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:21,871
Kids.

298
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,582
I had something come up today.

299
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:27,043
We had a counseling session at 5 o'clock.

300
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,837
It was replaced with the Korean language class.

301
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,922
Tell your friends who are not here as well.

302
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,549
Okay - \N Okay -

303
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,595
I'll see you later.

304
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,608
If possible, drop by the class.

305
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,445
This way, he feels avenged.

306
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,740
And immediately leaves school.

307
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,451
Apparently, you have a lot of hatred for him.

308
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:01,578
You're right.

309
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:04,205
He lied to you about Min Yoongi waking up.

310
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,708
You got lucky.

311
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,002
If you had been even a little late,

312
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,963
I might not have been able to deliver Hoseok to you.

313
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,053
It's a shame.

314
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,847
I want to kill him right in front of your eyes.

315
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,643
But...

316
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,271
I couldn't control the water level.

317
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,231
He easily died.

318
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,735
Like that flower in the garden.

319
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,863
Can I take a look?

320
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,948
Go ahead, take a look.

321
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,909
Because it's been a long time.

322
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,078
I can't come closer.

323
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,182
If Goon Woo says, "Wait," I have to wait.

324
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,017
And this.

325
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,186
It's his mobile phone.

326
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,814
I brought it for you.

327
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,981
But it's locked.

328
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,609
I didn't unlock it either.

329
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,040
It's too late now.

330
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,209
Give me Shup.

331
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,428
What's wrong?

332
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,597
You... Goon Woo.

333
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,391
...Why are you doing this?

334
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,027
Yes.

335
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,530
I checked the phone.

336
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,199
Shup.

337
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,077
I'll bring it to you tomorrow evening.

338
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,420
I'm telling you.

339
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,506
What will you do if you find Shup?

340
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,343
Like what you did to me.

341
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,221
Will you stab him too?

342
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,101
Even worse.

343
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,812
I'll do something.

344
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,815
Give me revenge.

345
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,528
...Eating together and...

346
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,242
Spending too much time with him, isn't it?

347
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,828
Well, it's clear.

348
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,372
I haven't lost my mind to...

349
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,547
But if...

350
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,341
Today...

351
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,302
On the same day...

352
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,806
I think Shup should be grateful to God.

353
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,979
Did you know?

354
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,941
Have you reached the sales limit?

355
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,403
This soon?

356
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,030
Yes.

357
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,534
I want to tell Shup today.

358
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,619
Now Chae Young will wake up.

359
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:33,248
And you're leaving this school, what about that?

360
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,709
What a timing.

361
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,254
That's how it turned out.

362
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,679
Min Yoong.

363
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,306
Today, my heart...

364
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,894
Called me a thousand times.

365
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,944
To remind me that...

366
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,073
I'm your sister.

367
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,367
And you're my little sister.

368
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,875
That I have to save you.

369
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,799
To remind me.

370
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,384
What do I want?

371
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,849
To remind me that here...

372
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,434
There's no place for me.

373
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,323
Where are you going at this hour?

374
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,204
Has something happened?

375
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,749
I think today...

376
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,337
It rained heavily on me.

377
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,216
So today...

378
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,553
Are you coming to your sister's dream?

379
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,598
Can we be again?

380
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,269
Can you be my dream?

381
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,236
I couldn't sleep last night.

382
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,280
I couldn't fall asleep.

383
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,242
Why?

384
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,496
Well, I was restless.

385
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,625
I also expected.

386
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,922
Expected what?

387
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,633
I should have expected

388
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,885
If everything goes well,

389
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,430
The issue of Choi Goon Woo will end.

390
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,476
We will be free.

391
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,355
Why is it so simple?

392
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,025
Huh?

393
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,655
It will end? We will be free?

394
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,615
Didn't you take it too easily?

395
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,179
Take it.

396
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,059
Huh? Okay.

397
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:55,992
It's strange. I'm sure we came to the right place.

398
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,162
At least make a call. Are you sure we came to the right place?

399
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,914
Okay.

400
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,750
I'll make a call.

401
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,710
Okay.

402
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:17,346
Ah, I came to the address you mentioned.

403
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,975
Are you coming now?

404
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,819
What is this?

405
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,906
I'm sorry.

406
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:36,866
...You.

407
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,956
I had no other choice.

408
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,541
I had to save Min Young.

409
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,294
How could you do this to me?

410
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,642
Anyway, you can't save Min Young.

411
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,977
So I have no reason to protect you.

412
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,078
Okay.

413
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,872
I'll give you the address.
