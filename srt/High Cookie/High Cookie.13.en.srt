[sigh]

357
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,727
- [Meaningful music] - [Siren sound]

00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:28,689
[tire rubbing sound]

359
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:35,988
[People are noisy]

00:19:37,322 --> 00:19:39,116
[radio operation sound]

361
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:43,870
[Man 1] Hey, Geonwoo!

362
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,707

364
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:51,795
you&#39;re on vacation

365
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:56,466
No, I was in a hurry after hearing the news.

366
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,385
<i>[남자1] 뭐?</i> <b>[Man 1] What?</b> <i>화재?</i> <b>fire?</b>

367
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,469
Or drugs?

368
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,055
fire

369
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:05,559
I stopped by because I was passing by.

370
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,396
Oh, we came after receiving a report that drugs were being sold there.

371
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:12,524
[Man 1] Hey, what is the situation?

372
00:20:14,192 --> 00:20:15,610
[Man 2] Inspector Yoon

373
00:20:17,571 --> 00:20:19,448
- [Man 1] Hey, see you later - Uh.

374
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,949

[Meaningful sound effects]

377
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,133
[Chief Heo sniffles]

378
00:20:38,842 --> 00:20:40,344
[Chief Heo] Oh, it’s cold.

379
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:41,553
Hey, are you really late?

380
00:20:41,636 --> 00:20:43,805
I hope you enjoyed your vacation, huh?

381
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:55,776
[Chief Heo] Hey, Detective Choi

382
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,612
You worked a lot under us, right?

383
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:01,615
Then shouldn’t we take care of this level?

384
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:05,619
그런 일 하라고 우리가 너한테 돈 준 거야, 이 개새끼야

385
00:21:05,702 --> 00:21:06,745
[Sound of difficulty]

386
00:21:06,828 --> 00:21:08,997
[Strugglingly] Please take me out first, I…

387
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:10,332
[Spit out]

388
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:12,709
I can&#39;t answer or talk like this.

389
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:15,295
[Director Heo] No, losing the recipe is not enough.

390
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:18,382
Yoongi Seok or something was making a fuss.

391
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:22,552
Our kids and the president are all behind!

392
00:21:22,636 --> 00:21:24,179
It&#39;s like this, fuck

393
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:26,098
Is it resolved, huh?

394
00:21:26,181 --> 00:21:29,309
This guy hasn&#39;t come to his senses yet.

395
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:30,852
Hey, turn on more water

396
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:32,813
[Geonwoo] Inspector Yoon Ki-seok!

397
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:33,980
my…

398
00:21:34,064 --> 00:21:35,649
[shaking breathing]

399
00:21:35,732 --> 00:21:37,442
I am a classmate of the police academy.

400
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:39,778
- [Heavy music] - We shared a dormitory together.

401
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:41,571
Since my days as a police officer

402
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:44,866
Overlapping work schedules several times

403
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,493
Currently the strongest

404
00:21:47,702 --> 00:21:49,329
Chi, chin, friend.

405
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,416
I&#39;m like family to you

406
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:53,708
That bastard, that

407
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,961
Don&#39;t you know a single weakness?

408
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,629
[Geonwoo’s heavy breathing]

409
00:21:57,712 --> 00:21:58,755
so?

410
00:21:59,756 --> 00:22:01,967
Just one report

411
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:05,846
Just that one detective

412
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:10,267
It&#39;s not going to fall apart, is it?

413
00:22:12,936 --> 00:22:14,813
[Keyboard operation sound]

414
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,569
[Chief Heo] Then

415
00:22:20,652 --> 00:22:22,279
can you kill me

416
00:22:23,447 --> 00:22:24,614
[Keyboard operation sound]

417
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,658
[I take a deep breath]

[Cool breathing sound]

420
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:34,875
[Kiseok] Oh, Mr.

421
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,959
Geonwoo?

422
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:38,003
Are you there yet?

423
00:22:38,086 --> 00:22:40,714
I&#39;m busy, but I&#39;m busy.

424
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:42,591
[Laughing] You know

425
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,092
Write, indeed

426
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:47,053
Did you have a good vacation?

427
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:49,848

Is your investigation going well?

429
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:54,853
This bastard, this, this

430
00:22:54,936 --> 00:22:56,646
Are you talking back?

431
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:57,981
[Kiseok] Wow

432
00:22:58,064 --> 00:22:59,482
Am I this sad?

433
00:23:01,026 --> 00:23:02,777
There’s no news [sigh]

434
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,739
Aren’t you tired of me giving the same answer every time?

435
00:23:05,822 --> 00:23:07,866
Hey, what&#39;s boring about you?

436
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:11,244
And if it&#39;s your parents

437
00:23:11,745 --> 00:23:13,747
They are like family to me too.

438
00:23:18,627 --> 00:23:21,046
Why are you my family?

439
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:23,673
[Kiseok] Ah, this bastard, this, this, tsk

440
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:25,759
What if your brother worries about you?

441
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:28,553
Just say ‘thank you’, tsk

442
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:29,804
Is the investigation going well?

443
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,556
I heard you&#39;ve been doing this shit again these days, really.

444
00:23:32,474 --> 00:23:35,143
[Kiseok] Oh no, I just walk around acting like a real person.

445
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:36,311
[Kiseok clicks his tongue]

446
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:40,523
I guess

447
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:43,068
These drug addicts

448
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:45,111
I feel like there&#39;s someone watching my back

449
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:46,071
[Meaningful music]

450
00:23:46,154 --> 00:23:47,948
I will definitely catch it, I

451
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,950
Now we&#39;re really there

452
00:23:51,785 --> 00:23:53,995
Did you report it above?

453
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:57,082
Still, I decided to talk to the team leader tomorrow.

454
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:58,708
[Meaningful sound effects]

455
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,753
[Kiseok] I’m going to go buy coffee.

456
00:24:01,836 --> 00:24:04,756
Add a shot of warm Americano, right?

457
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:15,976
[Sound of door opening and closing]

[Heavy sound effect]

459
00:24:30,365 --> 00:24:31,700
[Sooyoung] Then, Yoo Seong-pil

460
00:24:31,783 --> 00:24:33,243
Are you saying you&#39;re not a police officer?

461
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:34,577
[uneasy music]

462
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:36,538
[Lake] I don’t know about that either.

463
00:24:37,831 --> 00:24:39,833
What&#39;s certain is that I came to school for the recipes.

464
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,544
I said it clearly

465
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:44,754
There are proper adults in the world

466
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:47,173
There are also capable police officers.

467
00:24:47,257 --> 00:24:48,466
I will prove it

468
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,884
I wish I was that kind of person

469
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:52,387
There must have been police officers in police uniforms in front of my house.

470
00:24:53,096 --> 00:24:54,306
[Lake&#39;s Sigh]

471
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,434
I didn&#39;t even go this far

472
00:24:59,185 --> 00:25:00,478
[Hosu] No, about Yoo Seong-pil.

473
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:02,439
You could have told me in advance!

474
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:03,606
Ah, then me too

475
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,026
[Sigh] I bet you came up with a plan.

476
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:07,277
[Sooyoung] Hey

477
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:10,780
I found out you were a chef just a few days ago

478
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:12,991
you were hospitalized right away

479
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:15,076
When did you have time to talk?

480
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,703
[laughter] No, and

481
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:19,122
Why should I tell you?

482
00:25:19,622 --> 00:25:21,416
If only I hadn&#39;t saved you

483
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:23,043
If only it were a little late like you said...

484
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:24,878
I guess Choi Min-young couldn’t wake me up.

485
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:27,172
[Hosu] You can’t wake Choi Minyoung up without me!

486
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,132
[People are upset]

487
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,135
[Lake&#39;s Sigh]

488
00:25:35,722 --> 00:25:38,141
- That&#39;s why you saved me - [Heavy music]

489
00:25:39,976 --> 00:25:41,144
that&#39;s right

490
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,730
[Sooyoung] That’s why I saved you

491
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:46,691
Because you will wake Minyoung up.

492
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:49,527
[sigh]

493
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:55,658
They&#39;ll find me somehow

494
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:58,578
[Lake] No matter where I am or what I do

495
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:01,998
I&#39;ll find it somehow

496
00:26:04,501 --> 00:26:06,252
First of all, do you have cash?

497
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:10,590
[Elegant music flows]

498
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:18,932
I can&#39;t go home, school, anywhere.

499
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:21,559
Because it’s obvious that Yoo Seong-pil will come after me.

500
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:23,978
[deep sigh]

501
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:25,855
[Sooyoung] But you can’t even report it to the police

502
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:28,233
You&#39;ll know that even if I don&#39;t say it

503
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,782
Can you see the security here?

504
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,534
Very thorough

505
00:26:37,617 --> 00:26:38,660
[Lake&#39;s Sigh]

506
00:26:38,743 --> 00:26:40,370
So how long are we going to stay here?

507
00:26:42,288 --> 00:26:44,165
I&#39;ll solve it within the weekend

508
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:45,750

[Employee] Customer

510
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:49,546
Yes, it&#39;s ready here.

511
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:50,964
[Sooyoung] Thank you

512
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,934
[light sigh]

513
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,691
[Contemplating breathing]

514

[Sound of dropping]

515
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,534
[Sooyoung] What are you surprised about?

516
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:22,704
I took a bite earlier, when I was saving you.

517
00:27:24,831 --> 00:27:25,665
uh

518
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:30,336
Because it helps me think

519
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,924
[light sigh]

520
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:36,759
[heavy music]

521
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:39,053
[Lake sighs] I’ll take a shower first.

522
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:43,308
Oh, it&#39;s just a little messy.

523
00:27:43,391 --> 00:27:46,019
To organize my thoughts and calm my mind

524

[Sooyoung] That’s right

528
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:12,670
That&#39;s why I saved you

529
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:17,258
Because you will wake Minyoung up.

530
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,218
[rattling sound]

531
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:19,552
[Geonwoo] It’s a lake.

532
00:28:19,636 --> 00:28:21,346

[Distant popping sound effect]

539
00:28:55,296 --> 00:28:58,383
Sister, can you hear anything from upstairs right now?

540

[Continued popping sound effect]

541
00:29:01,511 --> 00:29:02,595
uh?

542
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,180
Can&#39;t you hear me?

Yeah, me too

548
00:29:16,901 --> 00:29:18,152
- [Sooyoung clears her throat] - [Call end sound]

549
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:20,446
<i>[민영] 뭐냐?</i> <b>[Minyoung] What is it?</b> <i>언니 남자 친구 생겼어?</i> <b>Did you get a boyfriend?</b>

550
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:22,615
no

551
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:24,534
What kind of boyfriend are you?

552
00:29:24,617 --> 00:29:26,119
Just a college classmate

553
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:28,913
Gura, you know everything, right?

554
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:30,957
[Minyoung] Are you saying you’ll never date again?

555
00:29:34,168 --> 00:29:35,461
Did you buy clothes again?

556
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,798
Are there that many clothes in the room?

557
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,092
[Sooyoung] Hey

558
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:45,054
How many clothes do you need when you go to college?

559
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:50,935
You can just steal my clothes and wear them later.

560
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,062
I know everything, huh?

561
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:55,648
How can you only know yourself?

562
00:29:55,732 --> 00:29:58,526
[Minyoung] If you’re my sister, can’t you make some concessions?

563
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,612
Why are you so selfish?

564
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:04,449
[Distant popping sound effect]

565
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:07,410

00:30:07,493 --> 00:30:09,162
[Minyoung] Ah, I told you these past few days.

567
00:30:09,245 --> 00:30:11,915
The noise between floors from the house above is no joke.

568
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:14,125
[Sooyoung] What do you mean?

569
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:16,252
I can&#39;t hear anything

570
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,879
[Mobile phone operation sound]

571
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:19,380
It&#39;s not

572
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:21,132
listen carefully…

573
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:22,133
Boom!

574
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:24,093
[Minyoung] I can still hear it?

575
00:30:24,177 --> 00:30:25,178

576
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:27,138
[Sooyoung] Among the things I bought today

577
00:30:27,221 --> 00:30:28,848
Just take a look and see which one is the prettiest, okay?

578
00:30:28,932 --> 00:30:30,642
- [Minyoung’s sigh] - Now

579
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:31,809
how is it?

580
00:30:32,393 --> 00:30:34,103
It’s okay if it’s a little flashy, right?

581
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:35,605
Yeah, it&#39;s okay

582
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:37,106
Hey, let&#39;s try this.

583

[Lake] I don’t know if it will help

597
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,475
Choi Geon-woo said that to me earlier.

598
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:14,936
From those people

599
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,688
You&#39;ll never run away

600
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:18,564
‘Those people’?

601
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,817
[Lake] Yes

602
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:27,615
Is there someone else behind it?

603
00:31:28,199 --> 00:31:30,284
[Lake] I’m not sure about that either.

604
00:31:31,327 --> 00:31:32,370
you

605
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:34,622

[Exciting music]

607
00:31:35,623 --> 00:31:37,750
I came to your house earlier too

[Emphasized sound effect]

610
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:50,555
[Sooyoung] You know that Gong Woo-jun is a member of our club, right?

611
00:31:51,222 --> 00:31:52,890

I asked for help just once

615
00:32:02,316 --> 00:32:05,278
Can I check the personnel records of Inspector Choi Geon-woo?

616
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:08,781
I spent some time looking around, but I received it right away.

617
00:32:08,865 --> 00:32:10,116
And Jinwoo Song

618
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:14,078
[Jinwoo] At our school, there is a teacher called Yoo Seongpil.

619
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:17,290
I would like to ask you all the documents related to Seongpil Yoo.

621
