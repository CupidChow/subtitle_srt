00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,087
With a focused mindset, you can achieve a lot

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,715
And your studying efficiency increases

4
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,383
With cookies

5
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,136
Everything is possible

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,180
I heard your sister is going to Jong Han High School

7
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,766
Unlike me, she always shines

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,100
Of course, me too

9
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,771
I'm sure I can shine at work too

10
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,690
The best college entrance exam advisor in Korea

11
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,276
Mr. Yoo Sung Pil!

12
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,195
You're in a special class, right?

13
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,488
Choi Min Young

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,949
After the break, is there unemployment?

15
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,493
Shall we have dinner together?

16
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,662
Which class are you in?

17
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,044
Hold on a moment

18
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,504
Do you know him?

19
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,717
He's my sister

20
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,181
So Yo Jung

21
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,394
Because she's one of the special class students

22
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,146
He's dead

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,648
One of the students

24
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,483
Dead?

25
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,569
On his ship?

26
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,904
About So Yo Jung?

27
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,534
Because of a cookie that

28
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,202
You sell, man

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,873
Why did you turn my uniform?

30
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,667
Where are the rest?

31
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,377
Say something. Did you eat it?

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,088
...Tell me. What kind of cookie is it that

33
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,714
I have a boyfriend

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,801
Smile

35
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,969
Huh?

36
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,304
Shut up and smile

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,473
Lies must be covered with lies

38
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,309
Whatever I say, idiots believe it

39
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,603
Because he's an idiot

40
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,817
Oh, no

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,319
Oh no, what should I do? What should I do? Oh no

42
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,821
This

43
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,197
Where did you get it?

44
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,824
Is it important?

45
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,617
Because I want to help you

46
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,244
I can help you

47
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,544
So, you know that

48
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:52,046
If you tell the police, Min Young will also be arrested

49
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,215
So Min Young

50
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,260
Does he work here?

51
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,761
Shv is the one who made the cookie

52
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,222
And started this business

53
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,182
No one knows his identity

54
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,018
Shv doesn't know either

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,605
Shv knows that

56
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,232
You gave information to the police

57
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,360
Min Young because of me

58
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,155
It turned out this way

59
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,533
I love Min Young

60
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,703
How can I forget everything?

61
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:27,999
I want to

62
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,626
Kill someone

63
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,379
I'll give you an antidote

64
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,881
Antidote?

65
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,257
Instead of it

66
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,551
Do you want to

67
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,846
Become a cookie employee?

68
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,557
By any means

69
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,476
And as quickly as possible

70
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,895
I came to save Min Young

71
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,063
Do you want to stop me?

72
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,482
Welcome to this school

73
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,278
Look carefully

74
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,447
Sales have just started

75
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,909
Don't you want to do better?

76
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,452
Test it

77
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,745
It will help you

78
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,628
What are you thinking?

79
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:14,796
Huh?

80
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,422
I know everything too

81
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,550
I dress well

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,053
I eat good food

83
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,265
And make friends

84
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,849
Smile- \N I make a promise too-

85
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,977
Exactly like the life I have now

86
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,020
Without Min Young

87
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,565
Are you So Yo Jung?

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,278
He used to work in the factory for me

89
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,571
And now he cleans the school

90
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,782
I want to use Choi Soo Young

91
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,909
I will tell you the result

92
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,036
Then I'll tell you that

93
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,830
Who is Shv?

94
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,708
Do you know Shv?

95
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,126
I will catch Shv

96
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,503
Together and as quickly as possible

97
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,298
If you really are Shv

98
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,842
It's better if you kill me right here

99
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,051
Just as you tortured me

100
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,178
Hehhhh- \N I will torture you-

101
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,392
I'm going to the hospital where your mom is

102
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,271
Let me go!

103
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,189
Your mom

104
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,607
I will find her

105
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,818
And I will kill her

106
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,784
Come up to the rooftop

107
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,746
You need to take care of something

108
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,919
Can you really do it?

109
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,131
Can you make an antidote?

110
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,886
Yes

111
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,692
Yes, aunt

112
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,486
Shv, can you talk?

113
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,071
Honestly

114
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,282
I called to say that we ran out of supplies

115
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,743
It will be delivered today

116
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,372
So, what about me?

117
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,729
Shv?

118
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,242
Yes

119
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,452
Shv

120
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:17,246
Suddenly, the call got disconnected. Are you okay?

121
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,664
Yes, I'm fine

122
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,249
I'll call you later

123
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,965
I'm hanging up

124
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,383
You're not Shv, are you?

125
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,946
I found Shv

126
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,938
It's finally over

127
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,982
Both Shv

128
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,400
And the instructions

129
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,361
And the USP pill

130
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,907
If the police come right now

131
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,617
What do you want to do?

132
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,538
I want to

133
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,373
Now you have to take care of yourself

134
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,586
The owner of those instructions is coming

135
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,135
I think he's here

136
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,848
Wait

137
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,607
I want to

138
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,817
Don't try too hard

139
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,446
You can't escape those people

140
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,615
Mr. Teacher?

141
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,546
You're not the U Sung Pil teacher, are you?

142
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,634
So, you're saying

143
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,187
Something happened to Shv?

144
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,981
What?

145
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,650
...the desired joint device- \N Hehhhh-

146
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,498
Hello? I wanted to know if Patient So Ho Soo has been discharged or not

147
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,220
Two hours ago?

148
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,972
Thank you

149
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,891
Lee Ohn Soo

150
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:39,949
Is everything okay?

151
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,246
It's not your job, is it?

152
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,748
What?

153
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,250
I'm going to the doctor

154
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,918
So, nothing

155
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,336
Hey

156
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,428
Where are you going?

157
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,389
Hey

158
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,363
Lee Ohn Soo

159
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,824
Go aside- \N Go aside-

160
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,577
Dear customers

161
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,463
To thank our dear customers who have supported us until now

162
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:39,341

I'm sorry- \N What?

171
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,696

When you arrive, take a photo at the entrance and send it

Mr. Teacher?

179
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,067
You're not the U Sung Pil teacher, are you?

180
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,777
What are you doing here?

181

I found it

They will receive a free cookie for one month

185
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,294
What is it?

186
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,385
Ah, here, here, here

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,472
The name of this event is "Cookie Run"

188
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,349
What is it?

00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,280
Wait, wait

Wait, wait, wait

Later, I will check your identity and let you know

195
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,651
So, wait a little, okay?

196
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,457
Oh, my phone

197
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,711
I left my phone- \N What?

198
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,506
Why did you organize this event exactly?

199
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,717
Why did you drag So Ho Soo into the middle?

200
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,094
Even I don't know

201
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,596
If you don't know, then who does?

202
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,016
Anyway

203
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,727
Is my share still safe?

204
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,312
Yes

205
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,858
If my father finds out about this and that I took the car, he will kill me

206
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,943
I took a huge risk now

207
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,904
Where are we going?

208
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,865
There

209
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,242
Let's walk wherever we can

210
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,536
Okay

211
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,775
Hey, don't take a picture

212
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,693
...only one- \N Hey, delete it-

213
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,779
I'll take just one- \N Hey, delete it, aren't you going to delete it?-

214
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,407
I'm sorry

215
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,950
I changed my mind

216
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,369
The promise you made back then

217
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,664
If you act on it, then I will go after Shef

218
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,376
It's not because I don't trust you

219
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,963
Just for the sake of assurance

220
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,134
Do I need to approach the HR manager first?

221
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,304
Yes, that's right

222
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,181
Okay

223
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,059
I don't know what issues you two have with each other

224
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,436
But it doesn't matter to me

225
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,604
I just

226
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,940
want to get that order

227
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,484
Thank you

228
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,737
I told him to come here

229
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,572
He always listens to me

230
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,660
Are you getting to work now?

231
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,579
What's the hurry?

232
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,125
I told him to buy a goat today

233
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,504
So when?

234
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,549
First, I want to make sure that

235
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,677
Shef is in my fist

236
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,973
As long as I'm sure her work is good

237
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,225
Then I'll twist and reset her

238
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:43,765
Hey, Gun Woo

239
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,602
Hey! Gun Woo

240
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,897
Ha? \N How did you come here?-

241
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,690
Aren't you on leave?

242
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,361
No, as soon as I heard the news, I came quickly

243
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,280
What? Fire?

244
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,364
Or drugs?

245
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:01,950
Fire

246
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,454
I was passing by and thought of checking

247
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,291
We received a report that drugs are being sold here

248
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,419
Hey, how's the situation?

249
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,505
Inspector Yoon

250
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,343
See you later- \N Okay-

251
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,239
Oh, it's cold

252
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,448
You're late

253
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,700
I hope you had a great holiday

254
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,671
Hey, Detective Choi

255
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,507
You've been working for a long time, right?

256
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,510
So, shouldn't you be useful in these situations?

257
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,514
That's why we're paying you, fool

258
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,892
...First, get me out of here

259
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,604
I can't talk like this

260
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,190
Losing the order wasn't enough

261
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,277
Because of the trouble caused by that Yoon Ki Suk

262
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,447
The boss and the guys are all dead

263
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,074
Damn it

264
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,993
I can fix it

265
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,204
This Ahn Ter hasn't come to his senses yet

266
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,747
Hey, pour more water

267
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,708
Inspector Yoon Ki Suk

268
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,875
...Him

269
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,337
We were classmates at the police academy

270
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,673
We were even roommates in the dorm

271
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,466
Since I became a police officer

272
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,761
We solved a lot of cases together

273
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,388
He's the best now

274
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,224
He's... my friend

275
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,311
Like family

276
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,603
That Ahn Ji, him

277
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,856
Do you think I don't know his weakness?

278
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,650
Well?

279
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,862
Just for a report

280
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,741
Just for a detective

281
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,162
Are we going to separate?

282
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,464
So

283
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,174
Do you want to kill him?

284
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,770
Yes, him

285
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:35,854
Gun Woo?

286
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,898
You still haven't gone?

287
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,609
Is it only your head that's busy? Mine is too

288
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,486
I know

289
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,987
I'm telling you

290
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,948
Did you have a good holiday?

291
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,743
How are your parents?

292
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,120
Is your investigation going well?

293
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,748
This Ahn Ji, this

294
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,541
Are you ready to answer?

295
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,876
Wow

296
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,377
Now I'm upset

297
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,672
Nothing new

298
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,634
Don't you get tired of me giving you the same answer every time?

299
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,761
Hey, why should I get tired of you?

300
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,139
And also your parents

301
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,642
They are like family to me too.

302
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,941
Why am I part of your family? You are a public figure.

303
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,568
Look at this change.

304
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,654
If your brother is worried about you.

305
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,448
"You should say "thank you."

306
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,699
Is your investigation going well?

307
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,451
I heard you are causing trouble again.

308
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,038
I'm just doing my job.

309
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,418
In my opinion,

310
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,963
These substitute addicts.

311
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,006
Someone used me as a tool.

312
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,843
I will definitely catch them.

313
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,845
It's finally over.

314
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,890
Did you report it?

315
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,977
I will talk to the team supervisor tomorrow.

316
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,648
I'm going to buy coffee.

317
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,651
Hot American coffee, a shot, right?

318
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,595
So, it's Yoo Seong-pil.

319
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,138
Isn't he a police officer?

320
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,433
I don't even know.

321
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,728
But I'm sure that he came to this school with the order to catch him.

322
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,439
He said so himself.

323
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,649
He wants to prove that

324
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,068
There are honest people in the world, and

325
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,361
There are capable police officers too.

326
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,779
If he was such a person,

327
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,282
The police would be at my house now.

328
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,329
It didn't need to go this far.

329
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,373
It should have happened sooner than this.

330
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,334
You told me about Yoo Seong-pil.

331
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,501
That way I could find a solution.

332
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,921
Hey,

333
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,172
I just found out a few days ago that you are injured.

334
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,675
And then you were immediately hospitalized.

335
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,886
Did I have time to tell you?

336
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,971
Not at all.

337
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,598
Why should I tell you?

338
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,017
If I hadn't saved you,

339
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,311
...if I had been a little late,

340
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,938
Cho Mi-nyeong wouldn't have regained consciousness.

341
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,773
You can't revive Mi-nyeong without me.

342
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,067
That's why I saved you.

343
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,036
That's right.

344
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,039
I saved you for that reason.

345
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,625
Because you had to revive Mi-nyeong.

346
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,586
They will eventually find me.

347
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,553
Wherever I go and whatever I do,

348
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,473
They will find me somehow.

349
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,893
Do you have cash?

350
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,147
We can't go anywhere - home, school, nowhere.

351
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,827
Because Yoo Seong-pil will definitely come after us.

352
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,454
We can't go to the police either.

353
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,750
You know the reason.

354
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,128
Do you see those guards?

355
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,677
They are everywhere.

356
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,429
How long do we have to stay here?

357
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,265
I will solve the Yoo Seong-pil case myself.

358
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,060
Madam,

359
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,645
Here you go.

360
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,772
Thank you.

361
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,441
Why are you surprised?

362
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,859
Before I saved you, I also tried to poison him.

363
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,429
Oh.

364
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,599
It stimulates my brain.

365
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,560
I'm going to take a shower.

366
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,231
I'm a bit scattered.

367
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,948
It helps me calm down a bit.

368
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:43,203
Right.

369
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,914
That's why I saved you.

370
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,855
Because you had to revive Mi-nyeong.

371
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,565
Hoseo.

372
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,153
Don't try too hard.

373
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,447
You can't escape those people.

374
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,241
Them - the people who come after you.

375
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,368
Do you hear that noise coming from above?

376
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,869
Huh?

377
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,278
Don't you hear what I'm saying?

378
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,490
Oh...yeah.

379
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,075
I'll call you later. Hang up.

380
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,166
Yeah, me too.

381
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,002
What is it? Did you find a boyfriend?

382
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,713
No.

383
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,341
Where was the boyfriend?

384
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,510
He is my classmate.

385
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,429
Oh, come on, I know everything.

386
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,014
Didn't you say you wouldn't date anymore?

387
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,808
Did you buy clothes again?

388
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,852
Your room is full of clothes.

389
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,356
Hey.

390
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,693
You know how much clothes you need for university?

391
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,987
Have the courage to take off my clothes and wear them.

392
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,949
I know everything.

393
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,830
Why do you only care about yourself?

394
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,957
You shouldn't show mercy to me as your sister?

395
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,543
Why are you so selfish?

396
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,421
Do you hear me?

397
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,507
A few days ago I told you,

398
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,305
The noises from the upper floor are not my brother joking.

399
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,057
Can you hear me calling you?

400
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,810
Ah, yeah. Well, brother, it's not a joke.

401
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,020
What are you saying?

402
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,147
I can't hear you.

403
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,275
No.

404
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,027
Well, listen carefully.

405
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,028
Boom boom!

406
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,988
I keep hearing his voice.

407
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,073
Hey!

408
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,033
Among these things I picked up,

409
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,743
See which one is prettier?

410
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,537
Come here.

411
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,704
How is it?

412
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,998
My Mongolian flower is good, isn't it?

413
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,500
Yes, it's good.

414
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,001
Hey, come try it.

415
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,628
See, give it a try.

416
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,421
Huh? How is it?

417
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,756
I really like it.

418
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,467
Why do you like it so much? Is it good?

419
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,469
So this is mine. Hey, what are you saying?

420
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,388
It's mine. I bought it myself.

421
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,390
It's mine. Too bad you don't like it.

422
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,702
I don't know if it will help you or not.

423
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,370
Choy Goun Woo told me that...

424
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,831
I can't handle it.

425
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,583
I need to escape from those people.

426
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,459
Those people?

427
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,712
Yes.

428
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:27,510
So there's someone behind all these matters?

429
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,179
I don't know this one anymore.

430
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,265
You...

431
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,517
Do you know E from second grade?

432
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,645
He had come by your house.

433
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,450
Did you know he is also a member of our association?

434
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,785
All the ugly women in Gong Book Gang Palace know him.

435
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,996
The theory of Pythagoras is hidden in it.

436
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,751
His father is the police chief.

437
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:02,128
I asked him for help.

438
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,173
I told him to gather information about Inspector Choy Goun Woo's employee.

439
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,676
He searched for him a bit and found him.

440
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,011
And Sung Jin Woo...

441
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,973
We have a teacher named Yoo Sung Pil at our school.

442
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,185
I need the documents related to Yoo Sung Pil.

443
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,478
And I asked Jin Woo to...

444
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,773
Gather all the documents that Yoo Sung Pil provided to the school during his employment.

445
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,650
He said he would send them soon.

446
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,154
Let's go ourselves.

447
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,364
Let's get Inspector Choy Goun Woo.
