00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,427
The antidote that can wake up Choi Min Young

3
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,512
I'm working on it

4
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,560
As soon as it's complete, I'll give it to you

5
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,728
Hey!

6
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,897
This bastard is still causing trouble

7
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,440
Don't you know what trouble you've gotten into?

8
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,155
Let's go

9
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,492
Let's go

10
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,494
Weren't you planning to kill him?

11
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,123
Do you want to go like this?

12
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,419
...Damn it

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,505
By any chance, are you...

14
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,299
Don't you believe all the nonsense about the antidote?

15
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,594
I'll think about it until tomorrow

16
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,180
Leave it alone until then

17
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,022
...Damn it

18
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:39,617
Actually

19
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,661
It was your lucky day

20
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,456
How did you manage to get out of the barrel?

21
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,252
Do you mean when you lost the instructions?

22
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,213
You fool, you fool!

23
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,673
Please tell me, okay?

24
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,134
I can't take it anymore

25
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,594
I feel like I could die at any moment

26
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,928
Even involving my family won't make a difference

27
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,472
So what do I have to do exactly? Huh?

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,808
I have to be a stranger

29
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,352
A stranger?

30
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,770
I'm gambling with my family's lives

31
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,856
Doesn't that make me more helpless?

32
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,275
I killed him

33
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,987
I killed him

34
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,905
With my own hands

35
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,492
That video

36
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,578
Every time I see it, I'm amazed

37
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,289
My dear Gun Woo, you're so naive

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,749
You're on your own

39
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,460
You found a new barrel

40
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,894
Yes, Su Young Shi

41
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,354
Detective

42
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,439
I found the antidote

43
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,943
How?... No

44
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,528
Who is Shaf?

45
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,739
But Detective

46
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,117
If Shaf can't wake up Min Young

47
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,702
Then what should we do?

48
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,996
What? What do you mean?

49
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,208
Even if the law punishes him, it won't ease my mind

50
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,169
Instead of handing him over to the police

51
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,089
Isn't it better if I kill him myself?

52
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,298
Didn't Shaf say

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,842
That he has the antidote and can wake up Min Young?

54
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,054
He said he doesn't have it

55
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,099
Min Young

56
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,687
He can't wake up

57
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,451
So

58
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,955
How did Chae Su Young find Shaf?

59
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,001
I think I have to go to school now

60
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,544
Yeah

61
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,586
Definitely

62
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,547
So what do we do about Inspector Park?

63
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,715
What do you mean?

64
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
I'll go with him

65
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,092
No

66
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,260
Give me three days

67
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,053
I'll definitely succeed

68
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,763
Can I have as much time as you can give me?

69
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,265
Hyung Nim (older brother)

70
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,934
Yeah

71
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,022
No, I'm coming too

72
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,065
I'm coming too. I'm coming too

73
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,234
Hey, hey, let me go

74
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,204
Hello?

75
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,915
Lee Won Soo?

76
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,877
He's sleeping

77
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,131
Didn't you bring the rebellion?

78
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,633
Why did you call this late to catch him?

79
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,010
...I thought

80
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,555
Do you want to apologize for ruining my counseling session?

81
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,895
It's not Ho Soo

82
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,063
Ah

83
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:41,818
His mom said he wasn't feeling well, so she went early in the morning

84
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,653
Probably because she was in a hurry

85
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,279
She didn't have time to inform you

86
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,242
So, where is he?

87
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,579
When I woke up, he wasn't there

88
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,956
I thought he went to school

89
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,111
So

90
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,447
Do you know where he is?

91
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,739
And as you said

92
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,867
Did he sleep at the dorm last night?

93
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,912
Maybe

94
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,123
Are you meeting Lee Won Soo?

95
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,791
What?

96
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,752
Did you have a fight? That's why he's not answering your calls?

97
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,130
It's your fault

98
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,631
No, that's not true

99
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,924
So what is it?

100
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,135
Why did you shout at him?

101
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,012
Should I spread rumors behind your back?

102
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,556
Oh...well

103
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,808
You yourself said that

104
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,978
You're in a good mental state and studying a lot

105
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,355
But you don't know why your grades have dropped

106
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,773
It's strange to me too

107
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,858
These days, not only the third grade

108
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,570
Even the other grades have seen a drop in their grades

109
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,906
What does that mean?

110
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,161
Something unprecedented is happening.

111
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,372
It's still not exactly clear

112
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,459
I have some doubts too

113
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,920
But

114
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,630
What does that have to do with that side?

115
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,883
I think that side is behind these events

116
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,596
Can you help me?

117
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,390
I'll ask again

118
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,975
Last night

119
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,229
Was there anything strange about that side?

120
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,066
Blood

121
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,110
There was blood on her school uniform

122
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,197
At first, I thought she had her period

123
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,282
But it's not possible that

124
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,661
The blood has gone all the way to her name tag

125
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,144
I've sent you a picture of it

126
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,480
And the kids said last night that

127
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,649
Li saw that side and Song Ji-won together

128
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,068
Even then

129
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,486
There was blood on her clothes

130
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,613
What time exactly was it?

131
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,324
It was past dinner time. How?

132
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,160
Didn't he go with Hoseo yesterday?

133
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,161
Why?

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,081
Thanks to that, he gave me his counseling appointment

135
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,749
But was he with Ji-won at that time?

136
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,126
So, what about Hoseo?

137
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,253
Did anyone see Hoseo at that time?

138
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,005
I'll try to find out

139
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,590
Oh, okay. Thank you

140
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:21,829
What is it?

141
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,583
Has Lee Hoseo not come here?

142
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,463
Did I say he hasn't come here?

143
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,049
What?

144
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,801
Exactly which grave? He hasn't even come to school

145
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,554
There's nowhere else he could go

146
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,350
I'll find the hospital your mother is in

147
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,644
And then I'll kill him

148
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,771
...No, no

149
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,523
What?

150
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,777
No, not my mother, damn it

151
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,363
Jinho

152
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,406
Please let me go. I'm begging you

153
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,784
Please. I'm begging you

154
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,535
From now on, I'll do whatever you say

155
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,412
Jinho, please. Damn it

156
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,373
Just let me go find him

157
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,500
Ah, damn it

158
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,626
Exactly

159
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,337
Don't touch my mother

160
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,570
It doesn't make sense, logically

161
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,364
Girlfriend

162
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,241
What about her?

163
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,160
Oh God, what happened?

164
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,620
What's her name?

165
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,749
Choi Sooyoung

166
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,793
Is she from the same school? Classmate?

167
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,253
No

168
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,132
I work at a factory

169
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,176
Anyway, thank you

170
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,886
Soohoo's mom is asleep

171
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,597
Then I thank you instead.

172
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,893
Can I ask you a favor?

173
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,312
Now that you're here.

174
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,815
Can I go across the street and have something to eat?

175
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,192
I'm tired of hospital food.

176
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,237
Definitely.

177
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,823
Thank you.

178
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,576
If something happens.

179
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,244
Press the call button next to the bed.

180
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,371
The nurses will come afterwards.

181
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,084
Then I'll leave.

182
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,461
I'll be back soon.

183
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,576
Hello?

184
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,161
Oh, I'm sorry.

185
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,206
I'm calling from Housu School.

186
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,500
Are you in the hospital by any chance?

187
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,169
I stepped out for a moment.

188
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,296
Housu's girlfriend is in the room now.

189
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,967
Girlfriend?

190
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,637
Isn't Housu in the hospital?

191
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,347
Obviously not.

192
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,432
It's in the middle of the week. How can he come?

193
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,727
How? What happened?

194
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,020
No.

195
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,897
...Just...

196
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,357
Can you please?

197
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,652
Can you tell me the room number?

198
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,372
Hey.

199
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,832
Where were you?

200
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,126
The patient's name is Oh Jung Suk.

201
00:13:56,835 --> 00:14:00,297
New Wung Seoul Hospital, Room number 1130.

202
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,715
Hey.

203
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,883
I told you that...

204
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,719
If you're silent, I won't bother you.

205
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,931
I will make sure you pay for it.

206
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,641
Don't lie.

207
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,810
You killed my mother?

208
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,521
You did the same thing.

209
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,314
So why can't I?

210
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,692
Damn you, trash!

211
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,901
Ugh.

212
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,486
Answer me.

213
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:25,406
You did the same thing, so why can't I?

214
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,158
Did that bastard Choi Seo Young die?

215
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,160
No, she's not dead.

216
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,538
She's just sleeping.

217
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,290
I will save her.

218
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,501
I'll make the antidote and wake her up!

219
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,549
You can't wake her up.

220
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,593
Min Young.

221
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,678
She's not supposed to wake up.

222
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,638
Did you think I would fall for your trick?

223
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,849
Hey.

224
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,060
Did you kill my mother?

225
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,064
You didn't kill her, did you?

226
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,525
Are you scared?

227
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,030
Please say no.

228
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,573
...Please

229
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,199
Then...

230
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,743
Do you believe?

231
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,287
Do you believe?

232
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,164
...I have to believe

233
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,125
There's nothing I can do now

234
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,252
Just say it

235
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,004
Say that you didn't kill my mother

236
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,385
Don't laugh! Give me an answer

237
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,726
So today is...

238
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,645
Just stay like this

239
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,273
Tell yourself, is my mother dead or alive?

240
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,359
Like me, who spent the whole night

241
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,613
I was thinking about everything

242
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,990
I got hopeful for a moment

243
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,618
And then I got disappointed

244
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,703
Exactly like yesterday

245
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,750
...Oh, my goodness

246
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,672
If I were Chou Tzu-yu, I would have died a long time ago

247
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,132
Chou Hyeonuk Rock

248
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,009
Your father

249
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,555
The day he sent the letter

250
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,393
Min Young's mouth went dry and he passed out

251
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,812
At first, it seemed like a normal letter to me

252
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,939
I was curious to know why it had caused

253
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,191
Min Young to go crazy

254
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,026
And why Min Young

255
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,196
Exactly the day he regained consciousness

256
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,198
Did he try to throw himself down from the building?

257
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,826
I only told him

258
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,828
And then after six minutes, he would be happy

259
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,288
I only told him this

260
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,291
Even though he had gone up so high

261
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,335
He tied the back of the bomb

262
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,920
Hasn't he written to you?

263
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,091
Shut up

264
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,301
But

265
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,470
After he became my employee

266
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,182
Even when the back of the bomb was open

267
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,642
Min Young didn't go to him

268
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,978
I want to resolve the misunderstanding

269
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,857
I didn't kill Choi Min Young. I saved him

270
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,739
Did you really kill my mother?

271
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,828
I'll tell you

272
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,330
But first, answer my question

273
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,458
Can you really

274
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,670
Make an antidote?

275
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,384
Can you?

276
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,555
Yes

277
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,163
I was passing by, so I thought I'd drop by

278
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,249
It was all on my mind

279
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,293
Since I became a teacher, I haven't seen them once

280
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,629
Don't say that

281
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:11,632
Thanks to the school's support, I feel at ease

282
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,133
Because I heard

283
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,968
If a student performs well in their studies

284
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,180
The school covers all hospital and surgery expenses

285
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,642
Thanks to that, Hossein is completely focused on his studies

286
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,561
He used to do a lot of private tutoring and part-time work before

287
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,688
He struggled a lot to make money

288
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,825
Nobody knows

289
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,994
But his father is addicted

290
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,289
He's gone now. I don't know if he's dead or alive.

291
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,010
So

292
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,388
Is my mom really doing well?

293
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,682
Yes

294
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,059
So

295
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,520
Can you really make the antidote?

296
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,231
Yes

297
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,484
I feel relieved

298
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,948
...Mom

299
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,076
...Mom

300
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,723
I had to call an ambulance

301
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,518
The doctors and police are saying that you bullied someone at school.

302
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,187
So, just deny it and let them go.

303
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,356
They say you'll be on leave in three days.

304
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,609
As soon as you're on leave, start the experiments.

305
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,403
Report the results every day.

306
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,373
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,251
That patient regained consciousness. Please take a look at him.

308
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,920
Okay, understood.

309
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,801
Why did you set Hosu free?

310
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,930
What if he stabs us both from behind?

311
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,392
What if he tries to kill both of us?

312
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,520
For you and me.

313
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,855
Death is not so scary.

314
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,195
Coward?

315
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,782
Did you really believe and let go of his nonsense?

316
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,908
Yes.

317
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,285
Ugh.

318
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,995
Hey.

319
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,374
I tested the antidote that Shiva had prepared. It was a saline solution.

320
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,084
Did you know?

321
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,003
It's because he's still conducting experiments.

322
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,298
It's not ready yet.

323
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,550
Did you hit your head somewhere?

324
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,678
Even went to his mother's hospital.

325
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,389
I was waiting for a perfect revenge. Damn it. What's going on?

326
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,225
I didn't go for revenge.

327
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,394
Just...

328
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:13,188
Among all of Hosu's words...

329
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,774
I hoped this one was true.

330
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,734
It should have been true.

331
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,030
I went with a heavy heart.

332
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,365
If...

333
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,034
His mother being sick was also a lie.

334
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,912
Then I would have died too.

335
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,292
But it was true.

336
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,877
Hosu's mother.

337
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,505
She was really sick.

338
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,635
If even one of them is true...

339
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,350
It can be trusted.

340
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,978
Among all those lies...

341
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,147
Is it possible that the antidote...

342
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,607
Is true.

343
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,151
It's worth trusting.

344
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,945
Have you lost your mind?

345
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,993
I know it's incomprehensible.

346
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,537
I know it's meaningless.

347
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,124
I know it's foolish and naive.

348
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,417
I know everything.

349
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,919
But I can't do anything about it.

350
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,630
What's the reason for your inexplicable stubbornness?

351
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,966
Because...

352
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,889
I've always been like this.

353
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,225
Even when my dad treated me like garbage.

354
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,352
Even when he was arrested.

355
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,439
When I had to raise Min-young alone.

356
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,649
When I left school.

357
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,071
Even when the factory gave me a one-year contract.

358
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,448
Even when...

359
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,119
Dad sent letters from prison.

360
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:53,914
I believed that...

361
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,416
Everything will be alright.

362
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,418
Everything will get better.

363
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,171
Others might think...

364
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,506
It's meaningless.

365
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,592
And that it's foolish and naive.

366
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,929
And it's like I'm waiting for a miracle.

367
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,599
But I believed.

368
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,893
...In everything.

369
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,480
I believed in everything to stay alive.

370
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,435
I was so worried about you yesterday and the day before.

371
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,980
Your phone was turned off.

372
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,109
...You said you found the cure.

373
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,777
...Ah, that.

374
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,823
I made a mistake.

375
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,575
I'm sorry.

376
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,577
I should have told you.

377
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,708
I don't need anything from you right now.

378
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,210
I thought about it a bit.

379
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,921
I think I've put a lot of pressure on you recently.

380
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,883
If God forbid, you got caught.

381
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,427
You would definitely be in trouble.

382
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,846
So...

383
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,807
What do you want to do now?

384
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,435
I don't know. I need to think about it.

385
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,982
Did you hear that Hosu is hospitalized?

386
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,985
I heard he fell down the stairs and got injured.

387
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,070
Did you call him?

388
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,283
I want to go see him.

389
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,035
I'm sure he's doing well.

390
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,663
They said he lost a lot of blood.

391
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,674
He's in a lot of pain- \N It doesn't seem like it, though-

392
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,092
My dad is a trickster.

393
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,552
Are you here? - \N Come in-

394
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:16,806
Today, Li got three new customers.

395
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,489
I'll be on leave tomorrow and go home.

396
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,407
Then I'll prepare the materials.

397
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,755
Did you not do well on your exam? - \N It must have been difficult-

398
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,299
I got two Fs.

399
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,561
Yes, Aunt.

400
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:28,855
Oh, Shiva, can you talk?

401
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,649
To be honest,

402
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,027
I called to let you know that I ran out of supplies.

403
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,364
Of course, I know that.

404
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,492
You're not the type of person to forget.

405
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,577
These days, we have a lot of customers.

406
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,747
I'm afraid if I'm not careful, problems will arise during delivery.

407
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,749
The supplies will be delivered today.

408
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,128
I knew that

409
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,547
...you never

410
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,424
forget.

411
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,303
and you deliver the supplies on time.

412
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,181
I'm telling you, Jake Jake.

413
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,228
Add one more.

414
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,397
What?

415
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,819
Li is there.

416
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,821
Ah, damn it.

417
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,031
No matter how many times I tell him, he sends it with his phone.

418
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,825
Still, he always comes and shows off himself.

419
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,203
Anyway, another customer has been added.

420
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,956
Tell him he did a good job.

421
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:29,833
...so I...

422
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,920
Shiva?

423
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,568
Yes- \N Shiva?-

424
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,987
My phone suddenly got disconnected, are you okay?

425
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,488
Yes, I'm fine.

426
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,366
Oh, alright.

427
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,952
So, I'll call again.

428
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,672
I'll hang up.

429
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,885
You're not okay, are you?

430
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,433
What?

431
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,934
How do you know?

432
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,078
Did you wake up?

433
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,923
Thank you for

434
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,050
finding the recipe.

435
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:05,011
and using it like this.

436
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,181
If it was someone who didn't know what it was, they would have cut it.

437
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,308
This recipe is not from this world forever.

438
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,812
But because our clever Hasu had a slice of it.

439
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,980
I was able to find it.

440
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,694
Mr. Teacher, what do you mean?

441
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,326
I mean, thanks to you, I was saved.

442
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,455
According to my knowledge.

443
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,040
About a year and a half ago.

444
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:35,875
You found it.

445
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:38,211
And you started this business.

446
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,381
But how did it come to your mind to make cookies with it?

447
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,716
And that too at school.

448
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,093
...and in the laundry room.

449
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,472
You made it right in the laundry room and sold it.

450
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,559
Why are you doing this to me?

451
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,646
I said I don't know anything, okay?

452
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,067
It's a waste to have a smart kid like you.

453
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,570
If you had better parents, you wouldn't do these things.

454
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,030
Then you had a good life, didn't you?

455
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,449
If the police come,

456
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,618
What are you going to do?

457
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,955
Now you should worry about yourself, Hasu.

458
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,833
The one who gave the order is coming.

459
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,344
I think he's here.

460
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,847
...oh no.

461
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,058
...oh no.

462
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,231
Hasu.

463
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,692
Don't try too hard.

464
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,485
Oh no.
