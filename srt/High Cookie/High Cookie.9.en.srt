00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,170
Zhenyu

4
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,250
What do you do?

5
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,510
What do you do?

6
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,530
What do your sister think

7
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,600
What

8
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,280
Let others see

9
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,280
I thought you were Cui Minying's brother

10
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,620
What's the meaning

11
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,840
What to do with allergies

12
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,220
I know too

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,930
Cook

14
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,730
What others will hear

15
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,000
You have known

16
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,170
Am I a cookie employee?

17
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,680
What

18
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,240
You are not scared, but you first observe the surroundings

19
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,600
What's the meaning

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,060
Isn't it

21
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,930
What's wrong

22
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,240
Can't you know?

23
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,260
I had already told him

24
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,770
Work with you

25
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,370
I already knew it

26
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,240
We

27
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,440
Um

28
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,370
Why tease me

29
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,170
why did not you tell me

30
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,640
stop

31
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,370
Quarrel with me in front of everyone

32
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,370
The business will be delayed

33
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,080
what is his name

34
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,770
-Why is this -why is this?

35
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,930
who is she

36
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,530
Li En Book
Crazy

37
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,200
So arrogant

38
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,840
She is crazy

39
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,800
Speechless

40
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Everyone has to look at Zhenyu's eyes

41
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,800
Can't talk to you

42
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,280
Will delay business

43
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,820
Thank you for helping me but not doing this

44
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,220
If because of my delay, Min Ying wakes up

45
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,600
What can I do

46
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,440
Is it funny

47
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,110
Now the school knows

48
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,730
Transfer to the school vividly Song Zhenyu

49
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,350
How are she okay?

50
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,220
She is the transfer student

51
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,620
-This student -the person who moves Zhenyu

52
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,260
Is it her?

53
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,750
Why move Zhenyu

54
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,350
You see everyone is watching you

55
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,000
Can I not know

56
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,020
If you move Song Zhenyu, the school will mess up the school

57
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,380
Bleak

58
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,730
Bleak

59
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,830
Eat lunch separately

60
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,820
-Crece -Okay

61
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,510
I know the offender

62
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,330
It's the same as my expectations

63
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,620
I will understand these days these days

64
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,280
What do students in this school need

65
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,820
What should I become like

66
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,460
what should I do

67
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,460
See clearly

68
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,620
Now start to open up

69
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,390
April Sub -Test Section 1 Mandarin Section 2 Mathematics Section 3 English Section 4 Exploring

71
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,820

What

76
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,130
no

77
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,370
The difficulty of the whole subject

78
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,640
It has exceeded the high school level a lot

79
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,170
Zhenyu has been wrong several times

80
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,020
Actually get a full score

81
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,970
The most fair and fair school exam

82
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,750
Is anyone cheating?

83
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,730
It's not that I am not the meaning

84
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,280
I was because I was startled

85
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,310
It's just a person who is suitable for schools

86
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:08,710
You are the class teacher, Gu Hao class sfront

87
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,080
From the first Li Enshu to the tenth Park Xizhen
The first place in Li Enshu, Song Zhenyu, the third place Xu Haoxiu, the tenth place Park Xizhen

88
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,910
Look at it soon

89
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,460
Does this look like

90
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,310
Li Enshu is the one who moves Zhenyu, right?

91
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,550
30 points higher than Zhenyu in the second place

92
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,060
Heaven

93
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,800
Why do you come so early

94
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Not over yet

95
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,220
I now know that I want to change classes

96
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
This is my heart

97
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,480
We are friends

98
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,620
I am drumming the courage

99
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,220
Even if you are class S

100
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,550
Fighting by Zhenyu

101
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,950
It's hard to approach you on my position

102
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,260
But who am I

103
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,680
It's a book, your first school friend

104
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,480
friend

105
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,600
Can I ask you one thing?

106
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,860
Solve this question

107
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,790
Seeking the value of G (2)
It is the math question that the whole school has only you answered right

108
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,680
I changed the number

109
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,750
Write all the problem solving process

110
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,400
Can you let me see

111
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,600
It's better to determine

112
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,750
Some people are doubting you misunderstand you

113
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,860
What is misunderstanding and doubt

114
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,550
Because you are too rich

115
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,660
Bringing the answer

116
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,110
Or steal the answer

117
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,480
Or not

118
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,950
Because you are so beautiful

119
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,640
When will I unlock it to you

120
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,260
What when

121
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,910
Right now

122
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,260
Write on the classroom blackboard

123
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,950
Let everyone see

124
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,440
Grace

125
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,240
Don't solve

126
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,600
What kind of fun do you make up

127
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,570
Not only do you not give the first place, the first place is happy

128
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,840
What do you want to do

129
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,640
Do you look forward to making a mistake in the book?

130
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,110
Don't get in the end

131
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,820
How fun is it now

132
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,880
Can't solve it anymore

133
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,750
Bleak

134
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,930
Can't solve it, right?

135
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,220
What are you doing

136
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,440
The questions you have solved

137
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,310
Can't change the number?

138
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,910
no

139
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,220
Can't solve it

140
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,330
Don't you understand

141
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,310
The function is discontinuous

142
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,080
You can change your numbers casually

143
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,300
Can't solve the points limit

144
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,010
What does it mean

145
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,650
It seems that you are a question that you don't know

146
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,890
Actually you are not sure

147
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,960
I understand

148
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,030
Because this is the question you did wrong

149
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,950
This is the question sent me by Zhenyu

150
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,550
Can you change the question like this

151
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,480
Excuse me

152
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,810
I did this question wrong

153
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,240
I sent it to you

154
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,540
Enbook should be right

155
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,160
This question is not established

156
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,190
You wait for me

157
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,250
I will go to the teacher to get a question again

158
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,350
At this time, you need to apologize first

159
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,320
You should not continue to bully after bullying

160
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,610
It is said to be like this

161
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,330
According to my girlfriend

162
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,890
girlfriend

163
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,360
Students have been bullying you, can you not bear it anymore?

164
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,150
Thanks to you and I become famous

165
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,600
No one among the students in the school nowadays, no one knows me anymore

166
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,330
You said it is like in your plan

167
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,430
Class F transferred to the business that students can do

168
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,900
It is limited

169
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,180
so what

170
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,420
I thought about it carefully

171
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:36,340
You who have money and background learning and you are good

172
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,350
Why should I be the employee of High Cookie

173
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,590
I thought of two results

174
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,170
Either you are a chef who hides the true identity rustling

175
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,330
Either the lunatic that I can't understand with my common sense

176
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,750
Which one of the two do you think

177
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:57,910
Indifferent

178
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,050
Because no matter which one will accept my proposal

179
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,970
proposal

180
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,810
Dress with me

181
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,460
The two of us are

182
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,020
This is my place, right

183
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,350
This is what I help you

184
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,000
Park Xizhen passed my question to you

185
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,750
I also told you that this question is wrong

186
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,630
Um

187
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,810
Am I too easy to accept

188
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,540
Your confession

189
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,380
See you, even thank you

190
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,310
Please have a meal. Today, there is nothing delicious in the cafeteria

191
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,810
Going to school is a violation of school rules

192
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,930
What school rules

193
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,100
Cheap

194
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,280
It's really hard to eat tonic for dinner

195
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,370
What to eat for dinner

196
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,060
That's the one

197
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,850
Fried blue fish

198
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:38,900
Fried fish

199
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,650
I can really go out, right?

200
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:50,840
Um

201
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,740
But before that

202
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,360
Do you help me another thing

203
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,900
I just invite you to dinner

204
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,700
Hello

205
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,540
sorry

206
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,680
He is your boyfriend

207
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,440
So I ask you about your business

208
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,490
it is done

209
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,500
for you

210
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,170
Community

211
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,630
The name of the community application name Li Enshu is responsible for the teacher Liu Chengzheng's school year high school third/s class

212
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,960
Activities

213
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,010
Thank you

214
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,240
Nothing, I don’t work hard

215
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,910
At the beginning I was still trying to get the list of classmates

216
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,680
But after the rumors of you two spread

217
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,500
There are more than thirty applicants in less than five minutes

218
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,050
It also includes the academic year

219
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,230
Write your name in advance

220
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,340
OK

221
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,060
How did the teacher find the teacher?

222
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,850
He said he saw in the teaching office

223
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:19,090
Take the initiative to talk to me and be happy to help

224
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,480
It's so good

225
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,450
I thought the teacher didn't know that I was from Class F

226
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,760
Responsible for teacher Liu Chengzhang's school year high school third/S class

227
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,140
It seems that she is a student you love very much

228
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,120
Look at you so often

229
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,410
Of course it has come to her, but my student

230
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,000
Teacher, you are better than her family

231
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,830
Her sister will only make money in time

232
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,750
Never came

233
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,990
Even me

234
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,610
Haven't seen her yet

235
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,680
She seems to be busy

236
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,600
Don't say how busy it is

237
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,290
Leave a child alone here, I have never been here

238
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,570
Does this look like

239
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,510
Don't worry about she will come soon

240
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,690
Teacher, you really

241
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,700
She couldn't make a phone call

242
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,660
How could it come here?

243
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,630
I will definitely let her come

244
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,970
What did you see after eating cookies?

245
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,590
What can be, of course, the dream of Minying woke up

246
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,260
Really

247
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,390
The cookies I have eaten

248
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,500
Not so false

249
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,540
Do you eat cookies too

250
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,520
If I eat it

251
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,440
What do you see

252
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:04,870
that is

253
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:06,600
healthily

254
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,200
For a long time

255
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,210
A dream of living ordinary like others

256
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,690
It's really false

257
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,080
I just imitate you

258
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,330
Then don't be curious about each other

259
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,250
To be honest, I also dream of you

260
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,980
Not very interested

261
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,810
Then you mean that your real dream is others

262
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,010
Do you have cash

263
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,290
What

264
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,830
The rice is my guest

265
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,360
You also invite one

266
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,820
How did so much

267
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,280
Choose a photo frame

268
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:52,800
What to press

269
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,620
Haven't you ever photographed?

270
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,280
Of course I haven't taken it

271
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,570
I don’t know if you feed you

272
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,280
Try it casually

273
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,510
It should be okay

274
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,540
Select the shooting method Remote control shooting existing automatic shooting

275
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,710
Choose a payment method bank card cash payment

276
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,340
Please put the amount required for amount required 5000 Input cash amount 0 shooting
banknote entrance

277
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,750
Permanent

278
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,540
I said it was not afraid

279
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,570
We all say what happened

280
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,730
What happened just now?

281
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,800
What do we have to look at?

282
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,650
Learn to see where to see ...

283
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,170
Do we have to take a closer to shoot?

284
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,040
Hey, let's like this, let's make rabbits, rabbits, rabbits

285
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:37,120
The last one

286
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,820
knew

287
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,780
Zhenyu shouldn't like her very much, right?

288
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,730
Li Enshu

289
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,340
Hard to say

290
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,980
You look good

291
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,380
There is only one love

292
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,950
If you like it, you have to have at least three

293
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:07,110
I think they seem to like each other

294
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,760
Come on, what do you know?

295
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,090
Wait for it

296
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,300
The two of them will break up for a long time

297
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,650
I really can't understand Zhenyu

298
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,350
I don't understand why he pushed you away

299
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,940
you are pretty

300
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,340
Also know how to wear it

301
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,940
Learning is okay

302
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,370
good...

303
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,530
Still very kind

304
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,740
I didn't cry

305
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,500
Well, I know

306
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,700
It's just a bit annoying

307
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,190
Suddenly it becomes C, C, etc.

308
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:02,410
Because a discomfort is embarrassed

309
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,100
And their relationship

310
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,830
班 Why is the squad leader not here today?

311
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,480
I haven't been so happy for a long time

312
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,620
Please give me more advice in the future

313
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,050
See you to see the words of Haoxiu back to school

314
00:26:59,050 --> 00:26:59,720
Contact ...
I will contact you again

315
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,660
I can't bear this kind of thing

316
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,150
Don't move Xu Haoxiu in the future

317
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,190
I just wanted to break up for a day

318
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,410
how

319
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,720
Are you worried about that kid

320
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,620
no

321
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,670
This looks naive like this

322
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,590
Li Enshu's boyfriend

323
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,570
How about the reactions of the classmates

324
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,070
Just like expected everyone, everyone responded a lot

325
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,910
Park Xizhen is indeed a fast way

326
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,940
It's almost ready now

327
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,690
As long as it is officially operated well

328
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,420
you are amazing

329
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,920
I have never thought about this kind of thing

330
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,090
This is of course

331
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,060
You like this should not have such an idea

332
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,050
correct

333
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,380
Can your math notes lend me to see?

334
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,000
What

335
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,810
I have to learn in the near future

336
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,560
It may also happen as sudden as today

337
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,450
besides

338
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,400
This is naturally natural

339
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,930
Because I am now Li Enshu

340
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,590
Um

341
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,800
Of course

342
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,940
Li Enshu

343
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:48,180
Empty
empty

344
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,260
Empty
use

345
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,160
Grace

346
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:45,230
Encourage to consult

347
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:46,850
Li Enshu

348
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,070
Grace

349
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,030
Can't hear?

350
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,560
I said let's consult

351
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,510
I'm sorry, I concentrate on writing the questions and don’t hear the questions

352
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,480
earphone...

353
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,280
Go
