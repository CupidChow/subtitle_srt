00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,671
Hey, Song Jin Woo

3
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,979
Isn't he being excessive?

4
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,315
Hurry up, go, go, go

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,361
What are you doing? Stop it already

6
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,849
What are you thinking about?

7
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:24,853
Huh?

8
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,276
Everyone will think they don't know

9
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,403
Min Young's sister isn't here, it's your sister

10
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,117
What do you mean?

11
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,869
What does it have to do with Min Young?

12
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,420
I know everything

13
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,258
Cookie

14
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,098
The kids are listening

15
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,404
Did you already know?

16
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,906
That I'm Cookie's seller?

17
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,657
Huh?

18
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,994
Before you get surprised, check your surroundings first

19
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,580
Huh?

20
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,877
Nothing

21
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,718
What is it?

22
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,179
Shouldn't she know?

23
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,140
I already told her that

24
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,892
I'm working with you

25
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,274
So, how is Soo?

26
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,984
She knows everything?

27
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,529
Huh

28
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,035
Hey

29
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,329
Hey

30
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,251
Why did you assume?

31
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,836
You should have told me, okay?

32
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,423
Stop it, okay?

33
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,354
But if you betray me in front of the others

34
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,564
It's not good for our work

35
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,236
Hey, hey, listen

36
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,113
What? - What's its name? -

37
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,948
What is this? - What? -

38
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:42,949
Who is it?

39
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,159
Lee Eun Soo? - He must have gone crazy -

40
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,703
Why did she fool Jin Woo?

41
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,496
Yeah, she rejected the transfer student

42
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,541
It's really embarrassing

43
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:55,920
If you fall for Jin Woo

44
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,548
The other kids will distance themselves from you

45
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,384
Then your job will also have problems

46
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,722
Thank you for helping, but don't do this anymore

47
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,182
If it's because of me

48
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,477
What problem should arise to save Min Young?

49
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,528
It's not funny at all

50
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,239
Everyone must have figured it out by now

51
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,450
That the transfer student is involved with Song Jin Woo

52
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,494
His job is done now - Is he feeling better? -

53
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,705
Hey, is it him? Is it the transfer student?

54
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,665
The one who bullied Jin Woo

55
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,250
Is it him? - Yeah -

56
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,252
How is he going to handle Jin Woo?

57
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,004
Look

58
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,381
Everyone is looking

59
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,885
Do you think I didn't know myself?

60
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,511
That if I fall for Jin Woo

61
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,096
Will there be a commotion at school?

62
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,152
You come too

63
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,246
I knew everything. It turned out exactly as I wanted

64
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,499
Now that I've experienced it, I understand that

65
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,335
What do these kids really want?

66
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,261
And what I should do

67
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,019
And how to do it

68
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,770
Look carefully

69
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,523
Our work starts now

70
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,485
Four, one

71
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,986
Two

72
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,072
Three

73
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:52,949
Four

74
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,616
...a bit

75
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,368
Isn't it strange?

76
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:38,911
What?

77
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,122
Because the options were very difficult

78
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,041
It wasn't at the level of a high school student at all

79
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,043
Even Song Jin Woo had some mistakes

80
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:49,171
...but still, a perfect score

81
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,925
The exams were conducted with utmost security and fairness

82
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,969
Are you saying the questions were leaked?

83
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,597
...no, no, no. That's not what I meant

84
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,767
I was just surprised

85
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,687
Because a genius came to our school

86
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,023
As a teacher, I should deal with the changes in the special class members

87
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,774
...from first place to Lee Eun Soo

88
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,777
And from tenth place to Park Hee Jin

89
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,697
Hey, listen - Is it reasonable? -

90
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,241
Is it the same Lee Eun Soo who got involved with Song Jin Woo?

91
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,453
Hey, with Song Jin Woo, who is second, there is a difference of 30 points

92
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,539
He must be good

93
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,249
Why did you come so early?

94
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,870
It's not over yet

95
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,415
I know you're going to another class

96
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,173
This is for the farewell party

97
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,926
Whatever happens, we're friends

98
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,511
On the other hand, I really showed courage for this

99
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,602
Even if you're first in the special class

100
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,106
...

101
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,943
It's still really hard to do this behind Jin Woo's back

102
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,322
But who am I?

103
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,742
You're my first friend in this school

104
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,874
Buddy

105
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,961
Can you do me a favor?

106
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,725
Solve this

107
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,312
This is one of the math questions that only you answered correctly

108
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,606
I changed some of the numbers

109
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,609
Can you prove that

110
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,110
Can you solve all the questions

111
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,614
It's for hard work

112
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,657
Because some of the kids

113
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,827
Doubt you and have misunderstandings

114
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,671
What doubt and misunderstanding?

115
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,509
Well, because you're rich

116
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,512
Maybe you've bribed to get the answer key

117
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,389
Or maybe you've stolen it

118
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,641
Or

119
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,686
Since

120
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,604
...you're really beautiful

121
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,654
How much time do I have?

122
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,156
Until when?

123
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,741
Right now

124
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,452
Solve it on the whiteboard

125
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,914
So everyone can see

126
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,893
Can't solve it? - Can't you solve it? -

127
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,773
Is it him?

128
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,361
On that side

129
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,989
Don't solve it

130
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,618
Did you go to the cinema?

131
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,788
Your friend became first, you should congratulate him

132
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,707
What is this about, really?

133
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,376
Are you waiting for him to make a mistake?

134
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,961
Stay aside

135
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,714
He's having a good time

136
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,684
I can't solve it anymore

137
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,148
Are you saying you can't solve it?

138
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,443
What does this mean?

139
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,364
Because some of the numbers changed, you can't solve it?

140
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,532
That's not the point

141
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,201
It can't be solved anymore

142
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,205
Don't you understand?

143
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,417
This function is irrational, and its numbers are irrational too

144
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,836
I can't find the definite integral

145
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,090
What does that mean?

146
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,012
You yourself don't know the answer, do you?

147
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,515
It's obvious from your tone

148
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,059
I understand

149
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,979
It doesn't matter, you made the mistake yourself

150
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,064
I got it confirmed by Jin Woo

151
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,732
He said the numbers can be changed like this

152
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,692
I'm sorry

153
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,404
Well, I also made a mistake in the question

154
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,411
That's why I made a mistake

155
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,913
I think Jin Woo is right

156
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,541
This question can't be solved

157
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,130
Wait

158
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,465
I'll ask the teacher another question

159
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,469
I think you should apologize first

160
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,515
Not that you torture him again and again

161
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,978
...friend

162
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,772
My daughter

163
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,482
Your girlfriend?

164
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,410
Can't you handle being bothered because of me?

165
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,746
Thanks to you, I became famous

166
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,999
Now everyone in the school knows me

167
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,085
You say it as if that was your goal

168
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:29,465
You can't easily sell something when you're a member of class F

169
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,841
Well?

170
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,551
I thought about it a lot

171
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:36,555
You're rich, you have parties, and you're good at school

172
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,683
So why do you have to work at the bakery?

173
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,977
There are two possibilities

174
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,522
Either you're that Chef no one knows

175
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,777
Or you're a lunatic beyond my comprehension

176
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,448
Which one do you think it is?

177
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,452
It doesn't matter

178
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,330
Because you're going to accept my offer

179
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,707
Offer?

180
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,963
Make an appointment with me

181
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,717
We are making an appointment

182
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,223
He's making an appointment with Jin Woo

183
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,933
What? Really?

184
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,027
This is my place, isn't it?

185
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,664
I helped you, didn't I?

186
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,292
Park Hee Jin sent me the question

187
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,962
And asked me if there was a problem

188
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,340
Yeah

189
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,845
Did I accept it very easily?

190
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,805
I'm confessing to you

191
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,766
You didn't thank me at all

192
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,530
So instead, treat me to a meal. The food tonight isn't good

193
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,785
But according to the school rules, we're not allowed to go out

194
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,121
Rules? Forget about it

195
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,665
I'll get cheap food

196
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,625
Well, tonight's food is really bad

197
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
What is the food anyway?

198
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,507
...that

199
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,426
Fried squid with empty head

200
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,344
Gosen-ti

201
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,060
Can we really go out without anyone noticing?

202
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,398
Yes.

203
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,910
But before that,

204
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,704
Come and listen to something.

205
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,206
Then I'll treat you as a guest.

206
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,178
Hello.

207
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,267
Sorry. Because he's your boyfriend.

208
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,771
So? What happened to what I wanted?

209
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,688
I did it.

210
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,024
Come.

211
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,362
Forum?

212
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,578
Thank you.

213
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,205
You're welcome.

214
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,084
At first, I didn't know how to approach getting a membership.

215
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,837
But thanks to the rumors behind you,

216
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,715
Within five minutes, over 30 people volunteered.

217
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,260
And that includes all the classes.

218
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,556
I wrote your name myself. Does it matter?

219
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,274
Where did you find the responsible teacher?

220
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,775
You saw me in the teachers' office.

221
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,486
And he volunteered to help himself.

222
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,946
That turned out really well, didn't it?

223
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,615
I thought because my teacher from FM class doesn't know me,

224
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,507
It's clear that visiting him every day means a lot to you.

225
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,509
It's obvious that he's very important to you.

226
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,680
I should come too. He's my student.

227
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,267
At least he has the best family.

228
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,729
His so-called sister only sends him money.

229
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,356
I've never even heard his voice.

230
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,777
I don't even know what he looks like.

231
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,989
His head is definitely busy.

232
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,949
No matter how busy his head is.

233
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,160
It's true that the child...

234
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,037
Leave him here and let him not come to see him once?

235
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,040
Don't worry. He'll come soon.

236
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,208
Thank you.

237
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,169
He doesn't even call.

238
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,546
Do you think so?

239
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,924
He comes however he can.

240
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,276
When you eat a cookie, what dream do you have?

241
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,783
It's obvious. I see Min Yoongi waking up.

242
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,659
Seriously?

243
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,704
But the things I see...

244
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,791
They're not that fake.

245
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,335
Do you eat cookies too?

246
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,837
So what?

247
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,547
What do you see?

248
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,175
Well...

249
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,927
That for years and years...

250
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,512
I'm healthy too.

251
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,348
And like everyone else, I have a normal life.

252
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,228
AAAH, it's not fake at all.

253
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,314
AAAH, I was imitating you.

254
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,611
So let's not be curious.

255
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:28,156
Honestly, I'm not curious about your dream either.

256
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,122
So you mean you actually have another dream?

257
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,000
Do you have cash?

258
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,418
What?

259
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,295
I invited you over.

260
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,672
Now it's your turn.

261
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,386
Why are they so many?

262
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,973
Which one should I press?

263
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,017
You... haven't done this before, have you?

264
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,102
No, I haven't.

265
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,021
...Um, well, I don't know.

266
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,148
Just press whichever one you can.

267
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,899
I think this one might work.

268
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,109
Yeah, I don't know.

269
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,616
Huh? Oh, I'm seeing it now.

270
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,660
Wow! I told you I wouldn't wear this, didn't I?

271
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,495
Hey, why? It's good - *smiling*.

272
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:17,747
What happened? Did you take a photo?

273
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,625
What happened? Where should I look?

274
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,419
...I need to know, well.

275
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,463
Should I go closer?

276
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,007
Look, look.

277
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,009
Hey, smile, smile.

278
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,760
Let's be rabbits.

279
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,179
Two, three - *smiling*.

280
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,268
This is the last time, okay?

281
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,896
Smile.

282
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,867
Jennie often ignores Lee on that side.

283
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,826
She doesn't like him, right?

284
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,579
Okay.

285
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,123
See it properly and clearly.

286
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,168
She has only placed one heart. If she really liked him, she should have at least placed three.

287
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,255
In my opinion, they both like each other.

288
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,842
Leave it. What do you know anyway?

289
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,596
Be patient and see.

290
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,181
They'll break up soon.

291
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,612
Ah...

292
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,698
I also don't understand Jennie.

293
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,743
I don't know why she's rejecting you.

294
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:41,373
You're beautiful, well-dressed, and good at your studies.

295
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,707
...and...

296
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,252
Kind... yes.

297
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:49,297
I don't cry.

298
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,966
Oh, okay.

299
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,718
I'm just a little nervous.

300
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,765
Suddenly, I ranked first in the special class.

301
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,686
I messed up my own math question.

302
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,522
...and they're adding these two as well.

303
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,740
Damn it, why does the food have to be so spicy today?

304
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,021
What's wrong?

305
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,773
Thanks to you, I had a good time.

306
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,068
Let's have each other's back from now on.

307
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,159
When you arrive at school, come and see each other.

308
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,286
I'll give you the news.

309
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,373
I can't stand these things.

310
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,542
Stop bothering Suho.

311
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,463
Hey, are you doing something? Let's hang out one day.

312
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,715
Why?

313
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,884
Worried about that exchange student?

314
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:22,182
No, I mean as Suho's boyfriend.

315
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,017
You seem like a kid and lazy.

316
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,902
How did the guys react?

317
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,404
They were as angry as we expected.

318
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,367
Hay Jin also feels a bit grumpy at the park.

319
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,079
We're almost ready.

320
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,998
We officially have to start the sales job.

321
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,541
You really have no idea.

322
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,336
I never thought of such a method.

323
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,421
It has to be this way.

324
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,133
Because a good boy like you would never do such things.

325
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,972
By the way,

326
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,225
Can you give me your notes?

327
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,643
What?

328
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:09,229
I think I need to study for a while.

329
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:12,357
Until something like today doesn't happen again.

330
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,652
It makes me look more natural.

331
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,612
No matter what, I am Suho now.

332
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,199
Oh, okay.

333
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,007
... Suho.

334
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,301
Suho, let's go for counseling.

335
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,136
Suho.

336
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,472
Suho!

337
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,895
Did you hear? Let's go for counseling.

338
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,529
... Ah.

339
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,573
Sorry, I was focused on this issue and didn't hear your voice.

340
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,074
... Earphones.

341
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,746
Ah!

342
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,624
Let's go.
