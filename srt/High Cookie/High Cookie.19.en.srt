[Students are murmuring]

368
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,264
[urgent breathing]

369
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,851
[tire rubbing sound]

370
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:17,706
thank you

371
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,376
What are you thankful for?

372
00:26:22,002 --> 00:26:23,420
You made the decision

373
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:25,839
[Hosu] You’ll be able to handle it too.

374
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,135
You&#39;ve already used quite a bit, right?

375
00:26:31,261 --> 00:26:32,554
I put it there yesterday

376
00:26:33,596 --> 00:26:34,764
uh?

377
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:37,517
How can you go to school as soon as you get it?

378
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,477
[Meaningful music]

379
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:40,770
[Lake laughs]

380
00:26:40,854 --> 00:26:43,440
But I guess you just sold it instead of eating it?

381
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,108
that

382
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:48,194
How do you know?

383
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,530
If I ate it

384
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:52,615
&#39;Cause you&#39;re dead now

385
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:55,368
[Tense music]

386
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:01,041
[Hosu] I concentrated it to 10 times the usual amount.

387
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,629
If you take just one bite, you&#39;ll die.

388
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,716
How much did you sell?

389
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,051
[Heavy sound effect]

390
00:27:13,636 --> 00:27:14,679

392
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:20,643
- [Emphasis sound effect] - [Heejin sobs]

393
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,146
You killed it

394
00:27:23,938 --> 00:27:25,190
[Lake] Everything

395
00:27:27,192 --> 00:27:29,235
The school must be in chaos by now.

396
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:32,447
[Heejin’s sobbing]

397
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,282
[Student 1] Come to your senses, hey!

398
00:27:34,366 --> 00:27:35,575
Hey, Kwak Minjun!

399
00:27:35,658 --> 00:27:36,659
[Heejin’s scared voice]

400
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:38,244
[Student 2] No, what kind of drugs did you take?

401
00:27:38,328 --> 00:27:40,288
[The students are noisy]

402
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,336
[Lake] Aren’t dozens of people dying at once?

403
00:27:48,463 --> 00:27:50,131
Because of the cookies you sold

404
00:27:51,758 --> 00:27:52,967
[Sooyoung] It’s a joke, right?

405
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,594
Don&#39;t play around

406
00:27:54,677 --> 00:27:56,554
When will I be able to handle it?

407
00:27:56,638 --> 00:27:58,390
He said he wanted to become a chef

408
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:00,850
[Hosu] Shouldn’t you have eaten it instead?

409
00:28:01,434 --> 00:28:03,269
Then the kids would have lived

410
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,939
You can&#39;t believe it...

411
00:28:06,022 --> 00:28:08,149
- [Dark music] - [Sooyoung] Is this revenge?

412
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:10,944
Then you have to take revenge on me.

413
00:28:11,027 --> 00:28:12,737
Why customers who don’t care!

414
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:14,030
Did I sell it?

415
00:28:14,614 --> 00:28:15,949
[Hosu] You sold it

416
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:18,410
of course

417
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:20,954
Of course I got revenge on you too.

418
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:22,497
[Music stops]

419
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,375
I also gave it to Minyoung Choi.
