2
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,730
I heard that creating this community is your idea

3
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,690
Yes

4
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,940
It has nothing to do with grades and liberal arts and sciences

5
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,820
I want to discuss the teaching content freely

6
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,780
For example

7
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,870
A new theme is set every month

8
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,290
If the theme of cultural heritage

9
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,210
Analyze it from the perspective you want to learn

10
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,460
If it is mathematics

11
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,170
Then start from the mathematical ratio contained in cultural heritage

12
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,130
If it is chemistry

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,090
Start from how to preserve cultural heritage with chemical methods

14
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,340
The way they are published are carried out

15
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,510
First of all, let's take a look at Jingfu Palace's diligence hall

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,060
This diligence

17
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,440
Contains a mathematical law called golden ratio

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,940
What is the golden ratio?

19
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,150
That is the horizontal and vertical ratio of 2: 1

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,330
Are these all you think alone?

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,660
This is what I started thinking before

22
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,790
I think this can make thinking more comprehensive three -dimensional

23
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,500
Teacher, you also know that it is not interesting if you just look at it

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,050
But I look at this

25
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,470
There is also a part of personal discussion with the head of the community

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,390
what is that

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,310
that

28
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:08,020
Society Classroom A
Because I don’t want to finish writing the paper according to the discussion, it is over

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,860
If you can, you want to give some feedback here

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,940
I am obviously ready

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,240
But I was still very nervous in front

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,860
After discussing the content of the published content

33
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,450
People outside the discussion will decline in efficiency and concentration

34
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,540
Do you want to do better

35
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,210
Try it

36
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,920
Can help you

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,540
So if you talk alone

38
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,880
You can communicate more concentratedly

39
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,470
Thanks

40
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,090
It is because your permission can make these realize

41
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,260
I am even more thank you

42
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,600
I heard other teachers say that your class is also well spread everywhere

43
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,140
Do you know yourself

44
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,070
Maybe it's been a long time since I touched it. I miss it, right?

45
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,820
I just feel very interesting

46
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,110
What

47
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,530
I can't do such an activity when I was in the United States

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,620
Back to South Korea after many years to do these

49
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,040
I feel like I like it

50
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,290
good

51
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,710
so what

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,090
I gave you time as you said

53
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,510
Did you find any discovery during this time?

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,850
I heard that the day Song Zhenyu was not in South Korea on the day two years ago

55
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,200
I went to the United States two weeks before the incident

56
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,410
Then I stayed in the United States for more than a month

57
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,990
So chef

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,500
Not Song Zhenyu

59
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,370
Few people know

60
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,790
The diagnosis of rare diseases is also looking for treatment methods

61
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,210
But in the end it was not treated

62
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,260
I am not interested in those who are not interested in

63
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,630
Who is the chef

64
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,300
that

65
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,720
Haven't you found it yet?

66
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,830
Have I said?

67
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,790
Park Zaixian is still alive

68
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,710
It's amazing

69
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,590
Can survive in the oil barrel

70
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,260
But what should I do?

71
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,180
He said to my men

72
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,930
As long as he puts it, he can find the chef faster than you

73
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,900
Let me use him not to use you

74
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,190
But I told him

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,530
Don't be funny

76
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,450
No one is faster than us Jianyu

77
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,950
I believe in him

78
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,870
We Jianyu

79
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,660
It only takes a few days to bring the result back

80
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,670
so

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,920
Do you have any plans

82
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,220
I plan to use Cui Xiuying

83
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,810
How to do it

84
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,110
I will tell you the results directly

85
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,900
Come and drink

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,610
This is my favorite drink in school coffee shops

87
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,830
Is there such a drink on the menu?

88
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,370
Add whipped cream mango strawberries to the sand ice

89
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,290
Sprinkle syrup and chocolate again

90
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,210
Why give us this

91
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,670
Why

92
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,970
Because we are friends

93
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,010
Drink

94
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,110
This is also the tanyuan knitting meaning, right?

95
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,660
Liu Bei Guan Yu Zhang Fei

96
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,790
Taoyuan Jieyi

97
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,580
cheers

98
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,460
cheers

99
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,590
Let's worship it

100
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,650
She has gone without drinking

101
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,190
Why do you keep drinking it all the time

102
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,320
Didn't you say that this is Taoyuan Jieyi

103
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,830
It's too sweet

104
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,290
Do you know that you will feel funny if you look closely?

105
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,380
Where is the funny

106
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,010
You must have a lot of friends when you were in school before, right?

107
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,140
Look like

108
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,020
right

109
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,230
Are you attracted by me?

110
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,160
but

111
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,830
What would you do if Min Ying woke up

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,710
What

113
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,250
Will the book completely disappear?

114
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,430
Nothing to deal with in school

115
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,930
Maybe I will end this time in the United States

116
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,060
It feels a bit sad

117
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,980
Whether it's me or other classmates

118
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,810
Only a few days

119
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,570
Can't drink anymore

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,160
No

121
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,250
what

122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,500
Give you
-Me I -Um

123
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,170
Come on
I can

124
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,760
Well you can do

125
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,840
very good

126
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,010
Coming

127
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,390
-The hit -do well

128
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,980
then

129
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm going to pick up

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,250
Xiu Ying

131
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,460
It's you, Xiuying

132
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,800
What is the book? I will throw the ball over

133
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,430
Factory director

134
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,350
haven't seen you for a long time

135
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,270
How did you come to school

136
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,560
I just want to ask you what you come to school to do

137
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,570
Li Enshu

138
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,030
Are they calling you?

139
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,410
I happen to go to school too

140
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,910
Do you leave together?

141
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,540
Ah good

142
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,750
Hello

143
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:22,430
Do you say you come to school to donate scholarships?

144
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,600
My second child wants to come to this school too

145
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,270
But his grades are a bit difficult to enter school

146
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,060
So as a parent, you can only try your best ability to try your best

147
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,110
how about you

148
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,530
I'm a little surprised to see you come to school

149
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,240
At the beginning, I still wondered if I confessed to the wrong person

150
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,830
Because the image has become too much

151
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,870
I clean up here

152
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,090
What

153
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,670
I can't continue working because of some things

154
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,340
Have you heard of my sister?

155
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,800
Xiu Ying

156
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:07,220
I just want to work in a school that my sister has been on

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,140
There is a sister who doesn’t know when I can wake up again

158
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:13,360
The feeling of going to school for her

159
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,610
I understand that kind of mood

160
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:23,740
Can I ask you one thing

161
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,780
certainly

162
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,410
I hope you don't talk to other teachers about me

163
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,420
What are you afraid of coming out?

164
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,090
Are you afraid of anyone who comes out something bad?

165
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,840
Is the atmosphere that disrupts the school?

166
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,390
You really understand me

167
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,890
But I can't just forget it

168
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,730
How about telling the grade minister

169
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,400
-Ings to tell you for you -no need anymore

170
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
It's fine

171
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,070
I will watch it myself

172
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,240
I think I can help you mention it so

173
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,030
-Don't you have a burden -I said no need

174
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,490
I don't think I want to hear any words that I say so

175
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,960
Uncle, you have come here

176
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,630
Are you Mr. Liu Chengzheng?

177
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,010
Yes, I just called you Liu Chengzhang

178
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,810
This is Cui Xiuying who worked in my factory before

179
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,810
Do cleaning in this school now

180
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,020
It's been a long time since I saw this time I saw it this time

181
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,280
Hello

182
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,080
Then go in and chat with the minister

183
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,290
He should be waiting for you

184
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,080
good

185
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,620
In short, I will ask you if Xiu Ying's words

186
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,460
Okay, I will take care

187
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,340
Thanks for your hard work

188
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,000
-On again -uh

189
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,360
Can you chat a little?

190
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,780
-thanks, thanks

191
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,660
Thanks

192
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,210
Where is the grace?

193
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,140
Suddenly chatting with an uncle and left and left

194
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,010
Uncle?

195
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:52,970
Um

196
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,100
Uncle wearing a suit

197
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,480
Maybe it's the father of Enshu, right?

198
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,080
Vast

199
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,880
He seems to be a mistake

200
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,260
I heard what an accident in his daughter in this school

201
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,770
What do you know

202
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,810
no

203
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,440
How did you know

204
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:53,160
If you do a chef in school, you can help you wake you up with Min Ying?

205
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,290
So what you have done before Minying

206
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,590
Civil Service Certificate Cui Jianyu Police Department

207
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,140
so

208
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,600
Are you a policeman?

209
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,390
Sorry Xiuying

210
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,400
Min Ying becomes like this

211
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,860
It's all because of me

212
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,240
It seems to be that uncle

213
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,410
Uncle who walked away with En Book

214
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,710
Isn't that uncle Park Smart's father?

215
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,630
The school had made a big trouble after the death of Park Smart

216
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,590
Hello

217
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,180
This is some information about Minying on the day of the incident

218
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,860
Naimin

219
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,490
Have been reported to the police

220
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,750
But is it still that like that

221
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,250
The chef noticed that it was strange to do it in advance

222
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,590
sorry

223
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,960
Is this what you said now?

224
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,880
You all know what she has become now

225
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,930
I'm sorry, is it finished?

226
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,840
I have no face to see you

227
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,970
But I think what should be recognized still must be acknowledged

228
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,520
If you should apologize, apologize well

229
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,520
So we can cooperate together

230
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,320
What are you talking about now

231
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,730
Together

232
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,820
Do you cooperate?

233
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,360
I will catch the chef's

234
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,530
Grasp with you as soon as possible

235
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,200
If I can't help you

236
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,090
Think about your sister

237
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,810
You also know that Min Ying, she doesn't want to pull you into the water

238
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,060
Want to save you all your best

239
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,060
After get off work recently, I went to see Minying every day

240
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,900
You haven’t went to see Minying for a long time, right?

241
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,950
There is bedsore on the back of Minying's back

242
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,260
Fortunately, I found that it was treated immediately in time

243
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,800
What did you say

244
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,480
Xiu Ying

245
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,970
Please give me another chance to prove myself

246
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,570
Consulting room

247
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,470
Where are you going? I have been looking for you for a long time

248
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,440
Nothing happens, can you okay?

249
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,970
What

250
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,290
I heard that Park Smart Dad came to school and met you

251
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,740
He didn't recognize me

252
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,670
Good luck, successful and deceived past

253
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,330
Give you your phone

254
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,570
Thank you

255
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,630
I didn't forget you

256
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,320
The school's affairs are too busy

257
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:13,800
Study for exams and work

258
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,360
Can't get time at all

259
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,250
sorry

260
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,040
I have decided to start at least now

261
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,630
I'm here to apologize to you

262
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,720
Sorry Min Ying

263
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,250
I listen to your method first

264
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,940
How do you find the chef out

265
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,280
Is there anything recently?

266
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,440
I think you are a bit strange

267
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:56,250
Don't go to the community and have become less

268
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,090
Not concentrated now

269
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,630
Vast

270
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,040
How about sending Li Enshu to the United States faster than imagining

271
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,830
Does it mean to speed up sales speed?

272
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,280
Don't participate in community activities in the future

273
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,260
You return to the previous look

274
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,030
I do n’t know what I just focus on reading ...

275
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,440
Just like that

276
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,130
No matter what I do, don't help me help me

277
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,650
Don't act safely

278
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,920
What are you talking about, I don't accept

279
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,420
Have a good opportunity

280
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,510
There is a police officer in the school to help me

281
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:08,200
The core component of the awakening and causing hallucinations

282
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,910
Definitely not made in the laundry room

283
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,540
Why do you say that

284
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,370
He cannot take his own exclusive secret

285
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,790
Share with the staff

286
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,480
It is impossible to show up in person

287
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,400
So although it is troublesome

288
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,110
But the chef will definitely send the ingredients to the washing room regularly

289
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,260
There are so many orders to pile up so only that can only be used to receive orders

290
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:48,590
You have to know who it is, how did you accept it

291
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,100
can you do it

292
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,380
I try it once

293
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,710
You came

294
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,660
Did you bring it?

295
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,950
This is the list of new customers. I think it is better to write it yourself

296
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,430
If you send it with a SMS, you may be hacked

297
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,970
There will be dangerous

298
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,840
You have to know that your job now is really easy

299
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,490
Anyway, it's just a job of moving your mind

300
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,120
You see, I have both brain and my body

301
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,390
Don't touch

302
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:42,470
I will watch you, don't touch it myself

303
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,190
knew

304
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,740
Use text messages next time, don’t get rid of clothes without any idleness

305
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,460
Hurry up

306
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,980
It's time to dinner and order the laundry room. You have to close it.

307
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,370
She is now departing

308
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,590
I'm not sure what to do

309
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,190
Can you track it? I'm consulting

310
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,450
Well

311
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,450
Tell me at any time

312
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,920
I will contact me if I will answer your phone call

313
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,480
Self -service storage cabinet

314
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,080
Laundry

315
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,750
boarding

316
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,340
Get on the bus

317
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,750
Song Zhenyu

318
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,480
淦 淦 淦 淦 淦 淦

319
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,050
This is a trap

320
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,950
You are optimistic

321
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
Who are you being followed

322
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,510
The chef also sees it too

323
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,210
You are betraying the organization

324
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,730
When do you want to say

325
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,090
Say it

326
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,410
Why do you help me

327
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:59,520
Because I didn't hear it last time

328
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,300
What did you see after you finished cooking

329
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:11,210
Tell me now

330
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,460
Then I will tell you who the chef is

331
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,840
Do you know the chef

332
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,230
Um

333
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,170
But if you lie to me, I won't tell you

334
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,540
Life like now

335
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,130
What does it mean

336
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,530
Dress and eat delicious

337
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,630
Dating friends and reading

338
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,860
Life like this now

339
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,000
That's it

340
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,220
No Min Ying

341
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,770
Without Cui Xiuying

342
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,830
There is no damn scar

343
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,510
Simple to be Li Enshu

344
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,520
Sadly because of a few questions

345
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,800
Playing temper because the cafeteria meals are unpalatable

346
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,510
Which university is distressed

347
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,110
You will be jealous of friends and will rely on friends

348
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,320
Friends who can talk about all day

349
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,100
Life like now

350
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,700
This is my dream

351
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,500
On the day you broke into the washing room

352
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,690
That detoxification agent

353
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,170
Actually I gave it out

354
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:36,490
The great detoxification agent that can instantly eliminate the side effects of cookies

355
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,130
I am curious about what ingredients are inside

356
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,380
How many days are chefs

357
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,820
Is he really God?

358
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,300
But before the investigation, I found something extraordinary

359
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,260
I heard that someone woke up after I injected the physiological saline I dropped the bag

360
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,520
Then say that it is a detoxification agent

361
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,730
Yes, everything is a lie

362
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,540
He has never eaten cookies at all

363
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,320
Do you remember who is that guy?

364
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:30,610
The weakest and most innocent and harmless in the school

365
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,200
Just by our side

366
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,080
What we believe most

367
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,460
That boy

368
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,400
Just a chef
