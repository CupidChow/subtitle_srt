2
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,756
So the formation of that organization was all your idea?

3
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,591
Yes.

4
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,801
Regardless of the level and background.

5
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,929
I want everyone to discuss and converse together.

6
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,557
About what?

7
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,269
We choose a topic every month.

8
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,313
If we choose a cultural asset as the theme.

9
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,858
We analyze it from the perspective of our field of study.

10
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,401
If it's mathematics.

11
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,237
We discuss the mathematical ratios found in those cultural assets.

12
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,323
We also use chemistry to preserve cultural assets.

13
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,618
And we talk about chemical purification methods.

14
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,203
Well, first of all.

15
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:21,581
Let's first take a look at Gyeongjong Joon in Gwangjuksa Palace.

16
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,083
This Gyeongjong Joon.

17
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,127
It is constructed based on a mathematical theory called Geumgang.

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,837
What is the ratio of Geumgang?

19
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:32,675
It means the ratio of width to height, which is square root of 2 to 1.

20
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,433
Did you come up with this idea alone?

21
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,521
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

22
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,563
If I do this.

23
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,900
I can write a three-page academic resume.

24
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,655
As you know, ordinary academic resumes are no longer interesting.

25
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,618
I had a look at it and saw it.

26
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,246
Individual counseling has also been done, what's that?

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,249
...Oh.

28
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,875
That.

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,962
The goal is not just discussion and writing articles.

30
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,297
I wanted to provide feedback if possible.

31
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,925
What do you think? - \N I was preparing for it -

32
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,136
I was very stressed ahead of it.

33
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,888
When you present in front of everyone.

34
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,308
You may lose focus because of others.

35
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,811
Don't you want to perform better?

36
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,732
Try it out.

37
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,900
It will help you.

38
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:35,071
Because if I talk to them privately, they can focus more.

39
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,490
Thank you.

40
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,742
They are all thanks to you.

41
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,161
We were able to make this happen because of you.

42
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,329
I'm thankful to you too.

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,582
Well, I heard from the other teachers that

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,918
You also perform very well in class.

45
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,295
Did you know?

46
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,842
It's because I missed it for a long time.

47
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,303
It's enjoyable.

48
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,304
Really?

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,226
Because these things were not there in America.

50
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,022
It's great that I came to Korea after all this time and engage in these activities.

51
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,732
I see.

52
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,526
Yes, that's right.

53
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,281
Well, as you said, I gave you time.

54
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,617
Did you find something?

55
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,288
I found out that two years ago

56
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,248
That day, Sung Jin Woo was not in Korea.

57
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,137
Two years ago, he was in America.

58
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,598
And he stayed there for over a month.

59
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,767
So, Sung Jin Woo.

60
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,479
He's not okay.

61
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,732
No one knows, but apparently he had a rare disease.

62
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,984
Apparently, he was seeking treatment.

63
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,071
But he couldn't be cured.

64
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,406
I don't care about his illness.

65
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,825
Just tell me when he recovers.

66
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,412
...Him.

67
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,747
Haven't you found him yet?

68
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:32,981
Didn't I tell you?

69
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,025
Park Jae Hyun is still alive.

70
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,861
It's really tough to

71
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,365
be able to survive there until now.

72
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,619
But it was yesterday?

73
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,204
He told the kids that

74
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,331
if I set him free

75
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,667
he can find the cure faster than you.

76
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,087
He asked me to bring him instead of you.

77
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,256
I also told him

78
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,675
"Don't make fun of me."

79
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,470
"No one is more efficient than my Guo Wu."

80
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:07,098
"I believe in him."

81
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,142
"My dear Guo Wu."

82
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,645
"In a few more days, he can reach a conclusion."

83
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:18,693
Well.

84
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,070
Do you have any plans?

85
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,661
I want to use Choi Soo Young.

86
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,248
What's your plan?

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,257
I will tell you the final result.

88
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,012
Here you go, eat it.

89
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,806
Among all the things on the buffet, I like this the most.

90
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,934
Did our buffet have this and we didn't know?

91
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,313
It includes mashed fruits, mangoes, strawberries.

92
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,523
It also has syrup, ice cream, and chocolate chips.

93
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,487
Why did you buy this for us?

94
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,905
Well, obviously

95
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,491
because we like it.

96
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,117
Have some.

97
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,704
Sure.

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,306
It's kind of like the Three Kingdoms reunion \N (referring to Chinese history).

99
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,810
Li Bi, Guan Yu, Zhang Zhang.

100
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,979
The Three Kingdoms reunion?

101
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:40,858
Cheers.

102
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,529
Cheers.

103
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,282
I won't go easy on you.

104
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,673
Fine, I won't eat it anymore.

105
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,135
Then why are you eating it?

106
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,556
He said it's a Three Kingdoms reunion.

107
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,187
Oh.

108
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,981
Oh, it's very sweet.

109
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,069
Now that I think about it, it's really cute.

110
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,321
What?

111
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,992
You had a lot of friends when you used to go to school, didn't you?

112
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,494
I guess.

113
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,085
A little.

114
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,254
I was very noisy.

115
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,306
By the way,

116
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,019
What are you going to do now that Min Young has regained consciousness?

117
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,105
Huh?

118
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,191
I mean, back then.

119
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,276
Can't she be on the other side anymore?

120
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,784
Well, there's no reason for her to stay anymore.

121
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:18,039
Can we say that I went back to America, right?

122
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,209
I think it would be a bit upsetting.

123
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,711
Both for me and for others.

124
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,131
We were only together for a few days.

125
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,804
I can't eat it anymore.

126
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,814
No, no- \N Oh, what happened?-

127
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,737
Dahyun- \N Me?-

128
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,155
Yeah, fighting.

129
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,865
Can I go now? - \N Yes, you can-

130
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,077
Wow, that's great.

131
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm throwing.

132
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,377
Wow, bravo, bravo.

133
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,381
Catch it.

134
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,556
Oh- \N I'm going to get it-

135
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,816
So Young Shi? \N (Shi means Miss)

136
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,655
Is it you? So Young Shi?

137
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,703
Oh Soo, what are you doing? Throw the ball to me.

138
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,794
Director, I haven't seen you in a long time.

139
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,212
...Are you coming to school for what?

140
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,673
What do you do at school?

141
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,844
Li On-soo.

142
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,141
Are they calling you?

143
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,562
Actually, I wanted to go to school too.

144
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,147
Let's go together.

145
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,405
Hello.

146
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,830
Did you come to donate money to the school?

147
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,750
I want my second daughter to come to this school.

148
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,628
But her grades are a bit low.

149
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,588
As a father, I should...

150
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,340
do my best.

151
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,343
What are you doing here?

152
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,180
When I saw you at school, I was a little surprised.

153
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,224
At first, it took a while to recognize you.

154
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,143
Your appearance has changed a lot.

155
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,191
I clean here.

156
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,069
Really?

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,697
With my abilities, this is the only job I can do.

158
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,326
Do you know what happened to my sister?

159
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,786
Miss So Young.

160
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,413
Only.

161
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,541
I wanted to work at my sister's school.

162
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,461
It's not clear when she will regain consciousness.

163
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,506
Now I feel like I took her place at school.

164
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,134
I understand.

165
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,762
...Can I?

166
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,516
Can I ask you a favor?

167
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,809
Of course.

168
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,770
Can you talk to the teachers for me?

169
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,398
Don't say anything about me?

170
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,484
I'm afraid to give them an excuse.

171
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,903
Has anyone said anything?

172
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,863
They say you're ruining the school, Jo?

173
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,786
As I suspected, you understand.

174
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,831
We shouldn't just overlook this matter.

175
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,793
How about telling the management?

176
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,878
Or do you want me to tell them?

177
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,797
No, there's no need.

178
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,300
I'm aware myself.

179
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,804
It's because I can help you. Don't be formal.

180
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,013
There's no need.

181
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,184
I don't want to talk about it.

182
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,686
That's why I told you.

183
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,523
Thank you for coming.

184
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,446
Mr. Yoo Sung Pil?

185
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,823
Yes, I called you.

186
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,035
Ah, it's him.

187
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,372
Ms. Choi So Young used to work at my factory.

188
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,791
And now she works as a cleaner here.

189
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,253
I'm glad to see you.

190
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,593
Hello.

191
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,226
So go inside and talk to the director.

192
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,936
They're waiting for you- \N Ah, yes-

193
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,771
Anyway,

194
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,649
Keep an eye on So Young Shi.

195
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,067
Yes, definitely.

196
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,277
Good luck.

197
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,154
Yes, see you again.

198
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,466
Can we talk?

199
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,971
Thank you- \N Thank you very much-

200
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,348
Slowly

201
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,648
Thank you.

202
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,572
Where did Soo go?

203
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,118
I saw a guy and went with him.

204
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,705
A guy?

205
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,040
Yes.

206
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,251
He was wearing a suit.

207
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,920
Wasn't it her father?

208
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,112
I think they mistook me for someone else.

209
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:29,451
...I heard their daughter was here. Something happened to her.

210
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,878
How do you know?

211
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,837
I don't.

212
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,549
How did you find out?

213
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,471
So Hee said if...

214
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,392
If you work here, will it bring back Min Young?

215
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,437
Is that why you're doing the Min Young case?

216
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,163
Yeah.

217
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,498
Are you a police officer?

218
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,835
Sorry, Soo Young Shi.

219
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,671
Min Young because of me.

220
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,008
This disaster happened to her.

221
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,512
What?

222
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,766
That was that guy.

223
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,643
The one who went with Soo.

224
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,645
What?

225
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,730
He's Park Ji Hae's father.

226
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:43,734
The same Park Ji Hae who caused trouble and made the whole school go crazy.

227
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,738
Hey!

228
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:57,122
Min Young gave me this information on the day of the incident.

229
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,136
So Min Young...

230
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,642
Even though she told the police,

231
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,812
This disaster happened to her?

232
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,400
So Hee found out that she betrayed us and acted faster than us.

233
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,485
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,071
Is that all?

235
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,366
That kid, she became like this and...

236
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,909
Can you only say sorry?

237
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,036
I have no excuse.

238
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,914
I only accept what I must accept.

239
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,959
I will apologize as I must.

240
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,336
I think we can work together.

241
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,507
What did you just say?

242
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,842
Work together?

243
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:51,844
Together?

244
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,262
With your help, very soon...

245
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,681
We'll catch Soo Hee.

246
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,273
Shall we work together?

247
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,316
What if I don't agree?

248
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,319
This is not what your sister wanted.

249
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,572
You know that Min Young...

250
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,782
Because she didn't want you to get involved.

251
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,242
And because she wanted to save you.

252
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,619
That's why she tried her best.

253
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,965
These days, my work is finishing.

254
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,259
Every day I go to the hospital to see Min Young.

255
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,265
It's been a long time since you visited her, right?

256
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,354
Her wound got infected.

257
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,775
Thank God I found her and took care of her treatment.

258
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,817
What?

259
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,570
Soo Young Shi.

260
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,618
Please give me the chance

261
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,288
to prove myself.

262
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,892
Where were you?

263
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,644
I looked for you a lot.

264
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,271
...Ah.

265
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,608
Nothing happened, did it?

266
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,652
Are you okay?

267
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,028
What?

268
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,202
I heard Park Ji Hae's father was here.

269
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,495
He saw you too.

270
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,789
...Ah.

271
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,962
He couldn't recognize me.

272
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,547
I got lucky.

273
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,634
It's yours.

274
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,974
Thank you.

275
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,033
I haven't forgotten about you.

276
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,288
I'm busy at school.

277
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:12,252
There are exams and tests.

278
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,962
And there's work too.

279
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,719
I don't have time to waste.

280
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,521
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,365
I promise you that

282
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,159
I'll take care of myself from now on.

283
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,622
I came to apologize.

284
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,798
I'm sorry, Min Young.

285
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,457
First, I need to hear what you have to say.

286
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,127
How do you plan to catch Soo?

287
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,476
Have there been any recent events?

288
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,478
You've been acting a bit strange.

289
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,440
You're not coming to the association, you're not talking much.

290
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,028
And now you're not even focused.

291
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:02,612
I wonder why.

292
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,366
How about a little earlier?

293
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,077
Should we send Li Soo to America?

294
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,998
Are you saying you want to finish the sales job faster?

295
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,338
Don't come to the association anymore.

296
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,048
Just like always.

297
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,050
Pretend you don't know anything.

298
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,385
Study well.

299
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,428
And don't do anything.

300
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,139
No matter what I do, don't help me.

301
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,349
Just stay safe.

302
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,977
What are you saying? Say it clearly.

303
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,480
I seized an opportunity.

304
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:40,734
At school.

305
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,447
There is a police officer who wants to help me.

306
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,759
That ingredient in the cookie.

307
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,261
It keeps us awake and hallucinating.

308
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,139
It's not working in the laundry room.

309
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,893
Why?

310
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,647
He never follows the cooking instructions.

311
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,982
He doesn't give it to the laundry room staff.

312
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,694
And he never reveals his true identity.

313
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,655
And delivers it directly.

314
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,491
So, be careful.

315
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,661
Every once in a while.

316
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,122
He somehow gets the ingredients to the laundry room.

317
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,250
So that orders can be delivered on time.

318
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,630
So, I

319
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,507
Need to know when and who

320
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,760
receives the ingredients.

321
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,512
Can you do it?

322
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,475
I have to make an effort.

323
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,647
Did you come?

324
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,025
Lately, you come a lot.

325
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,196
The list of new customers.

326
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,658
I thought it would be better if I deliver it myself.

327
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,871
The phone might be hacked.

328
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,330
It's dangerous.

329
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,792
Anyway, they gave you something that is not easy.

330
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,213
You use your brain, but I also use my head and body.

331
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,465
I rely on everyone for the job.

332
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,222
Don't touch it!

333
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,522
I'm aware, don't interfere with your work.

334
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,400
Okay, definitely.

335
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,070
Send it with your phone next time.

336
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,032
You don't have to come all the way here.

337
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,456
Alright, just go.

338
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,126
It's time for dinner, I have to wrap things up here.

339
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,211
Go on.

340
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,649
It's available right now.

341
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,609
I'm not sure. What should I do?

342
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,361
Can you track it?

343
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,488
I'm currently in a counseling session.

344
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,909
Yes, I can.

345
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,702
Share your location moment by moment.

346
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,746
I'll answer the phone.

347
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,748
So if anything happens, call immediately.

348
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:56,925
Get on.

349
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,385
Hurry up, get on.

350
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,677
Song Jin-woo?

351
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,388
I fucking told you to get on.

352
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,106
It's all a trap.

353
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,899
Well, see for yourself.

354
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,568
See who was chasing you.

355
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,576
Damn, he found out.

356
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,581
You're cheating.

357
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,018
Who do you want to speak up to?

358
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,271
Say it.

359
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,691
Why did you help me?

360
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,779
You didn't tell me last time.

361
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,288
What do you see when you eat a cookie?

362
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,499
Say it.

363
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,752
Then I'll tell you.

364
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,504
Guess who.

365
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,342
You know.

366
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,136
Guess who?

367
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,512
Yeah.

368
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,058
If you lie.

369
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,561
I won't tell you anything either.

370
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,909
I see the life I have now.

371
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,496
What do you mean?

372
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,999
I wear nice clothes.

373
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,794
I eat good food.

374
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,963
I make friends.

375
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,507
I make plans.

376
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,759
I study.

377
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,594
Just.

378
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,305
The life I have now.

379
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,562
Is that it?

380
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,068
Without Min Young.

381
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,780
Without Choi Soo Young.

382
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,784
Without these damn wounds.

383
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,664
I live as Lee Eun Soo.

384
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,877
I get upset because I made some questions wrong.

385
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,797
My nerves shred because the food is tasteless.

386
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,591
I think about which university to go to.

387
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,345
I envy and expect from others.

388
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,557
I talk to my friends all day long.

389
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,685
My current life.

390
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,941
It's a dream that I have.

391
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,830
The day you went to the laundry room.

392
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,877
That antidote.

393
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,093
I replaced it with someone else.

394
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,848
I was curious to know.

395
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,976
How sudden side effects disappear.

396
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,519
And that antidote.

397
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,023
What is it made of?

398
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,571
And how genius Shaf is.

399
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,118
Is God really there?

400
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,497
But before I research.

401
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,375
I discovered something very strange.

402
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,297
That after injecting that saline solution into him, he regained consciousness.

403
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,842
And it was the same antidote.

404
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,596
Yes.

405
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,932
It was all a lie.

406
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,685
From the beginning, he didn't eat the cookie.

407
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,730
Do you remember, right?

408
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,315
That you were in school.

409
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,818
Which bastard.

410
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,654
Weaker, poorer.

411
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,865
More innocent and harmless.

412
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,247
He is closer to us.

413
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,917
And we trust him.

414
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,592
That bastard.

415
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,679
Shaf, come here.
