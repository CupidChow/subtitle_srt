Striving for your dreams again today

10
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,365
To all of you giving your best

11
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,243
Are you doing okay?

12
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,578
[Heavy music]

13
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,916
Persistent effort and countless tears

14
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,086
Aren't you tired of the repeated pain?

15
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,591
Despite this, isn't the vague dream

16
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,927
making you feel anxious?

17
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,057

experience the world of fantasy unfolding before you

24

What you need for your dreams from now on

is no longer effort, tears,
or pain

26
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,627

[Student 2] What kept you?
[Student 1] What kept you?

35
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,881
Why are you so late?

36
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,426

[Sound of whooshing wind]

40
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,929
[Suyeong] Sorry,

41
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,225
I thought I could make it, but today of all days is the interview...

42
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,186
[Laughter and chatter leaking through]

43
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,396
Hello?

44
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,816
Minyeong,

45
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,402
[Minyeong laughing] Ah, it's okay.
It's good you didn't come.

46
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,570
You would have just heard endless bragging about the school anyway.

47
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,906
Why bother coming? It's a waste of time
[Students laughing and chatting]

48
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,449
[Suyeong] It's worth bragging about,

49
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,828
the new consultant coming in is renowned nationwide,

50
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,664
to meet such a person...
[Students' laughter leaking through]

51
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,165
[Students' laughter]
[Student] Ah, seriously…

52
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,584
[Laughing] Hilarious, really

53
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,877
What are you doing?

54
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,797
Hanging out with friends?

55
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,674
[Minyeong] Yeah, at the dorm

56
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,759
[Minyeong's laughter]

57
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,760
Right,

58
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,096
It's not good to study all the time, even in senior year...

59
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,057
[Minyeong] Anyway, good luck with the interview. Hanging up now, fighting!

60
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,100
[Call end tone]

61
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,320

[Heejin's incredulous laughter]

63
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,791
[Heejin] What are you doing?

64
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,670
[Minyeong] What do you mean?
[Heejin's fake laugh]

65
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,591
I mean, you just put your speaker near us laughing,
and pretended to be part of it

66
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,094
Then you absurdly acted like you were hanging out with us,
saying 'Good luck with the interview, fighting!'

67
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,889
'Good luck with the interview, fighting!'

68
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,391
[Minyeong] I'll be asking you to do this more often,
I'll pay you 10,000 won per occasion, how about it?

69
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,061
Deal?

70
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,688
[Heejin's incredulous noise]

71
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
What are you talking about, damn it!

72
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,072
[Door lock sound]

73
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,035

[Deep breath]

76
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,547
[Tense music]
[Grade Head] Finally,

77
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,926
the moment you've all been waiting for.

78
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,347
We have the honor of introducing a special external lecturer

79
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,890
for this year,

80
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,017
who will guide our third-year students and is

81
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,896
the top college entrance consultant in the country!

82
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,441
Introducing Teacher Yoo Seong-pil!

83
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,070
[Grand music]
[People's cheers and applause]

84
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,381
[Tapping sound]
[Microphone feedback]

85
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,008
[Seong-pil] Uh...

86
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,678
When our students' entrance exams are over,

87
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,557
I expect to receive twice the cheers you just heard, I'm confident.

88
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,143
I am Yoo Seong-pil
[People's cheers]

89
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,817
Damn it...
[Mobile phone operation sound]

90
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,195
Ah, why did it have to be the masked girl and my roommate?

91
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,990
[Heejin] Damn,
how am I supposed to live with her for a year?

92
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,993
Ah, as if senior year wasn’t stressful enough,

93
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,329
there’s still time to change roommates, right?

94
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,665
[Student 1] But first,

95
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,168
we need to find someone who wants to room with the masked girl before we can switch...

96
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,128
What about you guys?

97
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,922
Do you want to be roommates with the masked girl? No, please do it, okay?

98
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,634
[Student 1's awkward laughter] Sorry,

99
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:52,638
the two of us finally became roommates after 3 years of trying.

100
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,434
[Student 2] Heejin, but the masked girl

101
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,395
might not be so bad as a roommate,

102
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,147
both of you are in class S,

103
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,149
It could be good motivation for each other to study
[Student 1 agrees]

104
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,942
Let's do rock-paper-scissors
[Door clicking]

105
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,861
[Heejin] One of us will room with me,

106
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,821
and the other with the masked girl
[Approaching footsteps]

107
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,739
[Emphasized sound effect]

108
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,616
Damn, that scared me
[Interesting music]

109
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,951
[Minyeong] You should pay up right away for the favor

110
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,337
They might not want to live with you either

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,505
What?

112
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,216
[Minyeong] Rather than living
trying to please you all the time,

113
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,926
they might prefer living with me, right?

114
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,594
What are you saying, idiot

115
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,554
[Minyeong] We're a match made in heaven

116
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,391
Both of us are avoided by everyone else

117
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,186
[Rustling sound]

118
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,687
In that sense, here's a bonus

119
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,065
See you later

120
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,487
Hey, four-eyes
[Emphasized sound effect]

121
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,032
Can you really spend 40,000 won?

122
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,910
Where does she get the money?

123
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,627
[Snicker]
[Rhythmic music]

124
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,465
[Seong-pil] In fact,
we really don't know our children

125
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:14,595
Not knowing their potential,
their dreams,

126
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,891
or even the wounds they might be carrying

127
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,978
[Door closing]
When I say this,

128
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,898
some parents might think,
'I couldn't be like that'

129
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,568
'I know my child better than anyone'

130
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,237
I confidently tell you,

131
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,324
you know less than anyone else

132
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,327
But that's natural.
You can't know everything.

133
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,454
And if you ask me,
'How can I know my child?'

134
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,291
'Who says you can? Do you know, teacher?'

135
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:46,085
'Do our homeroom teachers know?'

136
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,004
[Teachers' awkward laughter]

137
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,763
[Seong-pil's laughter]

138
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,268
I'll say it confidently again,

139
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,312
I don't know either

140
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,063
[Parents' laughter]

141
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,650
Hey, if the parents don't know,
how could the teachers, right?

142
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,737
But there's one thing we do know

143
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,616
It's okay not to know such things

144
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,620
For the remaining year,
those things are not at all...

145
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,664
Important!

146
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,209
[Book closing abruptly]
[Yujeong's heavy breathing]

147
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,431
[Yujeong sighs]

148
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,865
[Significant sound effect]

149
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,703
[Rustling sound]

150
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,383
[Sound of a door clicking]

151
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,051
[Softly] Damn, it's really noisy

152
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,887
[Heejin] Damn it, does being first in class mean everything?

153
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,728
[Sound of a door opening and closing]

154
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,369
[Sound of a door clicking]

155
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,128
[Heejin] Hey, Mask

156
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,215
What, you want to buy a spot here too?

157
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,843
I'll

158
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,012
sell it for a million won, want to buy?

159
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,985
[Button operation sound]

160
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,117
[Heejin's scream]
[Thud sound]

161
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,578
[Running footsteps]
[Tense music]

162
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,206
[Heejin's frightened breathing]

163
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,375
[Heejin] What is that?

164
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,088
[Running footsteps]

165
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,680
I promise you,

166
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:48,267
[Seong-pil] I will ensure the success
of our students' entrance exams

167
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,352
No, I, Yoo Seong-pil,

168
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,522
will make it happen
[Intensifying music]

169
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,192
[Music stops]

170
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,403
That's strange.
This is the moment for applause...

171
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,071
[People cheering]

172
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,782
[Laughing] Yes, thank you, thank you

173
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,285
Well, then

174
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,370
let's start the entrance exam briefing

175
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,957
for Jeonghan High School, the best private high school in the country

176
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,752
[Music filled with tension]
[Parents clapping and cheering]

177
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,636
[Clears throat]

178
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,734
[Intensifying music]

179
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,907
[Yujeong's faint laughter]
[Minyeong's shocked breathing]

180
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,450
[Dark music]
[Minyeong] Seo Yujeong

181
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,118
[Rustling sound]

182
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,663
[Yujeong's heavy breathing]
[Tense sound effect]

183
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,206
[Startled breathing]

184
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:58,504
[Bizarre sound effect]

185
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,381
[Startled breathing]

186
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,758
[Yujeong's vacant laughter]

187
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,344
[Eerie sound effect]

188
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,806
[Laughter stops]

189
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,808
[Minyeong's shocked breathing]

190
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,812
[Heejin] Over here, here!
Seo Yujeong is at the end...

191
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,064
[Heejin chokes up]
[Minyeong's alarmed sound]

192
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,900
[Minyeong's urgent breathing]

193
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,918
[Thumping sound effect]

194
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,297
[Weird music]

195
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,012
[Gyunam] Let's see,

196
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,225
Twenty-two years old, only a middle school graduate,

197
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,936
and the only family is a younger sibling?

198
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,607
I hear your sibling attends Jeonghan High School?

199
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,110
Quite the contrast between the sisters, huh?

200
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,862
[Light laughter]

201
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,948
Unlike me, she's so smart

202
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,825
and always stand among the top students there.

203
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:16,206
Of course, I'm confident I will shine in the factory work.

204
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,668
[Sigh] But the school's tuition cost a few thousands,

205
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,420
how do you manage the fees?

206
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,715
We're under social consideration, so we only pay about 10% of the fee.

207
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,967
What?

208
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,638
Then you must have some leeway.
Even if you don't get a regular position this time,

209
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,765
No, no, that's not the case.

210
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,143
The tuition is so high that even 10% is a lot.

211
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,354
[Suyeong] And there are lots of other expenses too.

212
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,856
Ah, leeway, hardly.

213
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,025
Desperate?

214
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,613
I've been here for four years,

215
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,116
I'm relying on this one chance.
I can't afford to fail.

216
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,497
[Sigh] Yeah, well,

217
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,999
[Gyunam] There are so many people who think they're big shots 

218
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,710
just because they've accumulated a few years of experience.

219
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:08,759
I value desperation, passion,

220
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,595
over mere tenure. That's what's important to me.

221
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,556
Yeah, it's very important.

222
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,811
Right, desperation, passion! Exactly.

223
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,941
Are you free tonight after work?

224
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,068
Why don't we have dinner together?

225
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,153
What?

226
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,948
Why?
[Gyunam] No, just

227
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,950
I want to see that

228
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:36,537
desperation and passion you have.

229
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,962
[Door opening and closing]

230
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,423
[Seungju] Why didn't you take the commuter bus?

231
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,174
Where are you going after work?

232
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm going out to eat.

233
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,430
Ah,

234
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,640
with the team leader?

235
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,562
It's for work.

236
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,398
[Seungju] Do you really want it that badly?

237
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,650
To stoop to such dirty, disgusting tactics?

238
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,825
[Door opening]

239
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,869
[Car engine sound]

240
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,207
[Inhales sharply]

241
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,134
[Video recording sound]

242
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,094
[Heavy music]
[Gyunam] Come on, get in

243
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,057
[Car door closing]

244
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,019
Oh, oh, the seatbelt

245
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,228
[Suyeong] Yes

246
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,522
[Significant sound effect]

247
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,441
[Video ending sound]
[Seungju] What are you doing?

248
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,568
Hey, what the hell? Damn

249
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,570
Give it to me [Struggling sound]
[Minyeong's strained breathing]

250
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,281
[Struggling] Damn

251
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,617
[Intriguing music]

252
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,787
[Minyeong sighs]

253
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,872
[Significant sound effect]

254
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,124
Wait a minute

255
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,876
[Gyunam] Who, who is that?

256
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,336
Do you know them?

257
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,592
[Emphasized sound effect]

258
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,639
It's my sister

259
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,978
[Significant sound effect]

260
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,499
[Minyeong] Just drop me off at the crosswalk ahead 

261
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,417
Mister

262
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,682
[Suyeong] Well then...

263
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,483
You were working, so you didn't see the homeroom teacher's text?

264
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,651
[Suyeong smiles slightly]

265
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:17,781
Anyway, it means commuting while the dorm is under repair?

266
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,117
[Minyeong] Yeah

267
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,079
Something about the boiler or plumbing being broken

268
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,791
Good, I hardly ever come home, even during holidays

269
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,294
Now we can spend some time together, even if it's brief

270
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,837
How great is that

271
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,093
[Suyeong's puzzled sound]

272
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,013
[Lively music playing]

273
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,315
[Suyeong] Why are we here? Let's get out quickly

274
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,776
[Minyeong] Were you going somewhere with that man in the car earlier?

275
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,697
He said he was heading in the same direction and offered a ride

276
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,700
[Minyeong] That's not true, right?

277
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,120
Ah, what nonsense

278
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,164
You'd get in trouble for that these days

279
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,208
[Minyeong] Right?

280
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,587
I should buy some groceries now that you're here

281
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,923
[Suyeong] Shall I go shopping before heading home?

282
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:27,267
[Minyeong] Please check me out, for everything.

283
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,978
[Suyeong] Minyeong

284
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,773
Minyeong 
[Exhausted breathing]

285
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:42,199
How did you pay for all this, huh?

286
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,077
[Minyeong] I got a scholarship

287
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,205
I wanted to tell you in person,
so I waited until now

288
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,581
[Suyeong] What?

289
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,791
[Minyeong] The school foundation

290
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,919
seems to have expanded benefits for top students

291
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,172
They cover all tuition, dormitory fees, living expenses,

292
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,925
and even give a separate scholarship

293
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,802
[Suyeong's surprised breathing]

294
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,139
[Light laughter]

295
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,852
[Surprised breathing]

296
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,813
[Suyeong] What?

297
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,984
I'll put this in the college tuition account

298
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,112
[Minyeong] No, you use it all
It's about 500

299
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,697
[Suyeong rustling] Let's refund the clothes first

300
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,740
[Forcefully] Why would you spend your money on this?

301
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,743
[Minyeong] You will need it while job hunting
You'll need decent clothes for interviews.

302
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,246
Dress well for an interview
Of course it is necessary

303
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,456
Huh?
[Minyeong] Sis,

304
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,458
quit your job

305
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,296
Ah, Minyeong

306
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,633
[Minyeong] There's no need to strain yourself to earn money
There's nothing more for me to take

307
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,344
According to the homeroom teacher, with my current grades,

308
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,847
I can get a full scholarship for all four years of college

309
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,099
I can't quit my job

310
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,728
[Suyeong] Instead,
I promise to work in a way you can be proud of

311
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,438
That's a promise

312
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:56,857
[Deep sigh]

313
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,193
Ah, don't you have something you want to do?

314
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,446
[Calm music]

315
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,618
[Light laughter]

316
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,620
No, there's nothing like that

317
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,710
[Minyeong sighs]

318
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,212
Let's buy some snacks on the way

319
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,548
I need it for studying

320
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,892
[Minyeong] Why don't you use the room, sis?

321
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,478
You hardly come home a few times a year. 
[Suyeong] Leave the room as it is.

322
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,147
It's okay, I'm comfortable in the living room

323
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,274
It's also bothersome to move things.

324
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,525
[Strained breathing]

325
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,985
[Minyeong] You really don't listen, do you?

326
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,030
But still, make sure you quit your job.

327
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,239
[Light laughter]

328
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,035
Just study moderately and go to sleep early. 

329
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,913
You need to wake up early tomorrow for school.

330
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,348
So...

331
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,894
Am I really going to wear these clothes? 
Not return them?

332
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,522
[Video of a lecturer]  You can't afford to not know grammar.

333
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,440
Thus, for the language media exam, 

334
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,070
if there are any students who keep making mistakes until the September mock tests,

335
00:23:01,154 --> 00:23:03,906
you absolutely must get all the language media questions right.

336
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,952
Sorry to say, but if you made mistakes in language media during the September mock test, 

337
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,368
hmm, you need to re-focus and pull yourself together. 
[Rustling sound]

338
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,247
With tears in your eyes, right?

339
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,040
You'll have to invest time and go over it once again…

340
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,209
[Crunching emphasized sound effect]
[Yujeong's faint laughter]

[Crunching]
[Knocking sound]

346
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,428
[Video lecturer] This is about the 12th lecture,

347
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,723
There's a method to quickly skim through it like this

348
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,641
and then…

349
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,351
[Suyeong] How is it?
[Continued video lecture]

350
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,853
[Minyeong's surprised laughter]

351
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,187
It suits you so well!

352
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,356

Oh, sorry if I disturbed you

355
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,780
I came in to iron the uniform,
just doing a bit more while here

356
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,449
Just taking the opportunity to…

357

What?

361
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:32,137
[Suyeong] What? It looks like the latest model,
this expensive one?

362
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,139
Saved some money, I guess

363
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:38,894
[Suyeong's laughter]

364
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,062
You got cookie crumbs on your mouth

365
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,940
[Suyeong] You've always been like that since you were little

366
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,359
Can't study without snacking

367
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:49,654
Anyway, you're still a kid

368
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,909

According to Heejin, on the bathroom floor

381
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,701
there were things like snacks or cookies
scattered around.

382
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,286
Did you happen to see them?

383
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:40,830
[Minyoung] I didn’t see anything.

384
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,833
Park Heejin saw them?

385
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,920
Yeah, but she doesn’t remember
clearly or anything...

386
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,797
[Minyoung] You mean,
I picked them up and ate them?

387
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,840
Like some disgusting scavenger?

388
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,884
[Yoonbeom] Hmm…

389
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,220
[Sound of writing on paper]

390
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,931

A joke?

405
00:27:06,651 --> 00:27:07,733
[Gyunam] Of course it's a joke

406
00:27:08,817 --> 00:27:11,025
We've worked together for a long time,
I can make that kind of joke

407
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:15,350
I just wanted to give you a ride home

408
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,475
So, what are your plans regarding the regular staff selection?

409
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,542
[Gyunam] What do you mean?
First and foremost, it's fairness

410
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,700
First fairness, second fairness,

411
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:27,767
and third, of course, fairness

412
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,275

No, I'm fine

417
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,874
Did you have breakfast, Manager?

418
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,667
