And everyone who goes all out

00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,720
Are you guys OK

8
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,820
Continuous efforts and unclear tears

9
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,000
And whether repeated pain makes you feel physically and mentally exhausted

10
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,000
Even if this is still a blank dream

11
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,430
Whether to make you feel uneasy

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,430
High cookie

No longer trying to tears and pain

18
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,920
Just take a bite

19
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,950
Here comes

20
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,199
Can't you come?

21
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,290

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,380

24
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,039
I thought I could go

25
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,590
But I want to interview today

26
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,190
Hello

27
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,700
Min Ying

28
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,539
Fortunately, you didn't come

29
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,379
Even if it comes, it must be listening to those showing off words.

30
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,380
waste time

31
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,389
It is really worth showing off

32
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,660
I heard that this new consultant is well -known in the country

33
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,980
That person

34
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,100
Sister
Laughing is really true

35
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
what are you doing

36
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,360
Are you playing with friends?

37
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,490
Um

38
00:04:58,491 --> 00:04:59,520
In dormitory

39
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,690

40
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,129
-In the whole day of studying all day because it is a senior year -feed

41
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,090
Mainly sister

42
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:08,010
You interview, I hung up, come on, come on, come on

43
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,330
what are you doing

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
What

45
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,990
Didn't you just let us laugh and listen to us just now

46
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,940
Then I pretended to be played with us

47
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,820
Come on interview

48
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,740
I will often ask you in the future

49
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,660
Give you 10,000 won each time

50
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,380

51
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,810
What do you say?

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:28,310
2024 Zhenghan High School High School Entry Examples

53
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
finally

54
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,460
I want to introduce you

55
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,720
Everyone has been waiting for a long time and we have been invited by hardships

56
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,910
An external lecturer

57
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,450
This year

58
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,840
Responsible for our senior high school students

59
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,620
The best domestic entrance examination consultant in China

60
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,780
Introduce you to Teacher Liu Chengzheng

61
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,240
At the end of our students' entrance examinations

62
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,749
Just accept the twice as mentioned just now

63
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,660
I have confidence

64
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:14,260
I am Liu Chengzheng

65
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,470
Bleak

66
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,230
Why is it a roommate with a mask?

67
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,310
How do I live with her?

68
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,640
It was because of the high school pressure

69
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:35,000
The dormitory should be able to change it in the rectification

70
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
Must first

71
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,610
Only those who want to cover with a cover can be changed

72
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,460
How do you want to be a roommate with a mask?

73
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,669
I'm sorry for the two of us in the past three years.

74
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,990
Good luck to become a roommate

75
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Xitian

76
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,900
But a mask

77
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,290
As a roommate, it may be pretty good

78
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,209
You are all in Class S

79
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:03,259
I can still learn to partner with each other very well

80
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,260
Scissors stone cloth

81
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,270
One of you two lives with me

82
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,250
One with one with the mouth

83
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
淦 淦 淦 淦

84
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,050
If you say good, you have to give it right away

85
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,420
They may not want to live with you

86
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
What did you say

87
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,940
Instead of living in your life every day

88
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,730
Maybe I want to live with me more

89
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,709
What are you say? Stupid

90
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,150
I mean we are born a pair

91
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,340
You who have been avoided by everyone and me

92
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,930
So give you some benefits

93
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,850
see you later

94
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Feed social assistance objects

95
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,700
Can you spend 40,000 won at a time?

96
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,580
Where are you from the money

97
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,000
We actually don't know our children very much

98
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,460
I don't know the possibility of children

99
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,190
I don't know the children's dreams

100
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,670
Maybe even the pain in the children, I don't know

101
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,270
I will tell you so now

102
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,640
Several parents may think so

103
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,400
I can't do this

104
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,830
I know my child than anyone else than anyone else

105
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,990
I tell you confidently

106
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,120
You don't know more than anyone else

107
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,620
But this is for granted, we will only understand

108
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,370
But if I say this, some parents will ask me

109
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,740
Teacher so

110
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,040
How can I understand my child

111
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,719
Who understand

112
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,250
Do you know the teacher?

113
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,560
Do our class teachers understand

114
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,100
Of course understand

115
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,920
I will tell you again confidently

116
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,230
I don't know either

117
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,989
Not even parents do not understand

118
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,590
Teachers can't understand it, right?

119
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,310
But we only know a little

120
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,720
If you don't know, you can

121
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,820
At least in the rest of the year

122
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,890
Those who are not important at all

123
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,390
Noisy

124
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,650
I thought I am the first place

125
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,860
Fed

126
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,880
Why not spend money to buy a place

127
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,730
I

128
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,680
Sell one million won

129
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Do you buy

130
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,000
what is that

131
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,590
I agree to everyone

132
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,220
Our students' admission exam

133
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,479
I make success

134
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,080
Not me Liu Chengzheng

135
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,960
What will make them succeed

136
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,180
Shouldn't you applaud?

137
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,710
yes

138
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,860
thank you all

139
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,290
So

140
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,420
The best private high school in China

141
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,000
The explanation of the entrance examination in Zhenghan High School will start

142
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,470
Xu Rujing

143
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,089
Here here

144
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,950
Xu Rujing almost here ...

145
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:46,889
Contractor Evaluation Form Personnel Record Card (Contractor)

146
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,040
I'll take a look

147
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,980
Age Twenty -two

148
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,970
Graduated from junior high school education

149
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,530
The family has only one sister

150
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,320
I heard

151
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,690
Your sister went to school in Zheng Han High School

152
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,210
Sisters are completely different

153
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,620
She is different from me a very dazzling child

154
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,410
The grades there are also upstream

155
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,420
certainly

156
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,070
I also have confidence in the work of the factory.

157
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,640
I heard that the tuition is tens of millions of won there

158
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,890
How to pay tuition fees

159
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,220
Because it is the object of social assistance

160
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,880
Only about 10 percent

161
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
what's the situation

162
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,420
Then it's quite calm

163
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,220
Even if you are not a formal employee this time, right?

164
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,580
It's not possible

165
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,850
Because tuition fees are more than 10 % of the imagination, there are a lot of imagination.

166
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,240
Coupled with other places, it also costs a lot of money

167
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,600
How can you calm down

168
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,560
Very urgent

169
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,370
This year is the fourth year

170
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,290
I just expect this to persist until now

171
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,950
I can't be a formal employee

172
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
good

173
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,640
There are many bullish work years

174
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,200
The guy who is not long -lasting

175
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,550
I am compared to those

176
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,110
I think more about it

177
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,990
Evergreen and enthusiasm

178
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,690
right

179
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,320
These are very important

180
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,350
Evergreen and enthusiasm is right

181
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,800
Is there time after get off work at night?

182
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,030
Have a meal together

183
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,310
What

184
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,970
Why eat
Just

185
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:36,020
I want to see the urgency and enthusiasm on you

186
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,770
Why didn't you take a company bus

187
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,630
Do you have to go to other places after get off work?

188
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,980
Go to eat

189
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,290
Do you follow the team leader

190
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,150
Because of work

191
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,340
As for this,

192
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,740
Also using this dirty way

193
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Bleak

194
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,630
Get in the car

195
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,690
seat belt

196
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,250
What to do

197
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,010
Who will you feed you?

198
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
give me back

199
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,150
Wait a moment

200
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
Who

201
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,900
Is the person you know?

202
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,140
It's my sister

203
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,280
Just stop at the sidewalk

204
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,110
Uncle

205
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,450
Then I'll go first

206
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,920
My sister did not see the information of the class teacher because of the job?

207
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,130
So during the dormitory repair period

208
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,510
Go to read temporarily, right?

209
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,850
Well, it seems to mean that the boiler is still a water pipe failure

210
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,889
It's so good that I haven't returned home during the previous holiday

211
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:31,480
Although it is only a while, it is good to be able to stay together

212
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,120
What can we do here, let's go out quickly

213
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,420
Where is your uncle's car just now?

214
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,380
Because he said he said he would send me

215
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,470
No, right?

216
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,099
Ouch, what are you blinding?

217
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,760
If so recently, it will be caught

218
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,810
right

219
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,210
Since you are here, you have to buy something

220
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:15,520
Don’t let's go back to buy food before going back

221
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,070
Trouble check out

222
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
All here are all

223
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,330
Min Ying

224
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Cui Minying

225
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,920
Where do you come from the money to buy these things?

226
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,760
I got a scholarship

227
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,849
Because I want to tell you in person

228
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,850
So now tell you

229
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,350
What

230
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,640
It seems to be a reward for the school consortium to the students in the school

231
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,900
Support tuition fee accommodation fee living expenses

232
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,480
Also give scholarships

233
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,330
I will deposit this into the college tuition passbook

234
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,459
Do you take it for a while, do you take it?

235
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,629
-It 5 million here -wait for us to retreat the clothes first

236
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,470
So enough money is enough

237
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,589
It may not be enough to go to job jobs elsewhere

238
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,470
If you want to interview

239
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:29,220
I definitely need some good clothes

240
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:30,640
What

241
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,390
Sister, don't do that job

242
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,519
Hey Min Ying

243
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,019
No need to barely make money by yourself

244
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
There is no need to spend money again

245
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,279
I listened to the class teacher and said

246
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,529
According to my current results

247
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,990
There is no problem with the full scholarship of the four -year university

248
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,280
I can't resign in this job

249
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,739
But I must work positively

250
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,200
I can promise you

251
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:59,750
Sister, you also have what you want to do, right?

252
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,050
I don't have any

253
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,940
Go back to buy some biscuits

254
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,150
Need to study when studying

255
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,280
Just say this room for you

256
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,489
I only came back a few times a year. You still leave the room out

257
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,329
No need to sleep in the living room comfortable

258
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,000
It's troublesome

259
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,380
You just don't listen to persuasion

260
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,630
Even so, you must resign if you work

261
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,969
Just learn to learn almost, just go to bed, hurry to sleep, right?

262
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,640
If you want to go to school, get up early tomorrow

263
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,329
I really wear those clothes

264
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,789
Not refund

265
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,830
Don't understand grammar

266
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,920
Because of the language matching problem, the September evaluation exam is wrong. Many people make mistakes

267
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,060
This is finished

268
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,340
Sorry, I'm sorry

269
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,720
If you are wrong in September

270
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,559
Start from grammar again to learn

271
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,720
To the language again ...

272
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,610
This is here ..

273
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Then ...
How

274
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,500
suitable for you

275
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,920
Oh sorry to bother you

276
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,959
I want to iron the school clothes for you so I came in

277
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,420
Take a look at you by the way

278
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,470
Oh, but the first time I saw this tablet, hey, hey

279
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,350
Ah this is also given by the school

280
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,850
oh

281
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,740
It seems to be the latest model

282
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,150
Such a expensive thing

283
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,860
Save some money

284
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,200
There are biscuits shattered on the mouth

285
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,670
You have been like this since childhood

286
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,080
Can't go in without any snacks

287
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,460
In short, it's still a child

288
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,630
After the school uniform is ironed, I will hang the living room

289
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,070
aunt

290
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,699
The users you dial have shut down

291
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:23,580
After beep, the voice mailbox will be transferred to you will charge a call fee

292
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,590
Listening to Xizhen said

293
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,170
Jin Yunfan

294
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:36,679
There seems to be biscuits in the bathroom that there are biscuits on the ground

295
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,470
Do you see it?

296
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,810
Not see

297
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,520
Park Xizhen said she saw it?

298
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,019
Hmm, she said it is not too clear

299
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,440
Say I picked up and eat

300
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,820
Because I am a social assistance object like a beggar

301
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,240
Do you usually say anything about Rujing?

302
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,910
Aren't you the same class?

303
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,210
-Byte -you say

304
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,290
Is it really dead?

305
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,630
Xu Rujing

306
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,640
Cui Minying

307
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,720
Can the team leader come one hour in advance tomorrow? If you have something to tell you
Can you come one hour in advance?

308
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,220
Are you joking?

309
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,730
Of course it's a joke

310
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,639
Working with you so long

311
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,150
Can the degree of jokes still open?

312
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,440
I just plan to send you home

313
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,409
That formal employee selection is how to do it

314
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,410
What else can I do

315
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,910
The first is fairness. The second is that the third is the third.

316
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,290
OK

317
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,839
Oh all we blame me

318
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,640
It hurts you if you don't even eat breakfast early in the morning.

319
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,350
It's not tight

320
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,099
Team, do you eat?

321
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,390
I drink to know the soup ...

322
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,650
Just eat it casually

323
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,280
There is still a bit of time to go to work

324
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,990
Take this pad

325
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,620
Thanks

326
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,840
Dear Cui Xiuying has handled it, don’t worry

327
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
oh oh

328
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,470
I didn't find this at my pocket, so I didn't find it in my pocket

329
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,520
Team leader, you eat

330
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,660
Is it smooth yesterday?

331
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,950
What do you say?

332
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,460
The disgusting thing was discovered by her

333
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,550
But what's going on? I haven't seen clothes that I haven't seen

334
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,310
Sister, what's the matter with you

335
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,810
The same clothes as yesterday

336
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,900
The team leader is also the same clothes

337
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:26,070
But yesterday, I saw what was on your sister's face yesterday

338
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,160
What happened to what happened

339
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,830
A bit like a scar

340
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,000
Shouldn't it be cut from an ax?

341
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,290
God

342
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,790
You woman

343
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,800
what's up

344
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,140
Let me go and let me go

345
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,520
God

346
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,900
Are you crazy

347
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:07,650
Apologize

348
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:08,910
Apologize to me immediately

349
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,159
Come and help

350
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,910
She seems to be crazy at all

351
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
sorry Sorry

352
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,330
sorry

353
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,130
I made a mistake

354
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
sorry

355
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
Make mistakes

356
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,320
Oh Min Ying

357
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,980
What should I do

358
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,820
Oh, that biscuit?

359
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,489
Yesterday I saw that you only took a bite, I threw the trash bin

360
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,490
leftover...

361
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,249
It's not why you turn over others' school uniforms

362
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,840
Did I ask you to iron my clothes for me?

363
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,220
Ah, I didn't care about it yesterday

364
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,719
So where is the rest

365
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,679
Sister when I am going to get off work today, I buy a biscuit home

366
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,190
Wouldn't you eat it?

367
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,730
Did you say it?

368
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:25,319
Nothing, no food, no food

369
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,529
But this matter makes you so angry

370
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:30,200
You are waiting for me to go to the factory to find you

371
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,410
What is it because of the biscuits

372
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,620
what's up

373
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,730
Is the one I just ate?

374
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
yes

375
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,110
Didn't you eat it for me?

376
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,110
It's delicious

377
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,370
Did you roast it yourself?

378
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,580
Ah ...

379
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,370
What's wrong

380
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Do not go early

381
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
OK

382
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,680
Okay now start today's morning meeting

383
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,889
The head office issued a policy

384
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,559
Pay attention to safety accidents

385
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,229
Not long ago, our factory

386
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,190
Many problems have been started because of the fire alert errors.

387
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
no

388
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,630
Team leader

389
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,130
Team leader

390
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,930
what happened

391
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,230
Team leader

392
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,570
Team leader

393
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,360
let's play together

394
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,490
Team leader

395
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,990
Team leader

396
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
Oh Min Ying

397
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I'm going to get off the taxi

398
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:41,890
Sister, where are you now

399
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,970
Where is that biscuits now

400
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,740
Ah

401
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,070
Touch me

402
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,500
What do you think

403
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,379
Sister can't understand

404
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,219
Just because a piece of biscuits shouted early in the morning

405
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,889
The time to go to school runs here

406
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,600
What biscuits are it

407
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,770
The team leader ate biscuits

408
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,150
Obviously it is no different from usual just now

409
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,240
I have a boyfriend

410
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
Citizen

411
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,490
What

412
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,910
Scared

413
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,920
He doesn't care about my scars

414
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,460
It doesn't matter if I don't cover it

415
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,090
It's pretty

416
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,720
I lived for so long and met

417
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,600
No one told me this way

418
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,180
It's my boyfriend to confess to me

419
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,929
Because it's too precious and reluctant to eat

420
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,060
I have been placed in a school uniform coat for several days

421
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,649
Although it may be just ordinary biscuits for my sister

422
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,690
But for me ...

423
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
sorry

424
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,170
Sister does not know

425
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,670
Sister really doesn't know anything

426
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,130
Really sorry

427
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,120
Why are you here now

428
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,740
I just made a big trouble for the class teacher

429
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,620
Smile

430
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:57,330
What

431
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,210
Close your mouth and laugh first

432
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,600
Why do you send it to your sister? Wait a minute

433
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,640
Lie need to be blocked with lies

434
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,400
As long as I said, she is stupid and believes

435
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,230
Because she is a stupid woman
