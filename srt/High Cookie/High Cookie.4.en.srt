The locations, characters, organizations, and events in this play are fictional and have no connection to reality.

3
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,210
Hey, do you know about Song Jin Woo's whereabouts?

4
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,620
Song Jin Woo and the Masked Girl.

5
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,870
Is there something going on between them?

6
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,360
They're not allowing it, right?

7
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,540
No, they're not allowing it.

8
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,780
...Me and Min Young.

9
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,640
I haven't heard anyone say anything.

10
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,370
So, what's the fuss about?

11
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,550
Where did they go?

12
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,130
New member?

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Oh.

14
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,660
She has made her choice.

15
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,400
So she can monitor the school situation.

16
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,670
Forget about her.

17
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,940
Why didn't you answer my calls?

18
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,670
I also sent messages, but you didn't reply.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,420
I was on vacation.

20
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,430
Vacation?

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,360
Someone has died.

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,030
We've been unlucky, it was one of our customers.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,670
Our cookies have also been contaminated.

24
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,219
...even the police were after us because of that.

25
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,780
Should I be worried about these things too?

26
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,630
Seriously?

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,900
Let's say you're telling the truth.

28
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,940
Our cookies killed one of our customers.

29
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,670
How did it become clear in the investigation that...

30
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,420
Are our cookies a type of drug?

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
No, no.

32
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,389
The test didn't show anything.

33
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,449
Yes, we had an altercation with a police officer today.

34
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,829
But everything is fine and resolved now.

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,240
It's all thanks to our new genius member.

36
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,320
You really deserve applause.

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,030
So what should we do about the police?

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,950
Be careful around Jihye Park.

39
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,980
I'm aware of the police myself.

40
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,150
Okay?

41
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,520
A case of illegal entry into the house?

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,240
Has the employer entered the employee's house to get cookies from him?

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,440
What are the identities of the attacker and the victim?

44
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,950
... For now.

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,850
Choi Soo-young and Choi Min-young?

46
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Hyung.

47
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,060
Who is the attacker?

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,690
I'll call you later.

49
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,620
What are you doing?

50
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,930
What?

51
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,210
I asked, "What are you doing?"

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,870
Is this your car?

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,190
My lighter had fallen on the ground.

54
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,070
Here.

55
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Mr. Detective.

56
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,380
Be careful.

57
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,690
Be careful of what?

58
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,500
When driving... be careful.

59
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,200
Okay.

60
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,160
...I only want what that jerk

61
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,150
I ate the cookie that Ms. Seo Young gave me.

62
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,969
Then, everyone had become beautiful and sexy in my eyes.

63
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,570
...and I had become, too.

64
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,750
Really... sheesh.

65
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,930
...and then?

66
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:31,360
Did you pass out?

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Yep.

68
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,140
Yep.

69
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,540
Yes.

70
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,239
Mr. Detective, do you believe what I'm saying?

71
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,840
What did they say in the test you took?

72
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,550
The shedding section is right here.

73
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,190
They said everything is normal.

74
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,030
They said there is nothing strange.

75
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,430
...Well, this means...

76
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,280
It cannot be proven that such a cookie has extraterrestrial components.

77
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,580
No one believes me.

78
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,540
...So...

79
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:56,869
You escaped from the hospital to get another cookie.

80
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,960
And you went to the victim's house?

81
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,190
Yes.

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,060
But...

83
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,750
They said he doesn't have a cookie.

84
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,119
They said he even took it from his sister.

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
His sister?

86
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,460
Choi Min Young?

87
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,410
Yes.

88
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,750
I haven't seen her.

89
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
...Mrs. So Young.

90
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,770
She is a very naive person.

91
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,800
But his sister is not just an ordinary girl.

92
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,580
...Just by going out, I'll sort it out.

93
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,520
...If she really has drugs, I'll confiscate them and...

94
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,310
I'll eat them all.

95
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,720
My... Do you have your address?

96
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,200
I am Kim Yoon Bum from the Jung-Han Police Station.

97
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,150
I came for Mrs. Choi Min Young... Can I come in?

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
No.

99
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,400
I came because of the recent incident that happened to you.

100
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,650
I have a few questions for you.

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,860
Didn't you say you came for Min Young?

102
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,000
I came for both.

103
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,750
Do you know what this is anymore?

104
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:07,910
...The test they did.

105
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,610
They said it's just a regular cookie.

106
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,590
I got this from the supermarket.

107
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
It looks very similar to that cookie, doesn't it?

108
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,140
Because you can buy them everywhere.

109
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,370
It's hard to tell which is which.

110
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Well?

111
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,500
Others can easily be fooled as well.

112
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Well, what?

113
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,990
One of the students at Jung-Han School died.

114
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,630
And it's because of this cookie.

115
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,690
How is it still the same as before?

116
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,220
Both back then and now.

117
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,950
Both them.

118
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,290
And you.

119
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,910
What?

120
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,890
I'm talking about you guys.

121
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,090
You fake policemen.

122
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,210
I heard you're fooled.

123
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,230
Can't you get over this after a whole year?

124
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,220
Mom, Dad.

125
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
I apologize.

126
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,620
Dad is scared, that's why he's saying it like this.

127
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,030
Speak your mind.

128
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,720
Didn't you give your daughter to your friends?

129
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,240
You said your daughter was accepted into the special class at Jung-Han High School.

130
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,030
From now on...

131
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,340
Take care of your health more.

132
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,410
If you need anything.

133
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,490
Don't be formal and tell me.

134
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,250
See? I told you.

135
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,170
Just by entering the special class, everything will be fine.

136
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,320
In both cases, the cookie...

137
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,070
There's a connection to Mrs. Choi Min Young.

138
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,840
I don't know about the school case.

139
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
There's no need for me to know.

140
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,970
But our case is related to Gyoo Nam.

141
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,610
It has nothing to do with that.

142
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,450
You said it yourself.

143
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,480
You said the attacker used the cookie as an excuse.

144
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,740
The test also showed that it was just a regular cookie.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,450
I told you that you can fool others with this cookie.

146
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,399
I know it's hard to accept.

147
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,130
...But if it turns out to be a drug case.

148
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Do you see this?

149
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,500
Do you know what kind of person Gyoo Nam is?

150
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,140
...Me.

151
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,930
...Us.

152
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,070
Do you know how we escaped from him?

153
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,140
Do you know what kind of person he is at the factory?

154
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,250
...He's a perverted man.

155
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,689
He came up with a stupid excuse.

156
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,410
...It's clear that my sister is a victim here. And you're saying...

157
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,230
Are these two cases related to each other?

158
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,160
...Him.

159
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,100
Have you happened to visit Gyoo Nam?

160
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,070
Did you come here because he brought up the name of the cookie?

161
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,180
Is that why you suspect my sister?

162
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,820
I apologize.

163
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:22,160
...Me.

164
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,440
I couldn't sympathize with you properly.

165
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,070
But it's really an emergency.

166
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,270
I'm not even surprised anymore.

167
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,920
You did the same thing four years ago.

168
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,710
You said, "Seo Young..."

169
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,200
"I heard you always wear makeup."

170
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,510
"I heard your skirt is always short."

171
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,270
"I even heard you provide services to your father."

172
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,850
"Isn't that right?"

173
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,070
"Why didn't you report it to the police then?"

174
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,380
"If you didn't want to, you should have called the police a long time ago."

175
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,399
With a gas, you can stay awake for hours.

176
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,260
That's why you can study a lot.

177
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,370
...By eating half of it.

178
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,350
You feel like you're about to fly.

179
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,629
When you eat the whole thing, your body becomes restless.

180
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,640
And your mind fantasies appear before your eyes.

181
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,110
Get rid of that milk.

182
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,179
...But if you eat more than one.

183
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,160
Disappear... or else I'll call the police.

184
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,880
That one.

185
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,990
I'm late coming home because of my classes.

186
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,720
Let's celebrate later.

187
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,850
(Detective Kim Yoon Bum)

188
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,680
For now, I have to go to school.

189
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,560
I'll leave my card here.

190
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,500
If your opinion changes, please give me a call.

191
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,670
What if you made a mistake?

192
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,230
What would you do then?

193
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,050
I'm sure about myself.

194
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:26,060
Can you forgive me?

195
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,390
I kneel down and apologize.

196
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,320
What should I do?

197
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
How can I prove it?

198
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,210
Who is Min Young's boyfriend?

199
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,510
That one.

200
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm late coming home because of my classes.

201
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,060
Let's celebrate later.

202
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,190
Here.

203
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,830
Did you come straight home after school today?

204
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Yes.

205
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,710
Is something wrong?

206
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,760
Because you came all the way here looking for me.

207
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
No.

208
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,460
The dormitory will reopen tomorrow.

209
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,020
I said I wanted to come see you.

210
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,730
After that incident, I felt drawn to you.

211
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,810
It's okay.

212
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,270
Wait a moment.

213
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
By the way,

214
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,800
Where did you learn how to make cookies?

215
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,250
What?

216
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,490
I'm just asking.

217
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,370
I want to learn it.

218
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,940
Go see her and find out for yourselves, really.

219
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:02,770
She made the cookies herself.

220
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,170
Or not.

221
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Yeah, sure.

222
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,720
Can we talk a bit?

223
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
What's wrong?

224
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Yeah, what's up?

225
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,860
Yeah, what's up? - Well -

226
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,460
Help me, please.

227
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,630
What?

228
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,939
I want to talk about my anesthesia.

229
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,730
I want to tell you the truth.

230
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,430
It was because of that police officer.

231
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,120
He said it because I wanted to go to the special class.

232
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,029
I killed Yoo Jung.

233
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,690
But does it make sense?

234
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,620
It's been bothering me for a few days.

235
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,169
... Yeah, you?

236
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,079
I never said anything like that.

237
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Yeah.

238
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,110
... Why?

239
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,799
What happened?

240
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,110
He gave me the order to kill.

241
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,930
He said his father used to have a pastry shop.

242
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,240
Really?

243
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,020
What happened to Park Ji-ha?

244
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,970
Did you see him? What did he say?

245
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,800
I'll call you later.

246
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,860
I'll sleep well tonight.

247
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,260
Prepare yourself to kneel down.

248
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,709
I told my friend who is a policeman everything.

249
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,950
Focus on your studies.

250
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,510
Don't get too caught up in your own thoughts.

251
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,039
I heard he works at the police station too.

252
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,750
He has been warned several times.

253
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,950
(Park Ha-jin)

254
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
(Choi Min-young)

255
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,790
(So Hoo-soo)

256
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,090
(Ji-ha, I'm waiting for you behind the tree)

257
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,599
Have you gone crazy?

258
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,000
I told you not to go to school anymore. (Boss)

259
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,569
But you went there and...

260
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:25,860
Did you spread nonsense to people?

261
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,260
Do you know how many people called me?

262
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,039
Boss, I myself also didn't want to go there today anymore.

263
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,800
... but

264
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:35,860
It's because of your actions that you can't get promoted.

265
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,599
Just know that you will be punished.

266
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,280
Come to the office tomorrow morning and explain.

267
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,550
Boss

268
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,380
(Drinking water)

269
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,130
Your sister suddenly said to go see him.

270
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,800
She asked me for a cookie recipe.

271
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
What happened?

272
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,569
It's an announcement from the daughter of the CEO.

273
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,479
Suddenly?

274
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
What do you mean, what happened?

275
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,086
(Daughter of Park Sang-gil) \N (Venue: Jung-han Hospital, Hall 803) \N (Date: March 8th, 2 PM)

276
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,149
What do you mean, what happened?

277
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,150
Suddenly, really?

278
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
(Detective Kim Yun-bum)

279
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,840
Hello?

280
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,530
(Detective Kim Yun-bum)

281
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,400
Isn't Detective Kim's phone?

282
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,440
Something happened to the owner of the phone.

283
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,400
It had a car accident.

284
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,420
It's severely damaged right now and can't respond.

285
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:05,820
Can you tell me your name?

286
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,660
Once he wakes up, I'll tell him to contact you.

287
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,260
Choi So-young?

288
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,220
Suicide?

289
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,169
Did Park Ji-hee throw herself off the building?

290
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,040
Does it make sense?

291
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,929
Anyway, for now, it will continue for a while.

292
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,709
The special class will continue with 9 students.

293
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,820
I just wanted to say that.

294
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,549
You shouldn't lose focus.

295
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,550
Did you understand?

296
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,239
First bell, put your belongings in the dormitory.

297
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,930
Second bell will be held as usual.

298
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,020
Be present in class on time.

299
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,820
Min Young.

300
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
Do you want me to bring your belongings to the dormitory for you?

301
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,550
Min Young, where are you going?

302
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,399
Saki, which Min Young brought by herself.

303
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,260
Two guys are bringing it together.

304
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,910
Didn't you prevent the fight?

305
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,420
Just say it.

306
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,510
I told him I would bring it myself.

307
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,219
But Hoseo insisted, my dear.

308
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,570
Because I am closer to Min Young.

309
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Let him leave it here.

310
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,480
Take it inside.

311
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:02,840
It's better if I come in somehow.

312
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,620
Go quietly.

313
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,060
Hoso.

314
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,060
Do you happen to like Park Ji Hoon?

315
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Me? Him?

316
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,460
Obviously not.

317
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,019
From now on, you should like him as a friend.

318
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,130
What?

319
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,150
...I- \N I like Choi Min Young ...

320
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,040
So you should like Park Ji Hoon too.

321
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,620
I'll give you money.

322
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,510
Okay?

323
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,820
Then don't interfere with us.

324
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,530
Hello.

325
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,800
Hello- \N Hello-

326
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,749
Teacher Yu, come here.

327
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:19,999
...He's the new detective who

328
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,930
They sent to our school for investigation- \N Hello-

329
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,039
I'm the college counselor, Yoo Sung Pil.

330
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,420
Nice to meet you.

331
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,369
Continue your conversation.

332
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:32,709
You come too.

333
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,910
No.

334
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,910
I have a little work.

335
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,130
Anyway.

336
00:25:38,131 --> 00:25:40,349
I'll reset everything without any problems.

337
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,219
The investigation is over.

338
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,970
But I know this detective, Kim Aunji, very well.

339
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:47,600
He always likes to make trouble for himself.

340
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,150
Is our school to blame? Why are they causing trouble for us?

341
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,199
Shouldn't affect our school negatively.

342
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,170
Exactly.

343
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,460
That's why I'm here anymore.

344
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,730
Cheers- \N Cheers-

345
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,420
With coffee, huh?

346
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,859
Is he crazy?

347
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,439
Wasn't it enough that we have the fear of being exposed?

348
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,220
Now with these actions, for example, is he trying to fix everything?

349
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,200
With the detective's accident and Park Ji Hee's suicide?

350
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,510
He wants to make everything worse?

351
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,420
Are you provoking me?

352
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,040
Do you dare to interfere in Shuva's work?

353
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,169
Shuva is different from us.

354
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,820
We don't know who they are.

355
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,710
If something happens, they could get involved.

356
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,039
But what about us?

357
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,400
What if we get stuck?

358
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,260
I want Shuva's number.

359
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,000
...I'll tell her that

360
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,000
He can't handle the job like this.

361
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,640
It's better not to call her.

362
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,310
Give me her number.

363
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,680
Shuva knows everything about

364
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,460
Cookie case and your sister's workplace.

365
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,400
Why didn't you tell us?

366
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,420
...Because

367
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,220
I handled it myself.

368
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,770
Seriously?

369
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So you haven't left any evidence?

370
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
No, I haven't left any evidence.

371
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,420
They don't know anything. Everything is on track.

372
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,639
Did you know that the detective who had the accident

373
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,000
was being followed by your sister?

374
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,420
Oh my.

375
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,310
Your sister didn't tell you?

376
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,640
Why didn't you change your clothes?

377
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,710
I'll change them now.

378
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,240
At sunset, we all go to the ceremony together.

379
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,750
You're coming too, right?

380
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,040
Yes.

381
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,000
Don't tell me you're rehearsing already

382
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,950
to show yourself mourning at the ceremony.

383
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,550
Don't bring Shiva.

384
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,420
Now that you've been hired permanently.

385
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,550
What else do you want?

386
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,200
What does it matter to you what you're doing?

387
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,820
If it matters, what then?

388
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,260
What should I do then?

389
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,950
Aigo, what should I do now?

390
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,350
I'm sorry. Are you feeling well?

391
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,640
Yes.

392
00:29:47,641 --> 00:29:50,800
What should I do with these?

393
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,600
(Choi Soo Young)

394
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,330
Thank you.
