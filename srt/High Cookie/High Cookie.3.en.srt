The settings, characters, organizations, and events in this play are fictional and have no connection to reality.

3
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,130
...two hundred and eighteen, two hundred and nineteen

4
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,190
Choi So-young

5
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,220
Come out

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,700
You have to come and save your sister

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,630
So I have no other choice

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,390
So-young

9
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,860
Come and see Min-young

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,320
You should have listened to Dad's advice.

11
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,960
See, because you didn't listen to Dad's advice.

12
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,560
That's how it turned out.

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,840
Otherwise, Min-young wouldn't be harmed like this.

14
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,560
Look at this situation!

15
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,020
That day, four years ago.

16
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,800
I wanted to have hope no matter what.

17
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,770
That I can handle it.

18
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,760
I kept telling myself that it's just a coincidence.

19
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,410
So I have to have hope.

20
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,890
Honey, I have to go to school.

21
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,820
Oh, sorry, I was supposed to make breakfast for you.

22
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,400
But now it's too late.

23
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,990
It's okay. I'll grab something on my way.

24
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm saying, didn't you install too many alarms?

25
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,200
This one is the last one.

26
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,800
Honey, are you also going to work today?

27
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,680
How are you?

28
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,420
What's wrong? Do you need money?

29
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,460
Classes will start from tomorrow.

30
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,170
Today, make sure to visit the hospital.

31
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,340
Your sister is worried about you and told me to take care of you.

32
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,760
My sister?

33
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,750
Are you in contact with my sister?

34
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,410
What?

35
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,300
...Well

36
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,750
Yeah

37
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
She told me not to tell you.

38
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,480
Tell me the truth, otherwise I'll hurt you.

39
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,860
If we want to be logical, it's all your fault.

40
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,670
You lied that I made that cookie.

41
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,310
You asked me what I had put in it.

42
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,120
Whether or not there were ingredients in it.

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,040
Well, what did you answer?

44
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,090
What else could I have said?

45
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,960
I said, "Yes, I made it."

46
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,920
But does it make sense to have ingredients in a cookie?

47
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,440
Block them.

48
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,910
Don't contact them anymore.

49
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,640
Can we talk for a few moments?

50
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,009
Legal medical report.

51
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,680
According to the tests, it was just a regular cookie.

52
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,550
Like the ones they sell at the supermarket.

53
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,080
Did they say they came to your house just for a cookie? They must have made up a fake excuse.

54
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,960
Yeah, they must have been like that.

55
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,570
You can go home confidently now.

56
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,830
I was already confident. I just came to ask like this.

57
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:01,900
Director General of Sang Gil Park.

58
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,090
Sorry.

59
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,620
Were you scared because I suddenly called you?

60
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,830
What did you have to say to me?

61
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Personal file (worker's contract).

62
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,930
By the way.

63
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,480
I heard your sister is in the special class at Jung-Han High School, she's an exemplary student.

64
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,100
My daughter is also in Jung-Han High School, she's in her third year.

65
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,640
So Min-Young and your daughter should know each other.

66
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,870
It was hard for her to get accepted into the special class this time.

67
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,060
Congratulations!

68
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,040
It's not because of her abilities.

69
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,130
It's because one of the students in the special class has passed away.

70
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,040
I spent a lot of money, but she couldn't get into the special class.

71
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,280
I know I shouldn't be happy about this situation.

72
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,080
One of the students has died?

73
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,930
The autopsy was completed this weekend.

74
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,900
They didn't find anything strange in his body or blood.

75
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,610
The cause of death was a heart attack.

76
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,780
So why did you call me? I'm already so busy with my studies and books.

77
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,220
Are you really from a famous high school?

78
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,710
...a student has died, and all you care about is studying.

79
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
I know.

80
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,700
I'm in the same situation myself.

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,160
Min Young.

82
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,160
Yoo Jung doesn't even have parents.

83
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,680
Today, everything ends.

84
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,290
He loves you.

85
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,720
They're still here.

86
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,360
Min Young, come back to class. I'll take care of your place.

87
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,550
Because he was afraid you would worry, he didn't tell you anything.

88
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:19,350
Besides being intelligent, he also has a high level of understanding.

89
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,210
What?

90
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,000
Just because someone has died.

91
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,990
He calls me every day.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,720
He says he's been scared and even has nightmares.

93
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,350
Really?

94
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,060
They must have been very close to each other.

95
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,540
When he sees Yoo Jung's condition, he should...

96
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,780
He should appreciate what he has.

97
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,030
I wish he would be friends with Min Young instead.

98
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,140
I think this is also fate.

99
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,220
So please tell Min Young to take care of my daughter.

100
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,400
What is your daughter's name?

101
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,320
Ji-hae... Park Ji-hae.

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,490
I heard you were at the police station.

103
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,280
I told Teacher Yoo.

104
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,350
Hey.

105
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,100
Really, wasn't he beside So Yoo-jung when it happened?

106
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,210
They said... they did an autopsy but found nothing.

107
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,440
Why are you so obsessed with that masked girl?

108
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
You're making a big deal out of it!

109
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Sung Jin-woo.

110
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,850
Sorry, I interrupted you.

111
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,620
Tell Teacher Yoo that I went to the restroom.

112
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,550
Oh, now I remember. He was friends with So Yoo-jung.

113
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,120
How funny! He used to say he had a crush on her.

114
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Where is Ji-hae?

115
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,420
He went to the bathroom.

116
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,140
Okay, I got it. Please don't look for me anymore.

117
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,130
Well, let's move on from this topic.

118
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,540
That embarrassing incident that happened a few days ago.

119
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,940
I apologize sincerely for that.

120
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,300
As the general manager, I apologize.

121
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,790
You've been working in this factory for a long time.

122
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,010
So you must know that she's not always like this.

123
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,990
We can't let one bad apple ruin the whole box, can we?

124
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,520
Ah, yes.

125
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,640
I wanted to tell you something.

126
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,350
If the police ever ask you anything,

127
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,720
Don't drag the factory into it.

128
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,990
I want you to promise me.

129
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,070
What happens after I promise?

130
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,670
What?

131
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,410
Can I become a permanent employee?

132
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,020
You have a strong spirit... like your sister.

133
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,370
I have to be strong to do my job well.

134
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,040
You're a police officer, aren't you?

135
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,850
Yes.

136
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,930
I came to turn myself in.

137
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
What?

138
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,670
I killed So Yoo-jung.

139
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,520
Because I was jealous of her grades.

140
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,290
I wanted to join the special class.

141
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,480
By using this.

142
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,870
Are you satisfied now?

143
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,040
Are you leaving now, aren't you?

144
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,580
Damn you.

145
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,010
I didn't dare eat this cookie because you're a guy.

146
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,580
Don't disturb me while I'm studying and get lost.

147
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:24,260
It has nothing to do with me.

148
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,160
He fell on his own. I didn't want you to worry for nothing.

149
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,450
Anyway, it's nothing new.

150
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,830
You must be shocked, for sure.

151
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,080
...If you had told me.

152
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,090
Would it have made a difference?

153
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,700
You would have just worried for no reason.

154
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,410
But how did you find out?

155
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,270
My daughter is the general manager of the factory and was classmates with you.

156
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,810
Her name is Park Ji-hae.

157
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,950
Park Ji-hae?

158
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,070
From now on, have the courage not to tell me these things.

159
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,670
I'm your supervisor.

160
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,510
She said she hates school and wants to leave.

161
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,960
But I don't care about your grades and scholarship.

162
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,170
By the way, I got hired permanently.

163
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,940
Let's celebrate tonight.

164
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,210
...I'll buy a cake. The class ends soon, so come to my house right away.

165
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,210
Oh, I have a class, I have to go.

166
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,560
I'll see you later. Congratulations.

167
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,690
Being hired permanently.

168
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,690
...So you're saying that

169
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,630
This cookie makes you study well.

170
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,530
But the more you eat, the stronger your reaction is.

171
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,310
...And then

172
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,930
Your wishes will come true.

173
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,430
Right before your eyes.

174
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
But...

175
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,600
If you eat more than one a day

176
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,270
It puts pressure on you.

177
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,540
Ji-hae.

178
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,450
Are you studying in the bathroom?

179
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,940
It's more comfortable in the room.

180
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,200
Do you want it to bring you more luck?

181
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,510
You can tell by just a glance how hard it is.

182
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:41,000
Because the ranking exam is coming up soon.

183
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,010
I'm a bit stressed.

184
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,470
Sorry.

185
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,510
You always wanted to join the special class, didn't you?

186
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,670
No... I understand.

187
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,290
I know it's not about your rank, and you want to get a scholarship.

188
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,360
If you don't get the scholarship, you can't come to school.

189
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,480
If I can sleep less, it would be great.

190
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,410
Look,

191
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,530
I have to finish it today.

192
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,730
But I haven't finished even a quarter of it.

193
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,770
Do you want me to help you?

194
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,290
Whenever you feel drowsy, eat it.

195
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,740
Taking a bite will chase away sleep.

196
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,740
What is it?

197
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,460
Could this cookie be magical?

198
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,610
Yes.

199
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,290
Thank you for your magic.

200
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,770
Fighting!

201
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,910
Yes.

202
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,320
I want another cookie.

203
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:47,140
Can you give me another one?

204
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,090
I knew you would say that.

205
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,910
That's why I put it in your bag.

206
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,490
Eat them all together.

207
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,760
It has a bigger impact that way.

208
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,520
Special class, special class.

209
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,680
Where are we going?

210
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,920
Yes.

211
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,310
Don't you want to tell me where you got it from?

212
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,980
I just bought it.

213
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,570
I don't want to seek revenge from the other kids either.

214
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,580
...just.

215
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,120
I came to say it was my fault.

216
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,130
Wait a moment! Did you say other kids?

217
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,420
But.

218
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,540
Why doesn't it disappear?

219
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,430
Yoo Jung is after me for everything.

220
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,600
Did you just say other kids?

221
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,980
I said Yoo Jung is after me for everything.

222
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,410
Well, no one is here.

223
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,560
So don't worry.

224
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,770
I am a police officer.

225
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,920
As long as you're with me, not even God or spirits can touch a hair on your head.

226
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,470
They can't lay a finger on you.

227
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Did you understand?

228
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Ok.

229
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,750
Come on, let's go for now.

230
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,380
Sorry, I have to answer this call.

231
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
Yes, team supervisor?

232
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,440
I came to Jung Han High School.

233
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,020
There's been a problem.

234
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,180
No, it's a bit difficult for me to go back now.

235
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,230
Team supervisor, I'll call you in five minutes.

236
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,360
I'm sorry.

237
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,340
Ji Hae, I'm sorry.

238
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,720
You're a police officer, right?

239
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,220
Sorry, I don't have time right now.

240
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,230
No, no, no.

241
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,620
I had a question.

242
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,030
Can you give me some time?

243
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
No.

244
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,280
I also want to become a police officer.

245
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,250
How can I prepare for it?

246
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,670
Hurry up and make a decision, or else you'll regret it.

247
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,370
You ruined Soo Yo-jung.

248
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,830
Ship?

249
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,670
I made a mistake.

250
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,610
It was my fault.

251
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,880
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,630
Did you tell the police?

253
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,230
Did you give them a cookie?

254
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,510
Please disappear.

255
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,290
Please, don't look for me anymore.

256
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,320
Give him a punch.

257
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,100
No.

258
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,050
You didn't do anything like that.

259
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,770
You entered the special class with your own abilities.

260
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,570
Disappeared.

261
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,010
He/she has gone.

262
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,300
Did you kill your friend?

263
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,740
It's nonsense.

264
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,860
I've become good.

265
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,970
It's okay, I ate a cookie.

266
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,810
I'm alive.

267
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,020
I should have eaten it earlier.

268
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,740
Go and tell him/her again.

269
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,030
Do you want to surrender?

270
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,390
Didn't you say you wanted your family to be proud of you?

271
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,240
I've come.

272
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,470
Where were you?

273
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,690
I'm sorry... Honestly, I lied.

274
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,370
What?

275
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,120
I lied.

276
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,370
I didn't kill Yoojong.

277
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,950
Why should I kill him/her?

278
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,720
Mom, Dad.

279
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,090
I'm here.

280
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,000
Really? Finally, I got into the special class.

281
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,290
It turned out just like you always wanted.

282
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,050
Special class.

283
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,990
Yeah.

284
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,320
Finally, I got accepted.

285
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,000
Didn't you say you gave up on me?

286
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,350
After three years, I achieved my dream.

287
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,250
So please, be my friend.

288
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,300
Be my friend.

289
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,400
Really, really.

290
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,640
Hey, hey! How are you, Park Ji-hae?

291
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,610
Ji-hae?

292
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,190
Ji-hae! Park Ji-hae!

293
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,700
Hurry up.

294
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Have you chatted, Ji-hae?

295
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Park Ji-hae.

296
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,290
Ji-hae.

297
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,450
What's the chat?

298
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,800
It's getting late.

299
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,100
I had a haircut.

300
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,550
When they wake up, please call me.

301
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,610
Yes, I understand.

302
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,360
Detective Kim Yoon-bum.

303
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:01,140
Does it make sense for CCTV footage to be deleted with a logical reason?

304
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,680
We need to find the one who triggered the fire alarm.

305
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,070
I'm sorry.

306
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,380
Come on, who would steal a cookie?

307
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,590
I told you that it wasn't just an ordinary cookie.

308
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,550
And the culprit is the one who triggered the alarm.

309
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,040
Ji-hae is known for these things.

310
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,370
Because of the college entrance exam pressure.

311
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,610
He suffers from severe delusion.

312
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,400
His parents also put pressure on him.

313
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,290
This is not the first time it has happened like this.

314
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,490
He even...

315
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,440
He takes psychotropic medication.

316
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,890
Really, though...

317
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,430
I am a police officer.

318
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,140
I am a detective.

319
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,450
My point is the same.

320
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,750
You have an excellent police intuition.

321
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,500
Have faith.

322
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,360
Aren't you his teacher?

323
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,580
Go buy yourself a cookie with this money.

324
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,080
Don't bother others so much.

325
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,930
Well?

326
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,390
Take it.

327
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm selling it to him.

328
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,520
Can you give me 3,000 won?

329
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,850
3,000 won? -Yes.

330
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:15,910
How much? - 1,000 won - Accepted.

331
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:18,530
Hold on a moment.

332
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,630
No.

333
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,640
...Maybe not him.

334
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,050
Mr. Teacher.

335
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,020
Hello.

336
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,210
You... yes, you.

337
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,880
Wasn't it you?

338
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,040
Didn't you take the cookie?

339
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,650
Suddenly, you grabbed my hand.

340
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,660
And you said you wanted to become a police officer - Hey!

341
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,670
If you keep doing this again

342
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,120
Pointless guessing

343
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,140
And tarnish the reputation of our school

344
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,520
I won't stay silent

345
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,800
Why are you doing this? Who are you?

346
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,250
Who am I?

347
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,940
This... fine...

348
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,370
Jerk

349
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,940
Wait for me. I'll be back again

350
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,420
Seriously, how are you doing?

351
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
Yes

352
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,440
What kind of crazy police have they sent?

353
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,520
Hyung, the thing is

354
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,310
I have a question for you

355
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,120
Is there a drug that looks like a cookie?

356
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,870
Eating it causes hallucinations

357
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,750
It kind of keeps a person alert

358
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,030
Is it possible for it to not be detected in tests?

359
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,180
Can you investigate it?

360
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Open up your frown

361
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,200
I deleted the CCTV footage

362
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,110
That police officer will never understand

363
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,770
That you and I stole the cookie

364
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Who are you?

365
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,660
Did Seo Yoo-jung die because of this cookie too?

366
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,490
Because of the cookie you sold

367
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,010
I told you, what kind of jerk are you?

368
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,350
Go ask Aunt

369
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,350
Open the door

370
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,120
Go open the door. I told them to come

371
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:42,080
I told you

372
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,200
Ask Aunt

373
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,740
Open the door

374
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,010
I haven't seen them in a long time
