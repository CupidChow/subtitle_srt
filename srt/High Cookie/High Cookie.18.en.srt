Where did you get it?

5
00:00:47,385 --> 00:00:49,554
Anyway, at this speed

6
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:53,475
[Sooyoung] You must have made a lot of money

7
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,727
If cookies are 300 each

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,104
How much have you earned so far?

9
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:01,316
How much have you earned so now you&#39;re giving up?

10
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,109
[Hosu] At least answer the question.

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,945
You ask me where I got it from

12
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:08,990
If you look at something like this, it&#39;s a recipe.

13
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:12,702
It&#39;s not like everyone was aiming for nothing.

14
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:15,497
[Sooyoung] You’re completely free from money.

15
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,458
Life gets so fucking easy

16
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:20,460
do you need money

17
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:23,922
[Hosu] If you’re doing this because of Choi Min-young’s hospital bills, I’ll pay for it.

18
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,595
Do you know how much I&#39;ll need?

19
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,347
say

20
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,389

No matter how you sell cookies

24
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:43,024
Unless I make it, I&#39;m bound to run out of ingredients.

25
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,444

[snort]

27
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:49,614
Then for life

28
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:52,158
You can&#39;t go back to being Choi Sooyoung.

Am I dying?

35

- [Dark music] - Why would I kill you?

36
00:02:56,598 --> 00:02:58,349
I have the recipe for you.

37
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:00,560
If you pass the recipe

38
00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:04,355
Will I die then?

39
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,357
[Chief Heo] But don’t be mistaken.

40
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,735
My brother is patient, patient

It&#39;s in the luggage compartment, right?

Did you receive the ingredients well?

130
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:48,783

Would you like to work with me just until I get the recipe?

161
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:44,649
[Geonwoo] If we get that, we can each go our separate ways.
