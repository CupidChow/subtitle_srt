2
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,350
How do you come

3
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,880
I just got angry at the class teacher

4
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,710
Smile

5
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,060
What

6
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,310
Shut your mouth and laugh first

7
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,909
elder sister

8
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,000
What do you send this to your sister?

9
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,800
Lies to make up with lies

10
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,620
As long as I said

11
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,260
Will be as doubtful as a fool

12
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,060
Because it's stupid

13
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,570
Go to the hospital to test the blood

14
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,710
Said no problem

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,710
In order to prevent the procedures for admission in the hospital

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,130
It's amazing

17
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,260
Will always laugh

18
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,169
I have urine pants in front of the staff

19
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,510
Can't laugh

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Is it a bit strange?

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,420
It's not something wrong

22
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,910
what happened

23
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,840
Pretend to be my boyfriend

24
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,240
Give you 20,000 yuan at a time

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,110
What do you say? So suddenly

26
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,040
Don’t I come, come on

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,350
Although I don’t know the reason, I feel very fun

28
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,950
Will the chairman grandson also lack money?

29
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,020
certainly

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
The chairman grandson is also lacking money

31
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,880
His tuition fees were paid by me

32
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,260
Vast

33
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,420
Um

34
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,420
Once

35
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,800
The remaining 80,000 will be advanced to you first

36
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,880
No

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Cui Minying

38
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,250
Turn off the light

39
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,599
I can't remember

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,220
Everyone just competes simply

41
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,510
What are you doing

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,800
I was very happy to catch the horse's feet early in the morning

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,820
If you don’t report the price of my late time, you want money

44
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,880
I give you twice the last time

45
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,150
But call my sister

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,420
What do I want to say

47
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,860
Just make her feel at ease

48
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,510
Right now

49
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,910
When I was

50
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,860
The students around are unclear

51
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,600
The words are a bit rough

52
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,969
Safety first, don't care about the inspection again

53
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,459
Of course Min Ying arrives at the school safely

54
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,309
Safety first

55
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,109
Min Ying is the pride of our school

56
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,640
It is a very good student

57
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,100
Teaching room

58
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,020
Where are you going?

59
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,460
You are Cui Minying in Class S

60
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,420
I go to the classroom

61
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,170
Didn't I heard that the group learning group was?

62
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,330
I was just late, so I didn't have it, right?

63
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,510
What

64
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,930
Come with me the next section is my class

65
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,019
Teaching room

66
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
follow me

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,059
I said in the morning too

68
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,169
Just be a study before the entrance examination

69
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,570
Self -introduction book discussion interview in school records

70
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,170
All extra -curricular preparations before the entrance examination

71
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,460
All must be done here

72
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,620
do you understand

73
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,709
Do you know each other

74
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,910
Gels each other

75
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,310
She is a new classmate from Class A this time

76
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,510
Do you know all?

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,040
Hello, I am Park Smart

78
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,839
I'm glad to learn with everyone

79
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,910
I have always wanted to learn with you

80
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,480
I have always been the eleventh

81
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,929
I haven't been admitted to Class S for three years

82
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,620
But with this opportunity

83
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,349
After Xu Rujing died, he could come to Class S

84
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,510
congratulation

85
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,280
Congratulations on everyone's ranking has improved one

86
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,440
Just introduce it here

87
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,130
Almost

88
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,439
Your ranking has also improved, so happy

89
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,510
What kind of kindness

90
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,260
Is it too ruthless? Haoxiu

91
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,440
What

92
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,880
There is a little bit

93
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
Shut up

94
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,220
Write your self -introduction book with dedicated heart

95
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,329
The ranking of friends' death has increased

96
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,600
So celebrated with friends

97
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,130
Just write like this

98
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,550
How about Haoxiu

99
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,020
Not to write

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,480
Slightly ruthless

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,420
Everyone wants to take the major of chemistry life, right?

102
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,080
Died suddenly due to friends

103
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,200
I am interested in this major

104
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,880
Slightly add

105
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,200
Min Ying and Xizhen are easier to write these, right?

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,640
You are witnesses

107
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,550
After no one answers the beep you called

108
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,910
Auntie. Please call you the phone quickly. The chef knows too?

109
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,529
Auntie, please call you quickly

110
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,400
The chef knows too

111
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,240
I can eat it myself

112
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,709
I work hard to do it well

113
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,660
Don't even say delicious sentences

114
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,350
tasty

115
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,330
By the way, your boyfriend’s name is Haoxiu, right?

116
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,420
I'm so satisfied

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,369
I have a feeling

118
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,799
You two are very suitable

119
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,420
You have never talked about love and don’t know how to pretend to understand

120
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,149
After a while I invite you to dinner

121
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,570
Call him too

122
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,420
Go and date newly bought clothes

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Sister, you are beautiful

124
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,350
what happened

125
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,260
Why is it gone?

126
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,170
-Chat quickly -what is this

127
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,730
Can't you change it?

128
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,569
Except

129
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,040
I have a lot of clothes

130
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,529
You wear this dress the same as him, right?

131
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,259
How to look good

132
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Hello

133
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,620
So naughty with my sister

134
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,370
You look at this clothes really

135
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,349
I go to buy cola

136
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,219
Eat the meal

137
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,330
I finished eating

138
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,440
Eat it too

139
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,039
Did I let you do this?

140
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,660
Have I said that let you do this

141
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,480
Why is it so loud

142
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,510
sorry

143
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,330
Didn't bring a wallet

144
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,800
There is a new cola in the refrigerator

145
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,750
No need to buy it

146
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,530
What's wrong

147
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,279
How to press wrong

148
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,110
Haven't you been here for a long time?

149
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
Wait a moment

150
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,310
I thought of making a phone call again

151
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,569
But afraid you think about it

152
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,220
So I have been waiting

153
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,710
Do you have anything to do

154
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,220
Isn't it

155
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,600
do not care

156
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,000
I am a bit messy now

157
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,510
It's the first time in this life

158
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,330
That feeling and mood

159
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,350
Get your arms away from your arm first

160
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,620
I am me

161
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,480
I just come to find that thing

162
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,769
I think about it and definitely be here

163
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,770
I only felt that kind of feeling after eating that

164
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Where is that now

165
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,460
what is that

166
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,080
biscuit

167
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,060
One thousand

168
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,820
-Wen a little -Okay

169
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,570
-Gain -Okay

170
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,710
What are you doing here

171
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,040
Do you live nearby?

172
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,170
What I said before is in the same community

173
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,859
Here is cheaper than the supermarket

174
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,750
So buy food while exercise

175
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
How can you come here

176
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,350
Is it just for a bottle of cola to come to the supermarket?

177
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,350
Um

178
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,660
I also save two hundred yuan

179
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,260
Do you have the time

180
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,800
Do you want me to play with you?

181
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,260
Team leader

182
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:04,530
Didn’t you tell me in the early morning?

183
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,930
Want to have dinner together or something

184
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,749
It's just a joke

185
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,839
If you come to the door to do this

186
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,659
I can't be a joke anymore

187
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,859
You go, let's go

188
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,020
My sister is back soon

189
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,509
I'm not kidding

190
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,480
real

191
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,479
Give me a biscuits and leave immediately

192
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,039
I don't

193
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,349
I want to give you too, but I don’t have

194
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,710
Where did you get it

195
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,969
Did you find someone to do it?

196
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,860
Did you buy it?

197
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,240
I don't sell

198
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,859
It was made by my sister's boyfriend

199
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,199
How can I have a way

200
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,440
Sister's boyfriend

201
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,440
Then ask your sister

202
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,220
Come back right away, right?

203
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,570
Don't be so rusty

204
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,030
Didn't I have given you 80,000 won before?

205
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,470
I said before I said I am a boyfriend

206
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,750
So I am a bank

207
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,000
If the dormitory can be repaired quickly

208
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,840
I hate staying at home

209
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,840
Why hate staying at home

210
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,010
poverty

211
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,890
Like a rotten pit

212
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,850
But it is very kind

213
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,520
So even more people want to vomit

214
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,480
You are also kind

215
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,660
you do not know

216
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,290
What kind of person I am

217
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,880
None of the people who are really bad will have such an idea

218
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,150
Sister Min Ying, don't go home before I contact you

219
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,030
My sister

220
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,540
what

221
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,590
When will your sister come back?

222
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,050
When will it come back?

223
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,390
Are you doing something strange?

224
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,390
Let me show me the phone

225
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:55,509
None

226
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,640
-At you sit there and wait for the meeting ... -show me to show me

227
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,020
Is your sister's phone 112?

228
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,520
My sister

229
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:11,360
No, your sister’s phone is not 112

230
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,110
-Bury -Hey

231
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,410
-In sister -Minying

232
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,409
Where is the biscuits

233
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,289
Just give it to me and leave

234
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,079
I won't make things so big

235
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,500
Xiuying, she has to do a small question

236
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,130
Alarm to the police

237
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,180
Hmm, go to the police to call the police to see it

238
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,930
See what your sister will end

239
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,730
Sister can't

240
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:46,520
Absolutely not

241
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,360
What can't be?

242
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,440
What's wrong with you?

243
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,400
Go together

244
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,470
It's not this name, right?

245
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,310
What did my sister's boyfriend put in the biscuits?

246
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,010
Rainbow appeared in front of you

247
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,600
There is also a big sister -in -law ...

248
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm really simple

249
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,529
I just want another biscuit

250
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,240
Where can you buy it if you don’t have?

251
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,739
Why let people call the police

252
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,910
Why do you make things big?

253
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,630
What a beauty

254
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,929
You are not the name of the team leader.

255
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,930
Is it very good?

256
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,300
Haven't you scolded me with my eyes?

257
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,350
Take a look at this evening

258
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
You are also very good

259
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,850
Dear, don't call the team leader

260
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,980
Screaming brother come to listen to it

261
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,570
I tear the tape on your mouth for you

262
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,450
coming

263
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,650
sister

264
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,610
fine...

265
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,910
Come alone

266
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,830
Biscuits

267
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,840
You put my sister first

268
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,840
Then I'll give it to you again

269
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,569
Do you have to call the police first?

270
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,570
Shut up

271
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,610
It's over

272
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,950
First confirm whether my sister is safe

273
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,830
Then call the police

274
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,330
You say confirmation

275
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,830
Are you going to go alone?

276
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,460
I will put a shoe card and the door

277
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,210
After I give you a signal in it

278
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,720
fortunately

279
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,510
It's okay

280
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,980
how about you

281
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,690
It is only six minutes at most

282
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,480
I will look at it after the matter

283
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,320
Then you will be dangerous

284
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,610
fine

285
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,030
I have experienced it

286
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,989
First hand over the biscuits

287
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,119
Give me me and leave

288
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,079
Can you just unbutton it yourself?

289
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
No

290
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,920
You let me give you again

291
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,459
I also want to fight for myself a little bit of escape

292
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Are you scared

293
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,380
Do you know that you are doing bad things?

294
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,550
Give me a biscuit

295
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,930
Think more about you

296
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,560
I can't give it to you, let's get in danger, right?

297
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,100
What do you want to do like this?

298
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,700
Give me me

299
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,580
Biscuits and biscuits, give me me, let you give me

300
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,409
I let you give me

301
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,330
Give me me

302
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,170
Give me

303
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,590
Wait a minute

304
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,390
Don't come over

305
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Min Ying

306
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,970
Min Ying

307
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Min Ying

308
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,810
Are you OK

309
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,900
Why don't you do it as I said?

310
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,900
I feel that I can't just go away like this

311
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,490
never mind

312
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,660
Help me loosen my sister

313
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,890
Stretch

314
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,850
waste

315
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,370
Only waste

316
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,350
Cui Minying

317
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,890
Hello

318
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,310
Min Ying

319
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,729
Cui Minying

320
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,939
It takes a few minutes

321
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,569
Open the door when I am still talking

322
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,950
Can I survive?

323
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,660
I will work hard, please don't hang up

324
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:11,570
Don't come in

325
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,959
Cui Xiuying

326
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,720
If you don’t get out now, your sister is about to die

327
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,720
Don't come out

328
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,270
I have already called the police and someone will come soon

329
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,810
Xiuying

330
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,399
Dad told you

331
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,070
If you don't come out, your sister will die

332
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,360
If your sister is dead, it's all because of you

333
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,370
Don't come out

334
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,620
Quiet

335
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,049
Come on, save your sister

336
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,590
Don't come out

337
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,510
No name
