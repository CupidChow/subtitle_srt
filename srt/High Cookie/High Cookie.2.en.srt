00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,350
Why did you come now?

3
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,880
Our teacher was handling the case file.

4
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,710
Smile.

5
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,060
What?

6
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,310
Be quiet and smile.

7
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,909
That one.

8
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey, why are you sending it for your sister?

9
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:28,800
Lies must be covered with lies.

10
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,620
Whatever I say...

11
00:01:30,621 --> 00:01:32,260
She believes it like a fool.

12
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,060
Fool.

13
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,570
He went to the hospital for tests.

14
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,710
They said everything is normal.

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,710
For now, as a precaution, they admitted him.

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,130
But the strange part is that...

17
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,260
He was laughing.

18
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,169
He soaked his pants in front of everyone.

19
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,510
But he was laughing.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Isn't it a bit weird?

21
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,420
Isn't it possible that he ate something wrong?

22
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,910
Really?

23
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,840
Pretend to be my boyfriend.

24
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,240
Each time, I'll give you 20,000 won.

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,110
What are you saying?

26
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,040
I'll do it.

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,350
I don't know what's going on, but it seems interesting.

28
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,950
Does the grandson of the boss also need money?

29
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,020
It's obvious.

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
The grandson of the boss also needs money.

31
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,880
I'll pay for his tuition.

32
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,260
You don't know, right?

33
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,420
Oh well.

34
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,420
You helped this time.

35
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,800
80,000 won for next time too.

36
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,880
He doesn't want it.

37
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,440
Choi Min Young.

38
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,599
I don't remember.

39
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,220
They will all get along.

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,510
Why is it dried up?

41
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,800
I guess I was lucky this time too.

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,820
So not rejecting my absence means you want money, right?

43
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,880
This time, I'll give you double.

44
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,150
Instead, call my sister.

45
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,420
What should I tell her?

46
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,860
Just reassure her.

47
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,510
Right now.

48
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,910
What about the students?

49
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,860
They may be a bit...

50
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,600
Their words might be harsh.

51
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,459
I know. Min Young arrived at school safely.

52
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,109
Min Young is our school pride.

53
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,640
You don't know how friendly she is.

54
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,100
Teachers' office.

55
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,020
Where are you going?

56
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,460
You're Choi Min Young from the special class, right?

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,420
I'm going to my class.

58
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,170
Haven't you heard about our group study?

59
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,330
Because you came late, you didn't hear, right?

60
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,510
What?

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,930
Follow me. Your next class is with me.

62
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,019
Classroom.

63
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
Follow me.

64
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,059
Like I told you this morning.

65
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,169
From now on, we will have group study together.

66
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,570
Everything we do includes interviews, study, and...

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,170
It's for college entrance exam preparation.

68
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,460
They will all take place here.

69
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:36,620
Be on your guard.

70
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,709
...you all know each other, so there's no need for introductions.

71
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,910
I guess there might be a need.

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,310
Your new classmate is from class A.

73
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,510
Do you know her?

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,040
Hi, I'm Park Ji Hee.

75
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,839
I'm very happy to study with you.

76
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,910
I've always wanted to study with you.

77
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,480
I've always been ranked eleventh.

78
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,929
That's why I couldn't get into the special class for three years.

79
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,620
...but now I have the opportunity to

80
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,349
because of your son's death, Soo Yoo Jung.

81
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,510
Congratulations.

82
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,280
Congratulations to all of you! Your rankings are going to improve by one.

83
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,440
That's enough.

84
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,130
Don't get too excited.

85
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,439
Your rank has improved too, you should be happy.

86
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,510
Why are you acting like that?

87
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,260
Isn't it a bit repulsive?

88
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,440
What?

89
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,880
Why not? It's a bit.

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,240
Stop.

91
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,220
Write it in your letter with a selfless heart.

92
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,329
"Because my friend passed away and our rankings improved."

93
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,600
"I congratulated my friends."

94
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:59,130
Just write it like that.

95
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,550
What do you think?

96
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,020
Why not?

97
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,480
Of course, a bit more ruthless.

98
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,420
Everyone here wants to study chemistry, right?

99
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,080
"Write" because my friend died.

100
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,200
"I became interested in this field."

101
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,880
Write it with a bit of passion.

102
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,200
Min Young and Hee Jin can do this, right?

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,640
Haven't you witnessed it?

104
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,550
The desired device is not available.

105
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,529
Aunt, please pick up the phone.

106
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,400
Chef also knows, right?

107
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,240
I can eat it myself.

108
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,709
I made a lot of effort for it.

109
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,660
Don't you want to at least compliment my cooking?

110
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,350
It's delicious.

111
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,330
By the way, your boyfriend's name is Ho Soo, right?

112
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,420
It really struck a chord with me.

113
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,369
I have a feeling about it.

114
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,799
You look good together.

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,420
You never let me know. How do you know, then?

116
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,149
I'll invite him for dinner later.

117
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,570
Let him know.

118
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,420
You should dress nicely and go on a date, too.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
You, really, are beautiful.

120
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,350
What's this?

121
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,260
Where did the clothes I bought go?

122
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,170
Surprise! What is this?

123
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,730
Did you go and change it?

124
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,569
I left one for you to keep.

125
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,040
I have a lot of clothes.

126
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,529
This looks good on you and Ho Soo, right?

127
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,259
It's beautiful, isn't it?

128
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
Hey!

129
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,620
Don't bring a flirtatious guy for your older sister.

130
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,370
See, it suits you very well.

131
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,349
I'm going to get a soft drink.

132
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,219
Finish your meal first.

133
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,330
I'm full.

134
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,440
But you should eat more.

135
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,039
Did I ask you to do this?

136
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,660
What? Did I ask you?

137
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,480
Why are you making noise?

138
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,510
Excuse me.

139
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,330
You forgot your wallet again, didn't you?

140
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,800
I looked in the fridge and saw that we have soda.

141
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,750
He doesn't want to buy it.

142
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,530
What is it?

143
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,279
Why are you getting all the passwords wrong?

144
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,110
Because you haven't been here for a long time. Have you forgotten?

145
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
Wait a minute.

146
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,310
I was going to make a call.

147
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,569
But I thought you would find it strange.

148
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,220
So I waited here instead.

149
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,710
Anything wrong, sir?

150
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,220
No.

151
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,600
I don't know.

152
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,000
I feel a little overwhelmed now.

153
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,510
It's the first time for me.

154
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,330
I have a strange feeling.

155
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,350
First, put your hands down.

156
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,620
Me too.

157
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:46,480
I came to find that thing.

158
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,769
The more I think about it, the more I realize it was because of that.

159
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,770
After eating it, I felt like this.

160
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,860
Where is it now?

161
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,460
What?

162
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,080
Cookie.

163
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,060
One thousand won.

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,820
Just a moment.

165
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,570
Here you go. Thank you.

166
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,710
What are you doing here?

167
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,040
Do you live in this neighborhood?

168
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:32,170
I told you before that we are neighbors.

169
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,859
The supermarket is cheaper, so I come here.

170
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,750
I also walk a little.

171
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,600
What are you doing here?

172
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,350
Did you come all the way here just for a drink?

173
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,350
Yes.

174
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,660
This way, I save two thousand won.

175
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,260
Do you have time?

176
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,800
Do you want to play a game?

177
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,260
Sir.

178
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:04,530
You said it yourself this morning.

179
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,930
That you invited me for dinner.

180
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,749
It was just a joke.

181
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,839
But the fact that you came to my doorstep is not a joke.

182
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,659
This is not a joke anymore.

183
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,859
Leave right now.

184
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,020
My sister is coming now.

185
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,509
I'm not joking.

186
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,480
I'm serious.

187
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:20,479
Give me a cookie and I'll leave immediately.

188
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,039
I don't have it.

189
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,349
I want to give it to you, but I don't have it.

190
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,710
Where did you get it from?

191
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,969
Is it homemade?

192
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,860
Or did you buy it?

193
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:31,240
I don't sell it.

194
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,859
My sister's boyfriend made it.

195
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,199
How do I get it from anywhere?

196
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,440
Your sister's boyfriend?

197
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,440
Then ask your sister.

198
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,220
You said he's coming now, right?

199
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,570
Don't make that face.

200
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,030
Didn't I give you 80,000 won?

201
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,470
You said I should be your sister's boyfriend.

202
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,750
I became it already.

203
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,000
I wish they would fix the dormitory sooner.

204
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,840
I hate being at home.

205
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,840
Why do you hate being at home?

206
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,010
Because of poverty (referring to his sister).

207
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,890
Like a beggar.

208
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,850
But he's kind.

209
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,520
That's why I can bring him up.

210
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,480
You're kind too.

211
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,660
You don't know me.

212
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,290
What kind of person I am.

213
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,880
Those who are really bad don't have such thinking.

214
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,150
Min Young, don't come home until I call you.

215
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,030
Little sister.

216
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,540
What is it?

217
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,590
Are you telling your sister to come sooner?

218
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,050
I asked her when she's coming.

219
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,390
You don't want to do something strange, right?

220
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,390
Let me see your phone.

221
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:55,509
No.

222
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,640
You go sit and wait - Show me - Show me.

223
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,020
Is your sister's number 112? (referring to the police emergency number)

224
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,520
Little sister.

225
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:11,360
No, your sister's number is not 112.

226
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,110
Yes? - Hello?

227
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,410
Min Young - Hello?

228
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,409
Where is Cookie?

229
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,289
Just give him to me and I'll leave.

230
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,079
It's nothing serious.

231
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,500
So Young is making something out of straw.

232
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,130
Call the police.

233
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,180
Call the police.

234
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,930
Then you'll see what trouble your sister will get into.

235
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,730
No.

236
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:46,520
No.

237
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,360
No what?

238
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,440
What happened?

239
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,400
Let me come too.

240
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,470
These are not it, right?

241
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,310
What has your sister's boyfriend put in that cookie?

242
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,010
A rainbow appeared in front of me.

243
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,600
...and then a few ladies.

244
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,440
See, it's very simple.

245
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,529
I just want that cookie.

246
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,240
If you don't have it, at least tell me where I can buy it.

247
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,739
Why do we have to call the police for such a thing?

248
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,910
Why are you making something out of straw?

249
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,630
You're so beautiful!

250
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,929
You always used to call me "Sir Manager."

251
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,930
Do you know how much I liked it?

252
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,300
You didn't swear at me with your eyes, right? (referring to their playful banter)

253
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,350
Now that I look at it.

254
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Your body is also something good.

255
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,850
Don't call me Sir Manager anymore.

256
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,980
Call me Oppa.

257
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,570
Should I open your mouth?

258
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,450
He came.

259
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,650
That one.

260
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,610
...It's nothing.

261
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,910
Did you come alone?

262
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,830
Did you bring the cookie?

263
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,840
First, let my sister go.

264
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,840
Then I will give it to you.

265
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,569
Shouldn't we call the police first?

266
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,570
Be quiet.

267
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,610
It will only get worse.

268
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,950
First, I need to make sure that my sister is safe.

269
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,830
Then we will call the police.

270
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,330
Are you sure?

271
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,830
Do you want to go alone?

272
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,460
I'll put my shoes by the door.

273
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,210
When I signal you, call the police and then run away.

274
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,720
Thank goodness.

275
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,510
He's feeling better.

276
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,980
Then what about you?

277
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,690
It takes about six minutes for the police to arrive.

278
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,480
I'll delay him somehow.

279
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,320
What if you get in danger?

280
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,610
It's okay.

281
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,030
I have experience with it.

282
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,989
Give me the cookie first.

283
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,119
Then I'll go.

284
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,079
After that, you can open it yourself.

285
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,080
No.

286
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,920
First, let my sister go.

287
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,459
I also need to find an escape route for myself.

288
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Are you scared?

289
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,380
Because you know that what you did is a crime.

290
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,550
Give me the cookie.

291
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,930
Use your brain a little.

292
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,560
What if I give it to you and then you do something? What should I do then?

293
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,100
Why are you wasting time?

294
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,700
I regret it.

295
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:11,580
Give me the cookie... Give me the cookie.

296
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,409
I regret it.

297
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,330
I regret it.

298
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,170
I regret it.

299
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,590
Oh well.

300
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,390
Don't come forward.

301
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Min Young.

302
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,970
Min Young.

303
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Min Young.

304
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,810
How are you?

305
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,900
Why didn't you do what I asked and instead jumped in like this?

306
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,900
Well, I couldn't just stand by and do nothing.

307
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,490
Forget it.

308
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,660
Help me open my sister.

309
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,890
Stop.

310
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,850
Damn you.

311
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,370
Did you think I'm stupid?

312
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,350
Choi Min Young.

313
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,890
Hello?

314
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,310
Min Young.

315
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,729
Choi Min Young.

316
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,939
... If I delay a few minutes.

317
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,569
I'll talk nicely until I lose my patience. Open the door.

318
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,950
Will you save me then?

319
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:38,660
I will delay, so please don't hang up until you arrive.

320
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:11,570
Delay it.

321
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,959
Choi So Young.

322
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,720
If you don't come out, your sister will die.

323
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,720
Don't come out.

324
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,270
I called the police. They will arrive soon.

325
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,810
So Young.

326
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,399
Daddy told you that...

327
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,070
If you don't come out, your sister will die.

328
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,360
If your sister dies, it's all your fault.

329
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,370
Don't come out.

330
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,620
Shut up.

331
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,049
Come. You have to save your sister.

332
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,590
Don't come out.

333
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,510
Be quiet.
