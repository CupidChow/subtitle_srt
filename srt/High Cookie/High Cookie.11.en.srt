2
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,574
Anyone who doesn't know thinks this is your home.

3
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,994
Oh, sorry. I was a little tired.

4
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,829
Let's start the lesson.

5
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,875
Were you working all night?

6
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,087
We have a lot of lessons today.

7
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,758
Don't worry, it's the last day.

8
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,385
Don't make excuses anymore.

9
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,723
By the way, my mom gave me this.

10
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,521
I added a little extra.

11
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,731
He said you worked really hard this time.

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,069
He said it was thanks to you that I can study in America.

13
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:56,241
But isn't this a little too much?

14
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,701
You also tried hard and got accepted.

15
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,079
If you want to go there, you need money.

16
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,247
Accept it.

17
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,833
This is not money for my parents.

18
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,127
Thank you.

19
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,130
I'll give you 200,000 won.

20
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,923
Can we finish today's lesson quickly?

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,384
Hey, Lee over there.

22
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,095
My parents aren't here.

23
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,012
How about 300?

24
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,353
Okay.

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,063
Come on.

26
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,903
Well, class is over.

27
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,610
I can't work anymore.

28
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:17,989
Then find someone else.

29
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,908
I did my best.

30
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:21,868
Give up.

31
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,746
Do you know how many times I got angry and yelled today?

32
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,789
How many times did they drop food from the table?

33
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,294
...I tried to bear it because of your circumstances.

34
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,129
Oh my God... dealing with my mother...

35
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,422
It's really hard, isn't it?

36
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,552
If only right now...

37
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,846
What should I do if I send 300,000 won?

38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,016
Oh, really, then...

39
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,273
I can deal with your conditions.

40
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,609
So please come and let's talk.

41
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,654
At least until tomorrow, okay?

42
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,411
I haven't seen you in a long time.

43
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,039
Dad.

44
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,386
Dad!

45
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,809
Dad!

46
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,271
Dad!

47
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,870
Ugh!

48
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,122
This money is for my mom's hospital.

49
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,458
This is all the money I've saved up until now.

50
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,834
If not, we'll die.

51
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,753
Do you know how much sleep I've missed?

52
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,671
How long will it take to save up this money?

53
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,631
Damn it.

54
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,920
Hey, I came to see the boss.

55
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:01,838
Ugh!

56
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,673
Did you delete all the files and cameras?

57
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,217
Ah, the police... what's going on?

58
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,385
Didn't the police come?

59
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,636
...then we should escape first.

60
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,720
Shut up.

61
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,474
Put the files in here.

62
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,476
I won't go anywhere without it.

63
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,566
Did you delete all the files and cameras?

64
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,110
Delete all the documents and evidence.

65
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,864
Boss, the police are on the first floor.

66
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,035
Once you transfer the files, throw the flash drive out the window, okay?

67
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,454
Okay.

68
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,737
...I just want to take my money.

69
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,556
My research was almost done.

70
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,599
There was no trace left.

71
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,893
There were no side effects either.

72
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,689
The instructions for that drug were perfect.

73
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,860
What happened to that researcher?

74
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,237
You burned down.

75
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,864
It was too slow, so it burned.

76
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,659
You're alone.

77
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,662
Did you complete the flawless research?

78
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,872
I told you that.

79
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,375
The research was finished.

80
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,543
The others too.

81
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,796
I didn't need to save them.

82
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,256
...that person.

83
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,591
What was their name?

84
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,011
Inhaesur?

85
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,846
Yes, Inhaesur.

86
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,682
I thought I would never find them again.

87
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,893
I thought they disappeared forever.

88
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,479
But that order still exists.

89
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,773
How unlucky I am.

90
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,150
Okay.

91
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,069
I'll find that substitute no matter what.

92
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,070
So...

93
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,032
...get the order from Shaf.

94
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,825
I'll kill them.

95
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,785
Inhaesur.

96
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,579
I'll carry out Inhaesur.

97
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,338
Song Jin-woo, did he take Lee Ohn Soo?

98
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,840
You don't know why?

99
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,677
Don't they realize they're being pursued?

100
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,266
Are you sure?

101
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,063
Ugh.

102
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,151
We need to find the cop who works with Lee Ohn Soo.

103
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,654
Otherwise, our business is at risk.

104
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,408
Then we'll have to end everything.

105
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,445
From now on, have it delivered directly to the house.

106
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,448
We need to be careful for a while.

107
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,249
Hoseo is not such a person.

108
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,751
Take responsibility for what you said.

109
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,170
...if only because it's interesting to you.

110
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,588
It really is interesting to me.

111
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,341
That you, who were betrayed by Hoseo.

112
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,219
How are you planning to get revenge on him?

113
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:01,929
That's what I was looking for.

114
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,098
But I'm not joking.

115
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,724
All my words.

116
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,017
It's the truth.

117
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,687
That Hoseo...

118
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,939
Is he the same Shaf?

119
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,402
I'm supposed to die.

120
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,031
My damn body hurts so much.

121
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,034
But they say there is no cure, damn it, because it's a rare disease.

122
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,080
Shaf found me himself and offered to help me.

123
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,625
He said if I eat a cookie, I'll get better.

124
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,962
My body doesn't hurt anymore.

125
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,423
And I'll stay healthy.

126
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,842
And I don't have to hide my weakness.

127
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,558
But the fact that Hoseo is the same Shaf...

128
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,561
It's very treacherous and selfish.

129
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,022
I'm working under Hoseo's command.

130
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,694
You're making a mistake.

131
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,988
You should believe in what you believe.

132
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,698
So what about me?

133
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,158
What about Min Young?

134
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,952
Did we both fall for Hoseo's deception?

135
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,996
Does it make sense logically?

136
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,582
If you don't believe me...

137
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,960
If you don't want to get revenge on him...

138
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,795
I'll do it.

139
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,466
I have no words for you.

140
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,012
I don't say these things for fun.

141
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,682
I'm not joking either.

142
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,480
Hoseo made me desperate for myself.

143
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,399
It wasn't as good as your grades.

144
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,901
What?

145
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,153
This difficult family life of yours.

146
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:45,282
Is there a reason you described it that way?

147
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,078
I want to tell them that I succeeded on my own.

148
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,330
I found my own opportunity.

149
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,209
But your method is wrong.

150
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,835
Look, number one:

151
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,462
Experimental learning experiences and extracurricular activities.

152
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,673
Number two: What I worked hard on during my studies.

153
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,632
And number three...

154
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,386
None of them are related to the questions.

155
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,179
No.

156
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,348
I wrote them down correctly.

157
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,229
Missing father.

158
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,147
And a mother with cancer and all that.

159
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,108
Do you want to buy sympathy?

160
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,819
Nobody cares about these things.

161
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,904
Hey, Jin.

162
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,031
Do universities care about these things?

163
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,994
No.

164
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:38,002
Well, that's enough for now.

165
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,378
Hoseo, too.

166
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,130
Write it down from the beginning.

167
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,256
Okay?

168
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,223
I'm sorry.

169
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,266
Guys.

170
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,643
It's true that it's not your turn.

171
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,979
But we spent time for him.

172
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,939
Shouldn't you participate?

173
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,566
And Ohn Soo.

174
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,693
We need to talk before you go.

175
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,820
We need to investigate the awards you won in America.

176
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,280
We should examine them.

177
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,198
I'm sorry.

178
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,785
If it's not necessary, can we do it later?

179
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,038
It's my turn next.

180
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,167
You were giving counseling numbers in order.

181
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,419
I thought that's why I prepared everything.

182
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,589
First, do it for Jin.

183
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,675
Ah, okay.

184
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,344
We'll do just that.

185
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,805
Hoseo.

186
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,267
Come, let's talk for a bit.

187
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,154
Wait.

188
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,907
What's the matter?

189
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,414
If it's not right, let me know.

190
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,129
I only told you at school that...

191
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,757
I'm working with a cop.

192
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,637
So how did Shaf find out and pursue me?

193
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,931
What happened?

194
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,351
Are you Shaf?

195
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,687
Huh?

196
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,984
Why are you talking nonsense?

197
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,529
You're not, are you?

198
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,781
It's impossible for you to be Shaf, right?

199
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,992
Obviously.

200
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,787
That's enough.

201
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,791
What would you do if you weren't obsessed with Shaf?

202
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,960
If you weren't obsessed with Shaf.

203
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,754
Do you take responsibility for what you say?

204
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,260
I keep thinking that...

205
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,847
Why did Shaf eat the cookie herself?

206
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,141
If there really is an antidote,

207
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,560
The easiest way would have been for Aunt to eat it.

208
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,106
That doesn't mean that...

209
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,361
Even Shaf doesn't have the antidote?

210
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,447
The antidote doesn't exist?

211
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,990
Min Young.

212
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,577
Can't she regain consciousness?

213
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,828
Yes, if what I said is true.

214
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,872
If So Hosu is actually Shaf.

215
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,250
Shut up.

216
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,169
I'll prove it myself, that...

217
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,255
Hosu is not Shaf and Shaf is someone else.

218
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,506
And Min Young.

219
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,925
She can regain consciousness.

220
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,721
You're not Shaf.

221
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,431
If you are Shaf.

222
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,266
That means the antidote doesn't exist either.

223
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,393
What are you saying?

224
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,395
But just to be sure.

225
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,148
I want to be completely certain.

226
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,529
Is this cookie real?

227
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,993
Can you eat it?

228
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,996
If you really woke up after eating it that time.

229
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,086
Do you doubt me?

230
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,714
I just want to...

231
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,049
Believe me.

232
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,595
It's really strange.

233
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,430
I'm in a good mental state.

234
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,350
I study more than before.

235
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,769
But my grades are dropping.

236
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,105
Oh, come on.

237
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,399
If you drop another rank, you'll fall into class E.

238
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,406
Someone who has been in class E and F for two years.

239
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,700
Suddenly enters the special class.

240
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,536
Isn't there any chance?

241
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,705
Maybe because she studied hard with all her heart and soul.

242
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,834
Are you saying I can't study?

243
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,044
No.

244
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,631
I'm just saying let's find a more effective solution.

245
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,384
Then give me a solution.

246
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,346
If your solution is effective, I'll pay you however much you want.

247
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,642
Hey.

248
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,645
So this way, I can succeed.

249
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,731
I even sacrificed my life for it.

250
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,071
Wait a moment.

251
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,545
I think we should schedule a counseling session another time.

252
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,671
What?

253
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,840
Come tomorrow morning.

254
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:35,757
Mr. Teacher!

255
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,761
This brat has something for herself.

256
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,055
She really wants to stay alive.

257
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,058
Revealing her home address and her daughter's elementary school was not enough.

258
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,978
She even revealed her parents' address.

259
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,748
Now I'm on the edge of the abyss.

260
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,500
This way, I could really die.

261
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,961
I can't take it anymore.

262
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,255
Don't cry.

263
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,549
What's wrong? It breaks my heart.

264
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,636
That if I find Shaf.

265
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,472
You'll save me.

266
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:24,806
Were you telling the truth?

267
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,145
If you make a mistake.

268
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,940
Your whole family will die.

269
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,151
However, you can exchange that for a Gwang Woo substitute.

270
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,736
I'll find her sooner.

271
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,240
I was telling the truth.

272
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,992
Don't underestimate Gwang Woo.

273
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,536
Didn't I tell you before?

274
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,623
That she, too, was in that barrel like you?

275
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,835
Someone who has neither a child nor parents.

276
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,880
What do you think she was counted on?

277
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,560
Why did you suddenly become suspicious of me?

278
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,313
You shouldn't do this anymore.

279
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:14,481
You know how much I want...

280
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,983
Min Young to regain consciousness.

281
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,027
Hey, you know how much I love Min Young.

282
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,654
But suddenly you say I'm Shaf?

283
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,492
I'm begging you once again.

284
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,996
Did Shaf say she would give me the antidote?

285
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,123
She didn't say that.

286
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,916
I don't know what happened.

287
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,918
But you're doing this because of your doubt.

288
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,214
What if I die?

289
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,263
Um...

290
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,810
Shaf will bring you back to consciousness.

291
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,770
If not,

292
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,565
I won't stay silent.

293
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,359
I don't want to die.

294
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,986
I don't want to die.

295
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,869
I won't give up.

296
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,954
Even if you don't like it.

297
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,373
I want to be absolutely sure.

298
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,500
What if I don't want to eat it?

299
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,091
Then I'll force you to eat it.

300
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,190
Oh, really.

301
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,862
If you really recover,

302
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,906
It's better if you just kill me right here.

303
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,784
Because I won't let it go under any circumstances.

304
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,911
Just as much as you tortured me,

305
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,788
I'll torture you.

306
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,083
I will report it to the police.

307
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,668
I will make sure you are punished in every way possible.

308
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:02,214
I will even find the hospital your mother is admitted to.

309
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,261
What did you just say?

310
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,972
The hospital your mother is in.

311
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,516
I will find it.

312
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,851
And then I will kill him.

313
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,061
Shut up.

314
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,813
Until I kill you.

315
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,107
What is it?

316
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,818
Are you really recovering?

317
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,684
You brought all these troubles upon yourself.

318
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,399
Because...

319
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,985
Why did you intervene with my mother?

320
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,279
So, really...

321
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,368
Is there no way to save Min Young?

322
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,871
Was all of it a movie?

323
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,748
No!

324
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,628
You can't do this.

325
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,046
To me...

326
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,425
To us.

327
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,511
Do you know how much I trusted you?

328
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,222
How much I relied on you?

329
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,018
I found a boyfriend.

330
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:39,978
And you were kind.

331
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,646
No!

332
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,275
Hoseok, hit him! Hit him! Hoseok, no, no!

333
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,402
I love Min Young.

334
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,572
Go away.

335
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,701
When you went to school, you had a lot of friends, right?

336
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,952
Didn't you?

337
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,704
Pestering me a little, didn't you?

338
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,878
Can't you say that you're not?

339
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,588
Say you're not.

340
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,132
Say you're not cured.

341
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:18,475
Do you know why I went this far?

342
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,518
And brought you to this school?

343
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,188
I gave you a chance.

344
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,733
I wanted to save a helpless person.

345
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,027
Like that day...

346
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,656
That cooking order saved me.

347
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,852
Ah...

348
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,160
Come behind me right now.

349
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,163
You need to deal with a problem.

350
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,307
There's no need to come. I solved it myself.
