2
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,570
Whoever watched it thought this was your home?

3
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,990
Ah, I'm sorry that I'm a bit tired

4
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,820
Let's start learning

5
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,870
Do you work overnight?

6
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,080
I have to do a lot today

7
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,750
Are you all the last day and don't be so tight?

8
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,380
Don’t make excuses for the last day

9
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,720
By the way, my mother asked me to give you this to you

10
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,520
I let her put it more

11
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,730
Tell her that Haoxiu is really hard during this time

12
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,060
In fact, thanks to you, you can go to the United States to study in the United States

13
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,240
Having said that, this is too much to give it too much

14
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,700
Aren't you going into Zheng Han High School?

15
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,070
If you want to go to school there, you should use money in many places.

16
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,240
Just accept it

17
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,830
This is not anything for my parents

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,120
Thanks

19
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:10,130
I will give you more than 200,000 yuan more

20
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,920
Let's go to get out of class today

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,380
Hey Li Enshu

22
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,090
Ah anyway, my parents are all going out. No one is at home

23
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,010
Then give you 3 million

24
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:24,950
Um

25
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,060
for you

26
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,900
Ouch after class

27
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,120
Aunt Guardian

28
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,610
I can't continue to do it

29
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,980
So go to someone else, okay?

30
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,900
I am also benevolent

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,860
Ah, let me go

32
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,740
Just today I don't know how many times my temper yells.

33
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,780
Overturn the dining table

34
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,290
I want to say that you are also very pitiful, so just endure it again and again

35
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,270
-Ep -my mother really hurts you, right?

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,550
If I

37
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,840
Now get you 300,000 yuan for you

38
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,010
Ouch

39
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,270
I will try my best to meet the requirements you make

40
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,600
Tell me again

41
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,650
At least how can I tomorrow okay

42
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,410
long time no see

43
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,030
dad

44
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,380
dad

45
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,800
dad

46
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,270
dad

47
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,870
Abominable

48
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,120
This is the mother's hospital stay and there are still

49
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
My full tuition in high school

50
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,830
We really die without this money

51
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,750
I don't sleep day without day and night

52
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,670
After all the money that I got to get it

53
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,630
Bastard

54
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,920
I came to the chief of the room here

55
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,830
Ah

56
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,670
Have you deleted the computer?

57
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,210
-Ma now the police ... -What is the situation?

58
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,380
Now the police are here

59
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,630
Hide first and then ...

60
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:09,720
shut up

61
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,470
Stay the files here

62
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,470
Not allowed to go before

63
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,560
Have you deleted the computer?

64
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,110
Hurry up and destroy the evidence for me, you guys

65
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,860
The chief police officer is coming from the first floor

66
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,030
If the file is transferred, you will immediately throw the USB out of the window to know?

67
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,450
yes

68
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,730
I'll get the money and ask me to get in

69
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,820
ah

70
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,550
At that time, it was exactly when the research is about to end

71
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,590
Nothing will stay in the body

72
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,890
There are no other side effects except poisoning

73
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,680
It can be described as close to the perfect drug formula

74
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,860
How about that researcher

75
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,230
Of course it was burned to death

76
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,860
That guy is going to die slowly

77
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,650
So he is alone

78
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,660
Have you done such a powerful study?

79
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,870
Didn't you tell you?

80
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,370
It is when the research is about to end

81
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,540
remaining people

82
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,790
There is no need to stay alive

83
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,250
Didn't you have that?

84
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,590
What is called

85
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,010
Do you want to say monopoly?

86
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,840
Right ah monopoly

87
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,680
Alas, I thought it would never be found

88
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,890
I thought it had disappeared from this world

89
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,470
I didn't expect that formula was still there

90
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,770
It's so fortunate

91
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,150
Chef

92
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,060
Just find that guy

93
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,970
If the chef handed the formula

94
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,820
Of course you have to kill

95
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,780
after all

96
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,570
Monopoly

97
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,330
Did Song Zhenyu take Li Enshu away?

98
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,840
Don't know why

99
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,670
Shouldn't you follow them and have been discovered?

100
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,260
Are you sure

101
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,060
Ah

102
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,150
The police who followed Li Enshu must catch it

103
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,650
If you can't find this business, it will be more dangerous

104
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,400
It's going to stop business

105
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,440
In the future, you will go directly to your home and get it.

106
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,440
Because I have to be careful during this time

107
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,240
Haoxiu is not like that person

108
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,750
Speaking to be responsible

109
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,170
If it is for fun in this prank ...

110
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,580
It really said for fun

111
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,340
You betrayed by Xu Haoxiu

112
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,210
How novel ways will be revenge?

113
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,920
I am looking forward to it

114
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,090
But this is not a prank

115
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,720
All of what I said is

116
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,010
fact

117
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,680
Still determine Haoxiu in one bite

118
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,930
Is it a chef?

119
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm dying

120
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,030
It's seriously ill

121
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,030
However, it is said that the disease is not cured.

122
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,080
At that time, the person who found a helping hand was a chef

123
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
It's okay after eating cookies

124
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,960
Don't feel uncomfortable

125
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,420
Live healthy

126
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,840
No need to hide the appearance of my own illness

127
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,550
But the chef turned out to be Xu Haoxiu

128
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,560
This is betrayal, this is too wanton

129
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,020
I actually work for him under Xu Haoxiu's hands

130
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,690
Your move now is a mistake

131
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,980
Who believes this kind of words?

132
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,690
what about me

133
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,150
What about Yingying

134
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,950
Are both of us being deceived by Haoxiu?

135
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,990
Do you think this is reasonable

136
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,580
If you don't believe it

137
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,960
If you didn't plan to make a novel revenge on him

138
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,790
I am here

139
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,460
I have nothing to talk to you anymore

140
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,010
What I just said is not for fun

141
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
It's not justified for prank

142
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,480
It is a pity that Haoxiu's self -introduction is a pity

143
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,390
Compared with grades and other activities

144
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,900
What

145
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,150
This difficult family environment

146
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,280
Is it necessary to have to emphasize every project, is it highlighting?

147
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,070
Because it is overcome by my own power

148
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,330
The opportunity to seize by my own strength

149
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
But this method is wrong

150
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,830
Look at the first item

151
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,460
Learning experience and inter -school activities

152
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,670
The second item worked hard during school

153
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,900
And the third item

154
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,240
These contents do not match the problem

155
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,990
no

156
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,620
It is well written to write well

157
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,270
You think if you write

158
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,190
This missing father or a mother with cancer

159
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,150
Does it seem like that?

160
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,860
No one will care about this kind of thing

161
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,340
Xitian

162
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,080
Will this kind of east and west universities care about it?

163
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,470
Won't

164
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,050
Anyway, here is here,

165
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,420
Haoxiu you

166
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,190
Rewrite a copy of the next time

167
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,300
Now you know

168
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,270
sorry

169
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,310
children

170
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,620
Even if it's not your turn yet

171
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,750
But after all, it is improved to make time

172
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,790
Still should be participated, right?

173
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,580
There is also a book

174
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,500
Since I am here, I will talk to me

175
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,170
Some records of you in foreign countries need to be confirmed

176
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,240
sorry

177
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,830
If it is not very anxious, can you complete it later?

178
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,080
The next time it is my turn

179
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,810
Didn’t you already consult in order from the first place?

180
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,390
I thought I was ready today

181
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,630
Let Xizhen come first

182
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,690
Um, let's go

183
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,280
That's how you do

184
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,780
Vast

185
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,200
Talk to me

186
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,200
Wait a moment

187
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,840
What

188
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,390
If not, you will answer me directly

189
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,940
You only know in the school

190
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,150
I'm joining for the chef with the police

191
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,570
But how does the chef know and follow me

192
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,980
What's wrong with something?

193
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,240
Are you a chef?

194
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,580
What

195
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,880
What are you talking about?

196
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,500
Right

197
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,830
You can't be a chef

198
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,930
of course

199
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,760
That's good

200
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,770
If Haoxiu is not a chef, what do you do

201
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,980
If he is not a chef

202
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,650
Can you be responsible

203
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,190
I thought so

204
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,780
Why do Xu Haoxiu have to eat cookies by himself?

205
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,120
If there is a antidote

206
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,830
Auntie coming to eat should be the simplest

207
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,000
actually

208
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,380
Will there be no chef without a solution?

209
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,420
How can there be no antidote

210
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,010
That's not

211
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,390
Is it awakened?

212
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,890
If I said

213
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,920
Xu Haoxiu is a chef

214
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,430
Shut up

215
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,190
I will prove

216
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,300
Haoxiu is not a chef, chef, and other people

217
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,480
Min Ying

218
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,970
I can wake up

219
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,740
You can't be a chef

220
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,410
If you are a chef

221
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,320
It doesn’t mean there is no antidote

222
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,410
What are you talking about?

223
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,440
But in case

224
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,190
I want to confirm

225
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,590
This is a real cookie

226
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,090
Can you eat it?

227
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,040
If you really have eaten and woke up

228
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,020
Are you doubting me now?

229
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,730
I'm because of this

230
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,900
Want to believe you

231
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,650
The process of the score of the sub -examination of Zhenghan High School (Park Xizhen)
It's really strange

232
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,480
My state is also very good

233
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,530
The amount of learning is more than any time

234
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,790
But the results have been declining

235
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,410
Oh, yes

236
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,440
If you retreat now, you will fall out of class A

237
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,800
People who have been in Class A and B for more than two years

238
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,750
This time I will be promoted to class S

239
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,580
There must be any problems in it

240
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,750
Will you learn too integrity?

241
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,880
Do you mean that I don't know the learning method?

242
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,650
It's not me that consider more efficient ways

243
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,280
Please tell me

244
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,240
As long as the effect is guaranteed no matter how much money, I will give it no matter how much money

245
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,690
Wow

246
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,830
It's because of this business that is so good

247
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,620
That's why you bet on life

248
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,750
Really

249
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,120
Wait a mininute

250
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Xu Shidan

251
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,690
The detailed consultation seems to be postponed until the next time

252
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,600
What

253
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,480
Let's continue tomorrow morning

254
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,940
teacher

255
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,810
Wow, it's a great guy

256
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,100
How much should I want to live?

257
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,100
Neither of my own address and elementary school on my daughter are not enough

258
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,020
Even the parents' address is sold

259
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,640
Everything has reached the limit now

260
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,430
I will really die if I go on like this

261
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,010
I can't support it anymore

262
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,270
Don't cry

263
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,820
Why are you so weird

264
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,440
You fish out

265
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,450
It means that if I find the chef, I will save me a life

266
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,740
Is it right

267
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,120
as well

268
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,990
If you don't get something, you can even kill your family

269
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,330
I will be better than Jianyu's kid anyway

270
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,090
Find faster

271
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,290
even so

272
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,040
Don't underestimate us Jianyu

273
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:46,340
Have I said?

274
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,680
Jianyu was also locked in the oil barrel

275
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,880
Guy without parents and children

276
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,900
What if you want to come out?

277
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,580
Why do you suddenly doubt me

278
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,120
It's not that you can't do this

279
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,040
Do you know how much I want Min Ying to wake up

280
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,840
You know how much I like her

281
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,700
But suddenly said that I am a chef

282
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,510
I ask you again

283
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,040
How can the chef say that you want to give you an antidote?

284
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,890
No

285
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,850
I don't know what it will become

286
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,960
It's just simply doubt, isn't it?

287
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,980
If I die

288
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,150
Real

289
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,830
The chef will wake up

290
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,790
Because if he can't do it

291
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,580
I won't let him go

292
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,330
Don't even give it to me

293
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,290
I said no

294
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,930
I didn't want to give up

295
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,890
Even so

296
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,310
I also want to confirm that you are not

297
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,550
If I don't want to eat

298
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,900
Then let you eat it

299
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,950
you really

300
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,120
Real

301
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,630
If you are really a chef

302
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,950
It's best to kill me here

303
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,830
I will never give up

304
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,680
I definitely will

305
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,830
Tooth

306
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,680
Not only the alarm

307
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,560
I will also let you be sanctioned by law

308
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,270
I will go to the hospital where your mother lives

309
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,990
What do you just say

310
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,530
The hospital where your mother lives

311
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,490
I will find the past

312
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,870
Then go to kill her

313
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,870
Shut up

314
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,700
Before I killed you

315
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,040
how

316
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,750
Are you a real chef

317
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,490
This is what you are looking for

318
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,210
Good -looking

319
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,790
Why take my mother out and say something

320
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,250
That is true

321
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,410
Can't you rescue Min Ying?

322
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,760
Are you making a show?

323
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,770
No

324
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,270
you can not

325
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,110
True to me like this

326
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,230
So to us

327
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,280
I trust you how much

328
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,160
How depend on you

329
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,830
I have a boyfriend

330
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,660
You are also very kind

331
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,580
no

332
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,830
Haoxiu vomited

333
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,130
Sit it out, Xu Haoxiu can't work

334
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,380
I like Minying

335
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,050
Escape

336
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:54,630
There are a lot of friends when you were in school before, right?

337
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,890
Right

338
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,970
A bit unknown

339
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,920
Even if it is now denied now, right?

340
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,630
Say you are not

341
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,180
Say you are not a chef

342
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,240
Do you know why I do n’t hesitate to do everything

343
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,450
Do you bring you a school?

344
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,080
I give you a chance

345
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,580
I just want to save a poor person

346
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,840
Like that day

347
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,590
The formula saves me the same

348
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,140
Please go to the roof of the teaching building now

349
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,060
There is something to deal with

350
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,280
No need to solve it

351
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,260
Chef
