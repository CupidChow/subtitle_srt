The detective who was
in a traffic accident,

3
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,570
do you know he went to see your sister?

4
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,680
Oh my god.

5
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,820
It seems your sister didn't tell you.

6
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,970
She thought it was a trivial matter.

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,760
Is that really so?

8
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,199
Remember,

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,860
the chef knows everything.

10
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,150
Eat more,

11
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,950
this is for the teaching staff.

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Go ahead and eat.

13
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,710
Really,

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,120
if I were an ordinary student,
I would feel so wronged,

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
right?

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,840
Thanks to my grandfather.

17
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,110
Let's eat.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Have you finished the math papers?

19
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,350
They are difficult and troublesome.

20
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,190
You didn't write them, did you?

21
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,546
How about I write one for you too?

22
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,090
I've already asked Seo Ho-su to do it.

My sister is not answering her phone.

25
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,220
I want to ask if she has gone to work.

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
What?

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,170
Did she go out during work?

28
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,886
You've come at the right time.

29
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,400
I was just wanting to talk to you.

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,350
Classes are about to start.

31
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,060
I've already spoken to the math teacher.

32
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,850
Really,

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,750
what do you want to say?

34
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,439
Detective Kim Yoon-boem Fan
had a traffic accident yesterday.

35
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,730
Did you know?

36
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,110
Kim Yoon Boem?

37
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,170
The detective investigating the school?

38
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,110
Yes.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,600
What happened? Is he hurt?

40
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,350
How did you know about it, teacher?

41
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,190
Because I was at the scene at the time.

42
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,430
It's very fortunate that

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,600
you were at the scene of the accident

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,090
and even rescued him.

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,810
What a coincidence.

46
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,280
This is not a coincidence.

47
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,860
What is it then?

48
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,460
Is there a need for you two

49
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,460
to meet alone outside of school?

Where did this thing come from?

54
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,729
Many were dropped at the
entrance of my workplace,

55
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,060
so I took some. What's wrong?

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Where is that place?

57
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,590
Is it important?

58
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,240
Can I go see it?

59
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,040

No, you can't,

76
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,680
you can't eat them.

77
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Why?

78
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,730
They are very dangerous.

79
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,749
Don't eat them for now. Give them to me.

80
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,750
Give you.

For investigation?

88
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,880
Why tell me all this?

89
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,529
I don't understand.

90
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,950

isn’t something you can do alone.

93

Has someone been forcing

94
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,910
or threatening you to do this?

Min-young.

191
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,880
Shit.

192
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,860
OK.

193
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,640
Shit.

194
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,440
Min-young.

195
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,530
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,970
I hung up the phone just now

197
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,509
because I was waiting
for Min-young to come here.

198
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,549
I wanted to hear what she
had to say before reporting,

199
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,020
that's why I hung up.

200
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,950
This cookie,

201
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,040
do you know how much one is?

202
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,970
It's three million won Three million won.

203
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,080
With what money would she buy cookies?

204
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,039
More money than your salary.

205
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,480
How could one afford this?

206
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,620
Question.

207
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,729
The scholarship money she gave you,

208
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,220
where did it come from?

209
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,350
I received a scholarship.

210
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,930
Sister, you use it.

211
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,360
It's about five million won.

212
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
The correct answer

213
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,260
is money earned for our work.

214
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,330
Next question.

215
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,600
Why did Detective Kim
Yoon-boem end up like that?

216
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,660
The correct answer.

217
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,220
Because he was naughty like you.

218
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,090
I say. Call the police.

219
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,870
Really.

220
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,050
You won't call until the very end, right?

221
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,540
Even if it's life-threatening,

222
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,110
you still have to protect your sister.

223
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Eh...

224
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,320
I won't call the police.

225
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,510
I'll pretend I never saw anything,

226
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,800
that none of this ever happened.

227
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,850
Please let me go,

228
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,660
I'll keep my lips sealed
for life. Just let me go.

229
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,650
But.

230
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,310
Min-young.

231
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,820
Just let Min-young out of this matter.

232
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,410
You're still making
demands. Why should we agree?

233
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,760
She's so capable, and
she's done the work well.

234
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,839
Thanks to computerization,

235
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,470
meteorologists

236
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,839
have become youthful.

237
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,689
The form is the present perfect tense,

238
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,110
ongoing from the past until now,

239
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900
"the field weather forecasting."

240
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,550
in the field of weather forecasting.

241
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,420
They say if you eat this cookie,

242
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,680
you'll torture yourself every single day,

243
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,950
or the scars on your face will disappear.

244
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,690
That's right.

245
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,310
She must also hate poverty.

246
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,030
The hard-earned money from the factory,

247
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,549
even if you spend just a
little, every time you do,

248
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,820
it feels like a sin, suffocating.

249
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,380
Our Min-young,

250
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,260
Min-young

251
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,669
has overcome...

252
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,700
Overcome what?

253
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Really?

254
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,200
Wow, how funny.

255
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,990
Scars will remain.

256
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,070
They're not something you can overcome.

257
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,190
Who says?

258
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,210
Who?

259
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,770
It must be Min-young.

260
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,110
Min-young.

261
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Stop talking nonsense. Our
Min-young is not like that.

262
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,440
You seem a bit careless
with your words now,

263
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,670
aren't you?

264
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,100
I know your agony,

265
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,420
it's hard to accept, isn't it?

266
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,880
Shut up.

267
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,080
Open the door immediately.

268
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,460
If you don't open the door
right away, I will kill you.

269
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,920
Before I die, you will have
died at the hands of your sister.

270
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
The cookies,

271
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,750
they were given to you
by your boyfriend, right?

272
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Ho-su.

273
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,780
That was a gift from Ho-su when

274
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,700
he confessed to you, wasn't it?

275
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,430
I... I asked Ho-su.

276
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,230
And he also knows how to make cookies.

277
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,230
Just say it.

278
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,590
Say it!

279
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,100
Say you have nothing
to do with the cookies.

280
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,950
Alright.

281
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
There's no need to say it out loud.

282
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,720
I can see everything in your eyes.

283
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,160
You're not someone who
would do such a thing.

284
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Call the police.

285
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,810
I will call the police.

286
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,840
I am going to call them immediately.

287
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,950
No way.

288
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,040
Quickly say it's not true.

289
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,249
Say it's not. I'm telling
you to say it's not.

290
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,040
Say it right now.

291
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,560
Contact the head chef immediately.

292
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,300
Tell him I will take responsibility.

293
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Do you...

294
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
do you know you're really selfish?

295
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,500
Just because of that scar,

296
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,800
how long will you use that as an excuse?

297
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,380
You hurt just at that day.

298
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,030
But I'm not.

299
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,759
Since mom left home,

300
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,600
I've had to deal with
that person every day...

301
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,350
You don't know I have these scars, do you?

302
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,010
But that day you went crazy
saying you'd call the police.

303
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,340
When you were tearing open the kimchi...
Didn't I tell you not to tear it?

304
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,790
You said you would help me,

305
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,480
so the accident happened that day.

306
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,090
Before that day,

307
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,950
even for a moment,

308
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,590
even once,

309
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,470
have I ever blamed you?

310
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,030
No. Do you know why?

311
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,770
Because it wasn't your fault.

312
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,320
I knew this when I was eighteen.

313
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,120
But how many years have passed

314
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,990
and you still blame me...
- I know.

315
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,589
I also know it's not my sister's fault.

316
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,260
But. Damn it.

317
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,140
I tried so hard

318
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,710
to survive,

319
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,520
gave up everything, just
watching you live your life.

320
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,000
The school I couldn't attend,
the things I couldn't do,

321
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
is that it?

322
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,090
The excuse is just a scar?

323
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,750
Do you commute here every day?

324
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,230
Yes.

325
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,730
It's close to home, right?

326
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,459
The commute must be convenient.

327
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
Very nice.

328
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,130
Sister really has a lot of good things.

329
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,390
Of course.

330
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,099
I'm so lucky to have found a good job,

331
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,509
and the salary isn't bad either.

332
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,550
And everyone is very kind to me.

333
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
Wow.

334
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
What should we eat tonight?

335
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,030
You must be hungry.

336
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,040
Good news.

337
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,160
The head chef said he will spare sister.

338
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,550
As long as Choi Soo-young,

339
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,620
keeps all she knows
about the cookie a secret.

340
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Shh.

341
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,690
Is it really just by promising this,

342
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,160
my sister will be returned unharmed?

343
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,380
So,

344
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,280
Min-young continues to work here?

345
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,380
Is this how I'm sent back unharmed?

346
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,750
Sister, I'll handle it myself.

347
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,230
- So...
- No.

348
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,760
There's no need for that.

349
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,440
The head chef is

350
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,750
curious about sister's dream.

351
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,530
Take a bite.

352
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,740
Auntie.

353
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
What will happen to me

354
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,610
if I eat this?

355
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Sister,

356
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,330
you'll become addicted to cookies,
you won't be able to live without them.

357
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,250
If it's not done well,

358
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,680
you might eat two pieces of this cookie.

359
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,080
Then you won't be able
to keep your promise.

360
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,010
Is there a more concrete method than this?

361
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,610
No.

362
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,930
No.

363
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,940
Sister, absolutely no!

364
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,070
So I'll just take a look for making sure,

365
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,720
can I?

366
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,100
The admission test materials for
the consulting room are missing.

367
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,860
I've already told you,

368
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,456
if you don't have the consent
of the Minister of Security and Life,

369
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,890
you can't view it.

370
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,939
It's really frustrating. Really.

371
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,480
If it's an emergency,

372
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,130
you should still contact the minister.

373
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Okay, forget it.

374
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,510
I'll go confirm and then contact him.

375
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,299
(No entry for external personnel)

376
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Geon-woo,

377
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
is that you?

378
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,300
Wow,

379
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,999
I was startled just now.

380
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,340
I thought I saw wrong.

381
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,790
How long has it been since
we last saw each other?

382
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,080
I heard you're suspended now?

383
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
I am being investigated.

384
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,616
I received instructions from above,
keeping it secret from everyone.

385
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Entrance exam corruption?

386
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Or school violence?

387
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Aren't you from the drug
investigation department?

388
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,250
What about you, senior.

389
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,180
Did you switch departments?

390
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,380
Why become a school-affiliated
police officer?

391
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,836
Aren't you also from the
drug investigation department?

392
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,590
I'm also being investigated.

393
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,510
Entrance exam corruption,
school violence, and the like.

394
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
And you?

395
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,490
I just...

396
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,010
Let's talk about it next time.

397
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,670
I still have class now.

398
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Okay.

399
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,389
No, sister, you can't. No.

400
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,390
Hey.

401
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,110
The thing you've always sold well.

402
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,050
- Why act like it's inedible?
- Shut up.

403
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,289
Call the head chef immediately.

404
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,510
I will talk to him personally.

405
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,210
Can I

406
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
take Min-young's place?

407
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,310
What?

408
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,650
Including Min-young's share, I
can do three, four times more.

409
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,440
No, I can do ten times her work.

410
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,690
Just let her leave this place.

411
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,110
Then I'll eat it.

412
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,260
Are you crazy?

413
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
But,

414
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,940
you have to promise not to provide

415
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,700
Min-young with cookies anymore.

416
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,370
Once you withdraw from this matter,

417
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,780
drop out

418
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
or transfer immediately.

419
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,160
Grades, school entrance
exams, none of that matters.

420
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
You don't understand.

421
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Now is not the time to
talk about these conditions?

422
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,320
I'm not begging you.

423
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Head chef.

424
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,470
I'm proposing to him.

425
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,640
I... I was actually planning to die.

426
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,139
Earn as much money as possible,

427
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,740
leave it for my sister and then die.

428
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,710
That's the dream and goal
for the rest of my life.

429
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:40,970
More Dramas and Movies With
Multi-language Subs - ALL IN HiTV

430
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
I...

431
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,510
I'll eat it.

432
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,569
Something even a high
school student can do,

433
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,100
can't I do it?

434
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,890
- Hey.
- A piece of cake.

435
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,050
No.

436
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm ready to die.

437
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,789
I can do much better than her.

438
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,810
I have confidence.

439
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,600
Hey, Choi Soo-young.

440
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,650
So let Min-young withdraw from this.

441
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,510
Okay.

442
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,690
The head chef agreed.

443
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Thank you.

444
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,070
What do you believe in to eat it?
How can you trust the head chef's words?

445
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,770
Listen.

446
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,280
All this is my fault.

447
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,810
It"s not your fault.

448
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,150
It's mine.

449
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,060
So you should stop doing this.

450
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,710
No, you can't.
