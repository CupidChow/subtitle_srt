00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,160
Did you know about the detective who had an accident?

3
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,570
Was your sister looking for him?

4
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,680
Oh no!

5
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,820
Your sister didn't tell you?

6
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,970
She must have thought it wasn't important.

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,760
Really?

8
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,199
Remember.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,860
Shafa knows everything.

10
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,150
Eat.

11
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:39,950
This is the staff meal.

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Eat.

13
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,710
Anyway.

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,120
If I were an ordinary student, I would feel oppressed.

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Don't you think so?

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,840
It's all thanks to my grandfather.

17
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,110
Eat your food.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
Did you finish your math homework?

19
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,350
They were very difficult.

20
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,190
Didn't you write it? Really?

21
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,546
Do you want me to write it for you too?

22
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,090
I asked Soo Ho to write it for me.

23
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,660
(Do Min Young, do her homework too.)

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,970
My sister is not answering her phone.

25
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,220
I wanted to know if she made it to work safely or not.

26
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,660
What?

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,170
Did she leave in the middle of work?

28
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,886
It's good to see you.

29
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,400
I wanted to talk to you.

30
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,350
Class is starting.

31
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,060
I informed your math teacher.

32
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,850
Oh my God.

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,750
What did you guys talk about?

34
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,439
Detective Kim Yoon Bum had an accident yesterday.

35
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,730
Did you know?

36
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,110
Kim Yoon Bum?

37
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,170
The detective who was doing investigations at school?

38
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,110
Yes.

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,600
What happened? Is he badly hurt?

40
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,350
How did you find out?

41
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,190
Because I was there at the scene too.

42
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,430
Thank goodness.

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,600
You were there too,

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,090
And you saved him.

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,810
What a coincidence.

46
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,280
It wasn't a coincidence that I was there.

47
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,860
So what was it?

48
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,460
Why should both of you

49
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,460
See each other outside of school?

Why are you taking pictures anymore?

53
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,200
Where did you get this from?

54
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,729
I found a lot of them at my workplace.

55
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,060
I also took a few. How?

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
Where?

57
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,590
Does it matter?

58
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,240
Can I go see it?

59
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,040
I'll bring it for you.

60
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,020
Okay, let's go.

Here, here.

71
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,930
Here, here.

72
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,909
Where did these come from?

73
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,330
No, what is it at all?

74
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,909
Isn't it just an ordinary cookie?

75
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,240
No.

76
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,680
You shouldn't eat them.

77
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Why?

78
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,730
They are very dangerous.

79
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,749
Don't eat them...give them to me.

80
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,750
Come on.

81
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,280
It's very dark here, isn't it?

82
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,280
I'll turn on the lights and then we can talk.

83
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,240
Let's go.

84
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,420
Come on. It's still inside.

85
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,440
So you're not a counselor?

86
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,109
So are these all for disguise?

87
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,440
To conduct investigations?

88
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,880
Why are you telling me all this?

89
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,529
I don't understand.

90
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,950
Because I know everything.

91
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,019
I also know that this is not something that

92
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,660
You can handle alone.

93
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,259
Either someone forced you

94
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,910
Or you were threatened.

95
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,200
I don't understand what you're talking about.

96
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,930
I want to help you.

97
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,240
I can help you.

98
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,170
How do you want to help me?

99
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,749
Of course, if you assist me in my investigations.

100
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,070
If you help me.

101
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,196
I swear by your benefit and I'll do my best

To make things easier for you

104
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,199
...Do you think you can trick me into helping you?

105
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
No, no

106
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,706
That's why I'm showing you this

107
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,730
How should I say it?

108
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,770

110

Is it called another organization?

111
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,660
Can you pass my report to them?

112
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,860
But can you give me a chance?

113
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,820
I will definitely prove it to you.

114
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,060
What do you mean?

115
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,420
That in this world, there are honest and

116
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,170
There are also capable police officers.

117
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,970
Where do they make cookies?

118
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,770
I work here.

119
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,770
Come here.

120
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,309
It's true, these days cars are very efficient in their functions.

121
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,599
But the school is wealthy.

122
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,020
Why don't they hire someone?

123
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,509
Doing all this work alone

124
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,460
Will cause back pain after a while.

125
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,660
But there's no solution.

126
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,930
Because the salary is high.

127
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,220
Oh, I see.

132
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,170
And sometimes food.

133
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,510
Didn't you say there were more cookies?

134
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,950
Where are they?

135
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,600
Oh yeah, right.

136
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,640
I'm not sure where

137
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,820
Wait a moment.

138
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,150
I'm sure I put them somewhere.

139
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,970
Hold on a moment. Where are they?

140
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,620
Just wait.

141
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,640
Here? Here?

142
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,170
Here?

143
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,879
Where are they? Where did I put them?

144
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,180
(Comfortable masks)

145
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,930
Those belong to my colleague.

146
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,280
Didn't you say they were just yours?

147
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,510
I'm doing two things at once.

148
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,420
Here are the ones you were looking for.

149
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,280
Here they are.

150
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,570
What do you want to do now?

151
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,310
Do you want me to call the police?

152
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,260
Café Tria?

153
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,619
Is there any other place besides school?

154
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,660
Is it for making cookies?

155
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
That's right.

156
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,040
I was suspicious of Café Tria at first too.

157
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,450
Apparently, you didn't look carefully.

160
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,910
Yes, she is a member of my family.

161
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,730
Can I answer?

162
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Yes.

163
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,860
I think you should come here right now.

164
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Yes, Aunt.

165
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,530
Is there a problem?

166
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,599
Your sister has found this place.

167
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
What?

168
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,060
She wants to inform the police.

169
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,860
What do you mean?

170
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,330
Do you mean Min-young?

171
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,910
Come here right away.

173
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,260

Hello?

175
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:46,260
Please speak.

176
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,950
Hello?

177
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,950
Why did you hang up?

178
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,620
You have to report!

179
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
...Really?

180
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,190
(Comfortable masks)

181
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:02,400
Was it really Min-young?

182
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,040
Yes.

183
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,970
So you knew...

184
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,420
If you report, Min-young will also be arrested?

185
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,170
Yes.

186
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,440
...So Min-young...

187
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,330
Does she work here too?

188

Yes.

190
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,620
Min-young.

191
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,880
Sh*t.

192
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,860
Sorry.

193
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,640
Sh*t!

194
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,440
Min-young.

195
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:22,530
Don't talk nonsense.

196
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,970
I turned off my phone because I'm waiting

197
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,509
Until Min-young comes here.

198
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,549
I want to hear what she has to say before I report.

199
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,020
That's why I turned it off.

200
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,950
This cookie.

201
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,040
Do you know how much it costs?

202
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,970
It's three million. Three million.

203
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,080
Which currency did she use to buy that cookie?

204
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,039
It's much more than your salary.

205
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,480
How does she pay for it?

206
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,620
First question.

207
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,729
The scholarship money she gave you.

208
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,220
Where did it come from?

209
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,350
I got a scholarship.

210
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,930
She, you spend it.

211
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,360
It's about five million.

212
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Now, the answer.

213
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,260
We made that money from this job.

214
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,330
Next question.

215
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,600
Why did Detective Kim Yun Bum get into this trouble?

216
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,660
Now, the answer.

217
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,220
Because he was nosy like you.

218
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,090
Call the police.

219
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,870
Really?

220
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,050
You don't want to call until the end, right? Is that correct?

221
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,540
Because even if your own life is in danger,

222
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,110
You have to protect your sister.

223
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
...This.

224
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,320
I won't report it to the police.

225
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,510
I pretend that I didn't see anything.

226
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,800
And nothing happened.

227
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,850
Please let me go.

228
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,660
I won't say a word until the end. Just let me go.

229
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,650
Instead,

230
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,310
Min Young.

231
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,820
Please kick him out of this job.

232
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,410
You're still setting conditions. Why should we accept?

233
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,760
Do you know how good he is at his job?

234
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,839
Thanks to computers.

235
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,470
Meteorologists.

236
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,839
A newly discovered creature.

237
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,689
His form is present perfect.

238
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,110
It has been continuing from the past until now.

239
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900
"In the field of meteorology."

240
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,550
In the field of meteorology.

241
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,420
They say by eating this cookie,

242
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,680
Something that you suffer for,

243
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,950
Or the wound on your face disappears.

244
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,690
Oh, by the way,

245
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,310
He definitely hates poverty.

246
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,030
The money that is hard-earned from the factory.

247
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,549
Even if you spend just a tiny bit of it each time.

248
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,820
It's like a terrifying sin.

249
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,380
My dear Minyoung,

250
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,260
Min Young.

251
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,669
...has broken it.

252
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,700
What?

253
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Really?

254
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,200
That's very funny.

255
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,990
The wound remains.

256
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,070
It can't be broken.

257
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,190
Who said that?

258
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,210
Who do you want it to be?

259
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,770
Not Minyoung anymore?

260
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,110
Min Young.

261
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Don't talk nonsense. Min Young is not like that.

262
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,440
Are you kidding me?

263
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,670
Seriously?

264
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,100
I understand your pain.

265
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,420
You don't want to admit it, do you?

266
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,880
Shut up.

267
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,080
Open the door right now.

268
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,460
If you don't open it, I'll kill you.

269
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,920
Before that, you're supposed to die at the hands of your sister.

270
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
Those cookies

271
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,750
Your boyfriend gave them to you, right?

272
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,580
Maybe.

273
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,780
Maybe when he confessed to you.

274
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,700
He gave them to you, didn't he?

275
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,430
I asked... I asked him.

276
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,230
He even knew the recipe for the cookies.

277
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,230
Tell me.

278
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,590
Tell me!

279
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,100
Tell me that it has nothing to do with those cookies.

280
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,950
Fine.

281
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
You don't have to say it out loud.

282
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,720
I can read everything from your eyes.

283
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,160
You're not the kind of person who would do something like this.

284
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Let's call the police.

285
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,810
I'm calling.

286
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,840
I'm calling the police right now.

287
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,950
Say no.

288
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,040
Say no right now.

289
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,249
Say no. I said say no.

290
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,040
Say it.

291
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,560
Call Shaf right now.

292
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,300
Say I take responsibility for everything.

293
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
...You.

294
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,000
Do you know how selfish you are?

295
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,500
Just for the sake of a wound.

296
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,800
How long do you want to use that as an excuse?

297
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,380
You only got hurt that day.

298
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,030
But I didn't.

299
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,759
Ever since Mom left home.

300
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,600
...I used to hang out with that person every day.

301
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,350
Didn't you know I have these wounds?

302
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,010
But that day he hit you and you called the police.

303
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,340
When you were about to open the chemistry kit, didn't I tell you not to?

304
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,790
You said you would help me.

305
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,480
That's why it happened.

306
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,090
Since that day.

307
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,950
Even for a moment.

308
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,590
Even once.

309
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,470
Do you blame yourself?

310
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,030
No. Do you know why?

311
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,770
Because it's not your fault.

312
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,320
I knew this since I was eighteen.

313
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,120
But in all these years.

314
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,990
And you still blame me? - I know.

315
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,589
I know it's not your fault.

316
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,260
...So damn it.

317
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,140
You're lucky for surviving.

318
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:41,710
I suffered a lot.

319
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,520
I left everything behind and just watched you live.

320
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,000
The school I couldn't attend, the things I couldn't do. I left everything behind.

321
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Is that all?

322
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,090
Is your excuse just a wound?

323
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,750
Do you come and go from here every day?

324
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,230
Yes.

325
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,730
It's close to home, isn't it?

326
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,459
It's very convenient to commute.

327
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,460
It's great.

328
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,130
You have so many good things.

329
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,390
It's obvious.

330
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,099
I'm lucky to have found a job.

331
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,509
The salary is good too.

332
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,550
And everyone is good to me.

333
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,220
Wow.

334
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
What should we have for dinner?

335
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,030
You must be hungry.

336
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,040
Good news.

337
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,160
Shaf said he forgives your sister's life.

338
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,550
Of course, if Choe Soo-yeong.

339
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,620
If she keeps the secret about Cookie.

340
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Shush.

341
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,690
Really, just promise me this.

342
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,160
You don't care about her job?

343
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,380
So.

344
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,280
Is Min Young still working here?

345
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,380
Isn't it because of that you're leaving her?

346
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,750
That's right, I'm mindful of everything.

347
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,230
...So- No.

348
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,760
No need.

349
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,440
Shaf said he's curious to know.

350
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:32,750
What does your sister wish for?

351
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,530
Give him a gasp.

352
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,740
Auntie.

353
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
If I eat it.

354
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,610
What will happen to me?

355
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Her.

356
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,330
You'll become addicted to Cookie, you can't live without it.

357
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,250
If you make a mistake.

358
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,680
You'll lose two pieces of it.

359
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,080
Then you won't be able to keep your promise.

360
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,010
Is there a more certain way?

361
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,610
No.

362
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,930
No.

363
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,940
No, Yeong.

364
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,070
So, I'll take a look for reassurance.

365
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,720
Okay?

366
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,100
The acceptance test questions for the counseling room are missing.

367
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,860
I told you that.

368
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:25,456
If you don't have the consent of the security manager and life safety.

369
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,890
You can't see them.

370
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,939
It's really creepy.

371
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,480
If it's an emergency.

372
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,130
You can contact Mr. Director.

373
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,620
Fine. Forget it.

374
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,510
I'll make sure and then I'll contact them.

375
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:54,299
(Foreign personnel entry prohibited)

376
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Gun Woo.

377
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,420
Is that you?

378
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,300
Wow.

379
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,999
My mouth was wide open.

380
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,340
I thought I saw it wrong.

381
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,790
How long has it been since we last saw each other?

382
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,080
I heard you're suspended.

383
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
I'm doing some research.

384
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,616
The order came from above. No one knows.

385
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
For corruption in the entrance exam?

386
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Or violence at school?

387
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Aren't you from the drug department?

388
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,250
Graduate school, what about you?

389
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,180
Did you go to a different department?

390
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,380
Why did you become the school officer in charge?

391
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,836
Aren't you from the drug department too?

392
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,590
I'm also doing research.

393
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,510
Corruption in the entrance exam, violence at school, and such things.

394
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,860
What about you?

395
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,490
...Well, I...

396
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,010
Let's talk later.

397
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,670
I have class now.

398
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,840
Okay.

399
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,389
No. Yeong, no. You can't.

400
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,390
Hey.

401
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,110
Is this what you always used to sell?

402
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,050
Why are you behaving in a way that makes you seem inedible? - Shut up -

403
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,289
Call Shiwoo right now.

404
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,510
I'll talk to him myself.

405
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,210
I can do it.

406
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,200
Can I take Minyoung's place?

407
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,310
What?

408
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,650
I work three times... no, four times harder than Minyoung.

409
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,440
No, I work ten times harder than him.

410
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,690
So please let me take his place.

411
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,110
Then I will eat it.

412
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,260
Have you gone mad?

413
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,840
But...

414
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,940
You have to promise that you won't...

415
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,700
I won't give cookies to Minyoung.

416
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,370
Forget about this thing you brought up.

417
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,780
Or just drop out of school.

418
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Or take a transfer.

419
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,160
Grades and entrance exams are not even a little bit important.

420
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,980
You mean you don't know that...

421
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,120
Now is not the time to set conditions.

422
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,320
I'm not begging you.

423
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,020
Fine.

424
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,470
I'm asking you for that favor.

425
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,640
I... Honestly, I had plans to die.

426
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,139
I wanted to save money.

427
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,740
I wanted to give it to my sister and then die.

428
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,710
This wish and goal are for the rest of my life.

429
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
...Me.

430
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,510
I will eat it.

431
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,569
Even a student can eat it.

432
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,100
Why can't I?

433
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,890
Hey, it's like drinking water.

434
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,050
No.

435
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,880
I have always been ready to die.

436
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,789
I can do it much better than that.

437
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,810
I am confident in myself.

438
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,600
Hey, Choi Soo-young.

439
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,650
So please take Min Yoongi out of this matter.

440
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,510
Okay.

441
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,690
Shaf accepted.

442
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Thank you.

443
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,070
With what confidence do you want to eat it? How can you trust Shaf?

444
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,770
Listen.

445
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,280
It's all my fault.

446
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,810
It's not your fault.

447
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,150
It's my fault.

448
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,060
So stop it now.

449
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,710
No.
