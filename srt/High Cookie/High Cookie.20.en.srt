I went to the dormitory

182
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:15,101
I&#39;ll go

183
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,478
[Minyoung] So you run away

184
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:22,400
[Music that heightens the mood]

185
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:25,736
this

186
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,030
Earlier, Seo Ho-soo secretly left it in the hospital room.

187
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:29,198
Have you checked?

188
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:32,535
It&#39;s a recipe

189
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,662
Take this with you

190
00:09:34,745 --> 00:09:36,998
Even if I run away, I might be able to survive somehow.

191
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,924
Rather than get caught, I&#39;d rather become a chef.

192
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,303
Sorry

193
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,388
I&#39;m sorry, Minyoung.

194
00:09:58,686 --> 00:09:59,937
[deep sigh]

195
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:02,898
[Police 1] This way.

196
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:06,611
[Sound of door opening]

197
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:07,820
[Police 2] None?

198
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:09,780
[Police 1] Did you see it?

199
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:11,657
A student who just came out of the broadcast room

200
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:13,618
Over there

201
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,620
- [Police 1] Let&#39;s go - [Police 2] Follow.

[Suyoung] At least we know

204
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:27,840
[Crying] 319…

205
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:31,802
[Suyeong] A lot changes in just a few minutes

206
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:33,804
That you can change it

207

[Swimming sound of strength]

210
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,617
[Geonwoo] Shhh

211
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,744
[nervous music]

212
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,165
[Suyeong’s surprised sound]

213
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,464
[Geonwoo] When you say something nice, pass on the recipe.

214
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:10,800
If you want to live, this is your last chance

215
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:12,551
I&#39;ll give it to you

216

ask?

219
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,851
[Suyeong] Tie me up or do whatever you want

220
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:22,728
Don&#39;t let them escape

221
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:25,689
Please go up and make a broadcast.

222
00:11:25,773 --> 00:11:27,358
the students I&#39;m talking about

223
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:29,777
After checking that each room has

[snort]

225
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,617
[Geonwoo] Why should I listen to that request?

226
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:39,245
Isn&#39;t this your last chance?

227
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:41,455
[Suyeong] Recipe

228
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:43,040
Seo Ho-su hid it.

229
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:45,501
Only I know that place

230
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:48,170
- If you do me a favor - [Meaningful music]

231
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,756
I&#39;ll tell you where.

[Chairman] Without even telling me

234
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:06,522
What if it happens like this?

235
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:09,483

236
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,901

237
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:14,196
Isn’t this what we promised?

238
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:17,908
If it doesn&#39;t fit

239
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,243
What should I do?

[Heavy sound effect]

241
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,622
In times like this, shouldn&#39;t an apology come first?

242
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,169
[Chief of Grades] I’m sure I saw the CCTV.

243
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,629
It is true that Eunseo entered the dormitory.

244
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,381
Then inside the dormitory

245
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,133
Is there no CCTV data at all?

246
00:12:34,216 --> 00:12:36,760
[Grade Manager] Yes, because of student privacy protection.

247
00:12:36,844 --> 00:12:38,512
I didn&#39;t put it in the dormitory originally.

248
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:39,680
by the way

249
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,099
Those ridiculous cookies

- [Dark Music] - Even just 1%

If there&#39;s a chance it&#39;s true

Perhaps today, to student Eunseo Lee,

267
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:30,231
If there is a student who received cookies

268
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:32,858
You should never, ever eat it.

269
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:34,777
And the cookie

270
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,946
Please bring it to the supervisor’s office on the first floor immediately.

271

[Minyoung] Choi Geon-woo did this, right?

280
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,976
Why didn&#39;t you run away?

281
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,436
Are you going to get caught just doing what you do?

282
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,438
Hurry up and get out, Choi Geon-woo will come soon.

283
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:14,233
[Sooyoung] If you get involved, it gets complicated

284
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,195
The recipe I gave you to buy

285
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,822

[Minyoung’s determined breathing]

291
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,423
[Minyoung] When Choi Geon-woo comes here

292
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:40,175
I&#39;m going to ask you to load it over there.

293
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,385
Just get them out of school

294
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,095
I&#39;m going to pass on the recipe.

295

Go back quickly!

In the end, this is all because of me!

[Sobbing]

300
00:14:54,481 --> 00:14:56,275
Because that caused a problem

301
00:14:57,693 --> 00:15:00,696
My sister, who knew nothing, ended up like this.

302
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:05,534
[Minyoung] If my sister gets caught like this, what will I do…?

[Sobbing]

312
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:46,241
Maybe if you ate the cookies the lake gave you

313
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,202
So if you died

314
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:50,955
I probably won&#39;t be able to come to school now

315
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:57,127
But thanks to you for putting up with the cookies

316
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:02,549
So, thanks to you for answering my phone call

317
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:08,555
Even if my sister is like this right now

318
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,641

finally

326
00:16:31,787 --> 00:16:34,164
I could try anything

00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:37,960
[Teacher] Seungya

328
00:16:38,585 --> 00:16:40,170

Are you Lee Seung?

00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:45,426
Yes, what about it?

[breathing in relief]

333
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:49,513
yes…

00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:54,893
[Student] I don’t know anything

335
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:56,603
It was just something Eunseo Lee gave me.

336
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:57,771
uh…

337
00:17:01,025 --> 00:17:02,943
[Minyoung sobs]

338
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:05,863
So

339
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,240
[Sooyoung] You today

340
00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:11,452
Like 4 years ago

341
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,872
You saved me one more time

00:17:15,456 --> 00:17:17,666
[bursts into tears]

343
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,049

Minyoungah

345
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,178
[Sooyoung laughs slightly]

346
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:32,097
Do you think I really want to run away?

347
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,184
[light laughter]

348
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:39,313
When you still have the courage to surrender

349
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:41,273
let me turn myself in

350
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,402
[Sobbing]

351
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:51,158
Please

352
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:53,368

save my sister

[Crying]

356
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:09,426
give me the recipe

357
00:18:11,804 --> 00:18:13,055
now

358
00:18:14,431 --> 00:18:15,724
We all

359
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:18,852
It&#39;s over, let&#39;s finish it

360
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:26,693
[Crying]

[Minyoung sobs]

362
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,252
[Geonwoo] What do you mean?

363
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:45,129
Eunseo Lee, no.

364
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:47,089
Sooyoung Choi did embroidery?

365
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:49,716
[Detective] That’s a good thing.

366
