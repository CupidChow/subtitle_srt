00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,669
I'm sure there's chaos at school right now.

3
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,881
Because many people suddenly dropped dead.

4
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,800
Because of the cookies you sold.

5
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,636
Are you kidding?

6
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,263
Stop joking around.

7
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,223
You said you could handle the consequences.

8
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,059
You said you wanted to get better.

9
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,103
You should have taken it yourself.

10
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,938
Then those kids would have stayed alive.

11
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,608
... Don't tell me it was you.

12
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,651
Are you getting revenge?

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,654
So you should have taken revenge from me.

14
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,406
Why did you involve others in this mess?

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,699
Did I sell them?

16
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,659
You sold them.

17
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,079
Of course.

18
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,623
I also took revenge from you.

19
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,876
From Chloe Min Young too.

20
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,045
I gave her a cookie.

21
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,822
Are you going to school or the hospital?

22
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,865
Chloe Min Young, please.

23
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,992
Chloe Min Young, please pick up.

24
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,327
Go to school.

25
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,496
If you're lucky, you might be able to save a few people.

26
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,623
No.

27
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,084
Let them die. You go to the hospital.

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,920
Chloe Min Young must have died for sure.

29
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,256
But you can take the USB that's there.

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,384
It's up to you.

31
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,470
If you don't go after her right now.

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,222
I'll get rid of the USB.

33
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,308
That person.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,603
Min Young.

35
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,731
Min Young, Min Young.

36
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,733
Didn't you eat the cookie, really?

37
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,402
You shouldn't have eaten it.

38
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,612
If you eat it, you'll die.

39
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,908
Where are you?

40
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,118
I'm at school right now.

41
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,370
Really?

42
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,080
Are the kids dead?

43
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,585
Oh, what should we do?

44
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,795
This is happening.

45
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,381
It's not your concern, right?

46
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,091
The masked girl?

47
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,848
Don't come here.

48
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,693
Attention.

49
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,570
The cookies that were delivered today.

50
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,281
They cause death.

51
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,284
What's happening at school.

52
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,785
Everyone.

53
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,829
It's because of these cookies.

54
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,833
Anyone who has seen the message, reply immediately.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,719
I'll talk to the principal's office.

56
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,429
Students, all of you.

57
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,224
Go to your rooms right now.

58
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,059
If anyone stays in the yard.

59
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,644
It's punished.

60
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,563
So, it means Li On Soo.

61
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,522
No.

62
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,859
Did your sister Choi Soo Young come to school with a fake identity?

63
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,028
Should I go to the police?

64
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,448
Then say it.

65
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,409
What's happening at school?

66
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,787
Is it because of your sister that the kids' grades have gone up?

67
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:07,705
If I say it.

68
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,167
You won't go to the police anymore?

69
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,712
If you do something.

70
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,965
My grades go up too.

71
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,114
So that means I'm special?

72
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,702
Even without that, I'm ranked tenth.

73
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,707
I'll report to the police.

74
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,081
Hey, Li On Soo!

75
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,541
Hey, go to your room.

76
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,709
Haven't you heard the announcement?

77
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,836
If you don't go to the dormitory right now, you'll be punished.

78
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,171
Announcement?

79
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,757
Hurry. Hurry and go to the dormitory.

80
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,134
...Announcement.

81
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,138
Hey, Li On Soo, Li On Soo!

82
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,019
That person.

83
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,730
Min Young.

84
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,610
I told you not to come.

85
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,445
Min Young, you shouldn't be at school right now.

86
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,197
Park Hee Jin reported you to the police.

87
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,865
That you forged your identity.

88
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,992
And you were selling cookies.

89
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,786
Anyway... she told everything.

90
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,371
This incident that happened to the kids.

91
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,457
It's all because of the cookies I sold.

92
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,959
I wanted them to reply so I could collect them.

93
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,295
But I didn't get a single reply.

94
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,091
We'll talk later.

95
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,425
So, what now?

96
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,765
Do you want to make an announcement?

97
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,351
The police don't know the full extent of it.

98
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,270
They only know that you forged your identity.

99
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,898
And that you're selling some strange cookies.

100
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,445
Let's run away.

101
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,197
Even if we can't go abroad

102
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,532
...we can still go

103
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,617
To the outskirts of the city where no one is

104
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,661
Damn it

105
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,330
Why did you sell cookies?

106
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,793
Just tell me why

107
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,420
Why did I do this?

108
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,758
I thought I had a reason

109
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,719
But now that it's turned out like this

110
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,389
I see that it was all just an excuse

111
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,604
Don't do it

112
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,064
Hey, where are you going?

113
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,617
You should arrest Lee's accomplice right now

114
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,290
Well, I understand what you're saying

115
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,459
But now we have fewer forces

116
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,044
...let's fix this situation first and then

117
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,216
Students in the courtyard

118
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,094
Customers who haven't seen my message yet

119
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,389
...what is this anymore? This

120
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,100
The cookies I distributed today

121
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,186
If you eat them, you'll die

122
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,522
All of them because of

123
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,649
These cookies are deadly

124
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,984
It's all my fault

125
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,740
You sold them

126
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,991
Ship

127
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,371
Because of the cookies you sold

128
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:20,833
So please

129
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,669
So that no one else dies

130
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,046
...please

131
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,133
Please don't eat them

132
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,011
And reply to my message

133
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,444
Are you relieved?

134
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,030
Did you announce it? Are you relieved?

135
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,116
Right now

136
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,994
Four people messaged saying

137
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,204
They didn't eat the cookie

138
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,252
This means we can still change the situation

139
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,004
Those who are in the dormitory haven't heard the announcement

140
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,839
I have to go there and announce it as well

141
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,468
If the police come, tell them

142
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,178
I went to the dormitory

143
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,096
I'm going

144
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,473
Run away

145
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,731
Take this

146
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,025
He was standing in the hospital room, lost in thought

147
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,193
I looked at him

148
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,530
It's up to you

149
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,657
Take this with you

150
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,993
Even if I run away, it's uncertain if I can succeed or not

151
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,919
It's better for me to get arrested as a scapegoat

152
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,298
Excuse me

153
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,383
I'm sorry, Min Young

154
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,893
This way

155
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,815
Is anyone there?

156
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,775
The student who...

157
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,652
Haven't you seen the announcement?

158
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,613
He went the other way

159
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,615
Let's go- Come on-

160
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,082
...we both know well

161
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,835
319

162
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,797
Within a few minutes, what things can change?

163
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,799
And what things can be changed?

164
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,612
Shh

165
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,459
Speak nicely, give me the command

166
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,795
This is your last chance to stay alive

167
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,546
I give it to you

168
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,716
Instead

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,385
I have a request from you

170
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,011
Request?

171
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,846
Do whatever you want, tie my hands and feet if you want

172
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,723
Or do something so I can't escape

173
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,684
Just please go up and make an announcement

174
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,353
See the students I'm talking about

175
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,772
Are they in their room or not?

176
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,612
Why should I act upon your request?

177
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,240
Didn't you say this is the last chance?

178
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,450
Upside down

179
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,035
The command is standing

180
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,496
Only I know his whereabouts

181
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,165
If you do what I said

182
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,751
I'll tell you his whereabouts

183
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,098
How were you able to do this without

184
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,517
telling me? Do this job?

185
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,896
Deal

186
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,191
This wasn't our agreement

187
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,903
Well, it's okay then

188
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,238
For example, what do you want to do?

189
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,617
Shouldn't you apologize first?

190
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,164
According to the security cameras

191
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,624
Lee has entered the dormitory over there

192
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,376
So inside the dormitory

193
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,128
Isn't there a camera?

194
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,755
No, there isn't. Because of preserving the privacy of the students

195
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,507
I didn't install a camera in the dormitory

196
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,675
I mean

197
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,094
Seriously, the students

198
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,263
Because of that silly cookie

199
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,723
Really?

200
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,643
Whether it's true or not, we have to believe it

201
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,521
Even if our chances

202
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,939
are one percent

203
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,108
we must protect the students

204
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,068
Teacher Yoo Seong-pil

205
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,196
Can you make an announcement?

206
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,323
I'll visit the dormitory

207
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,657
Ah, okay

208
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,075
Can you help me?

209
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,535
Yes, definitely - from this side -

210
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,703
Let's go

211
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,305
My concern is with the students

212
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,349
If there is someone today

213
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,226
if someone has taken cookies from Lee's side

214
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,853
Please do not eat that cookie under any circumstances.

215
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,772
And that cookie

216
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,941
Bring it to the officer on the first floor and deliver it.

217
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,400
Right now

218
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,528
Bring it and deliver it to the officer on the first floor.

219
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,874
Min Young

220
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,010
Who did this work?

221
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,971
Why didn't you run away?

222
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,431
Do you want to get arrested?

223
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,433
Hurry up and leave. Because Gun Woo is coming now.

224
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,228
If you also get caught, everything will be messed up.

225
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,190
The instruction I gave you

226
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,817
Do you want to use it like this?

227
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,490
Min Young

228
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,617
Min Young, Min Young, don't do it, okay?

229
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,418
When Choi Gun Woo comes

230
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,170
I'm trying to trick him.

231
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:41,380
I mean if he wants the instruction

232
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,090
He has to take me out of school

233
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,759
Don't just confuse yourself for no reason

234
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,177
Hurry up and go!

235
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,471
All of this started because of me!

236
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,225
Because I sold cookies

237
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,270
That's how things got complicated

238
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,691
And you, who were clueless about everything, got involved in this mess

239
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,529
What should I do if you get caught?

240
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,743
No.

241
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,757
Min Young

242
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,180
Thank you

243
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,308
Thanks to you

244
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,810
Min Young, thanks to you

245
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,898
I was able to save the kids

246
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,236
If you had eaten the cookie that tempted you

247
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,197
And a disaster was coming your way

248
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,950
I couldn't have come to school now

249
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,122
Thanks to you for resisting the temptation of eating the cookie

250
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,544
Thanks to you for answering your phone.

251
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,550
I had the opportunity to come

252
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,636
...and save the kids

253
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,186
I really got lucky

254
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,856
The kids would have died because of me

255
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,317
But thanks to you

256
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,946
One more time

257
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,406
I was able to

258
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,159
Let me do something

259
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,955
Song-ya?

260
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,165
Song-ya, internal?

261
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,458
Who is it?

262
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,377
Is it student Lee Song-ya?

263
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,421
Yes, please come in

264
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,508
Here is one of these

265
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,888
I don't know anything

266
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,598
Lee gave me this

267
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,766
...Ah

268
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,858
So

269
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,235
You saved me again today

270
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,447
One more time

271
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,867
Exactly like four years ago

272
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,628
Min Young

273
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,092
Do you think I want to escape?

274
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,308
As long as there's a chance

275
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,268
Let me handle it myself

276
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,153
Please

277
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,363
Please

278
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,243
One more time

279
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,121
Save me

280
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,421
Give the order

281
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,050
Come on now

282
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,719
Everything

283
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,847
Let's finish it

284
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,247
What do you mean?

285
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,124
Li on so... no

286
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,084
Did Choi Soo Young surrender himself?

287
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,711
Thank God everything

288
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,130
It's all settled

289
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:55,425
So where are we going now?

290
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,886
They said in the dorm

291
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,721
Isn't there a camera, right?

292
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,890
Detective Choi Gun Woo?

293
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,978
Catch him!

294
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,152
Now that the case is solved

295
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,404
Come without any trouble

296
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,697
Who are you?

297
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,620
This request

298
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,497
Boss

299
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,307
Hey, you trash

300
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,517
Damn you

301
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,872
We have arrived.

302
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,717
Just a moment. Please wait.

303
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,803
What are you doing?

304
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,784
We saw him/her again.

305
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,090
Shouldn't you apologize now?

306
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,179
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

307
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,097
Somehow, gather it together.

308
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,099
By the way,

309
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,061
There is another thing for which I should apologize.

310
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,063
Give the order.

311
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,440
I gave it to

312
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,567
Another one

313
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,703
Should I tell whom?

314
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,112
Give the order.

315
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,114
I'll give it to you.

316
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,701
I can't handle it anymore.

317
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,128
Hello

318
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,723
Hello

319
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,226
Oh, I don't know what to say anymore.

320
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,644
Please don't buy anything else.

321
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,522
Look, no one is eating it, it's stored in the warehouse.

322
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,109
Please let me know if you hear anything about my sister.

323
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,569
I'll come back again.

324
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,364
Hello

325
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,284
Hello

326
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,580
Won't you get tired?

327
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,873
It's been here every day for a year.

328
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,793
Hey, I told you not to eat it.

329
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:10,425
If I remember correctly, last week.

330
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,011
Didn't you ask us anything?

331
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,056
We believe it when we ask whether you're still in the world.

332
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,017
Are there honest people and capable policemen?

333
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,497
Tell my sister that I miss her.

334
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,626
Hey, how are you doing?

335
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,088
I'm fine.

336
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,214
I'm sorry.

337
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,716
Yes? I want to place an order.

338
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,260
Just as I promised.

339
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,512
I live with honor.

340
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,933
But I guess you won't miss me in your heart.

341
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,270
If only...

342
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,272
At least you would have called me once.

343
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,941
Or at least

344
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,902
You would have come to see me once.

345
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,697
Come sooner

346
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,533
I'll be waiting for you

347
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,537
I'm sure that

348
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,456
Eventually you'll come back

349
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,133
We have a lot of challenges ahead of us

350
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,260
My hospital expenses, tuition fees

351
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,804
Food money

352
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,556
Cost of living

353
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,727
I don't want to spend the money you earned by selling cookies.

354
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:50,692
Dad's letters are supposed to always come to us.

355
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,695
Unless we win the lottery and go somewhere else.

356
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,208
Whatever happens

357
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,919
Never again

358
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,212
I won't be shaken

359
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,466
Proudly

360
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,177
I live my life

361
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,681
So don't worry about me and take care of yourself.

362
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,641
Don't forget.

363
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,241
I will send you a letter.

364
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,206
Thank you - You're welcome -

365
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,679
Where is the bathroom?

366
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,849
On the right side.

367
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,649
Wait a bit. It will be finished soon.

368
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,914
Hey, what's up?

369
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,000
What's wrong?

370
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,668
A scream came from the bathroom.

371
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,099
Postscript

372
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,436
Please, make sure to stay alive.

373
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,023
Because I...

374
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,526
I'll find you no matter what.
