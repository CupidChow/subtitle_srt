I&#39;ll come tomorrow

6
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,334
[Suyeong] Rest well

7
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:21,336
sleep well

8
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,004
okay

9
00:01:23,797 --> 00:01:26,299
Instead of sleeping in the living room, sleep in my room.

10
00:01:26,382 --> 00:01:27,592
in bed

11
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,052
[Sooyoung] Yes

12
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,391
[Minyoung] Sister

13
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:40,480
[Sooyoung] Uh

14
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:43,566
I&#39;ll try hard

15
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,819
[Minyoung] Even if I go to college

16
00:01:45,902 --> 00:01:48,113
Even when you are old enough to live on your own

17
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:50,782
So this year goes by

18
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,117
Even next year

19
00:01:54,327 --> 00:01:56,246

[Calm music]

21

Even if there is no

23
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:06,923
Go quickly and get some rest

24
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:08,800
I&#39;ll see you tomorrow

25

30
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:38,997
[Sooyoung] Now

- [Door lock operating sound] - Because everything is over

32
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,337
[Door lock operating sound]

33
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,047
All I have to do is go back

34
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,465

[Increasing rustling]

46
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:57,051
[Sooyoung’s surprised gasp] Really

47

Really for the last time

48
00:04:59,929 --> 00:05:02,265
Just eat one more

[Jinwoo sighs]

55
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,131
[Jinwoo] You and Seo Hosoo are absent without saying a word.

56
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:36,549
Seongpil Yoo is a punk in every class.

57
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:38,217
School was crazy all day

58
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,598
anyway

59
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:46,601
Seo Ho-su was captured and Yoo Seong-pil

60
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,687
Are you saying he&#39;s dead?

61
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,071
What are you going to do now?

62
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,490
I&#39;m going to quit school too

63
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:03,284
[Sooyoung] But what came out today

64
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:05,495
in one day

65
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:08,623
Because it’s strange when three people disappear from school.

66
00:06:08,706 --> 00:06:11,751
I came out because I didn’t want to get in trouble.

67
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:15,713
Eunseo Lee

68
00:06:15,797 --> 00:06:17,548
Please let me go back to America.

69
00:06:17,632 --> 00:06:18,966
ASAP

70
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:20,593
I&#39;m serious?

71
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:24,597
I&#39;m serious

72
00:06:27,225 --> 00:06:28,226
[light sigh]

73
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,270
It takes a while to process the documents

74
00:06:31,354 --> 00:06:34,023
[Jinwoo] At least a week, at most two weeks

75
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:36,067
Up to a month

76
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,612
If you waste time for no reason, you&#39;ll end up in big trouble.

77
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:41,781
[Sooyoung] The test is coming soon.

78
00:06:42,698 --> 00:06:44,784
[Meaningful sound effects]

79
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:50,206
[Interesting and suspenseful music]

80
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:00,716
without a chef

81
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:07,348

82
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:22,155
[Music that heightens the mood]

83
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,699
[Student 1] Sister, why aren’t you answering my calls?

84
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:26,576
You thought I was really crazy!

85
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,870
[Student 2] Are we taking orders starting today?

86
00:07:29,745 --> 00:07:30,997
I&#39;m all out

87
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,957
[Student 1] I really have to study, okay?

88
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,417
Send it to me today

89
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,043
- [Sound of water falling] - [Sound of door opening]

90
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:43,759
[Heejin] What are they saying?

91
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:45,636
What is your order?

92
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,056
What on earth are you asking me to send you?

93
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,308
[Music stops]

94
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,435

[Music that heightens the mood]

100
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,983
[Suyeong] I’ll stop by the hospital room in the evening.

101
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,902
I have some business to run during the day.

102
00:08:43,569 --> 00:08:46,030
[Minyoung] Okay, see you later.

103
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,533
[Sound of putting it down]

104
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:08,761
[Minyoung’s moans]

105
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:10,304
[People sound surprised]

106
00:09:10,388 --> 00:09:13,975
[Doctor] Don’t overdo it and get good rehabilitation treatment.

107
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,393
You know, right?

108

[Sound of door opening and closing]

109

Did you listen to what the doctor said?

110
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,153
[Therapist] Don’t overdo it for the time being.

111
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:28,239
I took a wrong step

112
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:31,242
[Therapist] I understand your desire to recover quickly.

113
00:09:31,325 --> 00:09:32,952
I need time

114
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:35,955
I&#39;m overdoing it with my will

115
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:38,124
Because it doesn’t just get better like this

116
00:09:38,207 --> 00:09:39,166
[A rustling sound rings out]

117
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,376

[groans with difficulty]

121
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:48,134
As I said before, what&#39;s wrong with it?

Seongpil Yoo isn’t coming today either?
