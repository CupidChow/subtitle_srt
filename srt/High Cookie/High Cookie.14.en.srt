[Sooyoung’s sigh]

4
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,572
[Sooyoung] First of all, Yoo Seong-pil

5
00:00:50,655 --> 00:00:54,617
Because I was a consultant who only cared for a very small number of students.

6
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:56,077
There isn&#39;t enough data

7
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:59,080
Documents submitted to school

8
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:02,959
No matter how hard you search, it&#39;s hard to find out anything on our line.

9
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,460
[Hosu] The same goes for Choi Geon-woo.

10
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,254
In the beginning, it was just a few documents.

11
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:08,423
From what I thought I could recognize...

12
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:10,008
[Mobile phone operation sound]

13
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:13,928
Aren&#39;t you being too eager?

14
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:18,600
It’s natural for Minyoung to be passionate about her work.

15
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:22,145
What if it&#39;s already ruined?

16
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,899
Don&#39;t say anything that will drain your energy

17
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:33,865
[growling sound]

18
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:36,159
[Sooyoung’s sigh]

19
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:37,619
Would you like something to eat?

20
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:38,995
Should I order room service?

21
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,541
What am I going to do

22
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,210
[Lake] It’s true that you’re hungry

23
00:01:46,794 --> 00:01:49,756
What if you’re worried about your chemistry performance evaluation due tomorrow?

24
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:53,885
I don&#39;t want to fail

25
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,262
I don&#39;t even want to die

26
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,765
I just want to live

27
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:01,976
That&#39;s enough

28
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:04,062
I&#39;ll order food

29
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:07,398
[dark music]

30
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:08,900
Still haven&#39;t found it?

31
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:10,276
That&#39;s strange

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,195
Sooyoung Choi did that before, right?

33
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:13,947
[Chief Heo] I found out who the chef was.

34
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,241
[Geonwoo] I thought that was the case too, but it wasn’t so.

35
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:19,327
[Chief Heo] Hey, the chairman asked a question again today, huh?

36
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,080
When can I get the recipe back?

37
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,958
I brought fertilizer to appease the Chairman today...

38
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:26,042
Are you listening?

39
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,585
[Geonwoo] Yes, I’ll hurry up and see.

40
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:28,628
[Chief Heo] What?

41
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:31,422

Is that all it is?

43
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,676
If that old man&#39;s eyes roll over

44
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,428
You and I are both going to die, you bastard!

45
00:02:38,012 --> 00:02:38,972
[sigh]

46
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:40,682
I&#39;ll get back to you

47
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:42,642
[Call end sound]

[Doorbell sounds]

50
00:02:52,443 --> 00:02:53,903
[Suyeong] I think room service is here?

51
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,321
[Lake] I’ll go out

52
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:56,864
[Meaningful music]

53
00:02:56,948 --> 00:02:57,782
yes

00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:18,011
Shall we talk?

59
00:03:18,094 --> 00:03:19,137
How did you get here?

60
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,972
I took a picture of the navigation system.

00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:45,121
Is it okay for the police to do this?

- [Sigh] - [Dark Music]

70
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,586
I&#39;m just saying that because I&#39;m a little confused right now.

71
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,630
Why is Sooyoung protecting the chef?

72
00:03:56,174 --> 00:03:58,176
Is it because of what you said?

73
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,761
The chef can wake Minyoung up?

74
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:04,682
Hey, it&#39;s a lake.

75
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,352
[Geonwoo] Didn’t you tell your sister?

76
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:09,896
That recipe isn&#39;t yours

77
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:11,606

[Meaningful sound effects]

You don&#39;t have the ability to make something like an antidote in the first place.

80
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:19,530
uh?

81
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,159
What does that mean?

83
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,875
I&#39;ll take you to the lake

Entrance Exam Consultant Seongpil Yoo

88
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:45,264
I&#39;ll report you missing first.

89
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:48,643
[Sooyoung] Then you must be asking who is Yoo Seong-pil at school?

90
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:50,478
At least it was something the police told me to do.

91
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:53,106
There is a hole to escape through, like a trap operation or something.

92
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,858
No, that&#39;s not it.

93
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:01,114
The moment you get caught

94
00:05:01,989 --> 00:05:04,409
Doing something reckless that ends your life

95
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:08,496

97

102
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:23,636
[Geonwoo] Are you calling that a threat?

103
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:27,932
Isn’t Sooyoung also living in a status where she shouldn’t be caught?

104
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:29,600
I&#39;m different

105
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:32,437
[Sooyoung] You want to live there somehow.

106
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:34,605
I&#39;m not

[Geonwoo] Okay, were you prepared to die?

111
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,498
Okay, what do you want?

112
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:54,083
[Sooyoung] Let me ask you one question first.

113
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,502
Seo Ho-soo is a chef

114
00:05:56,586 --> 00:05:58,212
No one knows, right?

115
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,216
Yes, thanks to Sooyoung’s interruption.

116
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:05,803
What about the people who came to the front of the house?

117
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:07,305
You&#39;ll think it was caught.

118
00:06:07,388 --> 00:06:10,725
Because I put away all the experiment tools and materials in the house.

119
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:13,227
Right

120
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:16,022
Negotiations should start now.

121
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,941
[Sooyoung] The identity of the chef was discovered with difficulty.

122
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,277
There&#39;s no way I&#39;ll just let it go

123
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,653
[Music stops]

124
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:23,905

125
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:26,407
go back to school

126
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,742

Well, there are ingredients that go into cookies, right?

130
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:43,049
Please make it for me by Monday

131
00:06:43,132 --> 00:06:44,926
- [Dark music] - [Geonwoo] But I still want to be a chef

132
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,595
I have to show that I have secured it.

133
00:06:47,678 --> 00:06:49,347
Wouldn’t that make negotiations easier?

134
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,268

[laughter]

146
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:49,532
I didn&#39;t know

147
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:56,455
that&#39;s right

148
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,626
I actually stole it, the recipe.

149
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,046
To be exact, I picked it up

150
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,300
The money my dad stole from me to buy drugs

151
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:08,467

153
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:12,763
And the antidote...

154
00:08:12,847 --> 00:08:14,140
To those bastards

155
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:17,059
Isn&#39;t there a recipe?

156
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:20,354
[Sooyoung] That’s why I’m looking for you to the death.

157
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,026
Now you know better

158
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,946
Effects, side effects, everything like that.

00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:32,950
- [Calm music] - [Sigh]

160
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,580
How to wake up Minyoung

161
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:39,206
figure it out somehow

162
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,625
Find it

163
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:41,792
Try it and tell me

164
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:44,378
Don&#39;t say you can&#39;t do it already

165
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,173
Don&#39;t even make that face

166
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:49,342
Don&#39;t look weak

167
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,178
I&#39;d rather cheat

168
00:08:56,682 --> 00:08:58,934
I can never give up on Minyoung

[Exhale deeply]

170
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:06,150

00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:03,958
[Hosu] So, does Choi Minyoung appear in your dreams too?

176
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:08,337
what?

177
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:10,047
[Lake] No, how desperate you are

178
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,258
I wonder if I can do this much

179
00:10:16,011 --> 00:10:17,179
It&#39;s family

180
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:22,685
Not all family is like that

181
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:27,606
Choi Min-young also said something like that once before.

182
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:33,070
What did you say?

183
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,699
At first the scars disappeared

184
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,035
Then they say dad disappears

185
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:44,790
[laughter]

186
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,293
What next?

187
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:48,753
They say your sister disappeared?

188
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:51,046
no

189
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:53,382
They say it gets worse

190
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:58,471
A selfish sister who only thinks about herself

191
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:01,515
They say it comes in my dreams

192
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:04,185
[Dreamy music]

193
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:07,229
[Lake] He said that was his dream

00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:08,439
[ECG meter beeping sound]

195
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:10,149
Choi Soo-young is a bad person

196
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:18,115
[Minyoung] Oh, why are you wearing my shoes? They’re new too!

197
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,329
<i>아, 몰랐지!</i> <b>Oh, I didn&#39;t know!</b> <i>난 내 거인 줄 알았지</i> <b>I thought it was mine</b>

198

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

199
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,666
You stole my clothes!

200
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,710
<i>[수영] 뭐?</i> <b>[Suyeong] What?</b> <i>니?</i> <b>you?</b>

201
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,462
Did you say that now?

202
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:33,339
[Minyoung] Oh, you said that, why?

203
00:11:33,422 --> 00:11:36,175
<i>[수영] 어?</i> <b>[Suyeong] Huh?</b> <i>이게 까분다, 진짜?</i> <b>This is harsh, really?</b>

204
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,259
[Minyoung] You

205
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,345
You&#39;re ugly and your personality is trash, Mr.

206
00:11:39,428 --> 00:11:41,138
<i>[수영] 어?</i> <b>[Suyeong] Huh?</b> <i>야, 최민영</i> <b>Hey, Minyoung Choi</b>

207
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,765
What does that mean to you sister?

208
00:11:42,848 --> 00:11:43,891
Aren&#39;t you coming here?

209
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,726
Are you talking to your sister?

[Lake] But

212
00:11:52,816 --> 00:11:55,486
When I wake up from my dream, the first thing that comes back to me is

213
00:11:57,905 --> 00:11:59,281
are you okay?

214
00:12:00,574 --> 00:12:02,409
- [Emphasized sound effect] - [Lake] Sister

215
00:12:02,493 --> 00:12:03,953

[Minyoung] Fuck!

226
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,498
Fuck you, be quiet!

227
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:52,251
[Minyoung sobs]

228
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:57,715
Minyoung, are you okay?

229
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:59,800
[Rough breathing]

230
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:01,135
shut up

231
00:13:01,218 --> 00:13:03,262
This is not my sister!

232
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,473
Minyoung, are you okay?

233
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:11,103
[Sobbing] No, I don&#39;t want to wake up!

234
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:13,355
[Loud rattling sound]

235
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:16,317
[Minyoung’s painful scream]

[Sooyoung] Min Young-ah

237

[Music stops]

244
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,951
Did you get some rest?

245
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,787
Why did you ask me to come alone?

246
00:14:54,498 --> 00:14:55,874
I have a favor to ask you.

247
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,586
Actually, this school

248
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,131
Security is pretty good

249
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,758
Well, so is CCTV.

250
00:15:06,093 --> 00:15:08,345
There are a lot of guards and a lot of eyes.

251
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:10,723
But?

252
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:16,979
That&#39;s why things got bigger at the hotel that day.

253
00:15:17,062 --> 00:15:18,856
Well, I sent it to you first.

254
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:22,568
[Geonwoo] I think I need to hand over the chef role now.

255
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:24,737
[heavy music]

256
00:15:26,321 --> 00:15:28,115
Sooyoung, please help me.

257
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:30,117
[snort]

258
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:33,328
Why me?

259
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:35,789
[laughter]

260
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,043
[Geonwoo clears his cough]

261
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:43,047
You said it was my weakness before and it didn&#39;t work out that way.

262
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,007
You pushed me in

263
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:50,637
I think I&#39;ve found the right weakness.

264
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:56,602
Oh, no way…

265
00:15:57,811 --> 00:15:59,897
I&#39;m taking Minyoung with me.

266
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,316
[uneasy music]

267
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,777
[ECG meter beeping sound]

268
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:08,947
[Emphasized sound effect]

269
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:11,784
[shaking breathing]

270
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:16,622
This is how you catch the weakness.

271
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:19,792
Uh, where are you?

272
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:24,463
[In a trembling voice] Where did they take our Minyoung?

273
00:16:25,464 --> 00:16:28,092
I plan to return it to the hospital room.

274
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:30,886
If only Sooyoung listens to me carefully,

275
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:34,014
[shaking breathing]

276
00:16:35,808 --> 00:16:37,226
[Geonwoo] This is what I am too

277
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,436
I wasn&#39;t planning on doing it like this, was I?

278
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,688
If only Seo Ho-soo&#39;s mother was stolen,

279
00:16:41,772 --> 00:16:43,899
I thought it would end easily

280
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:48,946
When I got there, the chef had already done the work.

281
00:16:50,572 --> 00:16:52,074
It&#39;s empty, the hospital room

282
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,701
No, I mean...

283
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:56,995
What would you do?

284
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,206
At least Minyoung was caught.

285
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,584
So?

286
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,670
West Lake

287
00:17:04,753 --> 00:17:05,963
As soon as you hand it over

288
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:10,217
Minyoung will return to her hospital room safely.

289
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:14,346
[Geonwoo] Let’s be gentle, let’s do it

290
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,349
I&#39;m giving Minyoung a chance to get it back.

291
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,784
[Hosu] Did you deliver it?

292
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:36,702
uh

293
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:42,082
[Hosu] You said you were recording.

294
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,001
Can you let me hear it?

295
00:17:44,835 --> 00:17:46,753
He checked his cell phone first.

296
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:48,463
I couldn&#39;t do it for fear of getting caught.

297
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:49,590
ah…

298
00:17:50,465 --> 00:17:52,217
Well, there was nothing else to talk about, right?

299
00:17:54,803 --> 00:17:58,348
[Dahyun] Guys, do you want to go to the snack bar after we finish eating?

300
00:17:58,432 --> 00:18:00,893
- I developed a new frappe menu - [Nervous music]

301
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,354
In the past, it used to be frappe with whipped cream, mango, and strawberry.

302
00:18:04,438 --> 00:18:07,191
You were adding syrup and chocolate chips, right?

303
00:18:07,274 --> 00:18:10,235
But milkshake, chocolate chips, cookies, strawberries...

304
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,362
- [Geonwoo] I promise you one more thing - [Dark music]

305
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:17,284
We have outstanding professional manpower and guaranteed research funds.

306
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:20,245
Once you have the recipe

307
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:23,999
We will also be able to prepare measures to deal with the side effects that Minyoung experiences.

308
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:27,085
[Dahyun] I got 100 points at karaoke three times in a row?

309
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,295
oh my god?

310
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:29,796
I guess I should be a singer

311
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,425
Yeah, I guess singer would be the fastest since I can&#39;t even study.

312
00:18:34,885 --> 00:18:36,303
[Geonwoo] This is the evidence I told you about.

313
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:38,597
- [Elegant music plays] - Made by the chef himself.

314
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:43,185
[Chairman] Can someone please check?

315
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,855
By the way, where is Director Heo now?

316
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:49,233
[Attendant] I’m having a meeting with a client in the office.

317
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:51,526
Uh, yeah

318
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,989
Now I have to keep my promise, right?

319
00:18:57,908 --> 00:18:59,076
Thank you, Chairman.

320
00:19:01,203 --> 00:19:02,704
[Chairman] If you take care of it

321
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:05,832
The chef passes it on right away, right?

322
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,292
of course

00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:10,128

[Chief Heo] If you sign the contract then, it will be late.

00:19:18,595 --> 00:19:20,639
[Business partner president] Oh my, the manager too.

327
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:22,599
Have I been fooled like this once or twice?

328
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:23,892
You know?

329
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:26,770
[Chief Heo] I will repay you for being deceived.

330
00:19:27,354 --> 00:19:28,939
These days, my old man’s family

331
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:32,025
Is it because I&#39;m a bit sensitive to performance?

332
00:19:33,026 --> 00:19:34,903
Yes, you do.

333
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:38,949

uh?

344
00:20:05,225 --> 00:20:08,437
[교사] 'It is a principle
in many legal systems'

345
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:11,481
The most appropriate thing is to find the flow.

What happens?

00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,119
What happens, you know?

00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:26,580
Are you dying?

352
00:20:27,164 --> 00:20:29,583
It will be put to good use first.

353

00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:40,260
Is that possible?

358
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:43,180
I made my brother like that

359
00:20:44,806 --> 00:20:47,225
He&#39;s a bastard who killed several people.

360
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:48,685
Is that possible?

361
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:51,313
Well thought out

362
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:53,982
But

363
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,318
[Suyeong] I’m a little worried.

364
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:57,527
If it&#39;s a place like that

365
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,321
Teacher, no

366
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:03,658
Detective, you can be like that too.

367
00:21:06,286 --> 00:21:09,164
I don&#39;t mind as long as I get Minyoung back.

368
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,876
Detective, do you mind if I hand over the chef to you?

369
00:21:13,543 --> 00:21:14,586
[Geonwoo] Yes

370
00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:16,838
are you okay

371
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,009
And with such shallow water, West Lake can’t be saved.

372
00:21:27,933 --> 00:21:29,184
[Lake] Dowon resolution?

373
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:35,148
[Dahyun] I guess I left my wallet at the cafe

374
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:36,525
I&#39;ll be back soon

375
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,068
[Lake] Oh, I went and came back.

376
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:45,909
[The lake takes a deep breath]

377
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,662
The event you had over the weekend

378
00:21:49,454 --> 00:21:51,415
Almost all compensation was paid

379
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:53,792
Thanks to making it over the weekend

380
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:55,961
Good job

381
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,629
One way or another

382
00:21:57,712 --> 00:21:59,131
It must have been crazy

383
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:00,757
[Lake] No

384
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,926
I just focused on this and it was over quickly.

385
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:08,265
okay?

386
00:22:10,684 --> 00:22:11,768
[light sigh]

387
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:12,978
thank you

388
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,522
[heavy music]

389
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:16,815
what?

390
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:20,318
Just everything

391
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:23,238
[Hosu] No, you never said thank you.

392
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,907
I saved you twice

393
00:22:27,409 --> 00:22:28,493
it&#39;s okay

394
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:31,329
I was trying to wake Minyoung up, too.

395
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:33,540
I&#39;ll make sure to wake you up

396
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:36,668
To wake up

397
00:22:37,252 --> 00:22:38,962
I can do anything, whatever

398
00:22:45,594 --> 00:22:48,346
[Geonwoo] I hope it gets over by the day after tomorrow at the latest.

399
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:50,182
[Sooyoung] Yes

400
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:53,268
I&#39;ll make a plan and tell you in advance.

401
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,146
Okay, then I will prepare too.

402
00:22:58,356 --> 00:23:00,108
<i>- 민영이는요?</i> <b>- What about Minyoung?</b> <i>- [긴장되는 음악]</i> <b>- [Nervous music]</b>

403
00:23:00,192 --> 00:23:01,234
[Geonwoo] Ah

404
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,153
I&#39;ll send you a picture

405
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:04,487
Wait

406
00:23:10,702 --> 00:23:11,828
[camera shutter sound]

407
00:23:13,288 --> 00:23:14,664
[cell phone vibrating sound]

408
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,545
[Music that heightens the mood]

409
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,188
[Switch operation sound]

410
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:43,526
[Sound effect emphasized by bang]

411
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,070
[rattling sound]

412
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:47,697
[Sound of door closing]

413
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,783
[ECG meter beeping sound]

414
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:54,204
[Emphasized sound effect]

415
00:23:57,791 --> 00:24:00,126
[Meaningful music]

416
00:24:07,842 --> 00:24:09,844
[intense music]
