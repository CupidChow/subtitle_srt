2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,467
Because Yoo Sung-pil always

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,512
Has been a counselor for a limited number of students

4
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,972
There isn't much information about him

5
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,975
Even the documents he has submitted to the school

6
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,854
Won't reveal much about him

7
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,355
The same goes for Choi Gun-woo

8
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,149
As for him

9
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,318
Only some partial information is available

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,823
Do you not feel too much pressure on yourself?

11
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,495
But for Min Young-ae, I need to put pressure on myself.

12
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,040
What if the job is beyond repair?

13
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,794
Don't be too hard on yourself.

14
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,514
Shall we eat something first?

15
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,890
Should we ask them to bring food?

16
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,436
What should I do now?

17
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,105
It's true that I'm hungry.

18
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,651
I'm also worried about tomorrow's chemistry exam.

19
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,780
I don't want to fail.

20
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,157
I don't want to die.

21
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,660
I want to live.

22
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,871
That's enough.

23
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,957
I'll order the food.

24
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,795
Haven't you found it yet?

25
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,171
It's strange.

26
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,090
Choi Soo-young herself said that.

27
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,842
She figured out who he is.

28
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,136
I thought the same, but it wasn't like that.

29
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,222
Hey, the boss asked again today if...

30
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,975
When do I get the order?

31
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,853
...I took fertilizer for it today.

32
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:25,937
Are you listening?

33
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,480
Yes, I'm speeding things up with my work.

34
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,523
What?

35
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,317
You're speeding things up with your work? Hey, you're crazy.

36
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,569
Is this a joke?

37
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,571
If that old man finds out...

38
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,323
We'll both be in trouble, idiot.

39
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,577
I'll call you again.

40
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,798
I think they brought the food.

41
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,216
I'm leaving.

42
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,677
Here you go.

43
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,643
We met again.

44
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,022
Alone? You're not alone, are you?

45
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,906
Shall we talk?

46
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,032
How did you find this place?

47
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,867
With a tracker.

48
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,016
Is it okay for the police to do something like this?

49
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,481
Because I'm a bit confused, so I'm asking.

50
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,525
Why are you protecting Shaf?

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,071
It's because...

52
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,656
Can he wake up Min Young?

53
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,577
Hoseo?

54
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,247
You didn't tell him that...

55
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,791
It's not your command at all.

56
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,501
And you stole it?

57
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,757
You couldn't have made the antidote from the beginning.

58
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,425
Ha?

59
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,054
What does this mean?

60
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,770
I'm taking Hoseo with me.

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,940
No.

62
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,401
You can't take Hoseo.

63
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,154
What do you want to do, for example?

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,865
If I report that...

65
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,159
Yoo Seong Pil, the college entrance exam consultant, is missing.

66
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,538
So won't everyone ask who is the one at school?

67
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,373
You might think you can claim to be a police officer.

68
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,001
And get involved in the palace case.

69
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,753
But you know it's not like that.

70
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,009
The moment you get caught...

71
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,304
Your life is about to end.

72
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,391
What do you want to do then?

73
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,767
So Young Shi.

74
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,687
Then you will die too.

75
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,731
Are they going to...

76
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,108
Do they have weaknesses?

77
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,531
Is this a threat now?

78
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,827
Aren't you in a situation where you shouldn't get caught?

79
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,495
I'm different.

80
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,332
You want to stay alive no matter what.

81
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,500
But I don't.

82
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,055
So I'm waiting for death?

83
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,393
Alright, what do you want?

84
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,978
Let me ask a question first.

85
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,397
No one knows that...

86
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,107
Who broke the vase?

87
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,111
No, thanks to your intervention.

88
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,698
So what about those who were in front of the house?

89
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,200
They have no problem.

90
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,620
Because I took all the lab equipment and materials out of the house.

91
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,122
Yeah.

92
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,917
The negotiations start from now.

93
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,836
Because there is no other way for...

94
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,172
Shiva's identity to be revealed.

95
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,800
For now.

96
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,302
Go back to school.

97
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:27,637
And get to work.

98
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,438
Well...

99
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,358
Cookie is a type of substance, isn't it?

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,944
Make it for me by Tuesday.

101
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:44,821
I have to give them something so that Shiva stays safe.

102
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,490
Wouldn't it make our negotiations easier this way?

103
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,242
So-Ho-Soo.

104
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,163
Can you?

105
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,623
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,999
In my shoe.

107
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,088
A tracker was placed.

108
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,257
I had no idea.

109
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,427
Yeah.

110
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,350
I stole the order.

111
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,521
Actually, I cut it.

112
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,941
The day I went looking for the money that my dad stole from me to buy drugs.

113
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,195
...unless...

114
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,822
Those bastards.

115
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,658
Don't they have the order?

116
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,035
That's why they want to kill you.

117
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,954
You have the upper hand.

118
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,249
In all aspects, both good and bad.

119
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,921
Find a way to wake up Min Young.

120
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,841
Find him.

121
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,475
And tell me.

122
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,101
So don't say you can't.

123
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,520
Don't take that expression for yourself either.

124
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,687
Don't show weakness.

125
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,273
Even if you have to pretend.

126
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,068
I won't give up on Min Young.

127
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,237
So don't give up either.

128
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,073
Is Min Young in your dreams?

129
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,829
What?

130
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:06,045
Why are you acting like this?

131
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,853
Because it's my family.

132
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,232
Not all families are like this.

133
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,942
Choi Min Young said something similar once.

134
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,153
What did he say?

135
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,074
At first, his wound disappears.

136
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,580
Then his father disappears.

137
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,501
What happens next?

138
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,965
Did he say I would disappear too?

139
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,594
No.

140
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,930
He said you would turn bad.

141
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,188
He said a selfish sister who only cares about herself appears in his dream.

142
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,648
He said in his dream...

143
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:50,941
Isn't that my shoe you're wearing? I just bought it.

144
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,277
I didn't know! I thought it was mine.

145
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,366
Yesterday and the day before and the day before that also...

146
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,410
You stole my clothes.

147
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,124
What? What?

148
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,044
What did you just say?

149
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,010
You heard it yourself. Well?

150
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,224
What? You're speechless.

151
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,684
You...

152
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,561
You are ugly and have bad character as well.

153
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,605
What? Hey, Choi Min Young!

154
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,357
Aren't you coming here?

155
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,234
Is this how you talk to your sister?

156
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,070
I don't want to wake up.

157
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,154
You're not my sister.

158
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,240
Choi Min Young, are you okay?

159
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,033
Shut up.

160
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,660
This is how you treat your sister?

161
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:43,786
Aren't you coming?

162
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,621
Is this how one talks to their sister?

163
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,128
But...

164
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,381
...the first thing he sees when he wakes up from the dream is...

165
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,176
Goodness?

166
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,304
It's his sister.

167
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,848
His kind-hearted sister.

168
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,569
Min Young.

169
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,905
Are you okay?

170
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,433
Damn it!

171
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,393
Damn you! Just shut up already!

172
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,610
Min Young, are you okay?

173
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,030
Shut up.

174
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,157
You are not my sister.

175
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,368
Min Young, are you okay?

176
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,998
No, I don't want to wake up.

177
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,547
Min Young.

178
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,798
Are you okay?

179
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,846
Did you sleep well?

180
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,682
Why did you want to see me?

181
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,769
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

182
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,481
Honestly...

183
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,026
The security of this school is very good.

184
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,653
It has cameras and plenty of guards, and it's crowded.

185
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,240
Well?

186
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,618
Because we reached an agreement at the hotel that day.

187
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,874
For now, I sent them to find the black chickpea.

188
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,751
It's time to deliver Shiva to them.

189
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,463
So Young Shi, you have to help me.

190
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,010
Why?

191
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,223
You also took advantage of my weakness.

192
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,942
And you mixed me up in all of this.

193
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,902
I think I found your weakness too.

194
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,532
...don't tell me...

195
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,497
Min Young is with me.

196
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,792
That's how I found your weakness.

197
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,517
Where is he now?

198
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,687
Where did you take Min Young?

199
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,358
I'll bring him back to the hospital.

200
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,987
I'm taking Min Young back to the hospital.

201
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,781
Of course, if you listen to me.

202
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,121
I didn't want to do it either.

203
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,331
I didn't want to get involved in these things.

204
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,583
If I had stolen Mama Hwa's obsession.

205
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,794
It would have made my job easier.

206
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,841
But when I arrived there, she had already arranged everything.

207
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,969
His room was empty.

208
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,596
...No, really?

209
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,890
What else could I do?

210
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,101
I had to take Min Young.

211
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,479
Well?

212
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,565
So Hwa Soo.

213
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,858
Just hand her over to me.

214
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:10,112
I'll bring Min Young back safe and sound.

215
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,241
So let's handle it gently.

216
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,244
Because I'm giving you a chance to bring Min Young back.

217
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,679
Did you hand her over?

218
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,597
Yes.

219
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,977
You said you would record her words.

220
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,896
Can I listen to it?

221
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,648
I checked my phone.

222
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,358
I was afraid she would find out, so I didn't record it.

223
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,485
...Oh.

224
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,112
Was there anything else you said?

225
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,243
Kids, let's go to the buffet afterwards?

226
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,788
I invented another drink.

227
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,249
It had whipped cream, mango, and strawberries in it before.

228
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,086
With syrup and chocolate chips, why not?

229
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,130
...but milkshake, chocolate chips, cookies, strawberries...

230
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,257
I promise you.

231
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,179
We have a lot of professional manpower and research budget.

232
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,140
Just give me the order.

233
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,894
We can do something to make Min Young completely okay.

234
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,980
That time I got a perfect score of 100 three times in a row in karaoke.

235
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,190
How is that possible?

236
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,691
I think I should be a singer.

237
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,320
Yeah, I don't need to study anymore.

238
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,198
Here's the certificate I told you about.

239
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,492
She fixed it properly.

240
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,080
Check it out.

241
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,750
By the way, where's Director Ho now?

242
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,128
He's having a meeting with one of the clients.

243
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,421
Oh, okay.

244
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,884
So now I have to fulfill my promise, right?

245
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,971
Thank you, Boss.

246
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,599
If I take care of it, will you hand over Hwa Soo to me?

247
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,727
It's obvious.

248
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,187
If you don't sign it, it will be too late.

249
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,531
Thank you.

250
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,534
Do you know how many times I've been fooled before?

251
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,494
You know

252
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,787
Every time, I made up for it for you.

253
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,665
Because nowadays

254
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,834
The old man has become a little sensitive.

255
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,920
Okay then.

256
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,798
Hey!

257
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,137
Sir Director, we're in trouble.

258
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,146
...Sir Boss.

259
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,772
Oh, damn it.

260
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,817
...this damn bastard.

261
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,153
Who are these garbage people?

262
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,783
Huh?

263
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,037
In many legal systems, this is a principle.

264
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,332
First, we need to examine the sentence.

265
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,376
It starts with "it."

266
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,379
This is a principle.

267
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,799
If I hand over Hwa Soo, what will happen to her?

268
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,135
What happens to her?

269
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,970
You know what.

270
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,014
Will she die?

271
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,475
First, we use her.

272
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,478
We make the most of her as much as possible.

273
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,855
After that, it will be the same.

274
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,066
Do you have a guilty conscience?

275
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,070
Obviously not.

276
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,155
This trouble is because of my sister.

277
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,075
She killed a lot of people for no reason.

278
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,120
Obviously not.

279
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,580
Okay.

280
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,208
But...

281
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,877
I'm a little worried.

282
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,213
If it turns out the way you say it does...

283
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,422
It's possible that you too...

284
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,216
Will face this disaster.

285
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,553
Of course, for me, just bringing back Min Young is enough.

286
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,059
But if I hand over Shaf, will they let her live?

287
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,771
Yes.

288
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,481
There won't be any problem.

289
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,733
With these tricks, you can't save Hwa Soo.

290
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,904
Another reunion of the three states?

291
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,079
I left my wallet in the buffet.

292
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,043
I'll be back soon.

293
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,420
Okay, go ahead.

294
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,963
That event you organized.

295
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,557
I gave the prize to the winners.

296
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,310
We worked all weekend.

297
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,687
Good.

298
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,856
You did so much work.

299
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,524
You must have been very stressed.

300
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,026
I must have suffered a lot.

301
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,652
No.

302
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,821
I focused on it and finished quickly.

303
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,160
Seriously?

304
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,873
Thank you.

305
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,710
For what?

306
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:20,213
Everything.

307
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,133
I never thanked you before.

308
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,802
You saved me twice.

309
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,388
Forget about it.

310
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,224
I did those things to save Min Young.

311
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,435
I'll make sure to remind her.

312
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,563
For reminding Min Young.

313
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,857
I'll do whatever it takes.

314
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,241
I hope you finish the work by at least the day after tomorrow.

315
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,077
Okay.

316
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,163
I'll make a plan and let you know.

317
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,041
Then I'll get ready too.

318
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,003
How is Min Young?

319
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,129
Oh.

320
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,048
I'll send you a picture of her now.

321
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,382
Hold on.
