3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,369
What grade is it that
transferred to our side?

4
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,910
Gender: Female Nationality: Korean Immigration Records:
No records of entry or exit during the reference period

5
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,040
It's a matter specially
instructed by the chairman.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,629
I heard her parents are in
the American business circle.

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,999
She is also one of the top industrialists.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,670
She is also very interested in education.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,440
It seems that she also has the
idea of donating to a foundation.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,889
In short, we will allocate her to Class
F according to the school regulations.

11
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,059
Please manage her well, class teacher.

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,890
And please take good care of her.

13
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:03,996
Let her adapt to campus
life as soon as possible.

14
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,310
Okay, I will make efforts.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,939
I hope her academic performance
will be excellent as well.

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,400
If you don't want to hear gossip.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,939
Coming from a prestigious American university,
there shouldn't be any problem, right?

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,110
Okay, then let's adjourn. Everyone,
let's go to the morning meeting.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Right.

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,530
Did the full-time teachers and cadres
from the school also not come today?

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,580
Not quite sure.

22
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,290
Teacher, you go ahead and
hold the morning meeting.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,339
If it's a transfer student, I'll first
confirm a few pieces of information.

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,860
Then let her go back to the classroom.

25
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,590
- Okay, can. - Okay.

26
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,690
I see on your records that you
started studying abroad from high school.

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,536
Were you able to communicate in
English without any problems back then?

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,570
I adapted quite quickly.

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
That's great.

30
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,740
I hope you can adapt quickly here too.

31
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,870
I will, definitely.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Is it because it's your
first day at a new school?

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,000
I can tell you're quite nervous.

34
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,210
No, I'm fine.

35
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,250
Yeah, no need to be nervous.

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,670
It suits you well.

37
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,470
What?

38
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,060
I mean, you look like a
student from this school.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,320
It's here, Class F.

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,450
I'll go in first then.

41
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,830
Welcome to our school.

42
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,500
Okay, thank you.

43
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,630
You're here.

44
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,470
Everyone, please take a seat.

45
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,180
How about you introduce yourself first?

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,400
My name is Li Enshu. Please
take care of me in the future.

47
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,780
She's a school belle,
at the school belle level.

48
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,070
Regarding Enshu's seat,

49
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,740
go to the side of Duo Xian, the back row.

50
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,710
- Everyone, please listen to the class well.
- Yes.

51
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,600
Hello, my name is Wu Duo Xian.

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,640
You are really beautiful.

53
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,150
Thank you.

54
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,506
English, physical education, biology, chemistry,
drawing, Chinese language, Korean history, self-study.

55
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,530
What?

56
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,780
Today's class schedule.

57
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,790
English, physical
education, biology, chemistry.

58
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,110
Drawing, Chinese language,
Korean history, self-study.

59
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,750
Physical education is swimming
class. Do you bring your swimsuit?

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,050
Mm, mm.

61
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,295
Li Enshu, Jung-Han High School.

62
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,150
Are you Ji Sooyoung's sister?

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,150
What exactly is going on?

64
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,119
I'm afraid there might be
some problems afterwards.

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
Let me tell you first.

66
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,160
Just pretend you don't know me.

67
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,200
What?

68
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,000
Although we won't have any intersection.

69
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,260
Don't use honorific
language with me either.

70
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,170
I am here to save Minying.

71
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,030
Are you planning to obstruct me?

72
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,050
Anyway, it's fortunate.

73
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,850
I thought something
happened, I've been worried.

74
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,020
Although something did happen indeed.

75
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,270
Anyway, it's fortunate, very fortunate.

76
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,760
How about wearing a surf suit?

77
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,350
I think you would look
more beautiful in a bikini.

78
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Alright, I'll wear it.

79
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,690
Is it because of the scars on your body?

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,530
Hey, what kind of scars are those?

81
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,910
I used to dislike swimming a lot.

82
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,660
But it was fine after I
entered the third grade.

83
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,540
Because the swimming class
for Class F is after Class S.

84
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,459
There is a guy named
Song Zhenyu in Class S.

85
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,226
He is the incredibly handsome
school grass of our school.

86
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,250
I'm really sorry about that.

87
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,110
Can you please let go of me for now?

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,219
I'm sorry, I am an isolated person.

89
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,719
After just a few conversations
with you, I forgot myself.

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,760
Arrogantly linking arms,
thinking highly of myself.

91
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,850
I thought we were already friends.

92
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,310
No, it's not like that.

93
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
We are friends.

94
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,490
I happen to not have any
friends. Isn't this perfect?

95
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,779
Can I link arms with you again?

96
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,060
Since we're already friends now.

97
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,080
Let go. Didn't you notice
that she doesn't like it?

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,090
Are you good at studying?

99
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,050
That's not right.

100
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,696
It should be an escape-type study abroad.

101
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
And then couldn't persist until
the end before coming back, right?

102
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,969
English is not spoken very well either.

103
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,130
Just setting up the image
of a foreign student, right?

104
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,900
Take your hands off, don't
blame me for hitting you.

105
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,400
The grades of class S
are as solid as concrete.

106
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,320
But class F is the same.

107
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,020
Almost all of our classmates in our
class have been together for three years.

108
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,570
It's crazy, right?

109
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,790
You need to improve our relationship
for us to live comfortably.

110
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,800
In order for us to become close.

111
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,800
You need to help me out.

112
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,900
How did you know I
liked this kind of thing?

113
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,900
I just like violence.

114
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,840
Damn it.

115
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,180
Hello, transfer student.

116
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,020
This school is strange. It must have
started with the S-class eating together.

117
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
But there is another strange point.

118
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,360
If you eat with me, you
can have a meal anytime.

119
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,360
If you want to eat in
advance, you can tell me.

120
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,530
If that pervert harasses
you again, tell me too.

121
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,160
Can I also tell you something?

122
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,420
Probably not.

123
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,340
Duoxian, can I ask you for a favor?

124
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,430
Anything is fine.

125
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,520
Please bring Enshu's luggage
from your class to the dormitory.

126
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,230
Ask her for your dorm room
number and bring your luggage over.

127
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Please.

128
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,490
Sister Xiuying.

129
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,500
Who are you?

130
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,710
Minying's colleague.

131
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,250
It's now.

132
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,130
My colleague.

133
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,230
Let's go.

134
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,580
This is your room.

135
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,710
This way, the door will open.

136
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,050
Hmm.

137
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,720
Thank you.

138
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,010
No need to thank me.
We are friends, you know.

139
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,700
This was originally Cuiminying's room.

140
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,960
She was isolated in class S.

141
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,840
There used to be a large scar on her face.

142
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,920
It doesn't matter how
good she is at studying.

143
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,010
Everyone avoids her, dislikes
her, and talks bad about her.

144
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
Except for one person.

145
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,730
His name is Xu Haoxiu.

146
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,310
I like Minying.

147
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,290
How can you ask me to forget about her?

148
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,850
How is it possible to live
like nothing ever happened?

149
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,720
You can go and be busy first.

150
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,390
I need to tidy up my luggage first.

151
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,680
Let me help you with what you said.

152
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,060
We are friends after all.

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,610
Let me do it myself.

154
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,190
You can really go and take
care of your own tasks first.

155
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,250
Let me just organize your coat
for you. I am your friend, remember?

156
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,750
I just want to do something to help you.

157
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,390
Got it. I'll help you organize your coat.

158
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,030
Here you go.

159
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,060
But...

160
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,690
The classmate who lives here.

161
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,610
Do you know anything else about her?

162
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,280
Not quite sure.

163
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,300
Damn it.

164
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,050
Did Song Zhenyu tell you
to follow closely behind me?

165
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,720
Hmm.

166
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,310
Does he hate me that much?

167
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,220
Hate me to the point that you like me?

168
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Hmm.

169
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,520
Bastard.

170
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,650
Useless.

171
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,980
Son of a bitch.

172
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,900
I'm talking about you.

173
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,320
Don't you have any self-respect?

174
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,659
If he tells you to do it, just do it.

175
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,699
Is it really true, like the rumors say?

176
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,580
Is Song Zhenyu helping
you pay the tuition fee?

177
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,790
Yes, he is helping me pay.

178
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
What?

179
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,340
My family doesn't have money.

180
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,880
My mom has cancer and is in the hospital.

181
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,300
My dad left with a pile of debts.

182
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,060
But I still have to pay the dormitory fee
and other special activity fees every month.

183
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,519
If I can earn money easily like this,

184
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,640
why should I hesitate?

185
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,810
I definitely have to do it.

186
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,710
Zhenyu asked me to help him clean the room.

187
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,250
I'm leaving first.

188
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,100
What's wrong? Why are you looking pitiful?

189
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Put it down.

190
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,780
Thanks.

191
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,529
I'm going.

192
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,660
Minjun, this is the
favor book you asked for.

193
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,489
I was so scared to steal these.

194
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,199
Damn it, shut up.

195
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,909
I don't want to hear pig noises.

196
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,910
Damn it, touch and see.

197
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,750
Is it sexy?

198
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,420
Touch and see, useless

199
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,630
How is it? How is it?

200
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,010
Fantastic

201
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,560
- Can I take this? - Any one you want

202
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,690
Hey, catch her

203
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,770
I really took as much as possible

204
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,779
Secretly, as much as possible

205
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,530
Fool, this is new, the tag is still on

206
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,699
Can't even smell any scent, damn it

207
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,000
Damn it

208
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,750
I could just buy the new one
directly, why bother stealing it

209
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,630
Sorry, sorry.

210
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,760
At least do one thing well.

211
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,560
Do it right now.

212
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,650
The swimsuit I wore just now will do.

213
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,330
School-wide student life record book.

214
00:17:22,331 --> 00:17:24,710
Student information. Name: Li Jingshan.

215
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,379
Student information. Name: Jin Yaying.

216
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,026
Special matter: Her father is a high-level executive in the second largest corporate company in the financial industry. Comes from a
particularly wealthy family. Strong desire for material possessions; she wants everything others want. Really want to obtain father's approval

217
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,590
Inside here are the life records and personal
information of all students in the school

218
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,759
Not only grades, but also
introductions to parents' financial status

219
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,930
You can take a look

220
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,559
The ones marked in red
are customers of Cui Minying

221
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,600
You can refer to it

222
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,230
How much do we need to
sell to wake Minying up

223
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,150
10% of all students in the school

224
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,199
The current customers are only
3% of all students in the school

225
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,570
Just need to increase by 7%.

226
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,580
Approximately 31 people.

227
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,680
Why does it have to be ten percent?

228
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,810
There are security issues.

229
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,680
If you improve performance with me.

230
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,490
It's not good for the
original customers too.

231
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,750
Let's solve it quickly and end it.

232
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,880
Choose customers carefully.

233
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,170
Because if accidents happen,
it will affect business.

234
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,600
You will be responsible for everything.

235
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,530
Here you go.

236
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,650
Business comes after.

237
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,900
Let's hang up the signboard first.

238
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,090
There are answers to the class
placement exams in that tablet.

239
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,590
Eat the cookies and memorize the answers.

240
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
Why?

241
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,310
Many people eat cookies for the
purpose of improving their grades.

242
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,230
I want to share with my classmates.

243
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,790
You must first improve your grades.

244
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,150

249
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,010
What is this?

250
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,830
Is this the food our pig eats?

251
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,170
I'm not too sure either.

252
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,400
I don't really like cookies.

253
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,630
Let go, let go, let go, let go.

254
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,710
Come.

255
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,200
Use your mouth to catch
it and continue eating.

256
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,510
If you can't catch it,
it's a million Korean won.

257
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,720
Wow, a million Korean won!

258
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,990
One, two, three.

259
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,340
What if I catch it?

260
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,500
Will you give me a million Korean won?

261
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:20,910
What are you doing?

262
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,030
Who is this guy?

263
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,676
What right does he have to intervene?

264
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,200
Whose dog is that?

265
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,700
S-class Song Zhenyu's assistant.

266
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,970
Get lost, I'm leaving.

267
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,770
Give me that.

268
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,410
That is the feed for our pigs.

269
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,000
I want to eat this.

270
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,290
Really.

271
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,610
Damn it, I'm going.

272
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,750
He wants to eat it himself.

273
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,790
Damn it.

274
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Hello.

275
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,810
Just because Song Zhenyu is protecting you,
does it mean you can treat others with contempt?

276
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,030
Hello, hello, hello.

277
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
No.

278
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
I can see it.

279
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,280
It's bullying on campus.

280
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,850
I'm sorry.

281
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,190
Guo Minjun made me do this.

282
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,970
Sorry, En Shu.

283
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,750
Where?

284
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,040
Where are the things inside?

285
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,040
I was in such a hurry that I
didn't have time to bring them all.

286
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,040
I will buy the same thing
for you if anything is missing.

287
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,250
I didn't mean underwear.

288
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,930
What is it then?

289
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,570
Is there nothing else inside the underwear?

290
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,020
What?

291
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,210
Are you talking about cookies?

292
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes, that's the one.

293
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,610
What are you going to do with that?

294
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,190
No, where are the cookies?

295
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,140
I'm telling you

296
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,040
But if I tell you

297
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,340
Can you give me your underwear?

298
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,310
How much money do you
want to buy my underwear?

299
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,930
What?

300
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
How did you come here by yourself?

301
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,120
Come and sell things

302
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Do you need money?

303
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,200
If you take off your
underwear and give it to me now

304
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,810
I will give you three
million South Korean won

305
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,180
With this price

306
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,460
I can even sell more exciting things.

307
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,020
What

308
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,910
Before that

309
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,820
Damn it

310
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,120
Damn it

311
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,750
Damn it, I knew it would be like this

312
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,150
Let's talk it over and
delete it quickly, Enshu

313
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,830
Threatening like this is useless

314
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,530
I don't want it

315
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,240
Then I won't buy underwear either

316
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,540
It's better to steal

317
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,920
Run quickly

318
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,090
Ah ah, what is it

319
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm going

320
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,590
Ah, damn it

321
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,570
01011483247, right?

322
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,690
How did you know my dad's phone number?

323
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,240
Dad is a judge, mom is
a university professor.

324
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,770
Dad is preparing to resign
and join a law firm recently.

325
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,550
Should I send the video
just now to the law firm?

326
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,850
What are you trying to do?

327
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,050
Don't worry.

328
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,100
I am just threatening.

329
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,300
As long as you buy
things, I will delete it.

330
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,110
What?

331
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,690
Didn't I tell you so?

332
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,460
I want to sell something
more exciting than underwear.

333
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,100
What is it?

334
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,960
Industry awards.

335
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,330
Grand Prix.

336
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,510
Let's go out and play.

337
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,830
What are you doing?

338
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,690
They are too noisy.

339
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,380
They won't bully you in the future.

340
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,910
So don't worry.

341
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,440
What do you mean?

342
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,990
He's already tired of underwear.

343
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,000
I said I fell down, and the head
teacher immediately believed me.

344
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,280
I believe you now.

345
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,740
Is there something you need?

346
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,490
Weren't you the one who
said not to talk to you?

347
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,910
Why do you want to meet me now?

348
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,080
I want to say thank you to you.

349
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,280
Is everything going smoothly?

350
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,120
About saving Minying.

351
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,760
It's only starting now.

352
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,810
How many cookies do you want to sell?

353
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,680
At that time.

354
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,270
Even though my body
fainted, my mind was clear.

355
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,770
I'm shameless, aren't I?

356
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,800
But I will continue.

357
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,050
No matter what means and methods are used,
it should be done as soon as possible.

358
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,800
You are still not shameless enough.

359
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,170
Didn't you say that no matter
what means and methods are used?

360
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,930
Then you should make use of anyone.

361
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,050
What does that mean?

362
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
I will help you.

363
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,040
Quickly sell all the cookies.

364
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,150
Be shameless.

365
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Alright.

366
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,360
That's it.

367
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,010
If the salespeople succeed
in selling the cookies...

368
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,380
The next task belongs to the laundry room.

369
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,930
Cookies made inside
the laundry room's bakery

370
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,820
Will be delivered together
with the freshly washed clothes

371
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,730
Jung Han High School

372
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:13,240
The selling price of each
cookie is 3 million Korean won

373
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,020
Jung Han High School
Even with such a high price

374
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,550
The confirmed customers account
for 3% of the entire student body

375
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,580
They have already inherited
various stocks and cryptocurrencies

376
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,980
There are also real estate properties.

377
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,530
For them, high amounts are not a problem.

378
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,230
It even becomes a privilege.

379
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,860
Just take a bite.

380
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,190
It will improve attention and
enhance learning efficiency.

381
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Just eat half.

382
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,580
Emotions will become uplifted.

383
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,480
Worries will disappear and
the body will feel light.

384
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
And then,

385
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,110
If you eat the whole piece,

386
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,700
Dreams will come true.

387
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,520
As long as you eat a
cookie, nothing is impossible.

388
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,900
However, it is not recommended
to eat more than one cookie.

389
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,409
Price: 3,000,000 Korean won. Benefits It will improve attention and enhance learning efficiency. If you
eat the whole piece, your dream will come true. Just eat half of it and your mood will become uplifted.

390
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:00,166
Management personnel and distribution methods. The captain is the chef. I don't know his appearance, age,
or name. All staff members are unaware. Only Aunt (or auntie) knows, after her voice changes, she calls.

391
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,380
In conclusion,

392
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,490
Developing cookies, the person
who explores business opportunities,

393
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,880
is the chef.

394
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,420
No one knows who he really is.

395
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,199
The chef,

396
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,820
We already have five people so quickly.

397
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,330
Amazing, Cui Xiuying.

398
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,130
No, it's Li Enshu.

399
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,476
We can't draw a conclusion yet.

400
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,366
You also know that running
a business is one thing,

401
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,150
managing it is even harder.

402
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,490
You surely don't want
to hinder her, do you?

403
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,580
Don't let your selfishness
shake the entire business.

404
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,230
This is for the good of everyone.

405
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,540
How is that possible?

406
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,119
However, Chef

407
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,790
Chef

408
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,350
Hmm

409
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,250
I have been working for a long time
and have always been working hard.

410
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,800
Like the crisis situation last time

411
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,400
You won't abandon me again, will you?

412
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,930
I need this commitment.

413
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,470
Chef

414
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,890
Who is the chef?

415
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,520
Can you tell me quietly?

416
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,590
No

417
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
I saw Choi Min-young's
information and there are police.

418
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,380
I really don't feel at ease.

419
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,330
By the way, I want to talk
to you about this matter.

420
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,660
I know who the police officer is.

421
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,170
I will handle it, don't worry.

422
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,580
Also, aunt.

423
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,920
If you ask me for
personal information again,

424
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,660
You will be fired.

425
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,670
Haven't you always been doing well?

426
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,460
Keep it up.

427
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,080
Don't.

428
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,530
Crossing the line.

429
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,750
Where did you go?

430
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Ah.

431
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,940
I went on a date with Hee-jin.
