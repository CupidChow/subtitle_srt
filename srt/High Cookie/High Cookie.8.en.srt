2
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,369
What? Did you transfer in the last year?

3
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,040
Special command from the headmaster

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,629
His parents are in America

5
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,999
Among the top entrepreneurs

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,670
They give a lot of importance to education

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,440
That's why they want to contribute financially to the assembly

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,889
Anyway, according to school rules, he has to go to Class F

9
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,059
You, as the class teacher, should take care of him

10
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:02,890
Be careful with him

11
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:03,996
Until he integrates with the others himself

12
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,310
Sure, I'll do my best

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,939
I hope his grades are good

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,400
So that nobody can object

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,939
He came from a reputable high school in America. Surely he's not bad

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,110
OK, then. Let's go to the morning meeting

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
By the way

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,530
Hasn't that police officer come today either?

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,580
I don't know

20
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,290
Do you want to go to the meeting earlier?

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,339
There are some things about the transfer student that I have to confirm

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,860
Then I'll take him to his class

23
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,590
Okay then- \N Very well-

24
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,690
I saw in your records that you have been out of the country since elementary school

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,536
Could you speak English without any problems?

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,570
I quickly adapted myself to them

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
Thank goodness

28
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,740
I hope you can quickly adapt yourself to the others here as well

29
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,870
Don't doubt it

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,160
Is it because it's your first day?

31
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,000
It seems like you're a little stressed

32
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,210
No, I'm fine

33
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,250
Yeah, don't worry

34
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,670
You can relax

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,470
What?

36
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,060
I mean, it seems like you've been a student here for a long time

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,320
Here it is. Class F

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,450
So I'll go in

39
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,830
Welcome to this school

40
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,500
Oh, thank you

41
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,630
You came

42
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,470
Sit down, everyone

43
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,180
How about introducing yourself first?

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,400
My name is Li On Soo. Nice to meet you

45
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,780
You're very beautiful

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,070
...for the seat as well

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,740
Go to the side, Da Hyeon. Last row

48
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,710
Everyone, pay attention to the lesson- \N Okay-

49
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,600
Hi, my name is Oh Da Hyeon

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,640
You're so pretty

51
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,150
Thank you

52
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,506
English, sports, biology, chemistry, art, Chinese language, Korean history, independent study

53
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,530
What?

54
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,780
Today's schedule

55
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,790
English, sports, biology, chemistry

56
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,110
Art, Chinese language, Korean history, independent study

57
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,750
For the sports class, do we have to swim? Did you bring your swimsuit?

58
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,050
Yes, I did

59
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,295
(Li On Soo, Jung Han High School)

60
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,150
You are Nona Soo Young, right?

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,150
What's the matter?

62
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,119
Maybe there will be a problem later

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,160
That's why I'm telling you in advance now

64
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,160
Pretend you don't know me

65
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,200
What?

66
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,000
...we don't get along, but

67
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,260
Don't call me Nona

68
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,170
I came here to save Min Yoon

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,030
Do you want to stop me?

70
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,050
Anyway, I feel relieved now

71
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,850
I thought something had happened. I was worried

72
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,020
Well, something really did happen

73
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,270
...anyway, I feel relieved. Thank goodness

74
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,760
Why are you wearing a wetsuit?

75
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,350
I think you look much prettier in a bikini

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Just like this

77
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,690
Don't tell me you have a wound on your body

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,530
Hey, what's the problem?

79
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,910
I used to hate swimming

80
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,660
But now that we're in our final year, I like it

81
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,540
Because our class is right after the special class

82
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,459
One of the boys in the special class is named Song Jin Woo

83
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,226
He's the most handsome boy in our school

84
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,250
...I'm really sorry but

85
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,110
Can you leave me alone?

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,219
I'm sorry. I don't want any friends

87
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,719
After a few words we spoke

88
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,760
I felt a sense of intimacy and

89
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,850
I held your hand

90
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,310
No, it's not like that

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
We're friends

92
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,490
I also don't have any friends. It would be great, wouldn't it?

93
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,779
So, can I hold your hand again?

94
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,060
Because we're friends

95
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,080
Leave it. He doesn't like it, right?

96
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,090
Are you doing well in your studies?

97
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,050
No, I'm not, right?

98
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,696
You ran away to study abroad, didn't you?

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,360
And then you couldn't continue and came back

100
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,969
And your English is not good at all.

101
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,130
You just got attracted to the charm of a foreign student, didn't you?

102
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,900
Don't touch my hand until I reach you.

103
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,400
Special class grades are as solid as concrete.

104
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,320
Class F is the same.

105
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:32,020
Most of us have been in the same class for three years.

106
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,570
Isn't that right?

107
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,790
We need to get close to each other to be able to support each other.

108
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,800
To become close to each other.

109
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,800
You should help me with that.

110
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,900
How did you know I like these things?

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,900
I enjoy violence.

112
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,840
F**k.

113
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,180
Hello, transfer student.

114
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,020
This school is weird in general. The first one is this special class.

115
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,060
But another weird thing is that...

116
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,360
Whenever you want, you can have a meal with me.

117
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,360
Let me know in advance if you want to.

118
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,530
If that pervert bothers you again, tell me.

119
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,160
Can I say something too?

120
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,420
I can't, can I?

121
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,340
Da Hyun, can I make a request from you?

122
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,430
Say whatever you want.

123
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:23,520
Can you take that bag from me in the classroom to the dorm?

124
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,230
Tell her your room number so she can take your stuff there.

125
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Please.

126
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,490
Nuna Soo Young.

127
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,500
Who are you?

128
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,710
Co-worker Min Young.

129
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,250
Now.

130
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,130
You're my co-worker too.

131
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,230
Let's go.

132
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,580
This is your room.

133
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,710
If you do it like this, it will open easily.

134
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,050
Okay.

135
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,720
Thank you.

136
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,010
There's no need to thank me. We're friends no matter what.

137
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,700
This was originally Choi Min Young's room.

138
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,960
That hated special class.

139
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,840
There was a big wound on his face.

140
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,920
No matter how good his grades were, it didn't make a difference to his well-being.

141
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,010
Everyone ignored him, they disliked him and talked behind his back.

142
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
Except for one person.

143
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,730
So Hu Soo.

144
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,310
I love Min Young.

145
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,290
How can I forget everything?

146
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,850
How can I pretend that nothing happened?

147
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,720
You can leave now.

148
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,390
I need to pack my things.

149
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,680
What are you saying? I'll help you.

150
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,060
We're friends no matter what.

151
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,610
I'll do it myself.

152
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,190
You can leave now.

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,250
I'll help you with your underwear. I love you.

154
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,750
I want to be there for you somehow.

155
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,390
Okay. Just the underwear.

156
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,030
Come.

157
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,060
...I'm saying.

158
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,690
The one who used to live here.

159
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,610
Do you know anything else about him?

160
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,280
No, not much.

161
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,300
Dammit.

162
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,050
Did Song Jin Woo tell you not to hang out with me?

163
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,720
Hmmm.

164
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,310
So he dislikes me that much?

165
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,220
That he told you to not like me?

166
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
Yeah.

167
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,520
Bastard.

168
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,650
Asshole.

169
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,980
Hypocrite.

170
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,900
I'm telling on you.

171
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,320
Don't you have any pride?

172
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,659
Will you do whatever he says?

173
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,699
Are the rumors true?

174
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,580
Is Song Jin Woo paying your tuition fees?

175
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,790
Yeah, he pays.

176
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
What?

177
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,340
My family doesn't have any money.

178
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,880
My mom has cancer and she's in the hospital.

179
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,300
My dad has left us with a lot of debts.

180
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,060
But I have to give money for dormitory and other expenses every month.

181
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,519
When I'm like this, I can make money.

182
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,640
So why should I beg?

183
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,810
I have to do it for sure.

184
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,710
Jin Woo asked me to clean the room.

185
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,250
I have to go.

186
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,100
What's wrong? Why did you suddenly become so childish?

187
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Let it go.

188
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,780
Thank you.

189
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,529
Bravo.

190
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,660
Min Jun, I did the task you asked for.

191
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,489
My heart came into my mouth when I took it off.

192
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,199
Damn it, shut your mouth already.

193
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,909
I can't stand loud noises.

194
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,910
Give it a clap and see how it sounds.

195
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,750
Is it sexy?

196
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,420
Slap it, skull.

197
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,630
How is it? How is it?

198
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,010
Ugh!

199
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,560
Should I take one off? - Any one you want to remove -

200
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,690
Hey, grab it.

201
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,770
I took as much as I could.

202
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,779
I managed to steal as much as possible.

203
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,530
Fool, this one is new. It still has a tag on it.

204
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,699
It doesn't give off that smell, it's garbage.

205
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,000
Garbage.

206
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,750
If it was like that, I would have gone and bought a new one myself.

207
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,630
Excuse me, sorry.

208
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,760
At least do your job properly.

209
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,560
Right now.

210
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,650
Even bring his surfing suit if possible.

In all these records and personal information, it's about all the students.

Not only their grades, but also their parents' financial situation is included in this.

217
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,930
Take a look at it.

218
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,559
The ones I marked with red are Choi Min-yong's clients.

219
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,600
Take a look at this one too.

220
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,230
How much do I have to sell for Min-yong to take notice?

221
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,150
Ten percent of all the students.

222
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,199
Right now, only three percent of the kids are our customers.

223
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,570
We need to raise it to seven percent.

224
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,580
That's almost thirty-one people.

225
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,680
Why does it have to be ten percent?

226
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,810
There are some security concerns.

227
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,680
If you and I both slack off on it...

228
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,490
It's not good for our main customers either.

229
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,750
So let's solve everything quickly.

230
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,880
Choose customers carefully.

231
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,170
Because if something happens, it will have a negative impact on our work.

232
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,600
Then you will be responsible for everything.

233

Come.

234
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,650

235

The answers to the class classification exams are on the tablet.

237

Have a cookie and keep everything a secret.

Why?

239
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,310

241

Come.

253

You have to hold it with your mouth.

If you can't, you have to give me a million.

255

258
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,500
Will you give me a million?

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,676

267
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,000

Really?

269
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,610
This is fake.

270
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,750
He wants to eat it himself.

271
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,790

I couldn't cut it because I was in a hurry.

284
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,040
I'll buy you anything that's not there.

285
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,250
I'm not telling you about the underwear.

286
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,930

287
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,570
What wasn't in the underwear?

288
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,020
What?

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,880

291

292
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,190
No, where is the cookie now?

293
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,140
I'll tell you.

294
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,040
But you can.

295
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,340
Will you give me your underwear?

296
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,310
How much will you buy my underwear for?

297
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,930
What is it?

298
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,640
Did you come here on your own feet?

299
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,120
I came to sell something.

300
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Do you need money?

301
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,200
If you bring the one you're wearing and give it to me.

302
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,810
I'll give you three million.

303
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,180
With that money.

304
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,460
I can give you everything.

305
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,020
What?

306
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:25,910
But first.

307
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,820
Damn it.

308
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,120
Damn it.

309
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,750
Shit, I knew it.

310
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,150
As long as I have a clean mouth, wipe it.

311
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,830
This kind of threat is useless.

312
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,530
I don't want to.

313
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,240
Then I won't buy your underwear either.

314
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,540
Instead, I'll steal it.

315
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,920
Go get lost.

316
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,090
Oh, what's this?

317
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,320
Go that way.

318
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,590
Oh, shit.

319
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,570
Is this correct? 01011483247

320
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,690
How do you know my dad's number?

321
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,240
Your dad is a judge and your mom is a professor.

322
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,770
Your dad wants to resign and go to a law firm.

323
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,550
Should I send this to that law firm?

324
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,850
What do you want to do?

325
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,050
Don't worry.

326
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,100
I'm just threatening you.

327
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,300
Just by buying everything, I'll eliminate you.

328
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,110
What?

329
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,690
Didn't I tell you?

330
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,460
I want to sell something that is better than underwear.

331
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,100
What?

332
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,960
A reward.

333
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,510
Go out and play.

334
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,830
What are you saying?

335
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,690
They make a lot of noise.

336
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,380
They won't bother you anymore.

337
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,910
So don't worry.

338
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,440
What do you mean?

339
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,990
I'm tired of underwear.

340
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,000
I told the teacher I fell down and even she believed it.

341
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,280
No...she believed it.

342
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,740
But what's the situation?

343
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,490
You told me not to talk to you.

344
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,910
But now you're telling me to come visit you.

345
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,080
I wanted to thank you.

346
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,280
Your business is going well.

347
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,120
I mean Min Young is doing well.

348
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,760
It's just the beginning.

349
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,810
How much cookie do you have to sell?

350
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,680
That time.

351
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,270
So I fell, but I was fully conscious.

352
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,770
I am shameless, aren't I?

353
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,800
But I have to continue.

354
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,050
In any way possible and as quickly as possible.

355
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,800
You haven't become shameless yet.

356
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,170
Didn't you say you would do it in any way possible and as quickly as possible?

357
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,930
So you have to use everything.

358
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,050
What do you mean?

359
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,420
I'll help you.

360
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,040
Let's sell the cookies quickly.

361
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,150
It's completely shameless.

362
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
Okay.

363
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:43,360
That's how it is.

364
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:46,010
If the sellers succeed in their work.

365
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,380
Then the rest is up to the laundry room.

366
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,930
The cookies baked in the kitchen are delivered inside the dry-cleaned clothes.

367
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,820
(Jung Han High School)

368
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:10,730
Each cookie costs three million won.

369
00:31:10,731 --> 00:31:13,240
Even with this high price.

370
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,020
We still have three percent buyers.

371
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:20,550
They are the ones who inherited a lot of shares and currency.

372
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,580
They also have a lot of properties and assets.

373
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,980
For them, this money is a small amount.

374
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,530
It even becomes a credit for them.

375
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,230
Just with a gas.

376
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,860
Their concentration and learning capabilities improve.

377
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,190
With just a half.

378
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
They find a good feeling.

379
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,580
Their worries disappear and their bodies feel lighter.

380
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,480
And.

381
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
If they eat all of them.

382
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,110
Their wishes come true.

383
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,700
With a cookie, anything is possible.

384
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:37,520
But you shouldn't eat more than one.

385
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:47,900
Price: Three million won. High performance cookie. Just with a gas, it enhances focus and learning efficiency. If half is consumed, it gives a feeling of happiness to the person.

386
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,409
A person named "Chef" is our leader. Nobody knows what he looks like, how old he is, or what his name is. The only person who talks to him directly is Auntie. He changes his voice during phone calls.

387
00:32:54,410 --> 00:33:00,166
Anyway.

388
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,380
The inventor and founder of the cookie business.

389
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,490
It means Chef.

390
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,880
Nobody knows his identity.

391
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:10,420
(Chef)

392
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,199
You found five customers so soon?

393
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,820
Choi Soo Young is speechless.

394
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,330
No, it's Lee Sung.

395
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,130
We still don't know.

396
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,476
You know running a business is one thing.

397
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,366
And managing it is another thing.

398
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,150
You don't want to put a stumbling block in your own path, right?

399
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,490
With your selfishness, don't ruin our work.

400
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,580
If you're not going to throw a stone in front of your foot.

401
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,230
This is for everyone's benefit.

402
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,540
It's obvious that it's not.

403
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,119
(Chef)

404
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,350
Yes?

405
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:49,250
I've been here for a long time and I've done a really good job.

406
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,800
If something like this happens again.

407
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,400
I want you to promise that.

408
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,930
You won't give up anymore.

409
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,470
(Chef)

410
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,890
Can you tell me

411
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,520
Who are you?

412
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,590
No.

413
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
The information that Choi Min Young gave to the police.

414
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,380
Everyone is worried about it.

415
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:21,330
Actually, I wanted to tell you the same thing.

416
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,660
I found out who that police officer is.

417
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,170
I'll handle it myself. Don't worry.

418
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,580
And also,

419
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,920
If you ask about my identity again,

420
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,660
You'll be expelled.

421
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,670
So far, you've done a good job.

422
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,460
Just keep doing what you're doing.

423
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,080
And about the red lines.

424
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,530
Don't cross.

425
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,750
Where were you?

426
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,340
Oh.

427
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,940
I had gone to a meeting with Hee-Jin.
