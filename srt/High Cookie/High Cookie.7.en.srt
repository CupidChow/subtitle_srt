2
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,590
I want to handle it myself.

3
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,430
I'm supposed to kill someone today.

4
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,510
(Choi Min Young)

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,479
I want to kill him.

(Ho Soo)

9
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,540
Are you in school?

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,460
I'm sure I just saw you in uniform.

11
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,890
The desired device is unavailable.

12
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,420
No.

13
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,549
Are you freaking crazy?

14
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,970
Hey, come on!

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,010
Don't provoke him. He's lost his mind right now.

16
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,389
Don't. Drop the knife.

17
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,219
He doesn't care about you.

18
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,020
He's just scared.

19
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,060
Is he the one who brought the blades to Min Young?

20
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,440
Yes, yes.

21
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,029
He was the one who brought the blades to Min Young.

22
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,530
It wasn't me. It was him. He.

23
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,200
Ajumma (aunt)

24
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,620
Do you have Shaf's number or not?

25
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,040
Call him.

26
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,080
Tell him to come right now.

27
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,090
Shaf?

28
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,799
Did you really think he would come just by making a phone call?

29
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,920
I've never seen him once.

30
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,890
If he doesn't come, then you'll die.

31
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,889
No, no, no.

32
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,140
Okay.

33
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,200
Drop the knife, please, please, damn it, please.

34
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,210
(Shaf) \N Answer me.

35
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,170
(Shaf)

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,340
(Shaf) \N I'm glad to see you, Ms. Choi Soo Young.

37
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,430
If you are listening, then come here... No.

38
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,720
You must come.

39
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:09,219
Shaf, don't give up on me.

40
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,850
He really wants to stab me with the knife. He will really do it.

41
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,270
I will really kill him.

42
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,900
You're twenty-two.

43
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,650
Do you want to become a killer at this age?

44
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,240
It's disturbing.

45
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,200
But unfortunately, I don't have any interest in seeing you.

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,120
Shaf.

47
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,330
Shaf.

48
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,830
Shaf.

49
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,645
Think a little.

50
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:35,975
(Shaf)

51
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,709
Even if you kill your hostage.

52
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,840
Can you take that man?

53
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,090
Even if you take him.

54
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,630
Do you think it will end here?

55
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,900
But it still makes me feel good.

56
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,240
At least, before I die.

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,990
I've taken my revenge.

58
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,950
Is dying like this really the best way?

59
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,000
So what's the best way?

60
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,669
So, with the belief that Min Young will wake up someday,

61
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,800
Should I live my whole life like a crazy person?

62
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,050
Exactly like the life I've had so far?

63
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,170
No.

64
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,555
(Shaf)

65
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,640
If I say there's an antidote that can bring Min Young back to consciousness, what is it?

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,970
What is it?

67
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:35,680
Isn't this the best way?

68
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:38,560
(Shaf)

69
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,070
Antidote?

70
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,780
As I said, I can do something to bring Min Young back to consciousness.

71
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,790
Do you think I believe you?

72
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,750
Obviously no.

73
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,170
I have to see it with my own eyes.

74
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,880
Can you give me a cookie?

75
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,090
I'll give it to Ajuma to eat.

76
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,710
Can you save her right now?

77
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,510
No.

78
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,759
I might die.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,220
No, no.

80
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,390
Did you see?

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,890
Even your own employee doesn't believe you.

82
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,229
Who are you trying to fool?

83
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,690
I can prove it to you.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,070
Speak into your phone and check the command.

85
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,400
And fix it.

86
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,980
Shaf.

87
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,650
Don't you want to use me for testing the antidote?

88
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,900
Right?

89
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,570
Hello?

90
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Hey.

91
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,870
Hey.

92
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
You filthy woman.

93
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,209
You don't consider me a human, do you?

94
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,919
Because I don't know your identity.

95
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,379
You don't consider me a mosquito, do you?

96
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,540
Damn it.

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
Be quiet.

98
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,420
Our tester is being changed.

99
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,680
We have an intruder.

100
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,509
With whose permission?

101
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,640
Don't bother trying. It's pointless.

102
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,430
I didn't ask for your opinion.

103
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,350
I will decide.

104
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,520
(Hang up, end of the call)

105
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,359
It seems like you're tired of it, for God's sake.

106
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Is that right?

107
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,250
Hi-so, hi-so.

108
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,930
No.

109
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,850
No.

110
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,189
Hi-so, no.

111
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,729
Untie him. Untie him. Untie him.

112
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,440
Hi-so, no, no.

113
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
What are you doing?

114
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,800
Why did you involve an innocent person in this mess?

115
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,820
Troublemaker.

116
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,870
Troublemaker.

117
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,500
Can he really wake up, huh?

118
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,240
Are you going like this?

119
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,910
Is it okay for a student to smoke?

120
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,080
Put out that cigarette.

121
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,670
Mr. Teacher.

122
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Yes?

123
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,510
Didn't you come to handcuff me?

124
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,430
Do you know what happened to Min Young?

125
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,890
I'm coming from the hospital.

126
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,430
I came to bring some things for her.

127
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,310
Do you want to sit in the girls' dormitory at this hour?

128
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,296
Because her family wants it, I'll go and come back soon.

129
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,490
Who is her family?

130
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,240
Min Young's sister.

131
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,660
Sister? - Yes.

132
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,660
It's really strange.

133
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,990
It's impossible.

134
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
When?

135
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,630
What?

136
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,500
When did Min Young ask you for such a request?

137
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Really?

138
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,130
Are you lying?

139
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,800
Lie? Why should I lie?

140
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,720
Hey, Jin is also Min Young's roommate.

141
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,940
If something is needed, I will tell her to bring it.

142
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,110
Hello, Jin.

143
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,860
No need.

144
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,450
Now that I think about it, it's too early.

145
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
I'll go get it tomorrow.

146
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Really?

147
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,910
Yes.

148
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,750
It's too early. You go.

149
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,390
Min Young.

150
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
Woke up.

151
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,929
Woke up.

152
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,310
Really woke up.

153
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,690
Thank you for really waking him up.

154
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,850
(sigh)

155
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,050
Thank you very much.

156
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,430
Thank you very, very much. Thank you very much.

157
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,520
How does it feel to see a miracle?

158
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,930
I won't kill her. I won't kill her. So please wake up Min Young too.

159
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,870
Do you think why I went through all this trouble for myself?

160
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,830
Wasn't it for me? Because you wanted to save me.

161
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,890
I want to use Miss Choi Soo Young.

162
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,090
You came here to die.

163
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,970
We need people like you.

164
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,740
Can I give you an antidote?

165
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:09,950
Instead, do you want to become one of us, the Cookies staff?

166
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,000
Spend less money.

167
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,070
Hey.

168
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,030
Wake up Min Young.

169
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,170
Otherwise, I'll kill her.

170
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,940
I'm in Jin's room now, Min Young.

171
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,870
If you want to kill her.

172
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,780
Then I'll kill your sister too.

173
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,040
You were sleeping in front of the lobby.

174
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,480
Did you know that the dormitory supervisor brought you here?

175
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:18,000
...You mean I was dreaming? Min Young.

176
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,730
I was worried about you.

177
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,410
What if you were sick?

178
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,230
Rest.

179
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,751
It takes time to fully recover.

180
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,930
Do you really want Choi Soo Young to work here?

181
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,820
How do you plan to bring her to school?

182
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,180
I have an idea.

183
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,380
Okay.

184
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:49,210
But even without it, she wanted to kill me.

185
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,940
I like her like this.

186
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,350
Damn you.

187
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,830
Think about it again.

188
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,280
I don't know the boy who ate the cookies.

189
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,490
I'm not sure, but there is a police officer that Choi Min Young called.

190
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:22,060
Isn't it reckless to just bring her here because you like her?

191
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,730
Aunt, is there something I don't know about?

192
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,950
I'm just worried. That's it. I'm sorry.

193
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,140
Don't worry.

194
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,120
...Nothing will happen. About the police too.

195
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,440
She has seen the confidential files and received the report, why hasn't she done anything yet?

196
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,460
Even Choi Min Young has been affected by this disaster.

197
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,260
Are you saying that Min Young lied about calling the police?

198
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,550
I don't know either.

199
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,530
But even if she did call, she must be something more than an ordinary police officer.

200
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,190
(Chief Oh)

201
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,740
(Chief Oh)

202
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Yes, Mr. Chief.

203
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,490
Okay, I read the files you sent.

204
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,540
I see. But is that all you got from it?

205
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,350
If you're referring to the formula that we need to wait for, yes.

206
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,300
Aren't you in the laundry room? Well, we can send the kids inside.

207
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,940
We still don't have any information about Shaf.

208
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
Are you telling me to continue waiting?

209
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,780
If we take action now, Shaf will escape on his own.

210
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,100
Then we'll lose the formula as well.

211
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,710
Okay.

212
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,330
Gun Woo dear, he says to wait. I have to listen to him.

213
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,040
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Is the noise too loud, isn't it?

214
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,880
That Park Jae Young that you brought is playing with water now.

215
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,240
You have been there before yourself. Don't you remember?

216
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,660
Can I give you the antidote?

217
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,080
Maybe it's my fault that Min Young is like this now.

218
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,710
If I went to see her earlier.

219
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,770
Maybe I could have prevented this from happening.

220
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,610
Do you remember what happened in the laundry room?

221
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,310
Yes.

222
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,250
I remember we were in the laundry room. I also remember Cookie.

223
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,650
Forget everything.

224
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,570
What?

225
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,020
Don't interfere and pretend like nothing happened.

226
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
No.

227
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,190
I love Min Young. So how can I forget everything?

228
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,550
How can I not interfere?

229
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,410
How can I pretend like nothing happened?

230
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,900
Go.

231
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,650
Stop bothering me about the classes.

232
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
I'll still come back.

233
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll still come back.

234
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:18,410
By the way, Min Young asked me to pass a message to you.

235
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,480
The one who woke up, can you deliver a message to him?

236
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,800
Hey, Patty, didn't you know?

237
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,810
Didn't you know I'm that kind of person?

238
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,110
Until now, you were wasting your time, Skell.

239
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,770
I knew everything and I did this.

240
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,490
I knew you were living like this, and I did this.

241
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,330
From now on, live for yourself.

242
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,670
Don't tire yourself for no reason...tell them these things.

243
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,000
Say it with a bad tone.

244
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,230
Make them hate me, provoke them and make them angry.

245
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,040
You don't know anything either.

246
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,500
You don't know what I saw when I ate the cookie.

247
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,360
What my wish is.

248
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,410
You don't know anything.

249
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,380
So please wake up.

250
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,780
I'll tell you when you wake up.

251
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,360
When you wake up, curse me.

252
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,750
Tell me that I'm going overboard, tell me I'm being excessive.

253
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,820
Curse me as much as you want.

254
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,870
Have you been chatting?

255
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
...Why weren't you answering your phone? You know you haven't come to work in days.

256
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,500
...What's going on? Why are you packing up your belongings?

257
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,040
(Celebrating the selection of the school as one of the top hundred schools in the country for educational processes)

258
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,490
Wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

259
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,720
(Registering the school life)

260
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,050
Apparently, you haven't been feeling well these days.

261
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,720
What?

262
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,930
In the mock exam, you answered some of the two-point questions wrongly.

263
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,850
You also sleep in the middle of the class.

264
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,970
What's the matter? You used to be good before.

265
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,650
...Never mind.

266
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,970
Is it because of Choi Min-young?

267
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,430
I'm sorry.

268
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,350
You don't need to apologize.

269
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,290
This grade is yours, your future is yours.

270
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,210
Yes.

271
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,070
Now that it has been mentioned...

272
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,700
Are you in contact with Min-young's sister?

273
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,610
How?

274
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,940
I had to sign some papers.

275
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,220
I called her several times, but she didn't answer.

276
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,290
The nurse in the ward didn't have any information about her either.

277
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,830
Nobody was home. She has also resigned from her job.

278
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,190
I haven't been able to contact her for a few days either.

279
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,200
I don't know what happened.

280
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,686
(Sunday) (7:19 PM) \NWhy aren't you answering?\N Nuna, please answer the phone.\N Is everything okay now?

281
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,630
Connecting... Nuna So-young.

282
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:05,160
The requested extension is not available on the network. Please verify the number before calling again.

283
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,970
(Lee On-soo)

284
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,980
(Lee On-soo)

285
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,890
What? Did you get transferred in your final year?

286
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,480
Special order from the Chief Executive Officer.

287
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,580
His parents are among the top entrepreneurs in the United States.

288
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,490
They place a great importance on education, so they want to contribute financially to the assembly.

289
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,500
Anyway, according to the school rules, he has to go to class F.

290
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,480
You, as the class teacher, should take care of him.

291
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,510
Be mindful that he reaches out to others on his own.

292
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,880
Okay, I'll do my best.

293
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,890
I hope his grades are good so that no one can protest.

294
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,440
He comes from a reputable high school in America. He must be good.

295
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,740
Well then, let's go to the morning meeting.
