2
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:13,590
I want to turn myself in.

3
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,430
I killed someone.

4
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,510
Choi Min-young.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,479
I'm gonna kill him.

6
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,190
Record.

7
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,440
Ho-su.

8
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,150
Ho-su.

9
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,540
Are you in school?

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,460
No, I actually saw you
come in with your clothes on.

11
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,890
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

12
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,420
No.

13
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,549
Fuck, are you crazy?

14
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,970
Stop, don't get closer.

15
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,010
Don't provoke her. She's gone crazy.

16
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,389
Don't do that. Put the knife down.

17
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,219
The old man has no
intention of fighting you.

18
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,020
He is just scared.

19
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,060
The accomplice who
turned Min-young into that?

20
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,440
Yeah, yeah.

21
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,029
It was him who turned
Choi Min-young into that.

22
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,530
Not me, it's him, him.

23
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,200
Auntie.

24
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,620
You know the number of the chef?

25
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,040
Call him over.

26
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,080
Right now.

27
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,090
Chef?

28
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,799
You think he'll come if we call him?

29
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,920
I haven't seen it once either.

30
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,890
If he doesn't, you're dead.

31
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,889
No, no, no.

32
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,140
OK.

33
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,200
Knife, please, please, fuck, please.

34
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,210
Chef.
Answer it.

35
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,170
Chef.

36
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,340
Chef.
Nice to meet you, Choi Soo-young.

37
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,430
Come here as soon as you hear it. No.

38
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,720
Come here.

39
00:04:06,721 --> 00:04:09,219
Chef, you can't leave me alone.

40
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,850
She's gonna stab me. She's gonna stab me.

41
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,270
I'm really gonna kill her.

42
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,900
22.

43
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,650
Chef.
Do you want to be a murderer at your age?

44
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,240
I feel even worse.

45
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,200
But unfortunately, I have no
intention of meeting you. Chef.

46
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,120
Chef.

47
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,330
Chef.

48
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,830
Chef..

49
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,645
Think about it.

50
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:35,975
Chef.

51
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,709
Even if you kill the hostage.

52
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,840
Can you beat the man in front of you?

53
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,090
Even if you win.

54
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,630
Would it be the best ending?

55
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,900
It's quite a pleasure to
really stab him, isn't it?

56
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,240
At least it's revenge.

57
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,990
Before I die.

58
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,950
Is this the best way to die?

59
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,000
What's the best way then?

60
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,669
I was the one who believed
that Min-Young would wake up

61
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,800
and live like a crazy person?

62
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,050
Like I've always lived.

63
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,170
No.

64
00:05:25,171 --> 00:05:27,555
Chef.

65
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,640
What if I said there's an
antidote to wake up Choi Min-young?

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:33,970
What?

67
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:35,680
Couldn't that be the best way?

68
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:38,560
Chef.

69
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,070
You mean detoxify her?

70
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,780
Like I said, I can get
Choi Min-young to wake up.

71
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,790
You think I'm gonna believe that?

72
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,750
Of course no.

73
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,170
Before I see it.

74
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,880
Can you give me a piece of cookies?

75
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,090
I will give this auntie some.

76
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,710
Can you get her out now?

77
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,510
No.

78
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:09,759
I could die this way.

79
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,220
No, no.

80
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,390
See?

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,890
Your own staff doesn't believe it.

82
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,229
Who are you lying?

83
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,690
I'll prove you.
Chef.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,070
Use your cell phone to identify the item.

85
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,400
And get it.

86
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,980
Chef.

87
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,650
You don't really want to use
me as a test subject, do you?

88
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,900
Chef.
Right?

89
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,570
Hello?

90
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,740
Hey.

91
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,870
Hey.

92
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
Fuck you son of bitch.

93
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,209
You just don't take me seriously, do you?

94
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,919
You're treating me casually

95
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,379
cause I don't know who
you really are, aren't you?

96
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,540
Fuck.

97
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,000
Quiet.

98
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,420
The subject is changing.

99
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,575
Chef.

100
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,680
There's an intruder.

101
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,509
Who said it.

102
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,640
Don't try anything. It won't work.

103
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,430
Not asking for your opinion.

104
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,350
It's on me.

105
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,520
(Chef, end of call.)

106
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,359
Looks like he's given up on you.

107
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Right?

108
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,250
Ho-su, Ho-su.

109
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,930
No.

110
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,850
No.

111
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,189
Ho-su, no.

112
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,729
Spit it out. Spit it out. Spit it out.

113
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,440
Ho-su, no, no.

114
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,680
What is it now?

115
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,800
Why involve people who
have nothing to do with it?

116
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,820
Uncle.

117
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,870
Uncle.

118
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,500
It's really going to wake him up, isn't it?

119
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,240
Are you gonna go?

120
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,910
Can students smoke?

121
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,080
Put that cigarette out.

122
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,670
Teacher.

123
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Yeah.

124
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,510
Weren't you coming to get me?

125
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,430
You heard about Min-young, right?

126
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,890
我刚从医院回来

127
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,430
I'm gonna come over and
pack some stuff for her.

128
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,310
So you're going to enter the
girls' dormitory at this hour?

129
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,296
Since it's a family request,
I'll go in and get it right away.

130
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,490
Who's the family?

131
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,240
Min-young's sister.

132
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:04,660
-Sister? -Yeah.

133
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,660
So weird.

134
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,990
No way.

135
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,460
When?

136
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,630
What?

137
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,500
When did Min-young ask you to do this?

138
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Maybe

139
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,130
are you lying?

140
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,800
What do you mean, lying?

141
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,720
Hee-jin is Min-young's roommate.

142
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,940
If there's anything to take,
I'll have her take it down.

143
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,110
Hello, Hee-jin.

144
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,860
Never mind.

145
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,450
Well, on second thought, it's pretty late.

146
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
I can get it from the resident
tomorrow during the day.

147
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,370
Yeah?

148
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,910
Yeah.

149
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,750
It's late, get inside.

150
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,390
Min-young.

151
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
He's awake.

152
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,929
He woke up.

153
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,310
He really woke up.

154
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,690
The chef really woke him up.

155
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,850
Chef.

156
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,050
Chef, thank you.

157
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,430
Thank you very much. I
can't thank you enough.

158
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,520
How does it feel to see a miracle?

159
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,930
I won't kill her. I won't kill
her. Please let Min-young wake up too.

160
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,870
Why do you think I'm going
through all this trouble?

161
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,830
It's all because of me, isn't it,
chef? Because you had to save me.

162
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,890
I see a use for Choi Soo-young.

163
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,090
You came here with the intention of dying.

164
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,970
We need people like you.

165
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,740
I can give you the antidote.

166
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:09,950
But would you like to be
an employee of High Cookie?

167
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't be funny.

168
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,070
Hey.

169
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,030
Wake Min-young up.

170
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,170
Or I will kill her.

171
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,940
I'm in Choi Min-young's room right now.

172
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,870
Kill her if you want.

173
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,780
Then I will kill your sister.

174
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,040
You were sleeping in the first floor lobby.

175
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,480
The dormitory manager
carried you back, you know?

176
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:18,000
Was it a dream? There was Min-young...

177
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,730
I was worried.

178
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,410
Worried if you're very sick.

179
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,230
Keep lying down.

180
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,751
It's going to take some time if
you're going to make a full recovery.

181
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,930
Do you really want Choi
Soo-young to be an employee?

182
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,820
Are you going to let
her work at the school?

183
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,180
I've figured out a way to do it.

184
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,380
OK.

185
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:49,210
Yeah, well, she just tried to kill me.

186
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,940
Chef.
I like that about her.

187
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,350
Fuck.

188
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,830
Chef, why don't you weigh in on this one?

189
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,280
Although had cookies today.

190
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,490
Not sure yet, but there's still
the police Choi Min Young called.

191
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:22,060
Isn't it a bit reckless to put her
to work just because you are happy?

192
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,730
Auntie, if you know something,
how can I not know it?

193
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,720
Chef.

194
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,950
I'm just worried, that's all. I'm sorry.

195
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,140
Don't worry.

196
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,120
There won't be anything,
about the Interpol... Chef.

197
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,440
He got a call and didn't move
even when he saw the secret files.

198
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,460
Even Choi Min-young looks like that.

199
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,260
Are you saying she's lying
about calling the police?

200
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,550
Chef.
I don't know that.

201
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,530
But if she do call the police,
he won't be just any police.

202
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,190
Director Huh.

203
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,740
Director Huh.

204
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
Hello, Director.

205
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:31,490
Yeah, I read the file you sent me.

206
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,540
That's it? That's all?

207
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,350
If you want the formula,
you'll have to wait.

208
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,300
It's in the laundry room, isn't
it? Just send someone to break in.

209
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,940
But we have so little information
about the chef right now.

210
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
Do I have to wait?

211
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,780
The chef's gonna sneak off on his own.

212
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,100
That formula is even more hopeless.

213
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,710
OK.

214
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,330
Geon-woo told me to wait, so I'll wait.

215
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,040
Sorry, sorry, it was so loud right?

216
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,880
Officer Park Jae-young you
caught, is playing with water.

217
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,240
You've been there
before. Don't you remember?

218
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,660
I can give you the antidote.

219
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:38,080
It's probably all my fault
that Min-Young is like this.

220
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,710
If I see it soon enough.

221
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,770
Maybe we can stop this from happening.

222
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,610
Do you remember that
day in the laundry room?

223
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,310
Yes.

224
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,250
I remember me and you in the
laundry room. I remember Cookie.

225
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,650
Forget it.

226
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,570
What?

227
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,020
Don't get involved in anything you don't want to be
involved in, and you'll pretend that nothing happened.

228
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
No.

229
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,190
I like Min-young. How can I forget?

230
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,550
How can I stay out of it?

231
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:29,410
How can I pretend it didn't happen?

232
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,900
Just go.

233
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,650
Don't skip class next time.

234
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,740
I'll come next time.

235
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll come again.

236
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:18,410
By the way, Min-young asked
me to give you a message.

237
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,480
If my sister wakes up,
can you give me a message?

238
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,800
You don't know, do you, bitch?

239
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,810
You didn't know I was this
kind of person, did you?'

240
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,110
You've been wasting your
time so far, you psychopath.

241
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,770
I know it all.

242
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,490
I know how you live and I still do.

243
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,330
So start living your life now.

244
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,670
Don't waste your efforts.

245
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,000
To be particularly vicious.

246
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,230
To make her hate me, to make
her feel aggrieved and angry.

247
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,040
You don't know anything.

248
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,500
What I saw when I ate the cookies.

249
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,360
What's my dream.

250
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,410
You don't know anything.

251
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,380
So please wake up.

252
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,780
I'll tell you when you wake up.

253
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,360
When you wake up, curse in front of me.

254
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,750
Call me brazen, call me over the top.

255
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,820
You can curse as much as you want.

256
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:25,870
What's wrong with you?

257
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,360
Why don't you answer your phone? It's been
a couple days since you've been at work...

258
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,500
What's going on? Why are
you packing your bags...

259
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,740
More Dramas and Movies With
Multi-language Subs -' ALL IN HiTV

260
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,040
Celebrating the selection of our school as one of the
top 100 schools in the nation for educational processes.

261
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,490
Wait, sorry, sorry.

262
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,720
School Life Record Book

263
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,050
I see you've been in a bad way lately.

264
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,720
Sorry?

265
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,930
On the private practice test the other day,
you got a lot of 2-point questions wrong.

266
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,850
Sleeping during class.

267
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,970
What's the matter with you?
You've been doing so well.

268
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:53,650
Ugh…

269
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,970
Is it because of Choi Min-young?

270
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,430
Sorry.

271
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,350
There's no need to apologize to me.

272
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,290
This is your grade. This is your future.

273
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,210
Yeah.

274
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,070
Since we are talking about this.

275
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,700
Can you get in touch with Min-young?

276
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,610
What's wrong?

277
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,940
There's a lot of paperwork on Min-young.

278
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,220
I've called her many
times, but she won't pick up.

279
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,290
The nurse in the ward
didn't know anything about it.

280
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,830
There's no one at home, and
the company's out of business.

281
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:46,190
I haven't contacted my sister
for a few days in a row either.

282
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,200
I don't know what happened.

283
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,686
(Saturday) 7:19PM
Why can't I reach you?
Sister, pick up the phone.
Nothing's really wrong, right?

284
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,630
On the line... Sister Soo-young.

285
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:05,160
The number you have dialed is not
available. Please confirm before dialing.

286
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,970
Lee Eun-seo.

287
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,980
Lee Eun-seo.

288
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,890
What? She's in third grade transferring?

289
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,480
It's a special order from
the chairman of the board.

290
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,580
Her parents are among the top
entrepreneurs in the United States.

291
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,490
They're always concerned about education, and
he's planning to donate to the Consortium.

292
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,500
Anyway, according to school
rules, she's first in F class.

293
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,480
Supervisor should arrange it well.

294
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:40,510
Take care of her and get her up to speed.

295
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,880
OK, I'll try.

296
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:45,890
I hope she gets good
grades so no one can talk.

297
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,440
She's a transfer from a prestigious
American high school. She can't be bad.

298
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,740
Dismissed. Let's go to the morning meeting.
