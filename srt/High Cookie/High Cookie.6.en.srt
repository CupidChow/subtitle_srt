00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,860
How could your sister be
at school? What's going on?

6
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,820
How could she faint again?

7
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,820
Sorry for calling you during class time.

8
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,780
Don't say that. What do you need me to do?

9
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,910
Can you take my sister to the hospital?

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,821
Either the school hospital
or any other hospital will do.

11
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,330
Take her to the emergency room.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
Got it.

13
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,250
You must stay by her side.

14
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,736
After you arrive, send me a
message telling me where you are.

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
What about you?

16
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,340
Aren't you going together?

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,640
I'll explain to you later, please.

18
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,970
Also, after my sister wakes up,

19
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,730
Can you help me convey a message to her?

20
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,990
Not the cafeteria, the laundry room.

21
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,950
What?

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,660
Places where cookies circulate.

23
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,856
In addition to that, there are circulation
methods, customer lists, and employee lists.

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,629
And within my knowledge, all
the information about cookies.

25
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,960
I will send you the data.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,140
But can you resolve the
matter as soon as possible?

27
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,250
Do you have anything delicious?

28
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,050
Please hand me over to the
police as soon as possible.

29
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,310
I want to surrender.

30
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,990
In other words, if you contact
me and hand over the data to me.

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Let's move immediately,
that's what it means, right?

32
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,790
Yes.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
Come to the laundry room.

34
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,210
Can you do it?

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Hmm.

36
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,800
But why suddenly change your mind?

37
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,810
Weren't you saying you wanted to prove it?

38
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,930
Prove that you are a decent
adult and a capable police officer.

39
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,190
Did something happen?

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I'll tell you later.

41
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,530
Because after I get caught, I
will confess everything to you.

42
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,320
Now, let's pretend nothing
happened and go back to class.

43
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Okay.

44
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,240
We will make preparations in advance.

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Don't worry.

46
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,590
Teacher.

47
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,890
No, police officer.

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,310
I'm counting on you.

49
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,710
I wonder what mischief
Cui Minying will get into.

50
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,510
Aren't you also well aware?
This girl is extraordinary.

51
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,630
Things have come to this point.

52
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,550
Can we still work as if
nothing happened, as usual?

53
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,480
At this point, let's hurry
up and reopen the business.

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Ah...

55
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,400
Chef, are you not worried at all?

56
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Yes.

57
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,030
Not worried.

58
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,030
Then I will trust you, Chef.

59
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,370
For now, let Jiji get involved.

60
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,620
Uncle.

61
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,840
Uncle.

62
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,810
Teacher Yoo Seong-beop.

00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,130
Auntie will reopen today.

65
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,340
Self-introduction.

66
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,300
Not only for entrance exams,

67
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,340
but also for social interaction,

68
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,970
self-introduction is of utmost importance.

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560
Others know nothing about me,

70
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,270
unless I speak, they
can't understand me, right?

71
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,350
Therefore, this self-introduction

72
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,730
is the only way for people who
don't know me to understand me.

73
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,780
Alright, so what is important
when writing a self-introduction?

74
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
It's actually very simple.

75
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,460
No matter what, find a way to make
the other person believe in oneself.

76
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,250
In order to achieve one's desired goal.

77
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,540
It's very simple, isn't it?

78
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,760
So, when you write your
self-introduction here,

79
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,180
Does anyone really not have any falsehoods
and only write the true situation?

80
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Me.

81
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,890
Yes, I read your introduction,
Xi Zhen, it's very good.

82
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,870
It's just suitable as a negative
example for self-introductions.

83
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,730
So you mean we should
write deceiving content?

84
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,230
Of course.

85
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,640
Just say that the other
party knows nothing about you.

86
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,109
As long as I present a
trustworthy situation.

87
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,630
Then they can only believe what I say.

88
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,060
Is it necessary to tell the truth?

89
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,989
Is this something that the top domestic college
entrance examination consultant would say?

90
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,500
This is what the top domestic college
entrance examination consultant said.

91
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,460
Xizhen, your desires
don't seem that strong.

92
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,470
Class 92 might be a
bit challenging for you.

93
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,330
Wait a moment, wait a moment.

94
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,590
The admissions officer from
Seoul University is calling.

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,350
I need to answer the phone.
Can I go out for a while?

96
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,730
I was kidding you.

97
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,320
See, this is how you
write a self-introduction.

98
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,109
As long as it can make
the other person trust you.

99
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,530
You can brag as much as possible.

100
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,320
In order to achieve the goal.

101
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,120
Hello, Song Zhenyu.

102
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,500
Is this college consultant a freak?

103
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,400
Is it really scientifically
proven in the academic community?

104
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Don't talk to me.

105
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,730
I have sent all the information
I mentioned to you as attachments.

106
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,060
I'm going to the laundry room now.

107
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,770
Please call the police immediately.

108
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,980
Oh, okay, I got it.

109
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,170

Song Zhenyu is a new employee, although the reason for joining is unknown. However, he seems to use his grandfather's background as the chairman to provide the head chef with CCTV or other advanced intelligence. [Management and Distribution Methods] Production: Head Chef Operation and
Delivery: Aunt Business: Cui Minying Employee: Song Zhenyu The leader is called "Head Chef". All employees do not know his appearance, age, or name. The only person who directly answers the head chef's phone is Aunt, whose voice has been digitally altered. Aunt listens to his instructions.

112
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,180
Oh, Teacher Liu.

113
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,010
It seems like there's some good news.

114
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,930
Ah, yes, indeed.

115
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,770
That's why I said
self-introduction is important.

116
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,810
What?

117
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,440
-Self... -Self-introduction.

118
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,610
What is this about?

119
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
Is it reopening?

120
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Yes, it is.

121
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,300
It has been a long time of rest.

122
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,600
So we need to work hard, any problem?

123
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
Well, let's see how much we can achieve.

124
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,490
Although I don't know if I can still do it.

125
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,900
I called the police.

126
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,070
I also gave them all the
information I had on me.

127
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,910
Police, right?

128
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,490
The head chef, for sure,
will try everything to escape.

129
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,390
But, aunt, it's not the same for you.

130
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,240
If the police arrest you, do you think
they will take responsibility for you?

131
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,460
They definitely won't.

132
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
See, I told you.

133
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,090
You can't just sit and wait for death.

134
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,660
It feels very unfair, doesn't it?

135
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,550
If you feel wronged,

136
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:24,631
You should confess everything you know,
starting with the chef's phone number.

137
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,230
Who knows?

138
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,310
Maybe it will help reduce
your sentence a little.

139
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,650
Hello.

140
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,700
You should be arriving soon.

141
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,410
You can't escape now.

142
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,490
Absolutely no escape.

143
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,040
This is Uncle Jiji.

144
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,420
The pastry chef who made
cookies for our party.

145
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,360
Oh, how troublesome this is.

146
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,290
I didn't expect that the first
meeting would introduce us like this.

147
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,670
Although uncle is skilled at baking
cookies, he is not easy to communicate with.

148
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,090
If you want to survive,
just confess honestly.

149
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,540
Which police officer did
you give the information to?

150
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,530
It doesn't matter if you don't say.

151
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,350
It's easy to find out who it is.

152
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,440
Can you decipher it?

153
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,940
Aunt, you're finished now.

154
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,530
No.

155
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,780
Only you are finished.

156
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,350
And this is the return for you.

157
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Cui Minying.

158
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,970
14 13.

159
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,680

Dammit.

161
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,690
If you had listened to Dad,
wouldn't everything be fine?

162
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,730
Xiuying.

163
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,570
It seems like Minying
has stopped breathing.

164
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Cui Xiuying.

165
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,560
Immediately change into clean
clothes and come out for me.

166
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,620
What if the police come?

167
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,750
Talk to them nicely and ask them to leave.

168
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,550
As long as the police
come, it will all be over.

171
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,730
Oh, really?

172
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,490
-No, not at all. -What is it then?

173
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,500
Sis, sis

174
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,710
Are you feeling a bit better?

175
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,260
It's a hunter

176
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,800
A really outrageous hunter

177
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
I'm very troubled

178
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,480
This is outrageous

179
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,310
-This -Just wait a moment

180
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,060
Lie down for a while

181
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,310
Okay

182
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,270
Such a dream...

183
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,070
The patient, she's...

184
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,910
Minying

185
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Minying

186
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,079
I'm going to find Minying

187
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Minying

188
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,210
Give me a call, Minying

189
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,490
So it turns out I'm still dreaming

190
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,330
Still haven't woken up

191
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,770
Wait a moment, I'll come right away

192
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,810
Please prepare the defibrillator

193
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,950
This patient, please calm down a bit

194
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,540
Calm down a little, patient

195
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,870
- Patient - Patient

196
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,499
Patient

197
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,460
Patient, please calm down

198
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,340
Patient, please try to stay calm.

199
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,470
This is what I've heard.

200
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,640
An ambulance came yesterday.

201
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,410
Why did the ambulance suddenly come?

202
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,020
They said it was related to someone.

203
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,230
What's going on?

204
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,740
Did you also see that she
was taken away wearing a mask?

205
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,150
So what?

206
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,450
Xu Rujing.

207
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,080
Xu Rujing has also become like that.

208
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,740
Her body bent backwards.

209
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,926
She had a smiling face, just like the mask.

210
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,000
So what?

211
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,170
I was afraid you would be curious.

212
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Because

213
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,420
I feel like you like her.

214
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,970
What about me?

215
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,060
I just think it's fun, that's all.

216
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,400
Where did you go? Why just...

217
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,030
What's going on?

218
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,780
Did you cry?

219
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,750
Minying

220
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,590
In the hospital.

221
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,010
Is she dead?

222
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,860
What happened at the hospital?

223
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Did she have a sudden cardiac arrest
like Xu Rujing for no apparent reason?

224
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,860
Smiling, he folded his body back.

225
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,160
Are you saying there
is no medical diagnosis?

226
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,250
It's not study time now.

227
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,280
But who instructed you to come to school?

228
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,200
It must be a deception.

229
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,910
As far as I know, I am the
only one from the agency.

230
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,170
I know the so-called cookie person.

231
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,920
Hey, why did the drug testing institute
come here? Is there nothing else?

232
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,970
They even disguised their identity.

233
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,760
But it's very strange.

234
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,810
Fortunately, I had the
help of Kim Yoon Fan.

235
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,270
How did you know in advance
to come to this school?

236
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,510
You even resigned from your job.

237
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,760
Keeping it a secret from everyone.

238
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,570
Forget it.

239
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,950
Don't answer me.

240
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,910
Anyway, I

241
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,080
will find out everything.

242
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,670
Where are you going?

243
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,630
Cui Minying Hospital.

244
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,430
Let's go together.

245
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,720
I am also planning to go.

246
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,860
Daolin General Hospital.

247
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,990
Although the reason is unknown,

248
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,150
the displayed state is a coma.

249
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,280
With the continuous state, it
may become a vegetative state.

250
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,270
Or the probability of death
will become increasingly higher.

251
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,800
As soon as I heard the news,

252
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,970
I dropped everything and hurriedly came.

253
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,690
It seems like you feel quite guilty.

254
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,310
Even attempted suicide.

255
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
That's right.

256
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Actually, my sister's dream is death.

257
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,370
Can her mental state be normal?

258
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,290
Right?

259
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,540
Anyway, what should we do now?

260
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,300
There is no reason for this.

261
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,550
We will call the police.

262
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,390
But if that's the case,

263
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,866
If Ming Ying wakes up
by some stroke of luck,

264
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,770
Then she would be the
criminal, you understand?

265
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,860
However, we still have
to hold on to some hope.

266
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,320
Because who knows, maybe
one day she will wake up.

267
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,240
As a compensation for keeping silent,

268
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,580
I will send medical
expenses and living expenses.

269
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,580
How about that?

270
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,500
Use this money.

271
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,850
When my older sister also
experienced the life she had imagined.

272
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,900
Jung Han High School.

273
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,160
Daulim General Hospital. She agonized
for a long time, but she finally agreed.

274
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,240
In any case, fortunately, things were
handled more smoothly than I had imagined.

275
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,130
She is truly a foolish woman.

276
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,430
As previously mentioned.

277
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,010
Starting business today.

278
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,600
What do you mean by
insisting on giving me a ride?

279
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,310
So, I found information about
you, and now you're scared?

280
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,740
The meaning is since it's already
like this, let's get along well.

281
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,030
But you didn't answer my question, right?

282
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,910
Go ahead and ask, I'll answer everything.

283
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,240
What do you have there?

284
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,230
The information sent by Cui Minying.

285
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,080
I don't understand what you're saying.

286
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,460
She is not an ordinary person.

287
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,380
Full of energy.

288
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,420
I gave you the
information, you should know.

289
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
She called me.

290
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,470
You are the new school
police officer, right?

291
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,470
Don't worry! It's absolutely confidential.
School Police Officer
Park Zai Xian
Campus Violence Hotline

292
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Yes.

293
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,800
There is a new type of drug circulating
in the school, shaped like cookies.

294
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,930
I am selling it.

295
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,230
I have already informed the
police hidden in the school.

296
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,360
Please verify with multiple sources.

297
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,650
In any case,

298
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,350
I have already sent all the
information to the other party.

299
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,740
Tell me, what is it

300
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,330
That you're looking for?

301
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,410
Please speak up

302
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,810
When you don't answer anything, what's the
point of saying we should get along well?

303
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,170
What about you, senior?

304
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,750
Why do you want to investigate this case?

305
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,570
Are you still going to do it alone?

306
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,300
I'm the same as you

307
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,340
Let's first do our best to find the
distribution channel for the cookies

308
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,380
Catch them

309
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,550
Obtain the recipe

310
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,430
Then quit this job as a police officer

311
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,060
And go make big money

312
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,860
Hello, since that's
the case, let's break up.

313
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Let's stop fighting between us.

314
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,706
It's not good to monopolize everything
by oneself, as it can cause choking.

315
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,990
Send me the information first.

316
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,399
Then, let's find the formula together.

317
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,440
As the elder brother, I
will take care of the rest.

318
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,250
In short, Choi Min-young
really has bad luck.

319
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,870
How come he always encounters
police officers like us?

320
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,170
Isn't that right?

321
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,800
Hold on, if we continue like this...

322
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,260
If Cuimineng wakes up, aren't we done?

323
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,180
Don't talk in the car.

324
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,970
At that time, it was true.

325
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,940
I really liked Cuimineng.

326
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,820
How fun it is.

327
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,820
Full of vitality, take
everything seriously.

328
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,630
Sometimes I like to joke around.

329
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,870
Zhenyu.

330
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,260
At least today, can you not joke around?

331
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,590
You can hit me.

332
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,640
But don't joke about Cuimineng's affair.

333
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,270
Please do me a favor.

334
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,590
Thank you.

335
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,670
Cui Minying.

336
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,730
Is it not baked yet? How long does it take?

337
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,150
My older sister can come
home and have a good sleep now.

338
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,660
I'm not alone.

339
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,290
Is anyone inside?

340
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,670
Is it this one?

341
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,720
I followed the agreement.

342
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:42,190
More Dramas and Movies With
Multi-language Subs - ALL IN HiTV.

343
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,100
I didn't go to the police.

344
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,270
It wasn't us, really.

345
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,780
Minying wants to commit suicide.

346
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
It's true.

347
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,620
Why do you want to call the police?

348
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,660
I should be the one to kill.

349
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,040
Voice memo.

350
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,510
I surrender.

351
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,590
Today, I'm going to kill someone.

352
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,600
No, it's not, it's not.

353
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,350
What are you doing? I said it's not.

354
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,580
I will definitely...

355
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,500
Kill that person.
