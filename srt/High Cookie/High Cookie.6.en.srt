3
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,536
The places, characters, organizations, and events in this play are fictional and have no connection to reality.

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,860
What does your sister do at school? What happened?

5
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,820
Why did she cheat?

6
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,820
I'm sorry I called you during class.

7
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,780
What a mess... what should I do now?

8
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,910
Can you take my sister to the hospital?

9
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,821
It doesn't matter if it's the school infirmary or other hospitals.

10
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,330
Take her to the emergency room.

11
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,460
Okay.

12
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,250
Make sure to stay by her side.

13
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,736
Let me know where you are when you arrive.

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
What about you?

15
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,340
Aren't you coming with us?

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,640
I'll explain everything later. I beg you.

17
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:22,970
And also, my sister regained consciousness.

18
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,730
Can you give her a message?

19
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,990
It's not a cafÃ©, it's the laundry room.

20
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,950
What?

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,660
It's where the cookies are made.

22
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,856
In addition, information about the baking method, customer list, and staff list.

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,629
And everything I know about the cookies.

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,960
I'll send it to you.

25
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,140
Instead, can you take care of something sooner?

26
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,250
What kind of thing?

27
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,050
Please hand me over to the police.

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,310
I want to surrender myself.

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,990
Then give me the information and contact me.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Does that mean I have to report to the police?

31
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,790
Yes.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,120
We need to go to the laundry room.

33
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,210
Can you?

34
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Yes.

35
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,800
But why did you suddenly change your mind?

36
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,810
Didn't you say you wanted to prove it to me?

37
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,930
That there are still honest people and capable police officers.

38
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,190
Did something happen?

39
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I'll tell you later.

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,530
After I'm arrested, I'll tell you everything.

41
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,320
For now, let's pretend nothing happened.

42
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Okay.

43
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,240
We'll prepare everything in advance.

44
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
So don't worry.

45
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,590
Teacher.

46
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:25,890
No, officer.

47
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:29,310
I trust you.

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,710
We don't know what Choi Min Young is up to.

49
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,510
You know she's not an ordinary girl.

50
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,630
After these incidents,

51
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,550
Can we pretend nothing happened and continue our work?

52
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,480
For now, let's start our work again.

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
...Ah.

54
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,400
Well, you're not worried at all?

55
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,820
No.

56
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,030
I'm not.

57
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,030
So I trust you.

58
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,370
Call Jake Jake.

59
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,620
Ayoga.

60
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,840
Ayoga.

61
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,810

63
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,130
We are starting our work again today.

64
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,340
Self-introduction.

65
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,300
Not just for the college entrance exam,

66
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,340
But also for social interactions.

67
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,970
Self-introduction is very important.

68
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560
Others don't know me.

69
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,270
So until I tell them, they can't know me, right?

70
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,350
Therefore, self-introduction

71
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,730
Is the only way for those who don't know me to recognize me.

72
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,780
So, when writing a self-introduction, what should I pay attention to?

73
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
It's very simple.

74
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,460
Find a way to gain the trust of others somehow.

75
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,250
So that you can achieve the goal you want.

76
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,540
It's very simple, isn't it?

77
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,760
So, when writing a self-introduction,

78
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,180
Is there someone who only speaks the truth and doesn't lie?

79
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Me.

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,890
Yes, I read your self-introduction. It was really good.

81
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,870
A prime example of a terrible self-introduction.

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,730
Are you saying that we should deceive others?

83
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,230
Obviously.

84
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,640
They don't know me at all.

85
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,109
Only if I gain their trust

86
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,630
They'll believe everything I say.

87
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,060
So why should I tell the truth?

88
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,989
Is this the exact advice that should come from a top college consultant?

89
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,500
This is exactly the advice that should come from a top college consultant.

90
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,460
Hey, Ji Jin, seems like you're not aiming high.

91
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,470
Special class must be really hard for you.

92
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,330
Wait a moment. Wait.

93
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,590
The admissions officer from Seoul University is calling.

94
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,350
I need to answer. Can I go outside?

95
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,730
I was joking.

96
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,320
See? This is how you should write a self-introduction.

97
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,109
Do whatever it takes to gain the trust of others.

98
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,530
You can boast as much as you want

99
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,320
Until you achieve your goal.

100
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,120
Hey, Sung Jin Woo.

101
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,500
Didn't the counselor approve it?

102
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,400
Did they confirm it scientifically at all?

103
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Don't talk to me.

104
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,730
I sent the information I mentioned.

105
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,060
I'm going to the laundry room.

106
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,770
Please call the police right now.

107
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,980
Okay. I understood.

108
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,170
Choi Min Young \N Cookie Business Policy

109
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Cookie's high performance \N only enhances concentration, learning efficiency, and improvement with one gas. If half of it is eaten, it gives a feeling of happiness. If all of it is eaten, it fulfills wishes. As soon as you eat this cookie, all wishes become possible.

110
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Sung Jin Woo has recently joined us. The reason for his coming is not clear. But it seems like he uses his grandfather's name as a chairman to provide us with CCTV and other information \N Producer: Shaf \N Delivery: Aunt \N Trade: Choi Min Young \N Employee: Sung Jin Woo \N A person named "Shaf" is our leader. No one knows what he looks like or how old he is or what his name is. The only person who talks to him directly on the phone is Aunt. He changes his voice in phone calls.

111
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,180
Mr. Yu

112
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,010
They must have given you good news for sure.

113
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,930
Oh, yes.

114
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,770
That's why I said self-introduction is very important.

115
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,810
What?

116
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,440
... Self- \N Self-introduction-

117
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,610
What is it saying?

118
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,040
Shall we start again?

119
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Yes.

120
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,300
We rested a lot.

121
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,600
That's why we have to work hard. Is there a problem?

122
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,160
Let's see how far we can go.

123
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,490
I don't know if I can or not.

124
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,900
I called the police.

125
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,070
I also gave them all the information I had.

126
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,910
The police?

127
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,490
That substitute Shaf is definitely trying to get in.

128
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,390
But Aunt, you can't.

129
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,240
Do you think if the police arrest you, they will help you?

130
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,460
No.

131
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
See? I told you.

132
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,090
You're not the kind of person who does nothing.

133
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,660
It's unfair, isn't it?

134
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,550
If you think you have been treated unfairly.

135
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:24,631
Then confess everything. Start with the Shaf's phone number.

136
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,230
How do you know?

137
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,310
Maybe wisdom has lightened.

138
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,650
Hey.

139
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,700
They are about to arrive now.

140
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,410
You can't go in.

141
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,490
No way.

142
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,040
This is Uncle Jake Jake.

143
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,420
Same Shaf who makes cookies for our party.

144
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,360
Oh, what are you going to do now?

145
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,290
I didn't expect our first meeting to be like this.

146
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,670
Yes, Uncle makes really good cookies, but he's not very friendly.

147
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,090
If you want to stay alive, speak up.

148
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,540
Which police officer did you give the information to?

149
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,530
If you don't tell me, it doesn't matter.

150
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,350
They can easily find him.

151
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,440
Do you know the code?

152
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,940
Aunt, your game is over.

153
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,530
No.

154
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,780
Your game is over.

155
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,350
This is the price of your betrayal.

156
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
Choi Min Young

157
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,970
Fourteen, thirteen.

158
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,680
Twelve.

159
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,770
Damn it.

160
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,690
If you had listened to Baba's words, wouldn't it have been better?

161
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,730
So Young

162
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,570
Min Young can't breathe.

163
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
Choi So Young

164
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,560
Put on clean clothes and come.

165
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,620
If the police come.

166
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,750
Send them on their way with a pleasant tongue.

167
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,550
When the police come, everything will be over.

168
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,490
119 Emergency Response Team.

169
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,400
My heart is in my mouth.

170
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,730
Seriously?

171
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,490
No, not at all- \N Then what is it?-

172
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,500
Nuna, Nuna \N (Older sister for boys)

173
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,710
Are you feeling better?

174
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,260
It was a hunter.

175
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,800
A hunter beyond imagination.

176
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,680
It was a dream of a dog.

177
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,480
Doesn't make sense with reason.

178
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,310
...This- \N Wait a minute-

179
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,060
Just take a rest for now.

180
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,310
It's okay.

181
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,270
...It was just a dream.

182
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,070
...That patient, him.

183
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,910
Min Young.

184
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Min Young.

185
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,079
I need to go look for Min Young.

186
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Min Young.

187
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,210
I need to call him.

188
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,490
So I'm still dreaming.

189
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,330
I haven't woken up yet.

190
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,770
One moment. I'll be right there.

191
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,810
Bring the electric shock.

192
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,950
Ma'am, please calm down.

193
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,540
Ma'am, please calm down.

194
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,870
Miss- \N Miss-

195
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,499
Miss.

196
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,460
Miss, please calm down.

197
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:36,340
Miss, please calm down.

198
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,470
That's what I heard.

199
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,640
An ambulance came yesterday.

200
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,410
Why did the ambulance come?

201
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,020
It came for someone.

202
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,230
What's the matter?

203
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,740
You saw the masked girl, didn't you?

204
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,150
Well, what happened?

205
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,450
So Yoo-jeong.

206
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,080
She had the same thing happen to her.

207
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,740
Her body bent backwards.

208
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,926
She was laughing, just like the masked girl.

209
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, what happened?

210
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,170
I thought you might be curious.

211
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It seemed like it.

212
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,420
You like the masked girl.

213
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,970
Me?

214
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,060
It's just for fun for me.

215
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,400
...Why did you come now?

216
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,030
What happened?

217
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,780
Did you cry?

218
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,750
...Min Young.

219
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,590
...You're at the hospital.

220
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,010
Is she dead?

221
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,860
What happened at the hospital?

222
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Did she have a sudden heart attack like So Yoo-jeong?

223
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,860
Was she smiling and her body bent?

224
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,160
They haven't determined the cause yet.

225
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,250
The study session hasn't finished yet.

226
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,280
Who sent you here?

227
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,200
You lied, didn't you?

228
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,910
Only I knew about it.

229
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,170
I'm calling her Cookie.

230
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,920
Because the drug detective has another reason to come here?

231
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,970
You even forged your identity.

232
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,760
But it's a bit strange.

233
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,810
I learned about the case from Kim Yoon-bum.

234
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,270
But how did you find out and come here?

235
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,510
You even resigned.

236
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,760
And kept it a secret from everyone.

237
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,570
Forget it.

238
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,950
You don't want to tell me.

239
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,910
Because I know the whole story.

240
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,080
I'll open the door.

241
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,670
Where are you going?

242
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,630
Choi Min-young Hospital.

243
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,430
So let's go together.

244
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,720
I myself wanted to go there.

245
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,860
(Doluem State Hospital)

246
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,990
The cause is unknown.

247
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,150
But for now, you're a suspect.

248
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:32,280
Depending on the condition, it could end up in a vegetative state.

249
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,270
There's a possibility of death too.

250
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,800
Just hearing the news made me give up everything and come here.

251
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,970
She must have had a guilty conscience.

252
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,690
That's why she tried to commit suicide.

253
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,310
She has the right, of course.

254
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
She just found out that her sister has always wished to die.

255
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,990
Do you think her spirit won't be affected?

256
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,370
Huh?

257
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,290
But what are you going to do now?

258
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,540
You don't have any reason to work anymore.

259
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,300
Are you reporting us to the police?

260
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,550
But like this?

261
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,390
If Min-young wakes up even a little bit.

262
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,866
Then she becomes the criminal, you know?

263
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,770
But you shouldn't lose hope.

264
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,860
Because maybe one day, she'll wake up.

265
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,320
As compensation for your silence.

266
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,240
We'll cover the hospital expenses and your life.

267
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,580
How about that?

268
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,580
With that money.

269
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,500
Build the life you've always wanted.

270
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,850
(Jung Han High School)

271
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:28,900
She hesitated a bit, but in the end, she agreed.

272
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,160
Thank God, everything turned out faster than I expected.

273
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,240
She's really foolish.

274
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:52,130
Just like you said.

275
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,430
We're starting work again from today.

276
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,010
Why did you suddenly want to bring me here?

277
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,600
What is it? Are you scared because I understood everything?

278
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,310
Anyway, what happened is an accident. Let's face it together.

279
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,740
But you didn't answer my question.

280
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,030
So now ask it. I'll answer everything.

281
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,910
Choi Min-young, what information has she given you?

282
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

283
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:22,230
She's not an ordinary girl.

284
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,080
She has a limp.

285
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,460
Since she gave you information, you must know too.

286
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,380
She called me herself.

287
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,420
Are you a police officer who just arrived?

288
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,460
Don't worry! Report it confidentially. \N School Police Officer \N Park Jae-hyun.

289
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,470
Yes.

290
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:37,470
There's a new type of drug in the form of cookies circulating in the school.

291
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,720
And I'm selling it.

292
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,800
I informed the undercover police in the school in advance.

293
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,930
Please bring the evidence.

294
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,230
Anyway.

295
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,360
I sent all the information to that person.

296
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,650
Tell me, let's see.

297
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,350
What are you looking for?

298
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,740
You should know what you're talking about.

299
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,330
I'm after you, aren't I?

300
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,410
Tell me already.

301
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,810
You're not answering my question, so why are you suggesting that we work together?

302
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,170
What about yourself?

303
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,750
Why are you investigating this case?

304
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,570
What are you doing on your own?

305
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,300
I am like you too.

306
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,340
I want to find the distribution channel for the cookies.

307
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,380
I will catch them.

308
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,550
I will get the recipe.

309
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,430
And then resign from my job.

310
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,060
And make money.

311
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,860
Hey, what do you think about working together?

312
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Why argue with each other for no reason?

313
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,706
If we eat everything on our own, it will get stuck in our throats.

314
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,990
So give me that information too.

315
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,399
Then we'll find the recipe together.

316
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,440
As your senior, I will take care of the rest.

317
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,250
But Choi Min-young doesn't stand a chance, does he?

318
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,870
Why do police officers like us always end up in their positions?

319
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,170
Isn't that right?

320
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,800
...Wait. It's like this.

321
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,260
If Choi Min-young wakes up, won't our job become difficult?

322
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:06,180
You shouldn't talk too much in the car.

323
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,970
That's the truth.

324
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,940
I really like Choi Min-young.

325
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,820
It's interesting, though.

326
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,820
He is funny and very hardworking.

327
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,630
He has a good sense of humor.

328
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:12,870
Jin-woo.

329
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,260
Can you not joke around today?

330
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,590
You can punch me.

331
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,640
But can you not make jokes about Min-young?

332
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,270
Please.

333
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,590
Thank you.

334
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,670
Choi Min-young.

335
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,730
How long until it's fully cooked?

336
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,150
She can definitely go home today and get a good sleep.

337
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,660
You're not alone.

338
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,290
Is someone there?

339
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,670
Was that it?

340
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,720
I acted as I said.

341
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,100
I didn't go to the police.

342
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,270
It really wasn't our job.

343
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,780
Min-young wanted to commit suicide.

344
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,360
I'm telling the truth.

345
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,620
Why should I report it to the police?

346
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,660
I can kill you myself.

347
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:56,040
Voice note.

348
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,510
I want to surrender myself.

349
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,590
Today, I want to kill someone.

350
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,600
Hey, it wasn't our job. It wasn't our job.

351
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,350
What are you doing? I said it wasn't me.

352
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,580
Definitely.

353
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,500
I will kill him.
