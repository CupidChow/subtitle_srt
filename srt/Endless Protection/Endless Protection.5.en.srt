1
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,239
You must have suffered
these past two years.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,520
Now that you're out, just relax a bit.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,520
Come on.

4
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,359
Have a drink with me.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,359
I don't drink.

6
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,039
I want to take my brother back.

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,799
Take him home?

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,719
I'll raise him.

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
Not Lu Guangfu.

10
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,880
Lu Guangfu is your father.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,719
He is not my father.

12
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,759
You were in prison for two years.

13
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,399
I took care of your brother.

14
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,680
We've developed a bond.

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,480
Letting him go

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
makes me sad.

17
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:11,560
But it's okay. He's your brother.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,560
Take him if you want to.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,280
Any time is fine.

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:16,879
I don't know if this is good

21
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,120
or bad for your brother.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
Anyway,

23
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,000
I can earn money.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,480
I must not let my brother be like me.

25
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:56,612
=Endless Protection=

26
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:00,036
=Episode 5=

27
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,680
Slowly.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,759
- Hello.
- Give me.

29
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,520
What do you need?

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,159
Some playdough.

31
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,840
At the corner of that row on the left.

32
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,520
Alright, thank you.

33
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,680
Are children's toys these days

34
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,039
all so fancy, honey?

35
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,039
They look quite fun to play with.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
Mom, I want this one.

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,599
Don't break that.

38
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,120
Here we go.

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,840
Stop that.

40
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,560
It's quite smooth.

41
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,639
Look, there's even a seat.

42
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,960
We didn't have this when we were kids.

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,080
Kids of five or six years old now

44
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,719
all have one each.

45
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,360
Kids of five or six years old?

46
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,360
Come on, Sir.

47
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:26,839
(Out of the maze)

48
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,639
Why are you back?

49
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,000
Instructor Bai
is your appropriate adult, Lu Sheng.

50
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:32,959
Alright.

51
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,000
I've said everything I should say.

52
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,519
Say what you didn't plan to say.

53
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,279
We're here

54
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,360
to ask you

55
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,839
about another suspect.

56
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,160
Lu Sheng, you're worried
about your brother now

57
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,879
and want to take all the blame,

58
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,680
right?

59
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
Pan Xiong was arrested.

60
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,000
Hadn't the police arrived in time,

61
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,759
your brother would've been toast, okay?

62
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,560
Upon your release,

63
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,639
why didn't you tell me?

64
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
I'd have taken down Pan Xiong.

65
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,879
How is my brother now?

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,480
Show him.

67
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Lu Ming's at the welfare center.
He's safe

68
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,560
and taken care of.

69
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,240
Let me.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,519
Look.

71
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:34,720
Be good. Open your mouth.

72
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,839
Is it tasty?

73
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,120
Yes.

74
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,360
Captain Bai,

75
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,959
we'll do the questioning.

76
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,279
Sit back in your seat, okay?

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm sorry,

78
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,920
Prosecutor Lin.

79
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,720
How did you know Pan Xiong?

80
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,759
He's a hometown buddy with Lu Guangfu.

81
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,519
Among that group of people, he's

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the most successful one.

83
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,240
Guangfu, it's me, Xiong.

84
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,160
Open the door. I can't hold on.

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,879
Xiong,

86
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,600
you're too polite.

87
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,800
What's with so many gifts?

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,959
Happy New Year.

89
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,720
Happy New Year.

90
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,360
You're awesome.

91
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,120
Join me.

92
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,519
Sister-in-law,

93
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:27,680
sit and eat with us. Okay?

94
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,759
You eat. I've eaten.

95
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,120
It's New Year. Join us.

96
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,759
I've eaten. You eat.

97
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,800
Let's eat on our own.

98
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,120
Lu Sheng, is it done?

99
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,319
Why did it take you so long?

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,360
Who did you take your bad temper from?

101
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:42,279
He's young. What could

102
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,240
he learn?

103
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,600
Nowadays, learning anything costs.

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, Guangfu,

105
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,519
if you are assured,

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,000
let Sheng follow me.

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll take him to earn.

108
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:52,959
Really?

109
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,959
I won't take kids from other villages.

110
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,959
But Sheng's our own.

111
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,600
Well,

112
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,720
I should help him.

113
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:00,720
Lu Sheng, come over here.

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,279
Come on. Thank Uncle Xiong.

115
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,560
He will take you out to earn big money.

116
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,720
Thank you.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,959
It's nothing.

118
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,920
From that day on,

119
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,639
I started learning a trade
from Uncle Xiong.

120
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,360
(What trade?)

121
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:53,199
(Just stealing.)

122
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,959
(Batteries,)

123
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,680
(bicycles,)

124
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,360
(phones,)

125
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,839
(and wallets.)

126
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,439
Once, when stealing a battery,

127
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,480
I was caught by someone.

128
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,720
Kid,

129
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,839
you look young.

130
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:10,959
What did you do to be here?

131
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,360
Be quiet.

132
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,368
Lu Sheng, someone
has come to pick you up.

133
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:19,199
Follow me.

134
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,920
(The officer saw I was just a child.)

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,360
(So he only scolded me a little)

136
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,600
(and let me go.)

137
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Alright, take him out.

138
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,600
It was at that time

139
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,759
Uncle Xiong knew

140
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,960
(Surveillance Area)
kids stealing wasn't a big deal.

141
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,120
He became bolder and bolder.

142
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,039
He even took me to steal
from other people's houses.

143
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,919
You got caught the first time

144
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,879
because Pan Xiong unlocked it

145
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,919
and directed you to rob the place.

146
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,639
Is that right?

147
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,000
I also thought

148
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,039
that even if I got caught,

149
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,879
the police'd only scold me

150
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,000
and then let me go.

151
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,279
I didn't know
that stealing and robbing are different.

152
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,159
Why didn't you

153
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,080
tell the police about these back then?

154
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,080
He had Lu Guangfu bring me a message

155
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
that he'd take care
of my mom and my brother.

156
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,080
Actually, at that time,

157
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,320
even if he didn't say it,

158
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,279
I wouldn't expose him anyway.

159
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,960
I always thought we were a family.

160
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,399
How is the practice?

161
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,519
Starting tomorrow,

162
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,759
I won't take you out to play anymore.

163
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:41,639
Tomorrow,

164
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,720
Lu Sheng will take you out
to play, okay?

165
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,840
Okay.

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,279
Okay, my brother
will take us out to play.

167
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,000
Lu Ming,

168
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,519
keep me company from tomorrow, okay?

169
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,440
No, I want to go.

170
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,240
Be good.

171
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:00,759
As always,

172
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,840
the more you work, the more you gain.

173
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,240
What is the reward for more harvest?

174
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
Toys.

175
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,000
What's the punishment for no harvest?

176
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,360
Being caged.

177
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,159
Good. Keep that in mind.

178
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,240
Continue.

179
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,480
You were reformed inside for two years.

180
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,200
Pan Xiong brainwashed you
for two months to beat that?

181
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,679
The skills you learned inside

182
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,679
can all earn you a living outside.

183
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,960
Instructor Bai,

184
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,559
I have tried.

185
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,759
But it didn't work.

186
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,879
I thought

187
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,639
they wouldn't know about my past.

188
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:46,600
I thought

189
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,240
I could live honorably as a person.

190
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,799
(You didn't steal the wallet?)

191
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,759
How did it end up
being under your pillow?

192
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,559
I'm asking you.

193
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:57,360
Tell me.

194
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,519
I said, I don't know.

195
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,559
Once a thief,

196
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,799
always a thief.

197
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,519
Exactly.

198
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,480
Nonsense!

199
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,039
It was clearly Pan Xiong who paid them

200
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:14,960
to frame Lu Sheng

201
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,639
so he could continue stealing for him.

202
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,399
Captain Bai,

203
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,759
we'll question him, okay?

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,639
Sorry.

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,639
Lu Sheng,

206
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
will you testify to what you

207
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,120
just said?

208
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,519
Pan Xiong,

209
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,320
we're old acquaintances.

210
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,440
You were dealt with for theft before.

211
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,879
Alright.

212
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,080
Now you're using
a fish hot pot shop as a front

213
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,559
to run a theft training class.

214
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,679
Are you planning to grow big and strong?

215
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,399
No.

216
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,639
Those kids were all desolate.

217
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,559
Some of them even wandered
on the streets

218
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,639
without food or drink.

219
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,879
So I took them in

220
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,279
and gave them food.

221
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,039
But some of them weren't obedient.

222
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:11,919
They'd go out and steal things.

223
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,679
Even hitting them didn't work...

224
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,759
You even hit them?

225
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,240
How?

226
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,759
I j-just

227
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,519
smacked them once in a while.

228
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,120
I-I didn't hit them hard.

229
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,120
Pan Xiong,

230
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,320
do you think we'd arrest you

231
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,559
without evidence?

232
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,559
You have no idea yourself?

233
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,399
Do you know how many locks

234
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,840
we found at your fish hot pot shop?

235
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,639
Over 120.

236
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,919
Any explanation?

237
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,279
Well...

238
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,639
The locks...

239
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,320
When I took over the shop,

240
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,679
the locks were just there.

241
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:44,799
They were there?

242
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,240
Then what's with the fish pots

243
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,639
and all those soaps?

244
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,159
Forcing young kids

245
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,240
to fish for soap in the boiling water?

246
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,919
How could you even think of that?

247
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,440
And what's with the cages?

248
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,000
Putting kids in dog cages?

249
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
Are you even human?

250
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,799
Playing dumb with me?

251
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:09,639
Fine.

252
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:12,039
Let's drop it for now.

253
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,600
Let's talk

254
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,960
about the two cell phone shops

255
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,799
and that electric vehicle shop
called East Shop.

256
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,159
Every month,

257
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,919
they have transfers
of 40 to 50 thousand yuan to you.

258
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,559
(Transfer Records)
Any explanation?

259
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:29,039
Let me remind you,

260
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,159
all these shop owners
have confessed to us.

261
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:34,720
Well...

262
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,600
About that...

263
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,600
My shop's business wasn't good.

264
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,080
The kids felt sorry for me,

265
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,159
so they went out
to pick up some things for me.

266
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,679
Like phones, batteries, and such.

267
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:45,279
All those phones were picked up?

268
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,440
Sometimes they just

269
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,600
took them conveniently.

270
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,960
According to your story,

271
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,240
it's the kids who went out
to steal things on their own.

272
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,000
You just helped
to fence the stolen goods?

273
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,519
They did it on their own?

274
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,320
Yes, that's right.

275
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
So Lu Ming also crawled
into the box by himself

276
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,279
to let you sell him?

277
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,639
No. Lu...

278
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,320
Lu Ming...

279
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,440
Since he called me godfather,

280
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,080
I was to send him to a good home

281
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,320
and find him one...

282
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,600
Godfather?

283
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,480
How dare you even say that!

284
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,679
He is so young.

285
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,759
How could you do such a thing?

286
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:19,919
Pan Xiong,

287
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,519
I solemnly tell you

288
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,960
that using children
to escape legal punishment

289
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,440
is one thing,

290
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,240
but child trafficking

291
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,960
is entirely another matter.

292
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,879
As you know,

293
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,480
we've taken Liu E,
the trafficker, into custody.

294
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,679
Now we are interrogating her.

295
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,919
Whoever comes clean first

296
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,159
will have it a lot easier in the end.

297
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,360
Listen up.

298
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,960
This is your last chance.

299
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,399
You should know

300
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:47,039
that child trafficking

301
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,039
is punishable by death.

302
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,399
Not trafficking.

303
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,440
I rented them.

304
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,759
You rented them?

305
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,559
How?

306
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,039
I gave those families
ten thousand for each boy

307
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,799
and eight thousand for each girl.

308
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,039
I rented them to steal things.

309
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,519
Did those children's parents

310
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,840
know you rent them

311
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,159
to make them steal?

312
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,320
Yes, they knew.

313
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,399
Some of them didn't.

314
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,919
But upon knowing, some of them

315
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:12,720
voluntarily brought

316
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,080
their children over to me.

317
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,519
I also think stealing is bad.

318
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,759
But Godfather said

319
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,279
it is a game.

320
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,360
Whoever steals

321
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,840
is a good child

322
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,480
and gets a reward.

323
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,720
Xing,

324
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
do you miss home?

325
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,519
Yes.

326
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:52,679
But I don't know if they miss me.

327
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:58,840
Then what do you want to do
when you go home?

328
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,039
Go to school.

329
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,440
Dad and Mom said

330
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,240
when I've saved enough money,

331
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,320
they'll take me to school.

332
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:41,759
(Juvenile Correctional Facility
Lion Dance Training Base)

333
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,320
One.

334
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,120
Two.

335
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:45,919
Three.

336
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,000
Four.

337
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,360
Hold steadily.

338
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,240
Horse stance.

339
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,319
What's wrong?

340
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,319
What are you doing?

341
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:12,799
Stand still.

342
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,480
Go back.

343
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,319
Stay out of it.

344
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,480
Huang Jiawang, stop.

345
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:18,048
Huang Jiawang.

346
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,559
Stand still.

347
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,519
What? What did I do?

348
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:25,759
I told you to stand still.

349
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,000
I can do it.

350
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,960
Why are you yelling for?

351
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,599
Shut up. Why so much nonsense?

352
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,000
How are you?

353
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,279
I'm fine.

354
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,599
Who did it?

355
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,880
I didn't stand firmly myself.

356
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:43,039
Report!

357
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,599
Yes?

358
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,559
Instructor,

359
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,559
Huang Jiawang kicked Li Hui down.

360
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,599
What are you saying?

361
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,519
What are you doing?

362
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,839
Stand still. Cut it.

363
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,119
What will you do?

364
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:54,759
Hit me?

365
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,640
Come on.

366
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,599
Hit me.

367
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,960
Should I pull the surveillance?

368
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,039
Go ahead and do it.

369
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,880
What will happen?

370
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,960
It's just two extra days
in confinement for me, right?

371
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:04,079
What?

372
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:05,559
Do you think I'm afraid of that?

373
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,480
You think you're so tough

374
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,039
that none dares to say a word

375
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:10,279
and I can't handle you,

376
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,039
don't you?

377
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,599
Listen up.

378
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,880
Once you're 18,

379
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,440
you'll be sent to an adult prison.

380
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,440
Then you'll realize we are very lenient.

381
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
Instructor Bai,
pull out the surveillance.

382
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,599
Miss Prosecutor?

383
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,279
Stand still.

384
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,279
Who are you calling Miss?

385
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,039
Wait. Look! He's about to hit me.

386
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,359
Listen, Huang Jiawang.

387
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,319
If the surveillance shows
that you kicked him,

388
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,799
as long as it's a minor injury,

389
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:34,640
we can charge you

390
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,880
with intentional injury.

391
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,799
Do you understand?

392
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,400
I do.

393
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,359
But what about him?

394
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,160
He got a stick

395
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,359
and was going to hit me.

396
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,200
Did I hit you?

397
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,039
Why were you
pointing it at me if you weren't?

398
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,000
Apologize to Li Hui.

399
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,559
No.

400
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,680
Immediately apologize to Li Hui now.

401
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,279
It's this office.

402
00:18:58,759 --> 00:18:59,880
Copy the video to me now.

403
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,799
He has to pay for his actions.

404
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:03,880
You're awesome, Ms. Lin.

405
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,599
When dealing with such unrepentant kids,

406
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,839
you know what they fear?

407
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:08,480
We have to turn to thunderous means.

408
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,799
Here, drink some water.

409
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,720
No, and I won't sit.

410
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I'm just here to tell you

411
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,400
Lu Sheng's and Pan Xiong's cases
will be handled separately.

412
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:17,000
They'll be prosecuted
by the Xinli District Procuratorate.

413
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,079
Wait. Do you really
have to put that kid in prison?

414
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,640
What he did is pardonable.

415
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,079
It's not up to you.

416
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,039
Next week, the procuratorate

417
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,720
will hear from the police
and the victims.

418
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,319
An appropriate adult has to be present.

419
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,880
Will there be change?

420
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,720
Next Thursday at 3 PM.

421
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,599
That time won't work.

422
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,960
My wife has a prenatal checkup.

423
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,079
Then get someone else.

424
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,200
Without me, that kid will be scared.

425
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,559
Be a good person to the end.

426
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,519
Reschedule it, okay?

427
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,279
I can't.

428
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,480
That's all.

429
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,160
His situation is special.

430
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,279
Can you show some empathy?

431
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,079
Based on Pan Xiong's confession,
the police went

432
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,279
to his hometown,

433
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,000
Yunzhao County, Xiangnan Province.

434
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,240
His confession is basically true.

435
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:06,799
Those people
are truly not qualified to be parents.

436
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Pan Xiong

437
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,400
rented 16 children in total.

438
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,079
Most of them are under ten.

439
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,720
The government has intervened

440
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,839
to have their parents

441
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,079
take all of them back home.

442
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,960
Civil Affairs Department has stepped in.

443
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
What about the kid from the facility?

444
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,720
Lu Sheng is the first kid
Pan Xiong trained

445
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,799
in theft.

446
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,079
Pan Xiong might
have been inspired by it.

447
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:29,920
From then on,

448
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,759
he started going to his hometown
to find kids

449
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:33,079
and then taught them to steal.

450
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,000
Lu Sheng has a younger brother

451
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,039
who is only five.

452
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,079
Lu Sheng's father

453
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,039
sent them to Pan Xiong.

454
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,200
Their father

455
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,599
is quite a piece of work.

456
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:43,920
He told the boys

457
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,200
he sent them to learn something.

458
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,240
But he knew exactly
what Pan Xiong was doing.

459
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:48,759
We visited his home.

460
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,559
He was also abusive towards his wife.

461
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,480
Look at you.

462
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,480
Aren't you handling
these cases quite well?

463
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Why did you tell me a while ago
that you couldn't

464
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,720
handle cases involving children?

465
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,319
Quickly give me

466
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:10,400
a concrete plan.

467
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,119
Also,

468
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:12,839
you can charge

469
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,839
Lu Sheng's father

470
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,319
as an accessory to theft.

471
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,759
And add another count of abuse.

472
00:21:20,544 --> 00:21:21,240
Okay.

473
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:25,319
Anything else?

474
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:40,192
(Request the revocation of Lu Guangfu's
guardianship over Lu Sheng and Lu Ming.)

475
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,000
Lin Zhitao,

476
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,519
you're new to your position.

477
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,880
You're already causing trouble.

478
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:47,079
The guardianship

479
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,880
is not something
you can revoke as you wish.

480
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Calm down, okay?

481
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,119
How can I remain calm?

482
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Do you know that this

483
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,160
has never occurred before
in our country's

484
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,279
prosecution history?

485
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,152
But that doesn't mean
it shouldn't happen.

486
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:59,039
General Rules of Civil Law's Article 18

487
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,000
and Law on the Protection
of Minors' Article 53

488
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
clearly define the duties

489
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,559
a guardian should fulfill.

490
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,720
If one fails to fulfill them,

491
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,480
who supervises?

492
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,559
No oversight,

493
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,880
what's the use of these articles?

494
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,440
Aren't they just zombie articles?

495
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,839
Parents have the right
to choose their own children.

496
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,559
Why can't the children

497
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,640
choose their own parents?

498
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,039
Is it fair?

499
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,480
Alright, you may leave now.

500
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,480
I'll take a look.

501
00:22:44,436 --> 00:22:46,080
(Prosecutorial Recommendation)

502
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:48,576
(Prosecutorial Case-Handling Center)

503
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,559
I'm Xia Rong, Xinli District Prosecutor.

504
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,240
Wu Tiantian, Assistant Prosecutor.

505
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,920
Hello.

506
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,400
Show it to them.

507
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,000
We have analyzed the case internally.

508
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,400
This is how I think.

509
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,440
(Report on Lu Sheng's theft case)
If Lu Sheng were a first-time offender,

510
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,039
we'd be very willing to be lenient.

511
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,519
But in the current situation,

512
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,680
I can't be sure that he has repented.

513
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,680
Not a first-time offender?

514
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,119
Then whether he has repented
or not depends on his actions.

515
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:15,039
It's about actions, right?

516
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,160
Rong,

517
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,119
I have thoroughly reviewed the notes.

518
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,519
He is a minor who was incited.

519
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,640
He is also a victim.

520
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,039
Every child has their own reasons.

521
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,279
I think we shouldn't just guess here.

522
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Why don't we

523
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,279
listen to

524
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:30,680
what he has to say?

525
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:34,464
(Outpatient Lobby)

(Ultrasound Report Printer)

527
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,799
Look.

528
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,759
Our baby is so good-looking.

529
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,000
It's pitch-black.

530
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,240
What can you see?

531
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,279
Don't say that about our baby girl.

532
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,079
How do you know it's a girl?

533
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,839
If I keep saying it this way,

534
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:53,279
it will be a girl.

535
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:58,960
Are you uncomfortable?

536
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,119
Have some water.

537
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,079
- Smell...
- Suppress it.

538
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,799
No, the smell is too strong.

539
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,240
Forget it. I will boil some water
for you when we get back.

540
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,200
We need to go to the supermarket.

541
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:19,480
Buy something.

542
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,319
Buy what?

543
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,119
Just make a list,
and I'll buy them for you.

544
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,599
I was thinking if we're going together,

545
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:27,640
I need to pick some presentable gifts.

546
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:28,640
Gifts?

547
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,799
What's going on?

548
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,799
My mother arranged it.

549
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,279
She said we'll have dinner

550
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,799
with the third uncle

551
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,880
to talk about your work.

552
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,559
I better not go.

553
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,039
They don't like me.

554
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,400
Cut the nonsense.

555
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,279
They've found someone for you.

556
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,440
Speak less, ask less,
and inquire less, okay?

557
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,559
Understood.

558
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,960
Work diligently and follow orders.

559
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,319
Well...

560
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,200
But, honey,

561
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,440
does it have to be today?

562
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,359
Why? Do you have a plan today?

563
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,680
No.

564
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
Well...

565
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,960
Uh...

566
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,839
The procuratorate asked me a favor.

567
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,640
And now

568
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,240
is the crucial moment for job transfer.

569
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,079
I think I shouldn't offend the chief,

570
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,640
or they won't let me go.

571
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,400
Then you should go.

572
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,119
Right?

573
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,039
But make sure you're home before five.

574
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,039
Don't be late.

575
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,279
I ensure you return on time.

576
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,359
Also, don't worry about buying things.

577
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,480
Let me take care of it.

578
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,480
I'll send you home first.

579
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,232
(Xinli District Procuratorate of Yunhai,
Appropriate Adult)

580
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,000
Sorry.

581
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:40,119
(Xinli District Procuratorate of Yunhai,
Spectator)

582
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,400
Sorry, I'm late.

583
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,079
Lu Sheng,

584
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,000
Captain Bai can't make it here.

585
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,720
We had someone
from the civil affairs bureau

586
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,240
act as your appropriate adult.

587
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,000
Lu Sheng,

588
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,359
we can start if you're ready.

589
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,440
Hello,

590
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:09,920
prosecutors,

591
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,599
police officers,

592
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,920
and

593
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,720
(Victim Representative)
victims.

594
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:18,784
(Confession and Repentance Letter)

595
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,880
This is the second time
I've committed a crime.

596
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,000
The first time, I stole something

597
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,440
and got caught.

598
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,039
So I

599
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,000
threatened the victim with a knife

600
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,359
and took the things away.

601
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,440
(Prosecutor)
It turned into robbery.

602
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,440
I served two years in prison.

603
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,400
This time,

604
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,079
I joined a theft gang.

605
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,039
But that's because I didn't want

606
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,519
my younger brother to be like me.

607
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,519
I didn't want

608
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,279
both of us to become thieves.

609
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,319
So I... I...

610
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:06,519
Lu Sheng,

611
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,160
don't be nervous. Speak slowly.

612
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,039
Have some water.

613
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,119
Sorry, everyone.

614
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,519
I'll start over.

615
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,359
I always remember

616
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,000
what Instructor Bai
from the facility told me.

617
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,400
Follow the right path.

618
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,640
(When I was first in the facility,)

619
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,480
(I felt very wronged.)

620
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,759
(I felt there was nothing wrong)

621
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,599
(with stealing to support my brother
since my family was poor.)

622
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,039
(But over these two years,)

623
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,680
(I gradually understood)

624
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:28,039
(I should distinguish right from wrong)

625
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,920
(and know what things can be done)

626
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,359
(and what can't.)

627
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:33,200
(At that time,)

628
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,319
(I sincerely repented.)

629
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,279
(I decided never
to do illegal things again.)

630
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:39,599
(But I didn't know)

631
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,039
(that leaving the facility)

632
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,839
(was the true beginning of my life.)

633
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,559
(I'd surely
encounter many difficulties.)

634
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,359
(When I encountered difficulties again,)

635
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,519
(I started doubting myself again)

636
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,480
(and doubting
if society had abandoned me.)

637
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,799
(Until Prosecutor Lin
and Instructor Bai)

638
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,039
(appeared again.)

639
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,599
(Then I knew)

640
00:28:58,799 --> 00:28:59,440
(many people)

641
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,319
(in this world hadn't given up on me.)

642
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:04,079
(I shouldn't give up on myself)

643
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:05,160
(because of the bad people)

644
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,799
(and join them in their wrongdoing.)

645
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,599
I don't want my brother
to be like me in the future

646
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,720
and choose the wrong path.

647
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,559
Even if I meant well for him,

648
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,839
my actions are still criminal.

649
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,279
I want to say sorry

650
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,200
to those I've stolen from.

651
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,000
I sincerely regret it.

652
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:31,559
I also thank everyone who has helped me.

653
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,799
Thank you all.

654
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,920
Since Lu Sheng,
the defendant in this case,

655
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,960
is a minor

656
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,599
and has shown a good attitude
of confession and remorse

657
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,799
with minimal malice,

658
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,640
he may be sentenced
to less than one year of imprisonment.

659
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,119
Fits prosecution conditions.

660
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,960
At the same time,
due to his confession and remorse,

661
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,839
according to Article 271
of the Criminal Procedure Law

662
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,480
of the People's Republic of China,

663
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,480
we've decided to conditionally
not prosecute Lu Sheng

664
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,839
with a probation period of six months.

665
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,400
That's all for today.

666
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:21,079
Adjourned.

667
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,079
Adjourned.

668
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,839
Prosecutor Lin.

669
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,960
Thank you, Prosecutor Lin.

670
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,960
Can you give this to someone for me?

671
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,039
Okay.

672
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,279
Look over there.

673
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:02,319
- Stop.
- Stop beating the drum. You!

674
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:02,920
Stop.

675
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,759
Stop beating.

676
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,640
Why are you
beating the drum in the afternoon?

677
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,759
It's a misunderstanding.

678
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,839
What misunderstanding?

679
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,240
You have no manners at all.

680
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,279
The drum.

681
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:15,359
Ma'am,

682
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:16,640
that's the drum I borrowed.

683
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,599
It's public property.

684
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:20,119
Officer, I'm telling you. It's him.

685
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,839
He's unbearably noisy.

686
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,039
My drum...

687
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,759
Let him leave.

688
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,759
Is this appropriate?

689
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,279
I really didn't mean it.

690
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:28,079
I stopped, alright?

691
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,039
What was that drumming just now?

692
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,759
Is he the one
who confronted Fu last time?

693
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,160
Yes, it's him.

694
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
He even tried to bribe me.

695
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,440
Bribe you?

696
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,680
He gave me a bag of fruit.

697
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:56,640
It's misconduct.

698
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,599
You said you wanted to help Lu Sheng.

699
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,039
Have I ever stopped you?

700
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,079
Shouldn't matters be prioritized?

701
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:10,680
Didn't we agree

702
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,640
on the dinner in advance?

703
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,920
I'm sorry, honey.

704
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,240
Listen to me, Bai Enyu.

705
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:20,920
If you make a mistake again,

706
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,839
explain it in person.

707
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,960
Don't text me.

708
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,960
Wait, honey.

709
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,119
Listen to me.

710
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:29,160
I have arranged everything today.

711
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,559
It's just that those older folks

712
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,680
were too enthusiastic.

713
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
They surrounded me

714
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,519
like a hero.

715
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:37,160
Are you sure it's what happened?

716
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,640
You're not proactive about the transfer.

717
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,440
Yet you're devoted to Lu Sheng's matter.

718
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,680
Honey, don't be angry.

719
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,359
Stand there.

720
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,960
Don't come over. Say it from there.

721
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,920
Who is calling
in the middle of the night?

722
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,480
Who is it?

723
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:53,839
Chief?

724
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
I really didn't mean it today.

725
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,519
No way.

726
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,799
This is just too much of a joke.

727
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
I'm really sorry.

728
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,319
I have a business trip
to Beijing tomorrow.

729
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:11,960
So

730
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:14,079
I had to ask you out so late.

731
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,000
It's okay.

732
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,279
It's my honor.

733
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,799
And you asked me out so late because

734
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,359
you heard something?

735
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,559
You play the drums well.

736
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,839
Sorry.

737
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,960
I was reckless today.

738
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,319
The procuratorate wouldn't let me in.

739
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:33,240
Of course. You were with a drum.

740
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Right.

741
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,160
That boy needed me.

742
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,119
Well.

743
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,480
About the interview,

744
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,759
I've always wanted to explain to you.

745
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,920
Though I said all those things,

746
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm not dissatisfied
with the prosecution.

747
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,000
I know.

748
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,759
The questions we asked

749
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:51,480
were indeed a bit sharp.

750
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,079
Don't take it to heart.

751
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,000
It's okay. I'm just young

752
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,799
and impulsive.

753
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,200
I greatly respect the work
of the procuratorate.

754
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,279
Thank you.

755
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,039
- Here, Yang.
- Here.

756
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Shrimp porridge for you.

757
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,640
I often eat here.

758
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Thank you.

759
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,960
Let's eat and talk.

760
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:07,839
Okay.

761
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,599
Is Lu Sheng the kid who bet with you

762
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,239
and asked you to take the judicial exam?

763
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,120
It's him.

764
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,599
At that time,

765
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
he was new there.

766
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,079
He was unruly

767
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,119
and disobedient.

768
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,400
That day,
it seemed to be about cleaning.

769
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,480
We just clashed.

770
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,920
I wanted him
to move in a positive direction.

771
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,079
So I provoked him

772
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
to bet with me,

773
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,800
saying if he could be
first in every subject

774
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,519
and reduce his sentence,

775
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:38,000
I'd agree to do one thing for him.

776
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,840
He certainly wanted
to see us instructors' downfall,

777
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,960
so he picked the judicial exam.

778
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,639
But unexpectedly, in the end,

779
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,679
he won, and I didn't lose either.

780
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,280
Well,

781
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,280
I was so motivated back then.

782
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,639
The life with a new direction

783
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,639
and new goals

784
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,880
was so fulfilling.

785
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,840
I think you also seem like a kid.

786
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,159
I am very mature when I work,

787
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,840
ma'am.

788
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,639
What do you think
about our procuratorate?

789
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,679
It's high and mighty.

790
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
I aspire to it.

791
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:18,719
It's just that

792
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,280
when it comes to kids...

793
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,480
You can speak freely.

794
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:34,199
It's a bit inhuman.

795
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,920
Let's take us for example.

796
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,760
Many of the kids

797
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,280
in our facility
come from problematic families.

798
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,800
If the children end up committing crimes

799
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,920
because of adult inaction,

800
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,719
the law can surely punish them.

801
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,239
Could it be

802
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,079
that the root of the problem
is with the parents?

803
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,440
Did they commit a crime or not?

804
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,440
Who will punish them?

805
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,239
I think every child's situation
is different.

806
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,119
We shouldn't focus

807
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,559
on what he did

808
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,119
but rather find out

809
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,760
why he did it

810
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,840
and who turned him into this

811
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,159
instead of just saying
the law says they are guilty.

812
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,079
I think beyond the law,

813
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,559
there should also be

814
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,760
common sense and human feelings.

815
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,400
Did I say too much, ma'am?

816
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:34,119
I don't usually talk this much.

817
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,239
I didn't mean
to instruct you on your work.

818
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,840
I just wanted to share my own thoughts.

819
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,679
You are right in what you say.

820
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,280
But there are also one-sided aspects.

821
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,119
Sure.

822
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,480
For every child you have disciplined,

823
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,079
do you specifically

824
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,320
study them?

825
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,400
It's not really a study.

826
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,239
I just want to understand them.

827
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
This is yours, right?

828
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,119
I looked for it.

829
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,519
So you kept it for me.

830
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,760
It was kept in our lost and found.

831
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,639
As I saw the facility name on it,

832
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,440
I guessed it must be yours.

833
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,119
Yes.

834
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,640
Look.

835
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:10,840
These are the three kids
your office sent.

836
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,119
They have been assigned to us.

837
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,360
Huang Jiawang and Li Hui.

838
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:16,719
Coincidence.

839
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,760
You've been at the facility
for ten years too, right?

840
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,880
Yes, ten years.

841
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,400
How many kids have you overseen?

842
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,079
Hundreds, I guess.

843
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,920
After they returned to society,

844
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,079
did you find out

845
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,199
how they turned out later?

846
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,639
There are some who changed.

847
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,079
They became good kids.

848
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,480
But some of them were sent back.

849
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,280
It happens.

850
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,440
So we have to start over.

851
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,800
It can't be helped.

852
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,039
I hope you
bring the experience of the facility

853
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,320
into the work of the procuratorate.

854
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,480
Really?

855
00:38:02,144 --> 00:38:02,960
Well...

856
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,800
Well, aren't you afraid

857
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,519
that I'll spoil
the fine seafood porridge

858
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,159
and turn it
into seafood goo once I join?

859
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,840
Our office is a big family.

860
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,239
It won't be turned
into goo just by you alone.

861
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,679
- Right.
- I have only one request.

862
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,559
Go ahead.

863
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,440
Add a little human touch for us.

864
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,320
I'll assure that.

865
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
- Here.
- Thank you.

866
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
Hello?

867
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,440
Prosecutor Lin,

868
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:52,960
this is Chen Huiwen.

869
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,079
Thank you.

870
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,000
I am going to meet Wenxuan.

871
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,360
Where are you?

872
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,239
The closest place to Wenxuan.

873
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,000
