00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,520
Guys, here we go.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,479
Hurry up.

5
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,640
Come on. Hurry.

6
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,399
Who is she?

7
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,960
I think she's from
the Accounting Class 2.

8
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,640
You can tell from this angle?

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,320
Hurry. The next one.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,920
This is good.

11
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,280
Great angle.

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,119
Dorm inspection.

13
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,200
Dorm inspection.

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,296
What are you watching?

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,879
Did your parents

16
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,200
send you here for this?

17
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,680
Take the laptop.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,079
You two,

19
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,120
check all the boys' phones

20
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,400
and laptops.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,359
Confiscate any device

22
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:21,879
that has such things.

23
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:22,879
I'll tell their parents.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,312
Hand it over.

27
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,439
You've applied for a police car.

28
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,759
Why are you driving in person?

29
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,919
I like driving.

30
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,960
You do?

31
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,120
What is this? An interview?

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,960
Make a right turn in 100 meters ahead.

33
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,960
Right turn, 100 meters.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,928
Here.

35
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,879
Right turn ahead.

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,759
Turning right again? Left turn.

37
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,080
The GPS says right turn.

38
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,879
Who knows better? You or the GPS?

39
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,680
The GPS is the most accurate.

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,639
Prosecutor Lin,

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,840
you don't believe anything
unless it's in the law, huh?

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,520
Yeah, totally.

43
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,199
Fine, I see.

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,159
Don't be

45
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,759
so cynical at the school.

46
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,039
No more witty comments.

47
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,759
Be serious as the vice principals

48
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:02,560
of this campaign.

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Fine, I'll be serious.

50
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,199
How do we get there?

51
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,159
Go forward.

52
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,680
Turn right at the intersection ahead.

53
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:15,919
Turn right.

54
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,560
Yeah, it says turn right.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Why are we turning right again?

56
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,399
We'll be back to the starting point.

57
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,000
We'll never make it there.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,879
It's telling me to turn right.

59
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,600
Got a problem?

60
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,920
Great. Three right turns.

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,959
What's with three right turns?

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,680
Nothing.

63
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,079
What should I do there?

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,639
Do what you're good at.

65
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,600
Communicate with kids?

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,480
Just maintain order there.

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,439
The key

68
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:52,759
is to talk less.

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,360
Okay?

70
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,560
This is wrong.

71
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,720
Why are we back here?

72
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:01,839
Of course, we are.

73
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,759
Three right turns.

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
I was following the GPS.

75

(Work Hard for the Exam!)
Our school

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,519
may be a vocational school,

77
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,639
but it boasts a history
of over 20 years.

78
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,199
There are more than
400 teachers and students

79
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,079
right now.

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,959
So many?

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,120
We also place great emphasis

82
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,240
on cultural education.

83
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:21,720
These students

84
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,680
may have failed

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
the high school entrance exam,

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,319
but we won't

87
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,560
give up on them.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,959
In addition to technical education,

89
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:30,920
we also set up

90
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,879
high school courses for them.

91
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,240
They live on campus, right?

92
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,120
Yeah, from Monday to Friday.

93
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,399
Those who live nearby

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
go home on the weekends.

95
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,079
This way, please.

96
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:43,584
Okay.

97
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
The legal education campaign

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,319
has always been a key component

99
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:50,720
of our work
at the Juvenile Prosecution Office.

100
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,480
From now on,

101
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,199
the procuratorate

102
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,160
will send a prosecutor

as a legal education campaign
vice principal

104
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,360
to communicate
with your teachers and students

105
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
every year.

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,000
Please kindly

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,839
- collaborate with us.
- With pleasure.

108
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:03,639
Put your feet down.

109
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,800
This is our director.

110
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,399
Director Hou.

111
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,399
Prosecutor Lin.

112
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,759
Let me know if you need anything.

113
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,879
No problem.

114
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,319
You still dare to wear a skirt?

115
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,800
I haven't got the time.

116
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
Come with me to the dorm.

117
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,839
Let's go.

118
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,319
Director Hou.

119
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,839
Is there a problem
with the girls' uniform?

120
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,240
The attire matters not.

121
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,519
Education is the key.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,639
That's right.

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,759
This way.

124
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,560
What are you doing?

125
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,560
We did nothing wrong.

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,839
Why should we hide?

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,839
Can you stop looking for trouble?

128
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Why should we

129
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,639
put up with it?

130
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,680
You're not the victim after all.

131
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,040
What do you mean by that?

132
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,120
Not everyone demands
an answer like you do.

133
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,759
Enough.

134
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,079
We're roommates.

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,319
Don't worry.

136
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,720
Director Hou would handle it.

137
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,199
He would have if he wanted to.

138
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,160
Xia Qiu.

139
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,319
Director Hou.

140
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,800
Hello, Principal.

141
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,040
How did it go with the police?

142
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,319
You startled me.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,720
Let's go.

144
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Prosecutor Lin.

145
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,480
This way, please.

146
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Still wearing a skirt?

147
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
What's the problem?

148
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll bet with you.

149
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:21,920
It was Xia Qiu

150
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,160
in the photo yesterday.

151
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:24,800
Prosecutor Bai.

152
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,040
We haven't heard anything

153
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,720
from the police.

154
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,160
I have to ask you for updates.

155
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
It's up to the police now.

156
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,879
You think I can urge them?

157
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
Just keep waiting.

158
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,319
How long do we have to wait?

159
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,680
Why are you urging me?

160
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,199
What's it to you, anyway?

161
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,800
So nosy.

162
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,680
Hello, everyone.

163
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,360
I am Prosecutor Lin Zhitao

164
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
(Campus Legal Education)
from the Yunhai People's Procuratorate.

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,360
It's my honor to give you

166
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,560
a lecture on the rule of law today.

167
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,519
Thank you.

168
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Thank you.

169
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,959
I know that you're not interested.

170
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,680
But you have to listen.

171
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,040
Because you don't know

172
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,319
how important it is

173
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,279
to have legal awareness.

174
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,079
Our theme today is,

175
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,079
"Cultivate virtue and integrity.
Be honest and law-abiding."

176
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:15,759
As the saying goes,

177
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,680
"No rules, no boundaries."

178
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,759
The law regulates people's behavior.

179
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,079
Knowing the law is knowing the rules.

180
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,120
It prevents us from going astray.

181
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Life is long.

182
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,000
Laying a good foundation
is the key to this journey.

183
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,759
It's an important period

184
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,960
for you to grow and obtain knowledge.

185
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,720
Once you learn the laws,

186
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
you will know what is legal

187
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,519
and what is illegal.

188
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,000
Then you can distinguish right

189
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
from wrong.

190
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,519
Know the laws.

191
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,679
Strive to be good citizens
of the new century.

192
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,559
The rule of law will be
more complete in the future.

193
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,440
Everyone must have
a high legal awareness.

194
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
Only those who know the law

195
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,720
(Legal awareness, legal weapon)
know their rights and obligations.

196
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,879
All of you here are minors.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,039
I have a question for you.

198
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,720
Who can tell me

199
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,799
what are the bad behaviors of minors?

200
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,759
Those who know can raise their hands.

201
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,799
Bad behaviors.

202
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,840
Zhen Rong.

203
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,720
Zhen Rong.

204
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay, you.

205
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,159
Smoking, drinking,

206
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,320
skipping classes,

207
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,039
- Louder.
- truancy...

208
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,679
Yeah, louder.

209
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:36,200
Louder.

210
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,759
Promoting books, audio-visual products,

211
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,080
or online information

212
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,120
featuring violence, terror,
and extreme content.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,480
Reading, watching,

214
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,759
listening, or promoting

215
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,159
obscenity and pornography...

216
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,799
What is pornography?

217
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,519
What's so funny?

218
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:57,639
Be quiet.

219
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,480
Bai Enyu.

220
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,000
Come out for a second.

221
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,200
Stop it.

222
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,919
Get out.

223
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,559
I didn't mean to scare them.

224
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,120
(Legal Education Class)
It's just my professional habit

225
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
to maintain order.

226
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
Here's a new habit.

227
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,879
Stand here.

228
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:13,840
Wait till it's over.

229
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
Is it a punishment?

230
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,679
Stop talking.

231
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,080
How is it my fault?

232
00:10:31,443 --> 00:10:34,560
(Bai Enyu)

233
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,440
Hello.

234
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:38,879
Ms. Tao.

235
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,759
What's wrong?

236
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,519
Why did you call me during work hours?

237
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,039
Nothing...

238
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,919
There's nothing.

239
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,919
I'm just calling to enjoy

240
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,039
the freedom of calling you
during work hours.

241
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,519
Surprise!

242
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,639
I've never done this

243
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,200
in the past ten years, right?

244
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,480
What's going on?

245
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,200
What do you mean?

246
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,240
Nothing.

247
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,840
My superior is considerate

248
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,159
and offers me personal space.

249
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,600
It sounds so hard to believe.

250
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,759
Did you...

251
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,080
Did you cause trouble

252
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,759
and get kicked out?

253
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,600
What...

254
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,480
Of course not.

255
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,399
No way.

256
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,039
Well...

257
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,039
Why don't you let me talk

258
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,039
to our baby?

259
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
I've missed him.

260
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,200
Here's something new

261
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,279
for you.

262
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,240
Get hung up on by your wife
during work hours.

263
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,120
Ms. Tao.

264
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,879
We need an explanation.

265
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,879
Let's go.

266
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,240
Minors over 14

267
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,480
and under 16 years old...

268
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,879
Where is he?

269
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:40,639
Who are you?

270
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,600
Where is he?

271
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,679
What are you doing?

272
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,559
There he is.

273
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,159
Security guard.

274
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,399
Get the security guard.

275
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,240
Director.

276
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,000
Tell me.

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,559
You said you'd solve the problem.

278
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:50,080
Stop!

279
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,960
- What's the plan?
- You said you'd solve it.

280
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,840
- Did you?
- Stop pulling me.

281
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,360
- We need an explanation.
- Resolve this issue now.

282
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,039
Stop!

283
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:56,159
Stop shouting!

284
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
All the kids are here.

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,279
Does it look right to you?

286
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,639
Let's talk in my office, shall we?

287
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,879
Go to the office. We'll talk it through.

288
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:06,759
Resolve this.

289
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,159
Let's talk it through.

290
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,679
Kids, study on your own.

291
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,159
We can fix it.

292
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,200
What did I say?

293
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,399
It's still the same thing.

294
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,000
We are truly

295
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,480
trying our best to investigate.

296
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,799
But after all, we're running a school.

297
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,120
We have our schedules.

298
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,759
Are you telling us to get transferred?

299
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,759
You can do that.

300
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:31,072
- You...
- Director Hou.

301
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
Tell me.

302
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,720
Up to now,

303
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
has the school taken any measures?

304
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,039
Speaking of which,

305
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,759
have your kids
been secretly photographed?

306
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,919
- What do you mean?
- Director Hou, you can't say that.

307
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,799
Won't it be too late

308
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,840
when our kids get their photos taken?

309
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,759
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

310
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:49,279
We're in a difficult position. I mean

311
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:51,360
if your kids have been photographed,

312
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,039
you can offer us some clues.

313
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,679
Wait.

314
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,159
Why don't you call the police?

315
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,480
The police did come.

316
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
But we don't know

317
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,519
who took the photos of whom.

318
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,080
It's impossible.

319
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,519
So we can't do anything?

320
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,159
How can the kids study

321
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,200
when they're scared?

322
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,279
We have already taken measures.

323
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
We have ordered

324
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,960
a batch of pants for girls.

325
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,360
Girls will wear school pants

326
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,360
for the transition period.

327
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,039
Are you saying that

328
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:21,879
my daughter was wrong to wear a skirt?

329
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,960
It makes no sense.

330
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,000
- Exactly.
- It's natural for girls to wear skirts.

331
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,279
Kids from other schools
also wear skirts.

332
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:30,624
- Why is it only happening here?
- You have to do something about it.

333
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Excuse me.

334
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,039
Please calm down.

335
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,360
Rest assured.

336
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,480
We will protect your children.

337
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,679
We promise

338
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,000
to improve the school culture,

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,639
strengthen security,

340
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:46,600
and eliminate

341
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,080
the recurrence of such incidents.

342
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,440
How?

343
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,360
- We have the prosecutors here.
- Yeah.

344
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,919
This is the vice principal
of our legal education campaign.

345
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,399
We place great emphasis

346
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,720
on campus legal education.

347
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,000
Prosecutor Lin

348
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,240
will offer you

349
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,399
a perfect solution.

350
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,799
Prosecutor Lin, is that right?

351
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:14,960
We need a solution.

352
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,840
Here's the thing.

353
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,840
We take this matter very seriously.

354
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,320
We are going to

355
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,279
contact our superiors right away.

356
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,759
We can assure you that the procuratorate

357
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,440
will lead

358
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
a thorough investigation

359
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,120
to ensure the safety of the kids, okay?

360
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,200
We need a deadline.

361
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,399
You can't keep us waiting.

362
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,120
One week.

363
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,200
No, three days.

364
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:38,720
Okay, three days.

365
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:40,919
We'll come back with an answer.

366
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,679
Why don't you go home first?

367
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:43,879
It's not nice

368
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,840
to keep making a fuss, okay?

369
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,200
Shall we...

370
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Let's go home.

371
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,879
In three days, okay?

372
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,559
Sure.

373
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:52,039
Three days only.

374
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,519
Okay, let me see you out.

375
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,519
Hou.

376
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:55,799
See them out.

377
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,080
What is going on exactly?

378
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,360
Why did that become our work?

379
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Hou, explain to them.

380
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,120
Well...

381
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,720
The police did come,
but there was nothing

382
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,080
to investigate.

383
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,440
And it's the key moment

384
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,919
before the college entrance exam.

385
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,639
I know not all the kids
are going to take the exam.

386
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,279
But if anyone gets implicated,

387
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,039
their lives would be ruined.

388
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,240
How many victims are there?

389
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,480
I've asked around.

390
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,679
They wouldn't tell me.

391
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,559
Who discovered this?

392
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,639
Well...

393
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,440
Prosecutors.

394
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,679
Let us look into it on our own.

395
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,480
We've troubled you so much.

396
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,440
Are you saying

397
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,399
that I gave assurance

398
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,240
to those parents

399
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,559
just to get them to leave?

400
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,080
No, no.

401
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,279
How about this?

402
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,960
We'll call the police.

403
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,240
Let them handle it.

404
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:52,759
I'll do it.

405
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,240
Wait. No rush.

406
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,039
We're obligated
to look into it ourselves.

407
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,879
The students are preparing for the exam.

408
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,279
Let's keep it to ourselves.

409
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,600
Maybe there is another solution.

410
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,840
Wait here.

411
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,679
I need a word with you.

412
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,360
What?

413
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,159
Come out.

414
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,399
Bai Enyu, listen.

415
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,200
We must know our places

416
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
when we're out handling cases.

417
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,559
Yeah, of course.

418
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,399
You are the leader.

419
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,480
I am your subordinate.

420
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,679
I won't be so lenient again.

421
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,919
Alright, let's talk business.

422
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,879
Can we

423
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,039
look into this ourselves?

424
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,720
Want to join the police force?

425
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,279
In that case, tell Captain Du

426
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,000
and work there,

427
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,039
not at the procuratorate.

428
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,440
Well, Madam.

429
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,159
Listen.

430
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,360
Even if we call the police,

431
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,879
there is no evidence.

432
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,799
It's nothing but

433
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,840
a public security issue.

434
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,279
But those are
sensitive photos of the girls.

435
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,919
If we make a fuss about it,

436
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,000
they'll be affected.

437
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,879
You're lecturing me?

438
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:54,039
I know it concerns the girls' privacy.

439
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,120
But the best choice

440
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,480
is to call the police.

441
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,720
How can we solve cases?

442
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:00,480
But we're responsible
for prosecutorial oversight.

443
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,000
Besides,

444
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,720
ordinary students

445
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,399
haven't dealt with the police before.

446
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,319
They'll be nervous.

447
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,960
Who would offer any clues?

448
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,000
We're doing this for the kids.

449
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,160
That's the purpose, right?

450
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,640
Trying to show off, huh?

451
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,680
You think I don't know?

452
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,480
Sure, you know the best.

453
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:15,559
It's your call.

454
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,839
I have to make it formal

455
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,880
with Prosecutor Zheng.

456
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,039
Again?

457
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,079
This is the procedure.

458
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,880
Fine.

459
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,000
Go ahead.

460
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,759
Ms. Zheng.

461
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:35,960
Listen.

462
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,440
We spoke with our superiors.

463
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,440
We will

464
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,960
take the initiative
to look into this case.

465
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,079
Police will intervene

466
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,160
once we have evidence.

467
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,720
Okay.

468
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,920
To protect the children's privacy,

469
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,720
I suggest that

470
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,599
the teachers
stay out of the investigation.

471
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,480
Is that okay?

472
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,680
You don't know anything about the kids.

473
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,440
Bring the girl who spoke to you

474
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,119
this morning

475
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,480
and we'll figure it out.

476
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:04,240
Listen.

477
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:08,240
You can skip the questions
you don't want to answer.

478
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,839
Okay?

479
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,759
When were you photographed?

480
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,960
I'm not in the photos.

481
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,640
You're not?

482
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,440
Do you recognize the victims?

483
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,079
Don't be nervous.

484
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,680
We are here to help.

485
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,839
Tell us what you know.

486
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,319
These photos don't even show the faces.

487
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:37,480
People are reluctant to admit

488
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,759
that they're in the photos.

489
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,720
To file a report is like

490
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,200
admitting it.

491
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,559
Everyone at school will know.

492
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,720
The perpetrator

493
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,000
surely knows that too.

494
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,240
But I think

495
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:52,000
if everyone keeps silent,

496
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,079
more girls will be bullied.

497
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,319
Where did you see those photos?

498
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:08,240
It's her.

499
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,079
Floral pattern.

500
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,799
What did you say?

501
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:13,960
Nothing.

502
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,319
Your phone.

503
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,839
Why should I?

504
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,720
Do you hear me?

505
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,359
Alright.

506
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:20,920
Here.

507
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,519
I dragged him to the director's office.

508
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,440
Director Hou took his phone

509
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,880
and said he'd handle it.

510
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,240
But nothing happened.

511
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,160
He's unreliable.

512
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,480
I should have called the police.

513
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,559
So these photos

514
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,119
were taken by that boy, right?

515
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,640
He said his roommate

516
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,440
received the photos
from someone in the other dorm.

517
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,359
That guy received the photos

518
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,279
from the guy in his upper bunk.

519
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,519
That guy received the photos

520
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,440
from someone
in the second-year pastry class.

521
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,519
That guy received the photos
from the hotel...

522
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,400
He's obviously brushing you off.

523
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,680
Tell me his name.

524
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,440
I'll talk to him.

525
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,039
She hasn't finished yet.

526
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,160
Go on.

527
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,119
That guy

528
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:04,880
received the photos

529
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,920
from someone
in the hotel management class.

530
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
That guy downloaded

531
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,599
the photos from the internet.

532
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,319
That's where it ends.

533
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,039
Carry on.

534
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,039
I'll go to the bathroom.

535
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,359
Who sent the photo

536
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,119
after that video

537
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,000
last night?

538
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,799
No idea.

539
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,200
Why do you care who took it?

540
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,039
Just watch it.

541
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,759
I don't want the videos anymore.

542
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,920
I only want photos.

543
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:34,720
(Men's Restroom)

544
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,240
That prosecutor guy

545
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,359
looked crazy.

546
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:38,799
He thought he was the director.

547
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,200
Totally.

548
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,720
I deleted that video

549
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,440
downloaded in class
with a nervous shake.

550
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,079
Send me some more.

551
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,519
Skipping classes?

552
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,920
Don't you see?

553
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,039
Nature's call.

554
00:20:58,839 --> 00:20:59,960
Go on.

555
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,000
Lost the urge?

556
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:02,279
We're done.

557
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,640
Quite addicted, huh?

558
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,839
It covered the toilet's smell.

559
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,279
How many did you smoke?

560
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,880
It wasn't us, sir.

561
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,440
It wasn't you?

562
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,400
That's right.

563
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm calling your parents.

564
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,000
Prosecutor Bai.

565
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:27,359
Who gives you the right
to call our parents?

566
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
You're not our teacher.

567
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:30,079
That's right.

568
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,200
I'm a vice principal of the campaign.

569
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,519
That gives me the right.

570
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,039
Alright.

571
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,680
I'll get someone to discipline you.

572
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,039
Director Hou or Principal Wang.

573
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,480
Choose one.

574
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,519
Sir, we apologize.

575
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,000
Sorry.

576
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,039
Sorry.

577
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,319
You apologize?

578
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,119
- Yeah.
- Straighten up.

579
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:56,920
Don't you hear me?

580
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,720
Straighten up.

581
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,480
I can't.

582
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,880
My back hurts.

583
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,960
Straighten up
even if your back is broken.

584
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,960
Have you seen the photos
circulating among guys?

585
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,240
Who sent those?

586
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,559
What photos?

587
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,559
Anything nice?

588
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,960
Stop wasting time.

589
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,799
Tell the teachers.
Tell my parents. Whatever.

590
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,680
(Men's restroom)
Bai Enyu, are you in there?

591
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,359
Bai Enyu.

592
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,640
Bai Enyu, come out.

593
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,799
Or I'm going in.

594
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:42,640
Principal Bai.

595
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:45,680
Your superior is calling you.

596
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,839
I'm coming in.

597
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,240
Enough.

598
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,359
Vice principal.

599
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,759
Are you serious?

600
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,759
Men's restroom.

601
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,599
Stop yelling.

602
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,640
That's inappropriate.

603
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,880
What were you doing?

604
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,880
Using the bathroom, of course.

605
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
You think I was smoking?

606
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:16,880
Hello, Madam.

607
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,160
Hello, Madam.

608
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,559
What was that?

609
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,319
What does it mean?

610
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,240
How would I know?

611
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,799
What were you saying in there?

612
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,920
Nothing specific.

613
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,759
Didn't I remind you

614
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,039
to follow procedures

615
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,440
and act according to the law?

616
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,640
I was just having a minor inquiry

617
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:41,640
with a few students.

618
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,599
Enough with your little tricks.

619
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,079
If you managed

620
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,160
to get something out of that girl,

621
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,000
my little tricks would be unnecessary.

622
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,160
Isn't it obvious that these boys did it?

623
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,559
Giving the verdict now?

624
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,880
Aren't we still investigating?

625
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,200
Besides,

626
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,559
black or white,
if it can catch mice, it's a good cat.

627
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,000
Who's catching mice here?

628
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,480
Is this Tom and Jerry?

629
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:04,319
Fine.

630
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,568
- Do it your way.
- Ms. Lin.

631
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,039
- What's wrong?
- We caught the perpetrator.

632
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,480
(Women's bath)
Come out!

633
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,079
Listen carefully!

634
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,720
We're giving you one last chance.

635
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
Hurry up and come out!

636
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,640
- Do you hear us?
- Come out!

637
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,559
I'm telling you.

638
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,279
If you don't come out, we'll break in.

639
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,759
Come out.

640
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,279
Here.

641
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:30,799
Right here.

642
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,440
Come out.

643
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,839
Come out.

644
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:36,240
What's going on?

645
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,400
Enough.

646
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,960
What happened?

647
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,480
Ms. Lin.

648
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
What happened?

649
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,079
We caught the perpetrator.

650
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,119
But he won't come out.

651
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,839
Did you see who it is?

652
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,839
A man.

653
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,000
About this high.

654
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,279
He sneaked in.

655
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,480
- He's alone in there?
- It's him?

656
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,119
Yeah, the bath is not open yet.

657
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,559
Yeah, he's alone.

658
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,400
Kid.

659
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,279
Catch him.

660
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,200
Catch him.

661
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,200
Be quiet.

662
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,279
Stop yelling.

663
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,000
Let me open it.

664
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,359
Ms. Lin, step aside.

665
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,359
I'll kick it open.

666
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,240
Enough.

667
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,759
Don't destroy public property.

668
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,440
Let me do it.

669
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,160
Kid.

670
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,119
Everyone's here.

671
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:14,000
You can't run away.

672
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
If you're innocent,

673
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,400
we won't wrong you.

674
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,480
Your vice principal is here.

675
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,240
She's our best prosecutor.

676
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,319
Stop introducing me.

677
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,240
Talk business.

678
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,039
This is psychological warfare.

679
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,119
Come out. It's done either way.

680
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,640
Let's get over it.

681
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,039
Quit the street talk.

682
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Kid, listen to me.

683
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,319
You have nowhere to go now, right?

684
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,559
I can see your figure

685
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,559
through this pane of thin glass.

686
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,359
Okay?

687
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,200
It's done either way. Let's get over it.

688
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:42,839
Okay?

689
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:43,920
Kid.

690
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:45,759
Quit the street talk.

691
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,240
Who is it? It's open.

692
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,440
It's Director Hou.

693
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,559
Look, it's Director Hou.

694
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,680
It's really him.

695
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,640
It's really him.

696
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,799
Director Hou is the perpetrator.

697
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,559
I am the "perpetrator".

698
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,119
Enough, you're rubbing your skin off.

699
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:14,200
Keep your dignity. Stop it.

700
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,319
I swear it wasn't me.

701
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,799
So what were you doing
in the women's bath?

702
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,200
I heard there was a perpetrator.

703
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,599
I went to catch him.

704
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,000
And they said, "Done."

705
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,240
(Setting a camera in women's bath, 3 PM today)
I became the "perpetrator".

706
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,119
So you were set up.

707
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,160
Yeah.

708
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,279
How...

709
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,279
How did you become the director?

710
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,240
You...

711
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,000
You're too kind.

712
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,359
Didn't we tell you

713
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,920
to stay out of it?

714
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,000
We said that, right?

715
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,680
Here.

716
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,640
Take a look. It's all here.

717
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,279
We just run

718
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,759
a simple check.

719
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,279
There are photos

720
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,160
and obscene videos from abroad.

721
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,480
More than half of the boys

722
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,400
are watching these.

723
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,720
Prosecutors,

724
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,319
please tell me.

725
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,128
What...

726
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,759
What should we do?

727
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,200
Have the police arrest them all?

728
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,720
Interrogate and punish them one by one?

729
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,039
Many students

730
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,000
are hoping to give it a shot

731
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:49,680
at the college entrance exam.

732
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:53,200
Shall we ruin their dream
because of this?

733
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,359
- Come out.
- Calm down, everyone.

734
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:58,359
Please be quiet.

735
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,359
Calm down.

736
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,519
Calm down.

737
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:02,319
He didn't let us call the police.

738
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,440
Call the police.

739
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,599
Call the police.

740
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,160
We must call the police.

741
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Kids, we are already working on it.

742
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Calm down.

743
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,960
Everyone, calm down.

744
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,480
Go back now. We are working on it.

745
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,160
Stop yelling.

746
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,480
Listen, kids.

747
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,440
Director Hou

748
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,119
is not the perpetrator.

749
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:19,920
You got him wrong.

750
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,839
Feel free to tell us your demands.

751
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,920
Okay?

752
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,960
Call the police.

753
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,319
Or we'll do it ourselves.

754
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,519
Yeah.

755
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,079
Call the police.

756
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,359
Hear us out, okay?

757
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:29,960
Easy, kids.

758
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,640
Listen.

759
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,680
No problem.

760
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,519
We can call the police.

761
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,920
Our investigation

762
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,599
shows that

763
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,680
three schools in Yunhai

764
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,960
have the same uniforms as yours.

765
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:39,920
So the clothes in the photo

766
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,000
can't prove

767
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,920
that the victim is from our school.

768
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,519
Therefore,

769
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,200
I need the victim

770
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,480
to report this to the police with us.

771
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,119
It will help with
the investigation, okay?

772
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,680
Rest assured.

773
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,960
We will accompany you

774
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,599
to explain this to the police.

775
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,559
She should come forward.

776
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:06,640
That's right.

777
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,480
Otherwise, it's a false accusation.

778
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,240
That's me.

779
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,200
I am the victim.

780
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,119
That was my photo.

781
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,279
Xia Qiu.

782
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,759
I'm really curious.

783
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,559
Which photo is yours?

784
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,000
Yeah.

785
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,880
Which part of your body?

786
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,119
Stop making a fuss.

787
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,440
Shut up.

788
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,039
Don't try to humiliate anyone.

789
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,559
The teachers are clueless.

790
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,440
The girls won't come forward.

791
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
The boys are all so nasty.

792
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,559
Any ideas?

793
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,200
We made a slight mistake just now.

794
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,960
We shouldn't have focused

795
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,400
on the victims.

796
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,240
We shouldn't pressure them, right?

797
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,440
These girls

798
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,119
did nothing wrong.

799
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,799
They got bullied

800
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,920
and were too embarrassed

801
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,720
to speak out.

802
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,480
How is that fair?

803
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,240
The perpetrators should

804
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,160
feel embarrassed.

805
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,920
Girls at this age

806
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,440
are generally shy.

807
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,079
It's normal to be embarrassed.

808
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,240
I didn't feel embarrassed

809
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,200
when I was their age.

810
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,240
Whoever offends me

811
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,279
should be embarrassed.

812
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,920
Not everyone is like you,

813
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,079
Prosecutor Lin.

814
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,799
When the perpetrator is brazen,

815
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,799
the victims get confused.

816
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,559
Especially when a group of rascals

817
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,559
are making a fuss.

818
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,160
When they got hyped up,

819
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,680
the girls would wonder

820
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,880
whether she should feel embarrassed.

821
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,119
When I was their age...

822
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,920
I know them too well.

823
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,920
You shouldn't have
stopped me in the restroom.

824
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,880
I don't want to

825
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,599
clean up your mess again.

826
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,960
You're a prosecutor.

827
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,240
Watch your words.

828
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:44,880
Neither of the cats

829
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,799
can catch the mice.

830
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,599
What do we do?

831
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,240
Aren't you the best prosecutor?

832
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,599
Enlighten me.

833
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:51,680
In that case,

834
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,079
let's try with other cats.

835
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,799
What kind of cat

836
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,119
is that?

837
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:58,319
A tabby cat.

838
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,200
I stepped forward today

839
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,559
to encourage them.

840
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,119
Let's say we manage
to bring the police here.

841
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,240
The real victims must step forward.

842
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,759
I wanted to step forward

843
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,599
but I was too scared.

844
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:17,559
You don't want your parents to worry?

845
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,319
But with such a commotion,

846
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,200
they must be more terrified.

847
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,160
What's this?

848
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,839
A homemade cat bed.

849
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,960
Oh my god, it's so ugly.

850
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,480
This isn't waterproof, right?

851
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,039
Maybe.

852
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,079
Sibao.

853
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:46,279
Sibao seems to have lost weight.

854
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,519
No way.

855
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,440
It ate a big bowl of food

856
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,640
this morning.

857
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:53,960
Oh.

858
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:56,079
Did your mom agree
to let you keep Sibao?

859
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,559
I haven't told her yet.

860
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Well...

861
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,680
I'm sorry.

862
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,880
I didn't stand up for you today.

863
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,240
It's okay. It's not your fault.

864
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,279
Xia Qiu.

865
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,119
Which photo is yours?

866
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,720
I dare you to come here.

867
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,559
Coward.

868
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,559
Tell the teacher
I'm going to the bathroom.

869
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,559
Okay, bro.

870
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,680
Why did the prosecutors leave?

871
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:16,759
You're on your own?

872
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:20,599
Will you stop?

873
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:27,680
What are you doing?

874
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Class monitor.

875
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,039
Trying to be the hero, huh?

876
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,319
Look at your face, loser.

877
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,839
Can't get up, huh?

878
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,200
Stop acting tough, sissy.

879
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,000
What are you doing?

880
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,200
Why are you so careless?

881
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,119
It's you again.

882
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,599
I'm helping him, sir.

883
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,039
Go back to your seat.

884
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,240
(Knowledgeable and skilled
Honest and friendly)

885
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,119
Zhen Rong.

886
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:51,799
Hand them out.

887
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,240
Tomorrow afternoon,

888
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,279
there will be an exam
on school regulations.

889
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,400
Another exam?

890
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
Stop complaining.

891
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,480
It's just an exam.

892
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,519
You know very well

893
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,920
why we're holding this exam.

894
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,119
Stop discussing

895
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
the photographs.

896
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,880
Don't cause further trouble.

897
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,960
Many of you are going to

898
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,800
take the college entrance exam.

899
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,760
Prioritize what's important.

900
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,079
Don't ruin your future.

901
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,039
Focus on the study.

902
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,480
Tian Jun.

903
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,000
Oh my, I...

904
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,679
I was kicked out.

905
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:06,960
(Removed from the group chat)
What happened?

906
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,079
Why am I also kicked out?

907
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,960
(Study material sharing group)
Look.

908
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,360
- Me too.
- For real?

909
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
What's going on?

910
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,800
I was also kicked out.

911
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,159
I was kicked out.

912
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,208
(School regulations exam)

913
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Alright, kids.

914
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,239
The exam begins.

915
00:35:34,548 --> 00:35:38,159
(School regulations exam)

916
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,280
(This question is only for girls.)

917
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,800
(If you're a victim or have clues about)

918
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,760
(non-consensual intimate photography,)

919
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:46,039
(please choose D.)

920
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:04,840
Attention.

921
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,599
How can you fail a test

922
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,280
on the school regulations?

923
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,840
Can't you work harder?

924
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,159
Tian Jun, Yang Lei, Fu Xiaobing, Li Yan.

925
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,840
Take the makeup exam

926
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,519
at the lab tomorrow.

927
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,079
Niu Yuanyuan, Du Xin.

928
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,599
Take the makeup exam
in the lecture hall.

929
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:34,199
Xia Qiu?

930
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,159
You failed, too?

931
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,719
How did you even fail that?

932
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:42,920
Go with the two of them tomorrow.

933
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
Everyone, put more effort.

934
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,400
Study harder.

935
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,760
Show your fighting spirit.

936
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,400
Alright.

937
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,000
Go back to study.

938
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:02,239
Sorry,

939
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:03,880
I gathered you here like this.

940
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,440
Don't worry.

941
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,840
Ms. Lin.

942
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,519
Have a seat.

943
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,039
Right now,

944
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,039
everybody thinks

945
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,440
that you're taking a makeup exam.

946
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,239
So please trust us, alright?

947
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,440
Thank you, Ms. Lin.

948
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,440
I know it might be a bit awkward.

949
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,719
But please try to find your photos.

950
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,000
Try to recall

951
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,639
the moment it was taken.

952
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,360
Take your time. Examine them well.

953
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:06,880
Madam.

954
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:10,440
I think I was photographed
during the physical education class.

955
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,360
It was raining.

956
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,280
We had the lesson in the gym.

957
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,840
The track and field team

958
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,679
and the basketball team were also there.

959
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,000
Physical education.

960
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,960
Track and field team.

961
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Basketball team.

962
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:24,920
Basketball team.

963
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,920
Narrow it down.

964
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:30,920
I was photographed
after the flag-raising ceremony

965
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,280
when I was climbing the stairs.

966
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,719
I'm from the nursing class.

967
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,639
Flag-raising...

968
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,199
Everyone was present?

969
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,800
It's hard to narrow it down.

970
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:41,880
Can you provide

971
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,039
some information

972
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,239
to narrow it down?

973
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,679
I was photographed
at the safety lecture.

974
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,400
We were

975
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,559
with the college entrance exam class

976
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:50,920
in the lecture hall.

977
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,760
I was photographed
when entering the classroom.

978
00:38:54,784 --> 00:38:56,079
I'm from the auto repair class.

979
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,039
Auto repair.

980
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
Auto repair.

981
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,599
Track and field. Basketball.

982
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,224
Yeah.

983
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,800
There aren't many students

984
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,679
on those two teams.

985
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,639
Only six.

986
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:15,320
Six?

987
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,519
- Okay.
- One from the auto repair.

988
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,599
Luo Shiyuan.

989
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,440
S-H-I-Y-U-A-N.

990
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,400
Two from
the entrance exam class.

991
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,280
Li Wanyou.

992
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,519
I wore rain boots in the photo.

993
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,679
I think it rained
during the safety lecture, too.

994
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:41,159
Yeah, it also rained
during the flag-raising ceremony.

995
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,880
Take a closer look.

996
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,360
We have plenty of time.

997
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:53,216
(Suspects of non-consensual photography)

998
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,039
Madam.

999
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,159
I figured out who did it.

1000
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,480
Tian Jun.

1001
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,159
It's him.

1002
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,360
What's going on?

1003
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,760
Holding a meeting here?

1004
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,519
Whose umbrella is this?

1005
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,360
It's mine.

1006
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:45,320
Call the police.

1007
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:50,079
Zhen Rong.

1008
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,679
Come out for a second.

1009
00:41:03,508 --> 00:41:05,152
(Grade 12, Class 5)

1010
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,679
Zhen Rong, right?

1011
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:09,440

the study material sharing group,

1012
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,400
