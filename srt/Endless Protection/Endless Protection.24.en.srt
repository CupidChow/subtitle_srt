00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,839
After passing two more villages,
we'll reach Hu Minmin's hometown.

Mr. Hu.

11
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:27,960
Come on.

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,800
They're the police officers
and the prosecutors here

13
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,120
to investigate the situation.

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,919
They want to ask about your daughter.

15
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,000
Your daughter who was born around 1993,

16
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,759
Hu Meimei,

17
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:48,759
passed away last September.

18
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,680
I don't know her.

19
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:54,599
Did she leave any money?

20
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
Do you even think about the money?

21
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,159
Your daughter is gone.

22
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,599
If not for these

23
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:02,919
useless girls,

24
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,520
how could our family

25
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,639
end up like this now?

26
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,400
The son of the cripple
from the east end of the village

27
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,680
died at the construction site,

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,080
and they paid a lot.

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,319
How did she die?

30
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,479
Any compensation?

31
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,840
Even if she left money,

32
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,080
how can you prove

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
that she is your daughter?

34
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,719
What proof do you need?

35
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,599
Why don't you draw my blood,

36
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:27,639
and take it for testing?

37
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,319
Did she ever send letters

38
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,560
or anything else home?

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
This unfilial daughter

40
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,759
became successful,

41
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,719
but she didn't send me some money.

42
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,919
How do you know that?

43
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,199
Did she come back?

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,639
You officials

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,759
just came to ask about something,

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,439
without bringing anything along.

47
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
- Leave here. You're not welcome.
- Stop!

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,240
Speak nicely.

49
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,120
Don't get physical.

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,840
What's going on?

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,639
I haven't broken any law.

00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:06,879
Ms. Lin.

54
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,120
Isn't it information
about Wan Xuemin's school?

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,159
You didn't know?

56
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,079
What's wrong?

57
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,959
Just because she's a girl,

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,120
you treated her badly.

59
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,279
When she was alive,

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,360
if you had any conscience,

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,439
even if you were nice

62
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,160
to her,

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,279
she wouldn't die,

64
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,519
and you wouldn't live so poorly.

65
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,399
If you have any questions, just ask me.

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,160
I haven't seen her for a long time.

67
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,360
It's Meimei.

68
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,800
Meimei is the youngest in our family.

69
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
When she was thirteen,

70
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,120
she went out to learn dancing.

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
I thought

72
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,240
for a girl of that age,

73
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,639
it's not good to go out.

74
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,519
But my dad said

75
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,399
it's fine if she can earn money.

76
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,360
So do you have any impression
of the person

77
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,839
who took her out?

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,319
I don't remember too clearly.

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,040
I just remember a man
who was of medium height,

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,959
and looked quite decent.

81
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,800
He even said the name
Meimei wasn't good,

82
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,279
and changed it to Minmin,
which could change her fate.

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,759
So I really don't have to pay tuition?

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,040
You really don't.

85

We provide food and lodging.

86
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,879
Dancing is a skill learned

87
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:39,920
from a young age.

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
Once your daughter is trained,

89
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,920
she can help you earn performance fees.

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,920
So Hu Minmin is the youngest
in your family?

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,160
Yes.

92
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,439
My dad didn't care for her.

93
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,439
I was the one who raised her
from a young age.

94
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,160
Isn't there an even younger sister?

95
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,959
Her name is Hu Li.

96
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,759
Think about it again.

97
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,399
She's about eight years old,

98
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,839
being always with Hu Minmin.

99
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,360
That...

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,279
That's her daughter.

101
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,959
You mean

102
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,959
Hu Li is Hu Minmin's daughter.

103
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,560
Are you sure?

104
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,040
Which "Li" is in Hu Li's name?

105
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
"Li" from "litchi".

106
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,120
Right, she is her daughter.

107
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm sure. She is her daughter.

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,160
When Hu Minmin was pregnant with Hu Li,

109
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,879
she was under fourteen years old.

110
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,120
Li Xiaoyao,

111
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
call Captain Du.

112
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,160
Confirm

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,800
the DNA of Hu Li and Wan Xuemin.

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,240
Okay.

115
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,079
I should have helped her earlier.

116
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,160
Who?

117
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,920
Meimei.

118
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,959
You're back.

119
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,160
Whose child is this?

120
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,720
Speak up!

121
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,399
Stop crying!

122
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm so unlucky to have you.

123
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,800
What a disgrace!

124
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,160
Your grandchild will be born.

125
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,759
Right.

126
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,319
Congratulations.

127
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,519
You'll soon be a grandmother.

128
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,959
I will be a grandmother.

129
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,240
Do you know if it's a boy or girl?

130
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,680
They are the same.

131
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,360
That's true.

132
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,480
That's how things are now.

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,360
Excuse me, Madam, may I interrupt?

134
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,480
Do you know Hu Meimei?

135
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,480
Hu Meimei?

136
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,120
I haven't seen her for long.

137
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,360
I heard she had only come back
once or twice, right?

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,120
Even so,

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,960
she took all girls away
from the village.

140
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
I don't know why.

141
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,639
Ask her. Her child left with Meimei.

142
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,679
My daughter Fang went to dance.

143
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,240
What nonsense are you talking?

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,679
I'm not just talking about your family.

145
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,240
I'm just saying no one has come back.

146
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,960
I've said

147
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,679
they went out dancing
and didn't come back.

148
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,559
There are similar girls in village.

149
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,480
They all went.

150
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,159
Some from neighboring village went too.

151
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,080
Moreover,

152
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,200
they have got paid.

153
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
We didn't lose out.

154
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:13,840
These

155
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,039
are information about

156
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,320
all current students,

157
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
temporary students, and all graduates

158
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,720
of Wannian Xingchen Dance School.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
There are 640 records altogether.

160
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
(Personal information files),
But there might be some spectators,

161
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,519
or those without recorded files.

162
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,440
They might be more difficult to trace.

163
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,440
Understood.

164
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:30,919
Regarding Hu Li,

165
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,279
the DNA test report is out.

166
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:32,879
How's it going?

167
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,440
It is different from what we imagined.

168
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,200
This Hu Li has no blood relation
with Wan Xuemin.

169
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,679
But don't worry,

170
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,720
no matter who her biological father is,

171
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,200
we will definitely find him.

172
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,960
Just

173
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,600
this proof

174
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,000
cannot be used as evidence
against Wan Xuemin.

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,080
What on earth has Hu Minmin experienced?

176
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,399
I dare not imagine.

177
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,720
Then let's refocus our attention.

178
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:54,919
No problem.

179
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,039
Our police information system

180
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,000
can first perform a verification

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
to confirm the accurate
contact information

182
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,279
of everyone.

183
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,159
Alright, narrow down the scope.

184
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,480
Hu Minmin's ID card

185
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,320
is a fake ID.

186
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,639
Therefore, she cannot go too far.

187
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,000
We'll take Fujiang Bay
and Yunhai as the radius

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,480
and search within this area, okay?

189
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,279
We can do that,

190
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,039
but the follow-up investigation work

191
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,080
might be troublesome.

192
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,080
Because our team

193
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,399
has two special cases
to handle this month,

194
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,200
so we'll have to allocate much manpower.

195
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,639
It's clearly impossible.

196
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:23,720
I understand.

197
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:27,039
Cheng Wei has already gone
to seek assistance.

198
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,559
Let's see if we can add staff.

199
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,200
But according to the current clues,

200
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,480
we can only take Hu Minmin's photo

201
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,840
and go from door to door locally

202
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,759
to inquire.

203
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,600
Do you need help?

204
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,720
Prosecutor Zheng.

205
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,600
No one has called me like this
in a long time.

206
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,440
We'd call you Chairman Zheng.

207
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,279
I've heard about the case.

208
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:47,440
Is it difficult?

209
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,519
It's too difficult.

210
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,399
There are many potential victims
in this case.

211
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:52,799
We need to conduct

212
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,519
a large-scale dragnet.

213
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:56,080
We are understaffed.

214
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,159
The pressure is too much.

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,559
Don't forget we have
over 600 women's directors.

216
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:02,879
Communication is what Women's
Federation does best.

217
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,120
That's great.

218
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,919
Then we'll have to trouble them

219
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,679
to assist us.

220
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,159
In follow-up, we'll

221
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,600
promptly secure the evidence.

222
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,440
Leave it to us.

223
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,039
Alright.

224
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,519
Thank you.

225
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Madam, have you seen her?

226
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,559
Her name is Hu Minmin.

227
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,559
Take a close look.

228
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,799
If you spot her, let us know.

229
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:21,600
Thank you.

230
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,159
Our work on anti-domestic violence

231
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,879
must go into villages and towns.

232
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,960
The publicity plan must

233
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,320
- avoid creating aversion in people.
- Okay.

234
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,769
(Yunhai Area Map)

235
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,840
Hello, may we come in?

236
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,879
Let's split up and act separately.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,279
Then I'll go this way.

238
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,519
Mr. Cao.

239
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,200
You finally came.

240
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,600
Where is the person?

241
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,519
Officer,

242
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,000
this is my daughter.

243
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,639
I already have a child.

244
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,759
Can we let that thing go?

245
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,879
I... I greatly respect your opinion.

246
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,120
Can you give me a few minutes

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,279
to have a chat with you?

248
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,320
I'm not a timid person,

249
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,080
- but...
- You're not timid.

250
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,279
You just want to protect your child.

251
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,000
I think your child will understand you.

252
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,559
Let's go.

253
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:09,120
(Interrogation Record)

254
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,399
You were conscious, right?

255
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,759
Yes.

256
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:20,960
He...

257
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,639
He pressed my head.

258
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,279
He kept telling me not
to turn my head that way,

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,399
and told me not to lower my head.

260
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
What are you doing?

261
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,360
Wan Xuemin has changed.

262
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,200
What?

263
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,600
His criminal behavior has two phases.

264
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,600
Look at this again.

265
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:07,675
(2009 He raped me in the office and
pressed me to look at the right corner.)

266
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:12,866
(2012 He covered his face and ripped off my clothes.
He pinched me and laughed at my screaming.)

267
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,960
From 2010 to present, Wan Xuemin has used
drug-facilitated offenses

268
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
and mind control

269
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,200
against the victims.

270
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,200
He wanted them
to remain silent and still

271
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,519
to completely obey.

272
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,519
But before 2010,

273
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,840
among the victims during that period,

274
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,840
they described

275
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,320
Wan Xuemin's behavior as theatrical.

276
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,600
He wanted the victims
to present themselves

277
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,919
and react.

278
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,480
Some victims mentioned

279
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,200
when Wan Xuemin

280
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,919
sexually assaulted them back then,

281
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,919
he wanted their faces

282
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,320
to be at a specific angle.

283
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,720
So we suspect

284
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,960
Wan Xuemin,
in the early stages of his crimes,

285
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,600
took a large number of such videos,

286
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,480
and possibly even sold them.

287
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,679
I speculate that period was
from approximately 2007 to around 2010.

288
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,679
We did indeed receive some reports

289
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,519
on child pornography websites.

290
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,440
However, these websites
are very cunning,

291
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,879
instantly relocating.

292
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:10,679
Fortunately,

293
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:12,600
we preserved the data
in a timely manner.

294
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,600
Now we can compare them
to check for dance school students.

295
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,039
Can this help narrow down the scope?

296
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,159
By the way,

297
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,679
Procuratorate this time

298
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,840
really did a great job.

299
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,480
With the leads you provided,

300
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,080
we can narrow down this scope

301
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,000
by 90 percent.

302
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,039
Alright.

303
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,320
Leave the rest to us.

304
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,600
Okay, I understand.

305
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,039
Okay, thank you.

306
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,720
Based on the video,
the police found so many victims.

307
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,279
Our speculation is correct,

308
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,399
in line with our conclusions.

309
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:39,399
However...

310
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,320
Look carefully.

(Wannian Xingchen Dance School)

312
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,519
So many children.

313
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,919
Still life imprisonment?

314
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,720
Death penalty.

is now in session.

318
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,440
Please bring the defendant to courtroom.

00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,679
According to the victim's statement,

320

the Defendant, Wan Xuemin

321
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,480
has engaged

322
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,039
in dance teaching since 2006.

323
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,639
Since 2007,

324
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,879
he established
the Wannian Xingchen Dance School.

325
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,559
During the eight years

326
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,359
from 2007 to 2015,

327
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,799
under the pretext
of correcting dance movements,

328
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
he repeatedly

329
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,400
molested 54 young girls
in public places,

330
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,039

the victim's character traits

331

and select targets for sexual assault.

332
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,200
Subsequently,

333
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,079
Wan Xuemin used

334
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,480
his position as head of the school,
under the guise of individual tutoring

335
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,920
moral education, and cleaning

336
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,079

Cao Meiyuan, Wei Xiangli,

337

Wang Yuqing, and ten other young girls

338
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,119
to rehearsal rooms,

339
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,119

340
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,960
equipment rooms,

341
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,279
and other places
to rape them repeatedly.

342
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,839
The first time
was in the top-floor dance classroom.

343
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:45,359
He covered my mouth.

344
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,079
I was terribly frightened,

345
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,000
and then I started to struggle.

346
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,599
But struggling is useless.

347
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,799
Eventually, I stopped struggling.

348
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,839
I was twelve back then.

349
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:58,359
My parents said

350
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,200
going out to learn to dance with
my sister would lead to opportunities.

351
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,359
I'm afraid my husband
will find out this.

352
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,960
But I don't want anyone else

353
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,200
to experience this again.

354
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,000
That day,

355
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,519
I will never forget that day.

356
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:19,599
He told me to tidy up the equipment room

357
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,799
and then locked the door.

358
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,480
My child can no longer speak.

359
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,440
She's gone mad.

360
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,440
But,

361
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,920
she always wakes up suddenly at night,

362
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,960
crying

363
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,799
and shouting.

364
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,720
She said that someone is staring at her

365
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,359
and there are ghosts in the hallway.

366
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,839
Could you introduce yourself?

367
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,079
I am a dance teacher

368
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,240
at Wannian Xingchen.

369
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,279
I've seen him leave female students

370
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,279
alone in the rooftop dance room.

371
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,279
I've also seen some children

372
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,279
leave while crying.

373
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,640
Tell me

374
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,440
why you choose to come
forward to testify.

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,200
Because I am a teacher.

376
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,799
I cannot let him tarnish
this profession.

377
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,440
Regarding the victim's statement,

378
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,960
the substantive authenticity,

379
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,039
legality,

380
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,119
relevance,

381
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,759
and purpose of proof

382
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:37,680
are not recognized.

383
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,000
The victim's statement

384
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,960
provided by the prosecutor

385
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,599
is only subjective evidence,

386
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,920
without objective evidence.

387
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,279
In the course of time,

388
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,000
the so-called facts mentioned
by these victims

389
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,279
are completely unverifiable.

390
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,519
Criminal proceedings

391
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,839
should prioritize evidence

392
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,440
and thorough investigation.

393
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,680
The unverified things

394
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,599
cannot be the basis for a verdict.

395
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,799
You bad guy, you are so heartless.

396
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,400
Victim's family, please be quiet, quiet.

397
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,400
You are so heartless.

398
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:12,359
This is a court.

399
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,319
I understand your feelings,

400
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,400
but please do not disrupt court order.

401
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,160
Prosecutor, please present the evidence.

402
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,160
I have another piece of evidence here.

403
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,160
This evidence

404
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,359
comes from a woman who should

405
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,799
have stood trial,

406
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,680
but she can't come today,

407
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,480
because she died half a year ago.

408
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,839
Her real name is Hu Meimei.

409
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:37,039
She once helped Wan Xuemin
commit a crime.

410
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,559
At the same time,
she was also one of the earliest

411
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,720
underage victims

412
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,680
victimized by Wan Xuemin.

413
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,160
In this recording device,

414
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,880
there is evidence of Wan Xuemin's rape.

415
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,200
On September 9, 2015,

416
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,240
at Wan Xuemin's request, Hu Minmin

417
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,839
lured the victim Cui Jiayi

418
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,039
(Evidence)
to Wannian Xingchen Dance School.

419
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,359
Before Wan Xuemin committed the rape,

420
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,519
to preserve the evidence,

421
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,079
Hu Minmin

422
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:10,559
left a recording device there.

423
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:19,072
(Wannian Xingchen Dance School)

424
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:35,440
(Hu Minmin MP3 recording)
You're here.

425
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,319
Who is she?

426
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,640
What do you think?

427
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,799
(Wannian Xingchen Dance School)

428
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:45,559
What's wrong?

429
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,160
She fainted.

430
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,440
You made her faint.

431
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,519
Right.

432
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,519
Isn't this convenient for you?

433
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,119
There really isn't anyone left
in the village.

434
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,880
This is the only way I could think of.

435
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,336
How did you make her faint?

436
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,039
I fed her something to drink.

437
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,279
Relax.

438
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,920
Her parents are both gone.

439
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,000
She's uncared for.

440
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,319
How come I didn't know

441
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,039
you could drug someone before?

442
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,880
What exactly are you scheming?

443
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,839
What could I possibly be scheming?

444
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,759
Haven't I always been doing
this for your sake?

445
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,039
If it weren't for you

446
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,200
taking me out of Fujiang Bay,

447
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,720
I don't even know where I'd be now.

448
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,440
I've always been loyal to you.

449
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,240
I think that

450
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,559
saying these things to me now

451
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:06,559
is not suitable.

452
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,799
So now you do value me.

453
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,039
Haven't you always said
that I'm a crazy woman?

454
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,960
If I weren't crazy,

455
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,480
would I go back and find little girls
for you to play with?

456
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,319
If you don't want her,
I can take her away now.

457
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,519
Satisfied.

458
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,759
I am very satisfied.

459
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,839
We do not know the emotional state

460
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,960
of Hu Minmin

461
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,200
when she saved this recording.

462
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,640
But as for her actions in aiding others
in committing crimes,

463
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,079
we certainly must condemn her.

464
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,000
It cannot be forgiven.

465
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,200
However, please pay attention
to one fact,

466
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,839
Hu Minmin is also a victim.

467
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,799
In 2006, Wan Xuemin,

468
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:25,640
under the pretext
of teaching her to dance,

469
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,519
took Hu Minmin away from Fujiang Bay.

470
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,559
In the year that followed,

471
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,319
Hu Minmin was continuously
raped by Wan Xuemin.

472
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,000
Not only that,

473
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,839
Wan Xuemin also transferred her

474
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,000
to other perpetrators,

475
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,519
which resulted in Hu Minmin
giving birth to a child

476
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,559
at the age of fourteen.

477
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,920
The biological father is unknown.

478
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,759
After that,

479
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,000
she lived a hard life on her own
with the child

480
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:48,039
without knowing how to seek help.

481
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,119
In 2010,

482
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,039
her daughter
had a persistent high fever,

483
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,688
but she had no money to see a doctor.

484
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,480
So Hu Minmin could only
make a helpless decision.

485
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
She returned to Wan Xuemin.

486
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,119
Didn't you want to come back?

487
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,079
Since then,

488
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,599
in her hometown and nearby areas,

489
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:40,680
under the guise of recruiting students,

490
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,079
the sixteen-year-old Hu Minmin

491
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:44,279
sought girls

492
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,759
from poor families

493
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,359
who lacked family care like her.

494
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,119
Meimei,

495
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:50,240
you've done well.

496
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,440
If there's anything good,

497
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,759
don't forget us.

498
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,680
Meimei, do you remember Xiaofang,

499
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,400
who has played with you since little?

500
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,319
Now that you've made it,

501
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,599
so take care of her.

502
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,039
This time, I return

503
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,920
to help these girls.

504
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,680
Hu Minmin knew well

505
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,200
about Wan Xuemin's temperament.

506
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,640
She was very afraid that her daughter

507
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,720
would be Wan Xuemin's target.

508
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:20,799
So she deliberately

509
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,160
cut her daughter's hair short

510
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,079
and blackened her face

511
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,480
to disguise her as a boy.

512
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,119
Starting from 2015,

513
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,720
her life began to change.

514
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,440
Hu Minmin met someone

515
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,519
who warmed her.

516
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,440
So she also started to consider

517
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,720
whether to escape her sinful life.

518
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,720
But on September 4th

519
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,039
2015,

520
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,599
what Hu Minmin dreaded most happened.

521
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,839
Wan Xuemin discovered

522
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,400
the fact that Hu Li is a girl.

523
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:52,519
He threatened Hu Minmin
to find another target for him

524
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,400
to victimize.

525
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,559
Hu Minmin was at a dead end.

526
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,880
She wanted to sacrifice a girl

527
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,000
to keep evidence

528
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,960
to blackmail Wan Xuemin
to let her leave.

529
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,119
So in the pocket
of the randomly chosen victim,

530
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,119
Cui Jiayi,

531
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,119
she placed a music player for recording.

532
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,000
But the music player was gone.

533
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Looking for something?

534
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,640
This one?

535
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:19,359
Here.

536
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,799
I told you earlier

537
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,400
you and I

538
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,920
are in the same boat.

539
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,680
Let me tell you one more thing.

540
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,440
I also like your sister.

541
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,079
Come on.

542
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:11,880
Come on.

543
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,480
You are here.

544
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,559
No need to find you.

545
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,920
She's quite cute.

546
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,400
But her temperament

547
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,880
is like yours.

548
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,559
Hu Minmin knew

549
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,319
she could no longer
protect her daughter.

550
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,799
She thought

551
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,359
that perhaps only by dying

552
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,079
could she end it all.

553
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,960
So finally, she chose

554
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,400
to commit suicide.

555
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,160
Do you know who I am?

556
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,759
Do you know who I am?

557
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,400
Can you call me Mom?

558
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,039
Regarding the legality of the source
of this recording evidence,

559
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,000
it can be acknowledged.

560
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,680
However,

561
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,559
the prosecutor only passionately

562
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:53,160
told us a story.

563
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,119
What does this prove?

564
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,119
Can storytelling replace
evidence presentation?

565
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,880
It is impossible to determine

566
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,319
the authenticity of this recording.

567
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,960
I would like to draw
the court's attention

568
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,680
to Hu Minmin's recording,

569
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,960
in which she tried to trap Wan Xuemin,

570
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,119
Wan Xuemin

571
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,720
did not deny his actions at that time.

572
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,880
Because Wan Xuemin thought

573
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,720
he had already destroyed
this music player,

574
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,440
so her evidence must be lost.

575
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:32,680
However, the chip inside
the music player

576
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,656
is very difficult to be
physically destroyed.

577
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,000
As long as the chip remains,

578
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,039
technical department
can restore the data.

579
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,440
However, in the conversation
within this recording,

580
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,872
there is no evidence of a rape.

581
00:32:43,904 --> 00:32:45,720
There may be various interpretations.

582
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,400
And Hu Minmin

583
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,640
was abandoned by her family
from a young age,

584
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,200
and later had a child out of wedlock.

585
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,039
In the recording,

586
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,519
she also explicitly called herself
a mad woman,

587
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:01,640
indicating her mental state
is extremely unstable.

588
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,799
This point

589
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,480
has already been testified
by her neighbors.

590
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,400
Logically speaking,

591
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,880
she is not qualified
to be a competent witness.

592
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,200
Therefore, her testimony
should not be trusted.

593
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,119
This is not fair.

594
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:16,119
Defense Attorney,

595
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,839
is claiming a poor girl as a lunatic

596
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,640
your so-called fairness or justice?

597
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,440
My justice

598
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,400
is to restore the truth of the facts.

599
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
Chief Judge, please note,

600
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,279
what the prosecutor currently
can provide is

601
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,079
just statements from some underage

602
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,680
or young adult girls.

603
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,160
Among these statements,

604
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,599
no one

605
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,079
can directly prove

606
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,559
that Wan Xuemin

607
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,680
committed seduction.

608
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,079
If such evidence can stand,

609
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,720
I think

610
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,319
when such girls are organized

611
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,240
make some nonsensical recordings,

612
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,839
anyone might be found guilty.

613
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,599
To punish someone,

614
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
there will be no lack of stories.

615
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,319
Defense Attorney,

616
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,599
please don't distort the evidence rules.

617
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:11,039
What you mentioned about
the neighbors' testimonies

618
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,960
are entirely
their subjective speculation.

619
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,320
However, these victims' statements

620
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,599
are logical and reasonable.

621
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,039
Moreover, the description
of the details of the crime

622
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,280
matches the normal memory

623
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,719
and expression ability
of children in this age group.

624
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,599
Being natural and reasonable,

625
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,320
it constitutes evidence that could only
be known by direct experience,

626
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
and has a high credibility.

627
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,719
Sexual assault cases inherently

628
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,559
are difficult to present evidence
and detect.

629
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,239
If even such evidence

630
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,000
cannot be trusted,

631
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,920
there'll no sexual assault cases

632
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,960
that can be convicted.

633
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,199
What do you suggest these victims do?

634
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,159
Shall we tell them

635
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,159
"Your accounts of being victimized

636
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,880
are useless,

637
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,840
so you must find direct evidence,

638
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,400
and catch in the act to convict"?

639
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,760
What is the law for?

640
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,039
And what are the police
and prosecution for?

641
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,400
Who can they finally believe in?

642
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,599
What is the purpose of the law?

643
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,519
It not only includes crime prevention,

644
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,320
but also includes education and reform

645
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,800
of those who have committed crimes

646
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,599
to lead them back to the right path.

647
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,079
In the past ten years,

648
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,440
the defendant has assaulted
more than ten young girls.

649
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,559
They are all children
under the age of fourteen.

650
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,639
But the defendant

651
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,920
is a forty-five-year-old adult.

652
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,400
He has full capacity for action

653
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,320
and cognitive ability.

654
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,440
He is fully aware

655
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,559
of how cruel and despicable

656
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,679
his criminal behavior is,

657
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,719
and how lawless and shameless it is!

658
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,719
He shows no remorse or restraint.

659
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,159
The first article of Criminal Law

660
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,599
is to punish criminals

661
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,519
and protect the people.

662
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,320
He committed crimes and did bad things.

663
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,519
Shouldn't he pay the price?

664
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:43,119
Time and time again,

665
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,280
he has harmed minors

666
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,920
yet hasn't faced punishment.

667
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:49,239
How can we protect the people?

668
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,039
Respected Chief Judge and Judges,

669
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,679
and victim's families present,

670
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,559
I would like to show you something.

671
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,599
This small origami
was made by Wang Yuqing,

672
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,199
the victim who voluntarily testified
during the first trial of this case.

673
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,519
During the first trial,

674
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,119
due to the extremely high-pressure
questioning by Defense Attorney,

675
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,960
she became emotionally overwhelmed.

676
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,800
Her testimony changed in court.

677
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,119
The first trial did not
accept her testimony.

678
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,800
What I want to say is,

679
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,519
it is precisely because
she is the victim

680
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,519
that her emotions could be so intense,

681
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,119
right?

682
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,280
If it wasn't related to her,

683
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,440
and she was lying,

684
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,079
why would this happen to her?

685
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,800
Isn't this the most compelling evidence?

686
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,519
This trial we are conducting now

687
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,440
is not only to punish

688
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,199
Wan Xuemin,
who sits at defendant's seat,

689
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,159
but to

690
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,599
protect those in front of the camera

691
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:04,360
who turned away, lowered their heads,

692
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,679
and wrung their hands in helplessness.

693
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,360
It is them we aim to protect.

694
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,840
They cry and awaken
in fright countless nights,

695
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,639
always and constantly

696
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:29,199
asking themselves

697
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,599
"why is it me"?

698
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,559
They blame themselves over and over.

699
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,079
If only I hadn't gone to
that dance school.

700
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,320
If only I hadn't gone
to clean at that time.

701
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,880
The criminal is clearly Wan Xuemin
sitting below.

702
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,840
Why are these children
enduring suffering?

703
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,519
Why?

704
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,768
I don't understand.

705
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Before the court session,

706
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,840
Wang Yuqing gave this to me.

707
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,840
She told me she figured it out.

708
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,760
She didn't do anything wrong.

709
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,719
Bad guy should pay the price
for the bad things

710
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,599
they did.

711
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,280
She suffered serious harm.

712
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,760
So she is still undergoing
psychological treatment.

713
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,480
But she told me

714
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,239
she has faith in us.

715
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,800
As the prosecutors of the country,

716
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:29,800
we should protect them!

717
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,079
I don't want to disappoint her.

718
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,000
We shouldn't disappoint them either.

719
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,760
On the court today,

720
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,199
even in the face of such
compelling evidence,

721
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,320
Wan Xuemin

722
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,679
has never confessed.

723
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,039
He shows not a trace of remorse.

724
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,320
Facing such a criminal,

725
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,280
how do we tell the children

726
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,280
that the environment
they live in is safe

727
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
and fair?

728
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,239
When children aren't well, no one is.

729
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,440
The future

730
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,800
of the children

731
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:11,199
is decided by us adults

732
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,800
sitting here today.

733
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,599
What do we decide with?

734
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,159
(Indictment)
With the indictment in my hand!

735
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,280
With the judge's gavel before us!

736
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,920
With the fairness

737
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,440
and justice

738
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,440
which we've learned, explored,

739
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,079
and upheld over decades!

740
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,039
Defendant Wan Xuemin,

741
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:38,159
as the head of an off-campus
training institution,

742
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,320
violated teacher's ethics,
and annihilated humanity.

743
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,519
For a long time, he has used

744
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:43,440
methods like spiking and seduction,

745
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,760
and engaged in rape and obscene acts

746
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
against young girls

747

submit to subjugation!

That's what you said.

who else has harmed Hu Minmin?

Whose child is Hu Li?

803
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,960
Does it still matter?

00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,559
This is the justice Hu Minmin

805
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,320
deserves to witness as a victim.

806

Don't ask again!

Even if others falter,

811
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,000
we'll keep going.

812

Can you understand?

813
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,960
- Be careful.
- Okay.

814
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,440
Catch him.

Doctor says she'll be discharged.

824

By then, I will also
bring my brother back.

Be cautious.

829
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:55,719
You can visit her often.

830
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,480
Definitely.

831
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:00,599
Slow down.

832
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,639
You look a bit more mature now.

833
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:07,199
It doesn't feel like a compliment.

834
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
Before,

835
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,320
you were a kid
who kept everything inside.

836
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:15,800
Now you're an adult who hides even more.

837
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,119
Sometimes I don't know how to say it.

838
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:21,159
No need.

839
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,199
No need to say all.

I know it all.

To be honest,

844
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:37,039
afterwards,

bad things

846
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,320
may far outweigh the good ones.

00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,320

the bitterness

849
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
into fuel.

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,480
Stand up straight.

But,

853
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,400
you still remember
the good things, right?

00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:05,000

- Yes.
- We won, let's go.

- Okay.

We won.

867
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
This is indeed a bit bland.

868
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,880
You should add some chopped green onion.

869
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,880
Alright, say a little less.

Take a look.

Ten thousand.

885
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,719
That's not much.

886
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:39,079
He has no more than that.

887
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:41,440
I think

888
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,960
Li Daoran is quite capable,

889

So they fined him, didn't they?

Yes, that's what it means.

Now that the internet is so advanced,

928

we must adopt a new way of working.

Let's have a try.

930
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,800

932

of permanent population.

00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:22,920
How difficult it is!

934
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:25,119
What's so difficult?

935
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:26,599
Do you know for one case,

936
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,679
how many families suffer behind it?

937
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,719
We must make those bad guys

938
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,519
understand the cost of crime.

939
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:33,239
Yes.

940
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:34,800
Just think boldly

941
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:35,679
and proceed it.

942
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,320
Point the target,
and we'll strike it down.

943
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,440
Okay, I'll handle
the preliminary research.

944
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,480
- Your current awareness is commendable.
- Absolutely necessary.

945
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,199
Take out all those bad guys.

946
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:46,784
(After Wan Xuemin
was legally sentenced,)

947
00:48:46,784 --> 00:48:49,344
(Joint Special Investigation Team
continued to intensify efforts,)

948
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:53,120
(and excavated the profit chain
of providing minors for sexual assault.)

949
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,392
(All criminal suspects
were brought to justice.)

950
00:48:56,032 --> 00:49:02,816
(From 2018 to 2020,
relevant national authorities)

951
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:09,568
(have successively issued laws
and regulations on protecting minors.)

952
00:49:09,728 --> 00:49:12,768
(In 2021, a regulation
stipulates 12 to14 years old)

953
00:49:12,768 --> 00:49:16,160
(with crimes of
intentional homicide or injury,)

954
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,616
(causing death or serious injury
shall be held criminally responsible.)

955
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,336
(In 2023, relevant national authorities)

956
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:25,696
(issued further regulations
on assisting minors.)

957
00:49:25,696 --> 00:49:28,960
(From 2023 to 2024,
relevant national authorities)

958
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,064
(issued regulations on assisting minors.)

959
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:35,880
Boys and girls,

960
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,880
(Guided by the Law)
I'm now going to introduce to you,

961
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,800
our vice principal of the law,

962
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,159
director of juvenile prosecution

963
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:45,519
in People's Procuratorate of Yunhai,

964
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:46,599
Bai Enyu.

965
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,760
Now, let's welcome him to speak.

966
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,199
Hello, kids,

967
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:56,559
I am Bai Enyu.

968
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:58,360
It's not the first time

969
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,559
I've come here to lecture.

970
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:00,840
Without further ado,

971
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,440
let's get straight to the point.

972
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,239
Don't think you're far from crime.

973
00:50:06,688 --> 00:50:09,400
And don't think not reaching the age
of criminal responsibility

974
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,199
allows you to escape legal sanctions.

975
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,760
I've seen a 15-year-old boy
commit a crime.

976
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,440
His last name is Huang,

977
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,239
probably only a few years
older than you.

978
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:20,079
The law gave him a chance,

979
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,440
but he reoffended
while serving his sentence.

980
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,960
He made no effort

981
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,480
to reform,

982
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,559
resulting in spending his entire life

983
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:28,960
in prison.

984
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,360
The Law on the Protection of Minors

985
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,119
proposes six major protections.

986
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,239
Family protection, school protection,

987
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:37,960
social protection, internet protection,

988
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,039
government protection,
and judicial protection.

989
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,119
But what I want to talk about today is

990
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:43,199
our protection

991
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:45,039
also requires your self-discipline.

992
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:46,440
What you need to do is

993
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,280
to be strict with yourselves
and distinguish right from wrong.

994
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,440
As for us,
the prosecutors and police officers

995
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:54,920
are to catch the bad guys

996
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,679
and protect you.

997
00:51:00,148 --> 00:51:01,728
(Honor Roll)

998
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:04,510
(Top Ten National Prosecutors,
Lin Zhitao)

999
00:51:04,625 --> 00:51:05,639
(Excellent Prosecutor, Bai Enyu)

1000
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:07,559
I'll tell you a real case.

1001
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:09,000
A five-year-old

1002
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:10,199
little girl,

1003
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:13,320
who just broke a bowl at home,

1004
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,679
was then stabbed with needles

1005
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:17,840
and scalded with hot water
by her biological parents.

1006
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,679
Her parents

1007
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,239
were arrested and sentenced.

1008
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,760
But what about the child?

1009
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,400
She now has a new guardian.

1010
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,280
She's also the first case applicable
to our digital prosecution

1011
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:35,440
and also the first one
to use our protection system.

1012
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,360
We have set up regular home
visit management

1013
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,360
and online guidance
for the guardian for her.

1014
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,920
No matter how far, we can manage.

1015
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,440
There are also runaway children,

1016
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:47,480
truants and dropouts.

1017
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:49,199
We made sure these children

1018
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:50,599
returned to school.

1019
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
I had worked in juvenile prosecution
for many years.

1020
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,760
I was very afraid of this kind of
occasion before.

1021
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:58,440
Because I think juvenile prosecution
cannot be publicized.

1022
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,199
It would be all regrets if publicized.

1023
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:04,679
(Speaker)
I dare to stand here now and say these.

1024
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,920
Because I believe rather than educating,
it's better to prevent in advance.

1025
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,440
Let the evil end before it starts.

1026
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,400
Let the suffering be healed
after it occurs.

1027
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:17,639
This is the meaning
of our digital prosecution.

1028
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,960
We're gathered here

1029
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:21,719
today because

1030
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,880
we care.
