00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,840
Sister, it hurts.

2
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,200
It's okay, hang in there.

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,479
After rinsing, it won't hurt.

4
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,840
Sister, you rinse yours too.

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,079
It won't hurt anymore.

6
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,240
Let's do it together.

9
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,639
Okay. Give it
to the publicity department.

10
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,879
You can head back now.

11
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's talk.

12
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,639
I don't have time to chat aimlessly.

13
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
Just one minute.

14
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,039
About what happened yesterday,

15
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,639
I think your attitude was not proper.

16
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,439
You are all family.

17
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,840
Wasn't that too much?

18
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,599
Did you really feel good about it?

19
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,360
Aren't you overstepping?

20
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
What does my life have to do with you?

21
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,719
I don't think I'm overstepping

22
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,400
or it has nothing to do with me.

23
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,879
We are all adults.

24
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,120
Everyone has family matters.

25
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,639
I grew up without parents too.

26
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,960
But I never act like you.

27
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,000
Now your brother is
your only family member.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,159
You can rely on each other.

29
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,520
Or you want to end up being alone?

30
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,000
You finally saw him,

31
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,000
and you just argued.

32
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,080
To the point
where you are complete strangers.

33
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,400
Who are you punishing?

34
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,520
Yourself or your brother?

35
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,719
One minute is up.

36
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,159
Was it that fast?

37
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,039
Hurry up and leave.

38
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,879
We'll rectify it.

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Definitely.

40
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,360
Sir, I...

41
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,360
I see.

42
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,039
Okay.

43
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,399
We're sealed off.

44
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,959
We're sealed off.

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,639
No one has a place to stay now.

46
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Go back to pack your things

47
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,839
and find somewhere else to live!

48
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,600
At 6:30 PM,

49
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,199
we'll lock all doors.

50
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,399
Anyone with dorm keys,

51
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,439
leave them here!

52
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,079
And also leave

53
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,079
the set of clothes!

54
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,720
Go to complete the procedures.

55
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,560
Let's go.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,720
You, come back.

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
You, get out!

58
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,199
And the surveillance.

59
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,240
After the video's deleted,

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,560
check it again carefully.

61
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,160
I'll find someone to handle it.

62
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,879
Get out.

63
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,120
Turn the power off.

64
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:57,639
Go ahead.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,552
Okay.

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,079
Want me to take you back?

67
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,879
I want to get my ID back.

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,879
Come here.

69
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,360
I've changed my mind.

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
Thanks to you,

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,720
my store has been shut down,
and my money's gone.

72
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,680
Now you want to leave?

73
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:38,720
No way.

74
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,399
You have to compensate me.

75
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,879
I have no money.

76
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
You have no money?

77
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,079
Go ask your family for it.

78

You saved me at the KTV yesterday.)

is currently on a call.

86
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,399
Is anyone here?

Hello.

91
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,639
Hello, is this 119?

92
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,959
The second floor
of Jiaoyang KTV is on fire.

93
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,800
That's right.

94
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,120
Okay.

Bai, I appreciate your kindness.

97
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,480
I better stay away from her.

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,800
Don't mention her to me anymore.

99
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:30,360
Yang, take the initiative.

100
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:32,320
If you can take the initiative...

101
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
Look, why is there so much smoke?

102
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,000
How about this?

103
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,080
I'll think of a way.

104

00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,080
After the video is deleted,

194
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,440
check it again carefully.

195
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,720
Here, take a good look.

196
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,240
Is this from your KTV?

197
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:54,720
No.

198
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,039
No?

199
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,799
Think again carefully.

200
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,000
Was there anything unusual
before the fire?

201
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,920
Or,

202
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,519
any suspicious people?

203
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,119
We're just trying

204
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,039
to find the cause of the fire.

205
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,559
Anything you remember

206
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,240
can help us solve this faster.

207
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,359
Please think carefully.

208
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:22,920
Well,

209
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,440
we have an employee named Beibei.

210
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,759
Got your ID card?

211
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,480
What did he say?

212
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,559
He asked my family to pay.

213
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,720
What should I do?

214
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,559
I'm begging you.

215
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,279
I really have no place to go.

216
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:47,359
Please pity me

217
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,599
and let me stay here for one night.

218
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,799
Just one night.

219
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,359
I

220
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
just thought she was pitiful.

221
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,799
She had nowhere to go.

222
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,559
So I gave her the back door key,

223
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,880
and let her stay
in the storeroom for a night.

224
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,440
I didn't expect this would happen!

225
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,920
Thank you all for coming
to Yunhai city procuratorate

226
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,880
for this incident briefing session.

227
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,039
Today we have invited

228
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,559
Captain Du
from the Criminal Investigation Team,

229
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,400
and Director Zhang
from the Fire Prevention Department

230
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,119
to explain to us

231
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,000
the details
of Jiaoyang KTV fire on April 17th.

232
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,759
(Incident briefing session)
Let's start with Director Zhang.

233
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:30,759
Okay.

234
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,079
(Brief on the fire)
The fire broke out

235
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,519
around 6:15 PM on the 17th.

236
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,279
After receiving the alarm call,

237
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,759
we immediately rushed to the scene.

238
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,576
By 7:10 PM, the fire was extinguished.

239
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,759
Two people trapped inside were rescued.

240
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,720
Nearby residences

241
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,960
and other buildings

242
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,440
were not affected.

243
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,079
Through on-site investigation,

244
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,920
we discovered two fire origins.

245
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,400
The first one was

246
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,799
(On-site investigation)
at the window in the storage room

247
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,160
on the second floor of Jiaoyang KTV.

248
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,480
At the scene,

249
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,960
we found a burnt electric kettle

250
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,279
and remnants of plastic barrels.

251
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,359
There's a high likelihood
of dry burning.

252
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,559
The electric kettle

253
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,720
ignited the curtains.

254
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,519
And

255
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,119
there were other accelerants nearby,

256
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,039
which led the fire to spread quickly.

257
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,400
The second fire origin

258
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,799
was at the staircase.

259
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
Low-level burning was observed.

260
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,400
From the V-shaped low burn marks
on the wall,

261
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,759
it can be concluded

262
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,240
that because the carpet

263
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,799
and the debris on the stairs

264
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,880
were ignited,

265
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,079
the escape routes of trapped people

266
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
were blocked.

267
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,480
Wasn't there another fire
in Tapo District

268
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,279
caused by an electric kettle?

269
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,640
At a hotpot restaurant, right?

270
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,599
Right.

271
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,799
But thanks to a timely alarm,

272
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,000
current situation is better.

273
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,519
Currently,

274
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,680
both fire origins

275
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,279
are clear and obvious.

276
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,559
But the ignition source
of the second fire origin

277
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,680
is still under investigation.

278
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,400
We're waiting for residue analysis

279
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,039
and a mirror test report.

280
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,039
Director Zhang.

281
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,559
The second fire source
is not fully confirmed.

282
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,799
Is there any special reason for that?

283
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,279
Usually,

284
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,880
it's caused by a short circuit
in the lighting wires.

285
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
But we didn't find
suspicious points on it.

286
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,064
And according to Lin Zhiyang,
one of the rescued victims,

287
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,240
when he entered the fire scene,

288
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,440
he had crossed the fire line.

289
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,599
This proves

290
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:19,440
it was not ignited
by the first fire origin.

291
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,640
Then it must be arson.

292
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,240
Don't interrupt Director Zhang.

293
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,519
Wait. Look.

294
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,880
Look at this photo.

295
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,599
This is the carpet at the stairs.

296
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,319
There's nothing beside it.

297
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,240
If it wasn't arson,

298
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,599
what else could it be?

299
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,599
And it was so coincidental

300
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,839
that fire broke out
on both sides at once,

301
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,039
trapping Lin Zhitao in the middle.

302
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
Last night, Lin Zhitao

303
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,599
just reported this KTV.

304
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:45,960
Today it caught fire.

305
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,000
Isn't that intentional?

306
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:51,039
You've been here for almost half a year.

307
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,599
Don't you know
the presumption of innocence?

308
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,799
Before Lin Zhitao left,

309
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,759
this KTV's

310
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,119
business information
was displayed on her computer.

311
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,079
She didn't even turn off the computer.

312
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,079
She was in such a hurry.

313
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,279
Could it be that
someone called her away suddenly?

314
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,599
I am talking about evidence.

315
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,839
I am inferring and looking for evidence.

316
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,400
Prosecutor Fu.

317
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,599
We can't overlook any possibilities.

318
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,680
Captain Du.

319
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,599
Any way to recover
the surveillance footage?

320
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,000
Ning Guochang,

321
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,559
the owner of this KTV,

322
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,039
turned off all the surveillance

323
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,799
in advance.

324
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,119
If he didn't have

325
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,559
a clear alibi,

326
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,680
I would have suspected him.

327
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,759
But for now,

328
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,960
the electric kettle that caused the fire

329
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:33,960
belonged to a waitress named Liu Beibei.

330
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,920
Where is she?

331
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,640
Ask her about it.

332
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,599
Her phone can't be reached.

333
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:38,359
Her family can't be contacted either.

334
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,920
Well, Lin Zhitao reported this place

335
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,599
to help Liu Beibei.

336
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,599
You were there too.

337
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,720
Lin Zhitao helped her before.

338
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,359
How could she
intentionally harm Lin Zhitao?

339
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,119
Let's not discuss this for now.

340
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:55,640
Director Zhang.

341
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,359
I have a question.

342
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,839
Up until now,

343
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:01,720
can we completely rule out

344
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,720
the possibility of arson?

345
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,599
That's hard to say.

346
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,599
Before the final conclusion...

347
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,519
Director Zhang.

348
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,400
Sorry.

349
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,279
My colleague is lying in the hospital.

350
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,480
Hope you can understand

351
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,759
why I'm so anxious.

352
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let's put aside
the official talk for now.

353
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,400
Based on your experience,

354
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,240
what's your real opinion?

355
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,200
Based on my personal experience,

356
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,440
fires with discontinuous ignition points

357
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,119
have a high probability

358
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,599
of being arson.

359
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,240
Colleagues from the police
and fire departments,

360
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,400
thank you all.

361
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,799
Prosecutor Lin is still in the ICU

362
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:51,960
and hasn't woken up.

363
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,000
She is our colleague and comrade
whom we work closely with every day.

364
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,680
Whether this fire was an accident
or intentional,

365
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,400
I sincerely ask you to help us

366
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,519
confirm the cause as soon as possible.

367
00:23:08,979 --> 00:23:13,408
(Surgical Ward)

368
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,599
I've never seen her this quiet before.

369
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,720
She's only quiet at times like this.

370
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,200
In a few days,
she'll argue with you again.

371
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,799
Will you be free in a bit?

372
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,359
(Room 1007)
I'll leave once she wakes up.

373
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,200
Is it necessary?

374
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,400
It's not embarrassing
to admit you care about your sister.

375
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:42,920
Why make it harder?

376
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,359
Who is Lin Zhitao's family member?

377
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,559
I am.

378
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,039
The neurology experts
have a consultation.

379
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,119
Please come over.

380
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,640
Neurology?

381
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,160
Yes, they need to talk
with the patient's family.

382
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:56,559
Let's go, hurry!

383
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,200
Right here.

384
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,759
Do you see it?

385
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,599
This is the lesion point.

386
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,359
This is a chronic hematoma,

387
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,599
which explains

388
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,960
her previous dizziness and headaches.

389
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,559
Our consultation team believes

390
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,559
the situation is quite dangerous.

391
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,359
I recommend surgery immediately
after she wakes up.

392
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,960
S-surgery?

393
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,000
Just this point?

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,960
Wasn't it caused in the recent accident?

395
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,039
May I ask who you are?

396
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,160
I am her colleague.

397
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,759
And you?

398
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:36,920
I am her relative.

399
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,279
I am her younger brother.

400
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,160
Are you not aware of her situation?

401
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,720
When she was young,

402
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,200
she must have suffered
a severe head injury.

403
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,440
There was only one bleeding point,

404
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,319
but it never fully healed.

405
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Over time,

406
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,720
combined with

407
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,039
over-exertion

408
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,880
and irregular routines,

409
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,519
it slowly developed into a lesion

410
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,759
compressing her nerves.

411
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:04,720
Her head

412
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,559
must have suffered

413
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:09,000
a violent impact from a blunt object.

414
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,920
Let go.

415
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,640
Come here!

416
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,720
Don't touch me.

417
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,519
Come here.

418
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,799
Get lost.

419
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,960
- Let go.
- What's going on?

420
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Don't be like that.

421
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,240
Zhengfeng.

422
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,599
Everyone is watching.

423
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
You are now back.

424
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:26,240
Stop making a fuss.

425
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,519
Village chief.

426
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,599
I'll sever ties
with this ungrateful girl.

427
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,119
Give me a certificate.

428
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:34,400
Zhitao, just admit your mistake

429
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,599
and go back with your dad.

430
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,519
Zhitao, quickly apologize to your dad.

431
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:38,880
He's the one who broke the law.

432
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,279
I'm not wrong.

433
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:41,720
I...

434
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,480
Are you done yet?

435
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,799
Zhitao, let me tell you.

436
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,839
All kids are raised with discipline.

437
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,160
A child raised
under the stick will be filial.

438
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,240
The one responsible
for domestic abuse that is

439
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,359
not severe enough
for criminal punishment

440
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,960
should be detained for fifteen days.

441
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
It's only five days now.

442
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,559
Why did you bail him out?

443
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,848
Zhitao.

444
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:03,920
You brat!

445
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,200
Enough!

446
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,799
So cruel!

447
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
How could you beat her like that?

448
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,079
Zhitao.

449
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:13,160
You're so reckless.

450
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,480
According to Articles 182
of the Criminal Law

451
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,440
of the People's Republic of China,

452
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,319
domestic abuse

453
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,079
that is serious

454
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,200
can result in two years of imprisonment.

455
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:31,840
I...

456
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,880
Are you crazy?

457
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,000
You.

458
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,160
What's wrong with you?

459
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,240
You brat.

460
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,400
Still talking back.

461
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,559
I'm going to beat you to death today.

462
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,839
Suit yourself.

463
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,240
If you hit me again,
I'll call the police again.

464
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:53,319
Let them lock you up for two years.

465
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:53,920
I...

466
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:55,680
Enough already!

467
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,400
Zhengfeng! Zhengfeng!

468
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,279
What's wrong with you?

469
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,640
What's wrong with you?

470
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,440
Zhengfeng.

471
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,039
Zhengfeng.

472
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,319
Lin Zhitao!

473
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,480
He is your father!

474
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,240
Are you trying to drive him

475
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,680
or me to death?

476
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,880
Call an ambulance!
Send him to the hospital!

477
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,240
That hit

478
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,400
must have hurt so badly.

479
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,839
Actually, I've always known it.

480
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,480
But I never dared say anything

481
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,240
or do anything.

482
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:41,880
You.

483
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,000
You were just a child back then.

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,039
What could you do?

485
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,319
She was just a kid too.

486
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,000
(Surgical ward)
After Lin Zhengfeng died,

487
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,880
everyone treated her like a jinx.

488
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,000
My mom would always complain
when mentioning her,

489
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,279
saying

490
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,680
she ruined our family,

491
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,359
and let her never come back.

492
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,839
She left decisively.

493
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,759
She left for high school,

494
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,039
and never returned again.

495
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,720
Then just like my mom,

496
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,920
I began to resent her.

497
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,279
I even somewhat hated her.

498
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,079
I hated her for not being with me,

499
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,720
and for not being with our family.

500
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,640
But I never thought

501
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,960
that she was the one

502
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:46,640
who was hurt.

503
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,680
All that she dared to do,

504
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,400
and all she wanted to do,

505
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
I did none of them.

506
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,720
I...

507
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,319
I am too coward.

508
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,319
You are not. Why do you say that?

509
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,200
You ran into a fire for her!

510
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,240
You are not coward.

511
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
You two are exactly the same.

512
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,920
Maybe.

513
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,599
That day when I rushed in,

514
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,200
I saw Lin Zhitao lying on the ground.

515
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,640
All my resentment and hatred

516
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,680
disappeared.

517
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,960
Lin Zhitao, I only wish

518
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,039
that you can be alive.

519
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,599
You must be alive.

520
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,839
You can't die here.

521
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:54,519
You...

522
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,599
You can't die here.

523
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
You must die of old age.

524
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,720
I must know you will die of old age.

525
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,960
You should...

526
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,640
You must...

527
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,559
You're so lucky.

528
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,200
How nice it is to have a family.

529
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,200
We're here.

530
00:30:37,359 --> 00:30:37,960
Captain Du.

531
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,000
You've worked hard.

532
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,559
- Ms. Zheng.
- Hello.

533
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,079
I'll take you upstairs.

534
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

535
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,720
- Come over.
- You stay here.

536
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,799
- Okay.
- Okay.

537
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,200
Come on, Ms. Zheng.

538
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,200
I'll show you around down here first.

539
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,960
Okay, be careful.

540
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,920
It's dark.

541
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,839
The main fire origin is upstairs.

542
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,440
Right.
The first floor is relatively safe.

543
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,839
I'll guide you this way.

544
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay.

545
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,839
Wait a moment.

546
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,839
Can I move it?

547
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,480
Yes.

548
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,554
(Suggestion Book)

549
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:32,400
Be careful.

550
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,079
This way.

551
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:38,559
Be careful.

552
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:48,839
Here.

553
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,640
This way, Ms. Zheng.

554
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:00,279
The heating rod

555
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,200
was placed here.

556
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,880
This was

557
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,240
the first fire origin,

558
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,079
where the cleaning agent
was directly ignited.

559
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,559
After computer simulation and analysis,

560
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,880
it's basically certain

561
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,599
that it was arson.

562
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
They even set up a backup ignition.

563
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:40,599
(Yunhai Criminal Police)
On that night of the fire,

564
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,759
you were staying
in the storage room, right?

565
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:44,039
Yes.

566
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,559
No.

567
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:46,799
Aren't you sure

568
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,240
if you were there or not?

569
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,400
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

570
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,160
Just say what you know.

571
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,799
You used
the electric kettle there, right?

572
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,599
I was hungry at night,

573
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,920
so I cooked some instant noodles by it.

574
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,119
Why didn't you turn off the power
when you left?

575
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,720
I'm sorry, officer.

576
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,200
I'm sorry.

577
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,200
I left in a hurry.

578
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:19,680
I forgot about the noodles.

579
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
I'm sorry.

580
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,792
(Was the cleaning agent
under the curtain?)

581
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,839
Don't be nervous.

582
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,119
We are just asking.

583
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,640
Do you think the cleaning agent

584
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,759
would be placed under the curtain?

585
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,039
The cleaning agent?

586
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,279
We have it,

587
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,759
but it's on the shelves.

588
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:50,799
The shelves?

589
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,079
It should be there.

590
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,680
I'm not responsible for cleaning.

591
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,920
I never touched it.

592
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,440
Are you sure

593
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:01,440
it was not under the curtain?

594
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,160
I'm not sure.

595
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,079
But I really didn't touch it.

596
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,960
We believe you.

597
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,320
Relax. It's fine.

598
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,760
But I still want to ask you.

599
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,239
You already cooked the instant noodles,

600
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,280
but why did you suddenly leave?

601
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,119
Beibei, you don't need to be nervous.

602
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,280
Tell us what you know

603
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,760
truthfully.

604
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,840
Because

605
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,679
someone called me away.

606
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,679
Who?

607
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,840
Here's your ID card.

608
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,760
Leave now, or you won't
have another chance.

609
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,480
If Ning Guochang finds it missing,

610
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
he'll come after you.

611
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,599
What if he comes to my house
looking for me?

612
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,440
Go home.

613
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,000
Change your SIM card

614
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,880
and your family's too.

615
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,199
She used to come there often.

616
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,440
She seems to be the owner's relative.

617
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,320
That night,

618
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,719
she heard about my situation

619
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,880
and helped me steal my ID card out.

620
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:14,960
You said she told you to leave, right?

621
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,599
Later,

622
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:20,079
we left through the back door.

623
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,400
Okay.

624
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,079
Then what about this text message?

625
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,199
(Message from Beibei to Lin Zhitao)
You said you were in trouble

626
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,079
and asked Prosecutor Lin to rescue you.

627
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,039
I didn't send it!

628
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,719
I swear I didn't send it!

629
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:37,960
I didn't send it.

630
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,719
I swear it wasn't me.

631
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,639
But after seeing this message,

632
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,039
Prosecutor Lin

633
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,559
rushed to the KTV

634
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,000
to help you.

635
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,960
But she was caught in a fire
and injured,

636
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,760
she is still now

637
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,760
in a critical condition.

638
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,599
Captain Du.

639
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,440
Have you caught the suspect? Who's it?

640
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,280
Mr. Ning.

641
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,239
(Search warrant)
This is a search warrant.

642
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:09,280
Please cooperate.

643
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,480
We need

644
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,559
to search your home.

645
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,719
I didn't break any laws.

646
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,559
Why are you searching my home?

647
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,599
You are Ning Kaitong, right?

648
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,000
(Police)
Please come with us

649
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:38,920
for investigation.

650
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,039
She did it?

651
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:41,480
Are you crazy?

652
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
What are you doing?

653
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,519
Impossible.

654
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,679
Why is it impossible?

655
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
We treated you well.

656
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,519
This is how you repay us?

657
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,000
You're just like your mother.

658
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,760
You jinx.

659
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,880
Calm down.

660
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,000
Mind your words.

661
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,679
Xiaoyao, take her away.

662
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,119
You need to come with us too.

663
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,760
Captain Du, what is he going for?

664
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,039
Captain Du...

665
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,224
(Suggestion Book)

666
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:47,554
(Welcome valuable suggestions for us.
Ning Jiachang, Sun Yajuan.)

667
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,960
(I hope Mom and Dad
spend more time with me. Ning Kaitong.)

668
00:37:56,564 --> 00:37:58,624
(Police)

669
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,960
You should ask my uncle about this.

670
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,000
He's the one who withheld her ID card.

671
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:05,760
Also,

672
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,639
that day I left with Beibei

673
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,719
and went straight home.

674
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,760
This has nothing to do with me.

675
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,400
What about the other times?

676
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
I just wandered around.

677
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:17,719
Officer,

678
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:20,400
I did help Beibei steal her ID card.

679
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,119
That was because I felt sorry for her.

680
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,719
After giving her ID card,

681
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,239
I never went back.

682
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,880
You can't suspect me

683
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,599
just because of this.

684
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,280
You sent this, right?

685
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:39,200
(Prosecutor Lin, I'm Beibei.
You saved me at the KTV yesterday.)

686
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,519
(Today the boss asked me to pay.
I'm so scared. Please help me.)

687
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,199
Hurry, hurry.

688
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:43,039
Pack up quickly.

689
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,199
Have you bought your ticket?

690
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:46,199
Not yet.

691
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,760
Without my ID card, I haven't dared to.

692
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,039
Give me your phone. I'll buy it.

693
00:38:57,012 --> 00:38:59,572
(Prosecutor Lin, I'm Beibei.
You saved me at the KTV yesterday.)

694
00:38:59,572 --> 00:39:02,368
(Today the boss asked me to pay.
I'm so scared. Please help me.)

695
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:05,057
(Delete)

696
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,300
(Delete contact, Prosecutor Lin)

697
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:16,768
(Add passenger)

698
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,000
Okay, I've bought the ticket for you.

699
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,639
The latest one.

700
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:21,639
Just half an hour away.

701
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:22,639
Let's go. No time left.

702
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,559
Hurry up.

703
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,039
Thank you.

704
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:25,960
You go ahead.

705
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,199
I'll grab something and come over.

706
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,880
You just believed her that easily?

707
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,599
I just helped her book the train ticket.

708
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,360
And then I left with her.

709
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,360
Okay.

710
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,639
Did you go back after leaving?

711
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,320
How many times do I have to say it?

712
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,360
I didn't go back.

713
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:58,039
Did you go back to the KTV afterward?

714
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:58,920
No.

715
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,800
Who had the keys?

716
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,599
After the closure,
they were all turned in to me.

717
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:03,880
Others shouldn't have them.

718
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,239
Who could have access to them?

719
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,960
We have a witness stating

720
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:13,519
that when he arrived at the scene,

721
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:16,000
the door

722
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,599
was open.

723
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Ning Kaitong.

724
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,199
(Suggestion Book)

725
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,159
What is this?

726
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:29,760
The KTV's suggestion book.

727
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,719
What's wrong with it?

728
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,239
How did the KTV's suggestion book

729
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,800
end up in your room?

730
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:39,159
My dad made it before.

731
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,960
What's wrong with my family's stuff

732
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,239
being at my place?

733
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:44,480
Then when did you take it home?

734
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,840
A long time ago.

735
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:50,880
Ning Kaitong.

736
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,119
Let me ask you again.

737
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,480
Are you sure you brought it home

738
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,920
a long time ago?

739
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,880
That's right.

740
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,320
Why do you keep confirming?

741
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:02,960
Alright.

742
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,000
Since you insist

743
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,320
you took it home a long time ago,

744
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:08,760
well,

745
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,559
tell me

746
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,559
(Contact)
what is this.

747
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,079
This is my number.

748
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,360
Call me if you need help, okay?

749
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,719
We provide all standard services.

750
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,960
There is no escort or a liquor seller.

751
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,400
The night before the fire,

752
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,599
this suggestion book

753
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,559
was still hanging at the counter.

754
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,000
Prosecutor Lin Zhitao

755
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,079
left her contact information on it.

756
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,000
Look at the next page.

757
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:39,719
Scratches from when she wrote.

758
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,239
So when did you take it home?

759
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,440
I went back afterward, so what?

760
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,880
I took my own things.

761
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,639
Do I need to report to you?

762
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,039
I'll tell you the truth.

763
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,199
We've already recovered

764
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:05,920
all surveillance footage

765
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,559
from before the KTV closed.

766
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,360
It shows that

767
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,440
when Prosecutor Lin

768
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,880
met Beibei,

769
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,440
you were present.

770
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:20,159
Moreover,

771
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Beibei told us

772
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,039
that the compensation demand

773
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,280
was only known

774
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,239
to you

775
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,199
and the head waiter.

776
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:28,400
At the time of the incident,

777
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,119
the head waiter had an alibi.

778
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,000
Moreover, the time when Prosecutor Lin

779
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,400
received these messages

780
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:34,480
and the time

781
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,800
when you claimed

782
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,079
to buy Beibei's train ticket

783
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:41,159
were only one minute apart.

784
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,400
Besides,

785
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,840
we found on your computer

786
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,199
that you searched
for flammable materials

787
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,719
56 times.

788
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,519

790
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,119
by cleaning agents 12 times.

791
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:58,920
Also,

792
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,440
you searched for business transfer

793
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,039
up to 109 times.

Ning Kaitong.

796
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,840
You did this

797
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,199
not just for killing Prosecutor Lin.

798
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,400
You also hated your uncle deeply.

799
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,480
You wanted

800
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,079
to burn down the KTV
your uncle embezzled

801
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:20,440
in a fire,

802
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,079
didn't you?

803
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:28,280
Brother,

804
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,280
the KTV was left for Tong by Jiachang.

805
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:33,400
It is the kid's last guarantee.

806
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:35,000
I can't...

807
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,800
Sister-in-law,

808
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,599
if so,

809
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,159
we have nothing to talk about.

810
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:41,280
Do you know how hard it is

811
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,320
to raise a child now?

812
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,000
Brother.

813
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:45,440
Brother.

814
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:52,559
If you promise to take care of Tong,

815
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,880
I'll sign.

(KTV Free Transfer Agreement)

817
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,960
You sent my mother to prison.

818
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,199
But my dear uncle,

819
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,559
(Business License of the Legal Entity)
my father's most respected brother,

820
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,639
did not issue
a letter of forgiveness for her

821
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,320
and tried to seize
my parents' lifelong efforts.

822
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,599
You are all responsible

823
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:22,199
for my mother's death.

824
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,239
Tong.

825
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:25,280
I made some delicious food for you.

826
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,199
Come out quickly.

827
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:27,400
I won't eat.

828
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,480
It's not for me anyway.

829
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,519
If it's not for you, what's it for?

830
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,039
For your sake.

831
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:36,800
If the two prosecutors
hadn't come today,

832
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,639
would you have given me such good food?

833
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:39,920
Save the money.

834
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,880
Save it to buy a car for your son.

835
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:46,159
Tong, what are you saying?

836
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,199
Your uncle and I

837
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:48,719
have never mistreated you!

838
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:52,280
Is that so?

839
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:53,320
So, you're saying

840
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,599
I should be grateful that you raised me

841
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,920
using money from my dad's KTV?

842
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,440
Wait.

843
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,880
Now the KTV is not my dad's.

844
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:07,559
It's yours.

845
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:09,480
Is that right, Ning Guochang?

846
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:10,840
Tong,

847
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,239
mind your words!

848
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,199
That's only temporary.

849
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,280
Stop pretending.

850
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,079
I saw it.

851
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:18,440
You finally transferred the KTV
under your name.

852
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,920
Are you happy now?

853
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,360
Just admit it.

854
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,360
You are

855
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:28,320
a bloodsucker who embezzled
your own brother's property!

856
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,159
Why are you hitting her?

857
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,000
Stop pretending to be a good person.

858
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,519
Ning Guochang,

859
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,239
you finally revealed your true colors.

860
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,599
Ning Kaitong,

861
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,400
you are a little demon.

862
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:47,039
That's right.

863
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,280
I want my parents to see clearly

864
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,840
who exactly made me like this today.

865
00:45:52,211 --> 00:45:54,489

866
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,840

869
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,719
Beibei?

00:47:06,003 --> 00:47:07,104
(Suggestion Book)

871
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:15,519
I admit it.

872
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,599
I set the fire

873
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,440
and called Lin Zhitao over.

874
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:22,800
I never intended to hide it.

875
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,440
Tong,

876
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,440
have you thought about the consequences?

877
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,199
I'm the only one left in our family.

878
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,800
I don't care.

879
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:39,480
Besides,

880
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:42,079
Lin Zhitao jumped in on her own.

881
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,880
I didn't force her.

882
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:46,639
Calm down.

883
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,079
She is

884
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,159
talking nonsense.

885
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,599
She did it on purpose.

886
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:51,480
I did it on purpose?

887
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,480
Did I purposely let her kill my mom?

888
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:57,480
Did I purposely let her
destroy my family?

889
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,920
What did I do on purpose?

890
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,440
Calm down and sit down.

891
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
I have no parents now, do you know that?

892
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:12,960
Right.

893
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,599
You are very pitiful.

894
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:16,280
Your parents are pitiful too.

895
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,000
Have you thought about your future?

896
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,000
Your life and your future.

897
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:23,000
How will you live
for the next 50 or 60 years?

898
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,320
You will spend a whole lifetime

900
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,400
And what about them?

901
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,039
How would your parents feel?

902
00:48:35,159 --> 00:48:36,119
Would they be proud?

903
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,000
Revenge, huh?

904
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:43,880
It's just

905
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,159
an excuse to escape your future life.

906
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,519
Then what should I do?

907
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,480
You can criticize me

908
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:56,079
and educate me.

00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:57,920
