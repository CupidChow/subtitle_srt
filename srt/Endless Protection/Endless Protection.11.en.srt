1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,279
Zhen Rong.

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,519
Data retrieved from your phone shows

3
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,079
that you established a group

4
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:23,640
in October 2014,
called "Study Materials Sharing Group"

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,120
with a total of 129 members.

6
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,120
Do you have any comments on this?

7
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,280
Data shows

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,240
that an account named
"Do Good Deeds Anonymously"

9
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:38,799
uploaded a total of

10
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,240
307 pieces of obscene
and pornographic videos and images,

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,679
with a total reach
of 39,603 person-times.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,240
The transfer records show

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,759
that this account charged group members

14
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:50,359
1,498 yuan in total.

15
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,799
Do you have anything to say about this?

16
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:03,600
Did you perform those actions in person?

17
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,280
Here, take a look.

18
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,159
If everything's clear,

19
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,439
just sign here.

20
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:23,456
(Zhang Ning)

21
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:29,879
Sir.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,599
When can I take him home?

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,959
The case is still under investigation.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,840
Once it's done,

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,799
we'll file public prosecution
with the court.

26
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:33,220
=Endless Protection=

27
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:36,644
=Episode 11=

28
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,872
(Practice the law
with virtues and righteousness)

29
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,639
In the blink of an eye,

30
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,120
Lin Zhitao,
the top ten prosecutor of Yuedong,

31
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,599
was dumbfounded.

32
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,560
Really?

33
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
Over 200 boys.

34
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,280
How can they find him?

35
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,360
She was having

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,280
such a headache.

37
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,240
The giant blister on her lip

38
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,560
was as big as

39
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,479
your eye.

40
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,360
So stressed?

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,280
Absolutely.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,800
Thankfully,

43
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,919
I, Bai Enyu,

44
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:05,439
who had once served as a police officer,

45
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,360
was trained

46
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,800
to be clear-headed and decisive.

47
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,439
I came up with some idea and...

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,919
Sorted it out?

49
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,319
Of course.

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,079
Go ahead and keep bragging.

51
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,079
You think I don't know

52
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,279
that Zhitao decided to hold that exam?

53
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,720
I compiled the exam paper, okay?

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,160
Still, she was inspired by me, okay?

55
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,120
Sure.

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,759
You're amazing. You're the best.

57
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:31,879
Here.

58
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,759
Here's a gift for you.

59
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,360
Why?

60
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,319
Praise me once, you will get one.

61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,439
Alright.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,560
It's my family business.

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,439
My wife sells these.

64
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,319
Thank you.

65
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,000
No problem.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Give me one more.

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,639
- Why?
- To give to Zhitao.

68
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,399
Let me do it.

69
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:45,240
Alright, go ahead.

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,839
This one?

71
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:46,720
Not bad.

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,552
Cute, huh?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Absolutely.

74
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,639
Let's make her cuter.

75
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,319
Why are you wandering around?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,279
W-Whose is this? What is it?

77
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:03,879
Bai gave you this.

78
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,600
I have one too.

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,639
Family business.

80
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,680
I don't want it. So childish.

81
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,360
Don't throw it away.

82
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,120
Leave it here.

83
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,959
Add a bit of color.

84
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,920
Come with me

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,560
to the Tapo District Procuratorate.

86
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,199
Now.

87
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,360
Now?

88
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,519
I haven't eaten yet.

89
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,839
Why not eat
before you head out each time?

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,560
Where's your meal?

91
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,279
I've been too busy

92
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,279
to have food.

93
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,480
Forget it. Hurry up.

94
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,480
Want some bread?

95
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:34,600
I packed some.

96
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,560
You've become so proactive,

97
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,000
sitting up front again.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,279
Who told you to sit here?

99
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,560
What do you mean by "again"?

100
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,120
The back is reserved for the superiors.

101
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,439
What am I to you?

102
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,839
A partner.

103
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,800
As your partner,

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,000
I should sit in your passenger seat.

105
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,519
I should throw you out of the sunroof.

106
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:02,120
- Have some.
- No.

107
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,040
Sure, you're never hungry.

108
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,000
You don't eat.

109
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,920
You don't drink.

110
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,480
Don't drop the crumbs in my car.

111
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,519
Whose fault is it
if I drop crumbs in your car?

112
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,639
Are you seriously that clueless?

113
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,279
I can't even have water when we're out,

114
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,279
let alone a meal.

115
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,800
I have to eat something now.

116
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,040
Besides, what's going on here?

117
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,959
The photo-taker is out.

118
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,120
The group founder is in.

119
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:35,000
One's under Public Security
Administration Punishments Law.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,079
One violated Criminal Law.

121
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,120
Tian Jun's

122
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,160
under 18,

123
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:39,879
first time,

124
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,079
not a big deal.

125
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
We can't detain him.

126
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,279
Zhen Rong is suspected

127
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,079
of profiting from
spreading obscene materials,

128
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,399
which is quite serious.

129
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,959
He may be sentenced to a year.

130
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:53,879
But...

131
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:56,680
His life will be ruined, then?

132
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,759
The district procuratorate
must have reasons for the arrest.

133
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
It's probably because

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,759
it was spread
in relatively large numbers

135
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,120
and profits were made.

136
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,680
The law is one thing.

137
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
But we must also
evaluate the social harm.

138
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,600
We're from the city procuratorate.

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,136
How about

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,079
we step in and lead?

141
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,040
Who do you think you are?

142
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,639
The city procuratorate
guides the district procuratorate.

143
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,399
The city prosecutors don't get to
guide the district prosecutors.

144
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,879
"Take our advice"?

145
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,079
So obsessed with power.

146
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,480
So why are we going there?

147
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:31,000
Zhen Rong's mother

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,279
is quite agitated.

149
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,120
They want us

150
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,519
at the district procuratorate

151
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,079
to help calm her down.

152
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,439
Sure.

153
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,639
Hi, Director Hou.

154
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,120
Ms. Lin.

155
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,920
It's bad.

156
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,480
Tian Jun's father is making a scene.

157
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,079
Yeah, the verdict is given.

158
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,040
I know that 500 jin of fry is valuable.

159
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,920
Let me finish.

160
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,879
No, this isn't a wrongful conviction.

161
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,800
Such a legal situation hasn't occurred.

162
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,920
The procuratorate can't file an appeal.

163
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:12,879
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

164
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,600
Prosecutor Lin.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Have a seat.

166
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,920
No need.

167
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,279
I'm just here to ask you

168
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,639
about Zhen Rong's case.

169
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,240
Lin, please bring some water.

170
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,480
No need. It's okay.

171
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,120
I didn't expect this case

172
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,399
to reach the city juvenile prosecution.

173
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,600
Thank you for coming.

174
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
No problem.

175
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
- Here.
- Thank you.

176
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
- Drink water.
- Thank you.

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,720
This case is not so complicated.

178
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,840
But it involves minors.

179
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,519
The mother of the child

180
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,159
is agitated.

181
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,440
Given this situation,

182
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,559
we decided to consult

183
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,559
the city's juvenile prosecution.

184
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,120
I understand.

185
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:49,879
So what are your suggestions?

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,120
It's in the documents.

187
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,919
Take a look.

188
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,639
Okay.

189
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:00,384
(Zhen Rong: Crime of distributing
obscene articles for profit)

190
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:04,128
(Shall be sentenced
to one year of imprisonment.)

191
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,039
Isn't it a bit too severe?

192
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,919
He only shared it with his classmates,

193
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,679
not the statutory unspecified group.

194
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,240
Right?

195
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,679
The chat group he created

196
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:19,080
had a total of 129 people.

197
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
We've verified their identities.

198
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,279
There were students

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,360
from other schools he didn't know.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,360
As the group owner,

201
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,120
he didn't prohibit others from joining

202
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,279
and adopted a hands-off approach.

203
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,840
Doesn't it count as
spreading to the public?

204
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,208
He didn't just distribute
obscene materials.

205
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,919
He also profited from it.

206
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,799
In that case,

207
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,799
it no longer counts

208
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,000
as an adolescent issue.

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,120
Nearly 40,000 disseminations
of obscene materials.

210
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,960
It exceeds the sentencing standards
for serious cases.

211
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,039
An adult could be sentenced

212
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,759
to three to ten years.

213
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,879
But the person involved is a minor.

214
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,200
So it's only one year.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,720
How...

216
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,120
Tian Jun went rogue

217
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,559
after joining the group

218
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,320
of your student council president, huh?

219
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
The teachers

220
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,000
put that kid to be the president, huh?

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,759
Besides, all those
100 students in this group

222
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
have seen the photos.

223
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Did you expel them all?

224
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Those who see the photos can walk free,

225
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,960
but the photographer gets fired?

226
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,679
We will punish those
who should be punished.

227
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,600
Right now, at this very moment,

228
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,480
tell me what you're going to do.

229
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,399
What will you do

230
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,960
about those students and teachers?

231
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,000
Will you expel them?

232
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,159
Unreasonable.

233
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,360
I'm unreasonable?

234
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,679
Tell you what.

235
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,840
If you don't offer me

236
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,240
a reasonable solution,

237
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,039
I'm not going to leave.

238
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,279
You...

239
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,879
Director, we're here to stay.

240
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,000
Director Hou, why is he back?

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,200
Yeah. Why is he back again?

242
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,159
Don't be rude.

243
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,799
Why can't I come back?

244
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,679
- Don't you feel ashamed?
- Shameless!

245
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,240
Even the police said

246
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,879
that they wouldn't punish

247
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,080
someone under 18.

248
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,360
So you must issue

249
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,000
a graduation certificate.

250
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,519
- Why?
- Why?

251
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,080
Calm down.

252
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,039
We won't allow it.

253
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,720
- Right, we won't!
- Right, we won't!

254
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,960
Who needs your consent?

255
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,240
Who do you think you are?

256
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,279
- How dare!
- How dare!

257
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,440
So what?

258
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,759
Why don't you shut up?

259
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,279
Didn't you hear me?

260
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,440
- Your son...
- Your son...

261
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,279
Stop yelling.

262
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,200
What about my son?

263
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,360
Enough.

264
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:30,440
Dad.

265
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,320
Dad.

266
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,600
Dad.

267
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,919
M-Mr. Tian.

268
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,200
Listen.

269
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,240
My dad has heart problems.

270
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,000
If anything happens, it's on you.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,600
Dad.

272
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,840
Mr. Tian.

273
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,639
Dad.

274
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,960
Director Hou, call the ambulance.

275
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,159
Right.

276
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,519
Stay put.

277
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,440
W-What for?

278
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,639
You.

279
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,960
Lay him flat.

280
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,799
Be careful. Mr. Tian.

281
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,039
My chest hurts.

282
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,759
Hello, Principal Bai.

283
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,399
Hello.

284
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,919
Uncle, get up.

285
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,240
It's cold on the ground.

286
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,120
Taking a nap?

287
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,600
You finally came.

288
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,679
Where is Prosecutor Lin?

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,639
She's busy.

290
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,960
This is...

291
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
Tian Jun's father.

292
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,720
He won't let us expel Tian Jun.

293
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:29,679
Yeah, I...

294
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,600
No, no. Stay on the ground.

295
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,440
You need to rest.

296
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,279
Like father, like son. Shameless.

297
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,279
What did you say?

298
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,320
Stay put. Don't move.

299
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,000
Let me handle it.

300
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,360
Go back.

301
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
He has nothing to do.

302
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,919
Can you waste time with him?

303
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:56,879
Go back.

304
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,039
We'll fix it.

305
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,639
Let's go.

306
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:07,879
Call the ambulance.

307
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
I wanted to.

308
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,159
Tian Jun didn't let me.

309
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,279
He got agitated.

310
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:11,960
Seriously.

311
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,320
Aren't you his son?

312
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,120
Your dad is in danger.

313
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
Can you take responsibility

314
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
if something happens?

315
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,559
I'll call the ambulance.

316
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,799
He'll get defibrillation and intubation.

317
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,840
He'll be fine.

318
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,000
Well...

319
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:23,879
Feeling better?

320
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,039
You know, those kids left,

321
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,799
and I felt a bit better.

322
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,159
That's great, Dad.

323
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,720
No matter who you bring here,

324
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,080
we will expel him.

325
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,519
Do you have any respect for the law?

326
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,039
Do you have to drive me crazy?

327
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,399
Enough.

328
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,399
Stop pushing yourself so hard.

329
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,879
You know your weight.

330
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,600
Mind your blood pressure.

331
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,279
So you want a diploma?

332
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:54,120
Yeah.

333
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,759
It's just a diploma.

334
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,399
Ask Tian Jun

335
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,720
how many subjects he failed.

336
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,399
Even if he's not expelled,

337
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,759
he won't get a diploma.

338
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,360
Then you need to improve
your teaching methods.

339
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,919
We must get the diploma.

340
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,399
- No way.
- Says who?

341
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,080
How about this?

342
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,879
Give us a written repentance.

343
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,159
Prosecutor Bai,

344
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,399
the school has its rules.

345
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,000
Hear me out.

346
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,039
The written repentance

347
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,559
must be signed by all the girls.

348
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,159
As long as they forgive him,

349
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,600
the school can handle it, right?

350
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,559
Making a scene doesn't help.

351
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,759
However,

352
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,440
he still has to take the makeup exams.

353
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,919
Follow the school's
rules and regulations.

354
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,799
I don't mind him making a scene.

355
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,519
- Dad, I don't think they'll forgive me.
- Go away.

356
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,840
I know you're in a dilemma.

357
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,600
But shouldn't we

358
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,279
give the child a chance?

359
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,960
If you can't accept this, Mr. Tian,

360
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,559
then we'll follow
the school's regulations.

361
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,799
We'll put a sleeping bag here for you.

362
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,919
Call an ambulance.

363
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:01,840
No need.

364
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,720
Well...

365
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,679
As long as all the girls
sign on it, right?

366
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,360
Then, we will write

367
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,399
the repentance.

368
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,080
So, we have a deal.

369
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,159
If the girls don't forgive him,

370
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,000
stop bothering Director Hou.

371
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,799
What do you mean?

372
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:18,360
We never bothered Director Hou.

373
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,840
We've been reasoning things out nicely.

374
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,240
Okay.

375
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,000
Won't you say thank you?

376
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:27,679
Thank you, sir.

377
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,679
So, it's settled then.

378
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,080
See you around.

379
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,440
Thank you.

380
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,120
Let's go.

381
00:15:35,552 --> 00:15:36,080
Let's go.

382
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,360
Prosecutor Bai,

383
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,799
Tian Jun should be expelled.

384
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,759
Our family is a scholarly one.

385
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,480
We have strict family rules.

386
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,360
How did our child end up like this?

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,679
I still

388
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,559
don't know what to tell my husband.

389
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,120
Does your husband stay here?

390
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,799
He's always working out of town.

391
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:11,720
So, how's your relationship
with Zhen Rong?

392
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:12,919
What do you think?

393
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,279
I quit my job for him.

394
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,840
I watch him study every day.

395
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,720
And yet,

396
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,840
he failed the high school entrance exam.

397
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,679
His dad says it's my fault,

398
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:23,360
shifting all the blame onto me.

399
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,159
I'm speechless.

400
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,320
I gave birth to the kid.

401
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
All the problems are mine.

402
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,679
I bear all the responsibilities alone.

403
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,399
D-Don't get worked up.

404
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,159
Does he often talk to you?

405
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,159
Yeah.

406
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,320
Every day.

407
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,960
I call him every day,

408
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,320
reminding him of studying.

409
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,720
The importance of studying.

410
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,919
That's it?

411
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,639
So you don't talk about anything else.

412
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,840
He is lagging far behind.

413
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,799
If he doesn't

414
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,000
get into a good university,

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,120
what will he do?

416
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,360
The vocational diploma

417
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,720
won't even get him a job.

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,320
I don't know what these kids

419
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,759
are thinking every day.

420
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,759
What can they think about?

421
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,200
They're in their adolescence.

422
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:07,279
N-Naturally, they're curious

423
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,880
about that stuff.

424
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,680
It's a normal impulse.

425
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,759
As his parents,

426
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,480
you should guide him.

427
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,480
Tell me. How should I guide him?

428
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,519
I've seen

429
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,480
that disgusting thing on his underwear

430
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,880
and those tissues in the trash can.

431
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,200
What should I do

432
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
as his mother?

433
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,640
I called his dad.

434
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,559
I said, "Our kid has grown up.

435
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,480
Talk to him about those things."

436
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,279
He hung up on me

437
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,759
and texted,

438
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,640
"I'm busy.

439
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,920
In a meeting."

440
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,720
H-He's always busy.

441
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,799
Always in endless meetings.

442
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,079
We are not here
to discuss who is at fault.

443
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,599
We are here

444
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,359
to investigate the background

445
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,759
of Zhen Rong's criminal acts.

446
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,759
Zhen Rong has committed a crime.

447
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,119
This is a fact.

448
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,839
You can't change that. Understand?

449
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,160
Please

450
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,319
help him.

451
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
Try to recall

452
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,039
if Zhen Rong has been

453
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,559
associating with

454
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,519
some strange people

455
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,359
and if he's been

456
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:23,880
acting strangely.

457
00:18:24,224 --> 00:18:24,799
Yeah.

458
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:27,759
He met a little vixen at school.

459
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,519
Mom,

460
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,319
why isn't the light on?

461
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,880
Mom, you didn't bring food to Grandpa?

462
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,720
What's wrong?

463
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,359
You want me gone?

464
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,519
No.

465
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,759
Ms. Lin said the afternoon was free

466
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:58,200
and you left early.

467
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,160
It's already 8:30 PM.

468
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,880
Where were you?

469
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,519
I went to the bookstore.

470
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,960
The bookstore?

471
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,240
With whom?

472
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,480
I went by myself.

473
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,160
By yourself?

474
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:18,839
Mom,

475
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,480
I'm sorry.

476
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,319
Homework done?

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,839
Not yet.

478
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,680
Do your homework.

479
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,672
Mom,

480
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
what's wrong?

481
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,039
This afternoon, I called your teachers

482
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,480
and classmates.

483
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,319
They said they saw you
with a girl from your class.

484
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,440
I just want to hear
what you have to say.

485
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,079
I didn't expect

486
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,960
that my own child

487
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,119
has learned to lie to me.

488
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,519
Mom, I just didn't
want to make you angry.

489
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,240
Is that why

490
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,640
you lied to me?

491
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,880
Why did you call my teacher again?

492
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:23,440
Where did you go?

493
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,256
What did you do?

494
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,680
I went to the school.

495
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,119
I bought some cat food.

496
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:28,960
What's her name?

497
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,519
I'm talking to you.

498
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,680
What's her name?

499
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,519
You've grown up

500
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,200
and become rebellious.

501
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,640
You're breaking my heart

502
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,480
for a woman.

503
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm so tired of looking after

504
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,240
the entire Zhen family.

505
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,319
I won't care a thing about you anymore.

506
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,839
Mom.

507
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,519
Mom.

508
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,559
Mom, I'm sorry.

509
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,599
Open up.

510
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,384
Mom.

511
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,960
Mom, I'm sorry.

512
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,960
Xia Qiu.

513
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,640
It's Xia Qiu.

514
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,839
Her name is Xia Qiu.

515
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,519
Girls are more mature than boys
at the same age.

516
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:45,599
They know a lot.

517
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,000
So I called

518
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,839
the parents of this girl,

519
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,720
telling them to stop their daughter

520
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,920
from going too close
to boys for no reason.

521
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,279
Let's put aside
whether she did anything wrong.

522
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,880
You called her parents

523
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,960
right in front of your son.

524
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,480
How is he going to

525
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,839
uphold his dignity?

526
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,960
He shouldn't get too close to girls.

527
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,839
I know what those kids

528
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,279
are thinking at their age.

529
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,279
I'm doing this

530
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,440
to protect them.

531
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,640
That's your wishful thinking.

532
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,200
So many kids have been ruined

533
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,559
by this family structure.

534
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,559
One missing. One controlling.

535
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,480
We'll take a look at his room.

536
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,880
Not allowed to lock.

537
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:38,368
(Work hard for a hundred days
to have good grades in the exam)

538
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:58,400
(Key points)

539
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,759
Full monitoring without blind spots.

540
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:07,552
(Drunk driving is no small matter)

541
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,359
I'm off. Bye.

542
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,480
I'm off.

543
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,640
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

544
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,440
Prosecutor Yuan.

545
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,160
Prosecutor Lin.

546
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,480
Why did you come

547
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,640
after work hours?

548
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,640
Take a look.

549
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,319
What is it?

550
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,640
Take a look.

551
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,279
He's...

552
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,480
That's right, he is.

553
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,519
You're right.

554
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,119
Why are you showing me this?

555
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,519
Zhen Rong's parents

556
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,559
installed

557
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:41,400
surveillance cameras in his room.

558
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,920
It has nothing to do
with him profiting from spreading

559
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,079
obscene materials.

560
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,960
I'm not trying to prove his innocence.

561
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:49,839
I'm just saying

562
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:51,880
that we can take into account the cause

563
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,200
in the case of juvenile delinquency.

564
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Sorry, Prosecutor Lin.

565
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,519
We don't take that into account.

566
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,559
Improper discipline

567
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,560
is his parents' duty.

568
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:03,920
I'm just being impartial.

569
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,559
I have a court session tomorrow.

570
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,119
Feel free to upgrade the handling level

571
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,519
to the city procuratorate.

572
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,759
Yuan Jiaxin.

573
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
Dear Prosecutor Yuan.

574
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,000
I know you're busy.

575
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,480
I'll just take up 30 seconds

576
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,839
of your valuable time, okay?

577
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:22,200
It's been 10 seconds. Hurry up.

578
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,039
Okay, go ahead.

579
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:23,880
Even 20 is enough.

580
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,960
Go ahead.

581
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
I'm not an expert in legal principles.

582
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,000
But I'm good at math.

583
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,119
Let me do the math.

584
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,559
He made a total of 1,400 yuan

585
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,039
in a group of 129 people

586
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,880
with a total of 307 videos posted.

587
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,440
So he made less than 4 cents

588
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:38,319
per video per person.

589
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,759
You call this profiting?

590
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,880
Zhen Rong, come out.

591
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:51,328
(Yunhai First Detention Center)

592
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,079
Hi, Principal Lin.

593
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,559
Zhen Rong.

594
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,599
This is not an interrogation

595
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,039
but a family meeting.

596
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:05,079
Once you see your mom,

597
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,480
open up and talk to her.

598
00:25:08,532 --> 00:25:10,400
(Yunhai First Detention Center)

599
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,759
Stay a bit farther back later.

600
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,440
Thank you.

601
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:17,880
Thank you.

602
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,000
(Family meeting room)
Alright.

603
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,880
Let's cut to the chase.

604
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,480
Who sent you

605
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,880
those nasty videos?

606
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,000
Why did they lure you in?

607
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
No one lured me.

608
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,400
Mom, I'm not a kid anymore.

609
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,519
Do you know where we are?

610
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:37,640
If you don't tell the truth,

611
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,720
your life is doomed.

612
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,160
Excuse me, calm down.

613
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,039
There is nothing

614
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,000
to talk about.

615
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,119
You haven't started yet.

616
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,519
Excuse me.

617
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Just a word with you.

618
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,400
He's a disgrace to our family.

619
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:51,680
Calm down.

620
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,440
To be honest,

621
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,799
Uncle Yuan here and I

622
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,720
were also curious at your age.

623
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,559
It's just that

624
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:13,839
you know much more
than we did when we were young.

625
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,839
Right?

626
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,799
We were only

627
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,519
going to the internet bar.

628
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,359
Right, Yuan?

629
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,599
Internet bar, really?

630
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,599
Really.

631
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,079
Yuan.

632
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,799
Weren't you curious as a teenager?

633
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,960
I didn't watch anything.

634
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,759
Sure.

635
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,519
This is not embarrassing.

636
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,680
Really.

637
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,640
It's a normal impulse.

638
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,279
Everyone has some

639
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,440
fantasies.

640
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,000
Fantasies?

641
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,279
I didn't want those fantasies.

642
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:57,680
First,

643
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,960
it's normal to have fantasies

644
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,559
and impulses.

645
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,519
It's nothing wrong.

646
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:03,720
Secondly,

647
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,160
you are equal with your parents

648
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,039
and teachers.

649
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,480
Say what you have to say.

650
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,920
Thirdly,

651
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,039
we are all here with you.

652
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,440
Why are you still

653
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,519
scared of your mom?

654
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,640
We fought for this family meeting

655
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,599
as an opportunity for Zhen Rong.

656
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:28,359
It's also an opportunity for you.

657
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,759
Do you want him
to be severely sentenced?

658
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,480
Does he appreciate my effort?

659
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,079
He's been brainwashed.

660
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,559
Calm down first.

661
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
Remember

662
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,000
when your son was born,

663
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:44,720
his first steps,

664
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,240
and his first words.

665
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,559
Does he always

666
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,079
learn everything immediately?

667
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,160
When he was

668
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,759
smashing things as a baby,

669
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,720
did you scold him like you did today?

670
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,559
He is experiencing

671
00:27:57,559 --> 00:27:59,160
another transition at this point.

672
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,759
Why is it different this time?

673
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,039
Look, you are

674
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,480
listening to me carefully.

675
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
I believe you heard

676
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,359
everything I said.

677
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,759
Why can't you do that with your son?

678
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,759
Can we give it a try?

679
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,000
I understand you.

680
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,079
I do.

681
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:29,000
While searching for info,
I clicked on a pop-up.

682
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,440
It was something

683
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,200
very revealing.

684
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,119
I didn't dare to look and closed it.

685
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,000
I understand.

686
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,839
Too much nasty content
on the internet nowadays.

687
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,880
Then, I once saw

688
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:47,160
my roommate watching a video.

689
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,640
So I learned

690
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,480
that guys were sharing nasty videos.

691
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,440
I logged into that website

692
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,839
without my mom noticing.

693
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,359
Then

694
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,480
I lost control.

695
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
I downloaded some videos.

696
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,119
A classmate found out

697
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,680
and asked for them.

698
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
After a while,

699
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,400
more people found out.

700
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,599
To make it easier,

701
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,240
I created a group.

702
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,359
Who knows you're the group leader?

703
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,119
Just three or four.

704
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,079
I told them that

705
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,440
if they told others,

706
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,680
I would disband it.

707
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,200
Are all the members your classmates?

708
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Only at the beginning.

709
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,440
Later, they invited more people.

710
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,880
Most of them were strangers.

711
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,559
At first, I got a little scared.

712
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,200
But they all called me "Bro".

713
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,359
Why did you create the group?

714
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,599
I just wanted to share some videos.

715
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,599
I didn't know it was illegal.

716
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,400
Then why

717
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,119
did they start paying you?

718
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,519
I don't know.

719
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,559
At first, I didn't accept it.

720
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,319
But then someone said

721
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,240
that they shouldn't let me pay

722
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:09,480
the membership fee for the videos alone.

723
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:25,119
(So many!)

724
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,799
(What type?)

725
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,968
Next one.

726
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:30,144
(Study Materials Sharing Group)

727
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,200
Zhen Rong.

728
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,720
Come down.

729
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:33,920
Good stuff.

730
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,559
Go ahead.

731
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,160
Stop pretending.

732
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,480
Even good students have needs.

733
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,240
Him? He doesn't.

734
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:41,720
Come on.

735
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,480
Zhen Rong, here.

736
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,072
There's more.

737
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,720
So many today.

738
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,440
Respect, group leader.

739
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,000
I bought videos with the money.

740
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,559
I didn't earn a cent.

741
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
I even chipped in a lot.

742
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,480
So you did this just to hear others

743
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,079
compliment you, right?

744
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
At first,

745
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:10,119
the guys looked down on me

746
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,440
because I wouldn't watch those videos.

747
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,519
They said I had problems.

748
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,680
Suddenly, I had so many friends.

749
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,640
So you just enjoyed

750
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,839
having many friends

751
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,000
and being trusted.

752
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,920
Is that right?

753
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,359
I do often

754
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,519
have those dirty dreams.

755
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,440
But no one lured me.

756
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,319
Zhen Rong.

757
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,799
Those are not dirty.

758
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,559
It's a normal phase in life.

759
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:48,960
One more question.

760
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,119
Tian Jun posted
those secretly taken photos

761
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,000
in the group at first, right?

762
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,759
Yeah.

763
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,440
I...

764
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,079
I-I didn't know that those girls

765
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,160
were from our school.

766
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,440
By the time I found out,

767
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,599
it was out of control.

768
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,880
Why did you disband the group?

769
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,279
I saw them humiliating Xia Qiu.

770
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,240
I didn't want that.

771
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:15,839
So I disbanded the group.

772
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,519
Prosecutor Yuan.

773
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,880
Zhen Rong didn't have severe

774
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,200
subjective malevolence.

775
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,240
Please reconsider.

776
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,000
The legal provisions

777
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,839
and standards are there.

778
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,480
Conditional

779
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,599
non-prosecution

780
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,039
is only applicable for

781
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
sentencing of less than a year.

782
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,680
You know that very well.

783
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,759
You're not worried

784
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,960
that changing the sentencing

785
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,319
would make you look bad, do you?

786
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,119
Bai Enyu.

787
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,559
Some people are different.

788
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,279
They never had adolescence.

789
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,519
That's enough.

790
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,119
Yuan,

791
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:54,240
I won't apply for an elevated handling.

792
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,079
But I hope that you aim an inch higher

793
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,119
to give the kids a chance.

794
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:02,119
Firstly, Zhen Rong didn't gain profit.

795
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:02,680
Right?

796
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,480
Secondly, he distributed
obscene materials online.

797
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,319
We can't handle it

798
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:07,720
according to the number of plays.

799
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,920
Besides, neither

800
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,640
the number of clicks

801
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,279
nor the number of distributions

802
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:14,359
reaches five times
the sentencing standard.

803
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,799
It doesn't qualify as a severe case.

804
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,200
Prosecutor Yuan.

805
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,119
Show him leniency

806
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,759
and allow him a future.

807
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,079
Zhen Rong

808
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,759
really deserves a chance.

809
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,759
Can we not give up on him

810
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,359
and try harder?

811
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,720
I will try my best to the extent

812
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,839
permitted by law.

813
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,799
You're awesome.

814
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:46,880
(Yang's Diner)

815
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,000
Little mute.

816
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,720
Can you speak or not?

817
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Speak, mute.

818
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,079
Speak.

819
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:52,960
Speak, mute.

820
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,200
- Speak.
- Speak.

821
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
- Speak.
- Speak.

822
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,839
What are you doing?

823
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,640
We're teaching

824
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,960
this thief a lesson.

825
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,800
Aren't these rotten?

826
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,079
Yeah.

827
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,719
So you know it's rotten?

828
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
Didn't he get it from the trash can?

829
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,679
You live in a trash can?

830
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,840
So he didn't steal it, whatever.

831
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,760
It's his fault that he's a mute.

832
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,639
So sharp-tongued.

833
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,960
Get lost. Go home.

834
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,000
- Mute.
- Little mute.

835
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,320
Nasty kids!

836
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,840
- Mute.
- Run.

837
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,592
Get up.

838
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,679
Look at you.

839
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
They wronged you,

840
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,639
pushed you, and cursed at you.

841
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,280
And you just let them, huh?

842
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,320
You never fight back.

843
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,679
Where's your family?

844
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,119
You know where you live, huh?

845
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,719
Let's go. Lead the way.

846
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,880
I'll take you home.

847
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,119
Go ahead.

848
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:12,760
Lead the way.

849
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,039
How would I know where you live?

850
00:35:25,632 --> 00:35:32,510
(Accommodation)

851
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,880
You live here too?

852
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,320
Wait.

853
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:29,599
Have this.

854
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,639
Xia Qiu.

855
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,440
Sign this.

856
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,008
(Letter of Repentance)

857
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,800
Sorry, I was wrong.

858
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,639
Please show mercy.

859
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:16,679
Spare me once.

860
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,840
Here's 200 yuan.

861
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,360
Once you sign,

862
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,039
they will all sign.

863
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,000
I'll add another 300, okay?

864
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,440
Girls' underwear
is pretty much the same.

865
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,239
No one will know whose it is.

866
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,280
You think you're quite special, huh?

867
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Tell you what.

868
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,679
I haven't posted your photos yet.

869
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,000
I'll ruin whoever

870
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:59,360
wants to ruin me. Do you hear me?

871
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:00,880
Let go.

872
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,280
Sign and I'll let go.

873
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,920
Okay.

874
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:09,960
I'll sign.

875
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,679
I'm sorry.

876
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:17,440
I apologize.

877
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,079
I have a bad temper.

878
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,519
Too impulsive.

879
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,568
Here.

880
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,039
The vet says

881
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,760
the neutering fee

882
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,159
is 500 yuan.

883
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,559
This is exact.

884
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:37,840
Get yourself neutered.

885
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,360
Wait...

886
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,559
You want me to sign?

887
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:43,079
In your dreams.

888
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,480
I'll kill you.

889
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,280
Get lost!

890
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,800
Got a problem?

891
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,360
You failed such an easy task?

892
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,320
You're useless.

893
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,039
There's something
you can't solve with money?

894
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,119
How come...

895
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:05,719
How come

896
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,400
I have such a useless kid like you?

897
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,679
Waiting for what?

898
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,280
Didn't you hear me?

899
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
Don't you feel ashamed here?

900
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,199
Let's go.

901
00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:31,008
(How are you doing?)

902
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,360
Have it all.

903
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,320
Pure and clean, understand?

904
00:39:57,199 --> 00:39:58,360
I don't ask you

905
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,480
to be rich and powerful

906
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,119
as long as you
live honestly and modestly.

907
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,000
Dig in.

908
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,159
Dig in.

909
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:23,880
With big bites.

910
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,920
Eat. Do you hear me?

911
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,559
Remember,

912
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,280
the leniency is conditional.

913
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,840
Don't let me down again.

on sex education for minors)

915
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,920
It's mine. Not kid-friendly.

916
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,440
Let me take a look.

917
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:29,119
Zhitao, take a look.

918
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,159
Good. Time to learn something.

919
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,119
How is this
a sex education lecture plan?

920
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,239
You're distributing obscene materials.

921
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,639
Nonsense.

922
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,280
This is edutainment.

923
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,800
It's down to earth, okay?

924
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,800
I knew I couldn't count on you.

925
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:43,679
Take it away.

926
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,920
I have it ready here.

927
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,960
Yours won't work.

928
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,760
I have it ready. There you go.

Let me see.

931
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,440
Isn't this a political education class?

932
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,800
Isn't this a genetics biology lecture?

933
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:07,760
What?

934
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:10,039
Dull and tasteless.

935

Good job.

I-I think it's pretty good.

938
