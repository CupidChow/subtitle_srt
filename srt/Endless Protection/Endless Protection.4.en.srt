Boss, one bowl of noodles.

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,239
How much for a lamb skewer?

4
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,719
Take the shrimp.

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,440

Don't rush!

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,439
Look for Big Fish.
Big Fish is the main target.

11
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:42,719
Roger that.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,479

13

Take it slow.

15
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:56,799
Thank you.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,200
Mentor, goods are delivered.

17
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,439
The Eye is on it now.

18
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,200
Get out.

19
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,239
- Let's go.
- Okay.

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,239
This tastes good.

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,599
Are you alright?

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,760
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,400
Little Fish got it.
Boss, should we act?

24
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,920
Mentor, should we act?

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,799
They're going to run!

26
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,439
Arrest them!

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,000
Come on.

28
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,759
Where to go?

29
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,400
Stop!

30
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,400
Don't move.

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,759
- Hand over the child!
- What do you want?

32
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,639
My child is snatched!

33
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,719

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,319
Go.

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,599
You, over there.

00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,840
Sorry.

40
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,120
Stop.

41
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,520
Stop there!

42
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,039
Keep running. Quite a runner, huh?

43
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:41,960
Squat down!

44
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,439

Get in the car quickly.

48
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,439
There is a pregnant woman

50
00:03:29,504 --> 00:03:30,319

My wife and I came a few times,

60
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,759
but the shop was closed.

61

Mr. Yang.

My wife is pregnant.

She vomits everything,

00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,439
and only wants your porridge.

you have now,

Thank you so much.

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,560
We're really short-staffed

80
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,759
and you're so urgent.

81
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,279
These are all ingredients.

82
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,360
But I've written

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,399

It's my gratitude.

Just accept it.

91
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,519
That's really unfortunate for you.

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,040
Well...

93
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,040
Why not report to the police?

94
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,199
What's the point?

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,160

96
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,759

00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,720
Come by more often then.

98
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,319
Sure.

99
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,920
- Close the door.
- Okay.

109

Okay, okay. Don't take it.

110
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,759
Alright.

111
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,800
That's okay.

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,240
Alright.

113
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,199

or eight months to go.

117
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:14,639
Alright, I know it.

118

You don't need to do anything!

119
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,360
You are just speaking!

120
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,560
When I had prenatal checkups,

121
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
you didn't show up.

122
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,120
I filed a record alone.

124

126
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,279
Where were you?

127
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,159
I was wrong.

128
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,080
I'll accompany you.

129
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,320
It's been ten years.

130
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,360
I wait at home for you every day.

131
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,519
Now we have a child.

132
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,919
Will we both wait for you at home?

133
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,840
No.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll wait for you.

135
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,600
I'll wait for you and our kid.

136
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,519
I'll wait for you.

137
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,120
I'll run straight home after work.

138
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,440
I promise, okay?

139
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,759
Alright.

140
00:08:59,519 --> 00:08:59,960
Come in.

141
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,279
What is the matter?

142
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,679
Nothing important.

143
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,399
I...

144
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,200
Just water your flowers

145
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,039
and see if you have any instructions.

146
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,879
My flowers don't need tea.

147
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Flowers don't, but you do.

148
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,279
I'll pour it for you.

149
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,039
Just say it.

150
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,240
I...

151
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,279
I just want to ask if

152
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,039
the personnel from Procuratorate

153
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,679
come to visit here again?

154
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:51,639
Be straightforward.

155
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,519
Any news about my interview
of Procuratorate?

156
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,399
Bai.

157
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you really a lubber?

158
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,960
You offended Procuratorate leaders

159
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,320
so harshly.

160
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,120
Still expect them to hire you?

161
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,240
No.

162
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,440
I just thought

163
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,360
if it doesn't work out,

164
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,720
I'll just work hard

165
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,480
and follow you.

166
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,039
Then, just work hard.

167
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,000
Chief, you're well-informed.

168
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,279
Are there any internal transfers

169
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,320
in other departments
before the New Year?

170
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,159
Bai.

171
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,240
I haven't retired yet.

172
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
Are you planning

173
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,200
to offend

174
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,720
all our fellow units?

175
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,000
No.

176
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,559
I'm just worried

177
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,679
you might recommend me

178
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,519
without my consent.

179
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
What if they accept me?

180
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't keep working with you.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,399
Don't worry, that won't happen.

182
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,919
Go back.

183
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,639
Alright then,

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,320
enjoy your tea.

185
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,039
I'm leaving.

186
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,360
If any unit needs people, I'll tell you.

187
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
I know what you're up to

188
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,960
just by the way you move.

189
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,360
Thank you, Chief.

190
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,720
Continue with your work.

191
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,624
Hello? Juvenile Correctional Facility.

193
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:34,592
Okay.

00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,960
That's enough.

196
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Come down now.

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,240
Please, okay?

198
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,240
Weixiang.

199
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,320
Stop running!

200
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Weixiang!

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,279
Stop running!

202
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,120
Don't run.

203
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
You'll get hurt.

204
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,279
Stop running.

205
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,120
Don't kick.

206
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,080
Watch him closely.

207
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,960
Come down. I'm exhausted...

208
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,320
Prosecutor Lin.

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,759
Let me do it.

210
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:14,879
Well,

211
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
anything needed, let's discuss later.

212
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,080
I haven't slept.

213
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,799
Look at this mess.

214
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,440
No, we're here to help.

215
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,519
Didn't you notify us

216
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,120
to come for early intervention?

217
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,480
Xiaoyao!

218
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:28,399
I let you call
the Juvenile Prosecution Office.

219
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:28,960
What is it?

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,039
Not the major crimes unit.

221
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,279
I did as you said.

222
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:35,879
We're from Juvenile Prosecution Office.

223
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,279
Where is Captain Du?

224
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,080
Captain Du?

225
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,080
In the interrogation room.

226
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
Stop crying, dear.

227
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,639
Contact the Welfare Home.

228
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,879
See if they can take them in.

229
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:47,320
Right now.

230
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,159
Alright.

231
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,080
You're too much!

232
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
Please, Prosecutor Lin.
We'll handle it.

233
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,440
I've been putting up with you
for quite some time.

234
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,639
- You, keep an eye on him.
- Okay.

235
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
Alright, kids.

236
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,879
Look what I've got.

237
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,399
Who wants it?

238
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,240
Who behaves well can get it.

239
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
This time,

240
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,120
we caught one adult, six kids,

241
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,360
and one baby.

242
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,360
You probably saw it all outside.

243
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,519
Where is that adult?

244
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,600
Well,

245
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,360
she's pregnant.

246
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,919
Once she got in,

247
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,360
she said she's about to give birth,
forcing us to take her

248
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,240
to the hospital.

249
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,240
This kid, an old acquaintance.

250
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,639
Just got released.

251
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,639
Can you reach their parents?

252
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,679
No, we can't.

253
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,960
Completely unreachable.

254
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,720
Prosecutor Lin.

255
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,120
We've worked together
quite a few times, right?

256
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,039
This time,

257
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,559
Prosecutor Zheng said

258
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,480
you're exploring early intervention.

259
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,039
We're fully cooperating with you.

260
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,720
So, let's have a discussion.

261
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,120
As you know,

262
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,879
those kids outside

263
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,200
will have to be released.

264
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,799
Can we speed things up

265
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,080
and interrogate him first?

266
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,840
The guardian must be present.

267
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,120
Or we can't begin questioning.

268
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,559
You've all here.

269
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,679
You can supervise.

270
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,679
Early intervention

271
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,879
is different from
having a guardian present.

272
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,120
You've handled major cases.

273
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,440
You know the importance
of timing, right?

274
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:24,720
Alright.

275
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,639
Nothing to hide.

276
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,960
To be honest,

277
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,240
this time,

278
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,360
we didn't catch them all.

279
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,120
We couldn't catch

280
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,279
the mastermind after a night waiting.

281
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,240
If we wait for another night,

282
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:39,519
and that master behind runs away,

283
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,279
all our efforts will be wasted.

284
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:44,440
No way.

285
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,000
Just let me in.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,088
- No.
- I'm his instructor.

287
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,264
- No, there's no precedent.
- Come on, we are colleagues.

288
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:52,200
See? I am a cop too.

289
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Just let me in.

290
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,559
What's going on? Why yelling?

291
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,600
Hello, sir.

292
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,799
I am Lu Sheng's instructor.

293
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,120
Instructor Bai?

294
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,440
Prosecutor Lin.

295
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,639
You know each other?

296
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:03,960
Kind of.

297
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,960
I know her.

298
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,759
She also knows me.

299
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,919
About last time, sorry.

300
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,679
I was impulsive.

301
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,600
About what?

302
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,240
Well, was a kid

303
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,519
named Lu Sheng

304
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:17,919
arrested?

305
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,960
You are his instructor, right?

306
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,080
Right.

307
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:24,639
Can you reach out to his parents?

308
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:25,759
His parents...

309
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,840
What did he do?

310
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,080
I'm asking
if you can contact his parents.

311
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,440
Don't probe into the case.

312
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:31,480
Can you?

313
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,559
His parents...

314
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,200
Well, all the events

315
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,559
we organized
that needed parents to attend,

316
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,399
he never showed up.

317
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,519
When he left,

318
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,879
we couldn't reach them either.

319
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,919
So what exactly did he do?

320
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,679
But, sir,

321
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,879
he has really reformed.

322
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,039
He was the class monitor,
even had sentence reduced.

323
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,200
He wouldn't mess up again.

324
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,720
Could there be some misunderstanding?

325
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,080
There's no misunderstanding.

326
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,799
He's caught red-handed with evidence.

327
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,720
Can I go in and talk to him?

328
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,759
I'll get what you

329
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,759
want to know out of him.

330
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, you're that good?

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,559
Why not interrogate all other suspects?

332
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,759
Wait. Just trust me.

333
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,039
He really listens to me.
I can definitely help you.

334
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,320
Let him in.

335
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We need an appropriate adult present

336
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,879
as a legal representative.

337
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,080
Alright, I'm suitable.

338
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,679
Can you?

339
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,440
I can do that.

340
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:15,879
Okay.

341
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,120
Kid, show some respect.

342
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
Today, we've invited colleagues

343
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,519
from the Procuratorate
just for your case,

344
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,440
you got that?

345
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:36,879
Lu Sheng.

346
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,320
Here!

347
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,120
What did you say when being released?

348
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,960
Just nonsense?

349
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,480
Instructor Bai.

350
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,559
I haven't been to prison.

351
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,119
Don't shout at me so early.

352
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,359
You dare say that again!

353
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,119
Instructor Bai,

354
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,720
please take your seat.

355
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
Please sit down, okay? Come here.

356
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,640
You wait.

357
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,880
When it is over, I'll deal with you.

358
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
I'll just sit here.

359
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,359
Explain everything clearly!

360
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,000
Instructor Bai.

361
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,079
Your task today

362
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,319
is just to observe.

363
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,920
Do you understand?

364
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:35,920
Lu Sheng, listen.

365
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,440
Since we cannot contact your parents,

366
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
according to the law,

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,359
we found an appropriate adult

368
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,279
to sit in and observe.

369
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,200
So many people, just for me?

370
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,079
Really?

371
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
No one will hurt you.
We're here to help you, okay?

372
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,160
- Okay.
- Let's begin.

373
00:17:50,848 --> 00:17:51,720
Let's begin.

374
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:53,640
Lu Sheng.

375
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,279
Talk to us.

376
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,839
You've been here twice, huh?

377
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,680
You know the rules.

378
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,400
Just say what you want.

379
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,359
Kid, don't push your luck.

380
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:03,960
Captain Du.

381
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,039
Keep the tone in check.

382
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,319
He's still a minor.

383
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,680
- Okay?
- Alright.

384
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,079
Tell me, around 9 PM
on October 4th,

385
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,240
on Kexiang West Road,

386
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,319
you stole electric bike batteries.

387
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,359
Do you admit it?

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,519
I admit it.

389
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,672
Who organized it?

390
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,079
Who was the leader?

391
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:27,840
I am.

392
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,519
You?

393
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Then, how did you

394
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,319
know those kids?

395
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:34,480
We met on the streets.

396
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:35,920
All my buddies.

397
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,759
Those seven or eight-year-olds?
Your buddies?

398
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,839
Those who crawl under the table

399
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,640
are your buddies?

400
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,880
Be serious.

401
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,599
Right.

402
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,680
Do friends have age limits?

403
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:46,640
Watch your attitude!

404
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,799
You too.

405
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:49,519
You can't say.

406
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:55,119
Let's all be serious.

407
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,680
Continue.

408
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:58,799
Lu Sheng.

409
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,000
What made you think

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,319
of organizing these kids

411
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,200
to commit theft?

412
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,200
None of us got parents.

413
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,039
We live together.

414
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,480
We have to eat and earn some money.

415
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,559
What's your connection to Zhou Aijuan,
the pregnant woman?

416
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,039
No connection.

417
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,319
Every line of work has peers.

418
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,079
You mean, you all met on the streets,

419
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,359
and to survive,

420
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,200
you decided to steal together?

421
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:28,720
Isn't it obvious?

422
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,519
Where do you live?

423
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,079
No place.

424
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:36,400
We wander.

425
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,079
Lu Sheng.

426
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,000
If someone is coercing you,
you don't need to worry or be afraid.

427
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,799
But if you want

428
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,119
to take all the blame now,

429
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,880
that's not a truthful confession.

430
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,519
No one is coercing me.

431
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,000
I told you I got

432
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,559
nowhere to stay.

433
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,640
I just live there, okay?

434
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:58,559
Kid.

435
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,359
I'll remind you of something.

436
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,240
You're seventeen years old, right?

437
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,880
If you obstruct the investigation,

438
00:20:06,599 --> 00:20:08,519
it'll delay your case.

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,640
Understand?

440
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,640
I just said

441
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:12,240
I organized it.

442
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:13,599
I'll take responsibility.

443
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Arrest me if you want.

444
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:18,440
So by your own words,

445
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,759
you're the leader
of this theft group, right?

446
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:21,880
Then tell me,

447
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,839
where did you fence

448
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,920
the stolen goods?

449
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,799
E-bike shops, phone stores, and so on.

450
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,720
Which shop?

451
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,519
The owner's name?

452
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,200
I can't remember clearly.

453
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,759
Then, last time,

454
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,799
what did you sell?

455
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,440
How much was it? You spent it.

456
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,039
On what?

457
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,079
E-bike batteries.

458
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,640
One hundred each.

459
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,799
On food.

460
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,784
What did you eat?

461
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,039
Barbecue.

462
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,839
Barbecue for a group of kids.

463
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,759
Is one hundred yuan enough?

464
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,920
I can't remember the details.

465
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,200
Forgot again?

466
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,240
Didn't the owner ask you

467
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,440
where the battery came from?

468
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:58,720
No.

469
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,880
Why not?

470
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,960
He knows us.

471
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,559
No need to ask.

472
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
Are you gonna keep lying?

473
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,359
Did I let you speak?

474
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,880
Well, you don't know him.

475
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,880
Believe it or not!

476
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,599
You are still lying?

477
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,119
Did I let you speak?

478
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,599
You know where we are?

479
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:14,400
Get him out!

480
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,640
You think I don't know you?
Speak the truth!

481
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,799
Get out, now.

482
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,000
Wait for me, Lu Sheng.

483
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,680
Instructor Bai,

484
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,079
you never know me.

485
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
When I came out, you told me

486
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,200
to start afresh.

487
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,319
A man

488
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,720
must solve problems.

489
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:35,680
But it's no use.

490
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
I'm just a maggot in the gutter.

491
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,039
Your teachings

492
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,519
are useless.

493
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,119
- Talking nonsense!
- Lu Sheng.

494
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:44,640
Take him out.

495
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,359
Now! Get him out!

496
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:48,279
- I wasted two years on teaching you!
- Get out!

497
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,880
Lu Sheng, you bad guy!

498
00:21:52,032 --> 00:21:52,839
Captain Du.

499
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,720
Can't continue. Let's go.

500
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:57,799
Watch him.

501
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:00,680
Prosecutor Lin.

502
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,000
When did you transfer over
to handle juvenile cases?

503
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:05,400
Not long ago.

504
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,880
The office just started
juvenile justice pilot department.

505
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
You got promoted?

506
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,864
- Not at all.
- How many people report to you?

507
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,079
Just one.

508
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,680
Just a clerk.

509
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,920
- That's it?
- That's it.

510
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,400
How can you even manage?

511
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,440
Captain Du.

512
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,480
For all future juvenile cases,

513
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,279
we may need to intervene early

514
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,799
to guide investigations.

515
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,559
We'll need your full cooperation.

516
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,079
Got it.

517
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,759
A pilot, after all.

518
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,359
Exactly.

519
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:40,559
You just said "all",

520
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,960
you mean...

521
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,319
All crimes committed by minors

522
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,680
and all crimes against minors.

523
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,039
Actually, the main purpose is to guide
investigation and evidence collection.

524
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:52,799
In this way,

525
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,200
we can ensure that the evidence

526
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,599
meets the prosecution standards.

527
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:58,160
Right.

528
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,640
Alright, we're old friends, right?

529
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,240
We'll work together more.

530
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,792
I won't see you off today.

531
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,200
Captain Du,
you really don't want to keep me longer.

532
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,279
Not at all.

533
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,359
I understand.

534
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,880
Our early intervention

535
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,680
probably messes with your usual work.

536
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,599
But I promise

537
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,640
we are here to help,

538
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,400
not cause trouble.

539
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,319
Got it.

540
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,920
Nothing else you want to say to me?

541
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:24,920
Haven't you said everything?

542
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
Nothing important to tell?

543
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,200
What to tell?

544
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,839
If it were just a theft case,

545
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:33,640
you'd not get Procuratorate in, right?

546
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,079
Prosecutor Lin,

547
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,920
the moment you showed up, I knew...

548
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,319
Lead the way.

549
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,119
Okay, let's go

550
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:42,960
to my office.

551
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
Let's talk.

552
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:47,119
This is from July 15th.

553
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:00,599
See?

554
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,519
That's a pregnant woman.

555
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,759
The kid is so small.

556
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,759
Just this small.

557
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:17,720
Quite smoothly.

558
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,920
They acted quite smoothly.

559
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:20,119
Indeed.

560
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,119
They are providing cover.

561
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,359
Next one.

562
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,079
(Welcome)
From the 20th day of last month.

563
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,119
Look.

564
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,920
Now, these kids

565
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,880
and this pregnant woman

566
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,079
are regulars at the police station now.

567
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,680
The officers can't do much.

568
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:50,920
They can only

569
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,759
educate the kids.

570
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,079
The woman always pretended
to be pitiful,

571
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,000
saying she didn't even know the kids.

572
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,039
And the kids' parents

573
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:01,160
can't be reached at all?

574
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,920
Some can.

575
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,039
But just in days
after they were taken home,

576
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,839
they were caught for theft again.

577
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,720
Moreover,

578
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:11,319
we have now discovered

579
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,279
more kids are getting involved

580
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:16,559
in theft than before.

581
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,880
Thank you.

582
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,319
We'll keep in touch then.

583
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,039
Alright.

584
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:22,440
Go back.

585
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,880
I won't see you out.

586
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:28,960
Take care.

587
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,759
Ms. Lin!

588
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,559
I'm sorry.

589
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,839
I was too impulsive just now.

590
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:49,559
This...

591
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,680
What do you mean?

592
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,039
Just some gifts,

593
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,559
as my apology to you.

594
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,640
I know Lu Sheng

595
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,599
too well.

596
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:02,920
He likes to talk nonsense.

597
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,279
Please don't take what he just said

598
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,160
in the record.

599
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,200
- Where we are?
- The police station.

600
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,920
- Who am I?
- You're Ms. Lin.

601
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,799
Don't cotton up.

602
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,920
Prosecutor Lin.

603
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,720
Are you bribing a public official
at the police station?

604
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,319
No.

605
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,000
It's just some fruit.

606
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,039
Now, it's evidence.

607
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,079
Evidence of what?

608
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,240
Evidence of vitamin C.

609
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,519
I'll take it back!

610
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,559
Prosecutor Lin.

611
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,519
Lu Sheng is very stubborn.

612
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,039
He must be covering for someone

613
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,480
or being coerced.

614
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,039
Prosecutor Lin,

615
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,839
please look into it more.

616
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:44,400
If he were in jail,
he would be done for.

617
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:46,125
(Office Area)

618
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,880
Open your mouth and take a bite.

619
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:04,799
Take a bite.

620
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,079
Is there anything we can help with?

621
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,440
Nothing else.

622
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,200
Just they should be in school,

623
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,960
but they are not.

624
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,519
It's quite pitiful.

625
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,319
Open your mouth.

626
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,240
Take a bite.

627
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,400
What's the condition of these kids?

628
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,359
Besides malnutrition,

629
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,079
most of them have likely suffered
some form of abuse.

630
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,200
I really don't know how to heal

631
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,559
their emotional wounds.

632
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,240
Call the hospital

633
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,079
and give each of them a check-up.

634
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,240
Okay, I'll call first thing tomorrow.

635
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,759
Call now.

636
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,279
Okay.

637
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,240
Done. Waiting for a reply.

638
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,839
Okay.

639
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,039
Xiaomei.

640
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,559
Oh, you

641
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,160
spilled it.

642
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,720
Oh my, dear.

643
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,279
You spilled it all over yourself.

644
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,559
Why are you so disobedient?

645
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,400
Stop, wipe it off.

646
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,880
Isn't it a waste?

647
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,319
Every grain is hard-earned.

648
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,279
Do you know?

649
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,000
Look, you spilled so much.

650
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,079
So disobedient.

651
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,279
Have some soup, okay?

652
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,200
Be good, and eat up.

653
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,279
Do they

654
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,000
have a base?

655
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,552
Don't underestimate these children.

656
00:28:23,552 --> 00:28:25,888
They have excellent
counter-surveillance capabilities.

657
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:27,079
After each crime,

658
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,240
they switch buses several times.

659
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,039
Well organized and disciplined.

660
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,480
In that case,

661
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,119
I strongly suspect
someone's pulling the strings.

662
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,720
So our initial theory is

663
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
that behind this case,

664
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,519
there's a trafficking ring

665
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,279
using minors for theft.

666
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,319
Zhen.

667
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,400
Why did you take Auntie's phone?

668
00:28:57,359 --> 00:28:58,880
Trying to contact someone?

669
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Or give it to someone?

670
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,599
I-I was wrong.

671
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,720
Zhen, look at me.

672
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:14,799
Look at me.

673
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:17,319
What are you afraid of? Tell me.

674
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:18,240
Who are you afraid of?

675
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
No, no.

676
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,799
Don't lock me in a cage.

677
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,799
Who locked you in a cage?

678
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,279
I won't get caught again.

679
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,440
No.

680
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,799
No.

681
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,359
Don't be afraid.

682
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
We're here. You're safe now.

683
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,039
T-Tell what?

684
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:04,440
Tell us your dream.

685
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:06,480
I want to be a doctor.

686
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,680
I want to be a millionaire.

687
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,319
I want

688
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,400
to kiss Hui from the next village.

689
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,200
I just want to be a good student,
and a good son.

690
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,599
I want to open a roast pork shop.

691
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,519
(Outsider)
What is your dream?

692
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,440
I don't have a dream.

693
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:33,160
What's the punishment?

694
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,000
It's very simple.

695
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,039
You not only need to give an answer,

696
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:38,160
but also explain the reason.

697
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:39,480
For three minutes.

698
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,319
Come on, let's applaud.

699
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:46,599
Alright.

700
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:49,640
My dream is

701
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,480
to make your dreams

702
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:53,839
fail to come true.

703
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,319
Guys.

704
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,960
Our theme this time is about dreams.

705
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,759
Dreams have no limits.

706
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:00,920
But why do you

707
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,680
want to see everyone's dreams shattered?

708
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,960
What's the use of dreams?

709
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
What's the use of thinking

710
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,759
of dreams here?

711
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,119
If dreams really works,

712
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,200
just let them dream

713
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,160
of not committing crimes.

714
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,079
That's great, isn't it?

715
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:20,079
That's also a great dream.

716
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
We should face life positively,

717
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,720
and think about good outcomes

718
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,839
to motivate ourselves.

719
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:26,920
Right?

720
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:27,880
We dream.

721
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,319
Then what?

722
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,519
Aren't we all sitting here?

723
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,160
Whose dream actually came true?

724
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:40,839
You guys

725
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,119
just want to brainwash us,

726
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,519
and make us reform.

727
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,000
If we become better,

728
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,079
you take the credit.

729
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,319
If we don't,

730
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,319
it's our fault.

731
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,680
Right?

732
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,920
How could it be?

733
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,960
Who'd accept us in the society?

734
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,839
What's the use of having dreams?

735
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,920
Do your parents care about you?

736
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,799
Anyway, my dad doesn't.

737
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,839
My dad is busy

738
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,000
with his other kids from his mistresses.

739
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,440
He doesn't care about me.

740
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,240
I can be selfless.

741
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,240
But who's been selfless to me?

742
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,359
I

743
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,640
don't know what rules are.

744
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,319
No one ever taught me.

745
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:27,279
Tell me, how do I face

746
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,119
a life like this positively?

747
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:32,864
(Be grateful)

748
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:38,560
(Locker Room)

749
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,680
Captain Bai.

750
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:40,720
Go for lunch?

751
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,720
- The police left?
- Yes, they've left.

752
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,200
They asked all they need,
and took a copy of Lu Sheng's file away.

753
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,624
Good for still investigating.

754
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:54,359
(Yuedong Province
Juvenile Correctional Center)

755
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,440
Didn't you get lunch?
Canteen is closing soon.

756
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:57,440
No appetite.

757
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,920
Has Lu Sheng made you

758
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,960
lose your appetite?

759
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,279
Be quiet.

760
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,240
Or I'll snatch your bowl.

761
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:05,880
Don't eat.

762
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,920
Alright. I'll stop.

763
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,400
But to be honest,

764
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,519
I believe the kids here may come back,

765
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,359
except

766
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,839
Lu Sheng.

767
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,319
Me too.

768
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,200
Why did he do that?

769
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,559
The things he learned here,

770
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,640
including tailoring, auto repair,

771
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,799
cooking, and lion dance,

772
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,079
he's top in each!

773
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,599
How can he not make a living?

774
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:34,432
(Why are you not answering?)

775
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:37,160
What did you say?

776
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:38,599
Make a living.

777
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,480
Take a look.

778
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,440
Can you zoom in this photo?

779
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,079
This one.

780
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,279
Right.

781
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:50,759
This one.

782
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:51,960
Zoom in more.

783
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,720
The resolution is too low,
no point in viewing it on a computer.

784
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,000
It's only a 1MP shot.

785
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,119
How to zoom it in?

786
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,440
Try it.

787
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,920
It's so small.

788
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:04,079
(Xinyue Restaurant)

789
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:05,079
What are the words?

790
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,279
What restaurant?

791
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,440
Xin...yue, right?

792
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,360
Xinyue Restaurant.

793
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,039
Xinyue Restaurant.

794
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,000
Ms. Lin, Lu Sheng's case
from two years ago is here.

795
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,920
And I met the prosecutor

796
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,760
who handled it.

797
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,559
What did he say?

798
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,559
Originally,

799
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,320
it was a break-in theft.

800
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,000
Given his age, it wasn't supposed

801
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,400
to lead to being imprisoned.

802
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,360
But when he stole things,

803
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,599
the male owner suddenly woke up.

804
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,679
In a panic,

805
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,599
he grabbed a knife nearby

806
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,360
and snatched the stuff.

807
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,679
So a theft turned into a robbery.

808
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,159
So it's a robbery case now?

809
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:47,760
Right.

810
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:50,760
Any accomplices?

811
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,440
No.

812
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,800
He confessed right away.

813
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,800
(Yunhai Public Security, Xinli Branch,
Detention Warrant)

814
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,000
Ma'am,

815
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,280
is this Lu Sheng's home?

816
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,719
Ma'am!

817
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,559
May I ask you

818
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,159
is this Lu Guangfu's home?

819
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,440
Do you know Lu Guangfu?

820
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:46,480
Lu Guangfu is not dead.

821
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,519
Lu Guangfu is not dead.

822
00:35:56,564 --> 00:35:58,272
(Name, Zhu Yan)

823
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,119
Ma'am, can we come in?

824
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,039
Is there anyone else here?

825
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:03,880
Anyone here?

826
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,559
This is Lu Guangfu's home, right?

827
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,639
She doesn't seem mentally well.

828
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,039
Anyone here?

829
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,760
Hello?

830
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:13,840
My liquor!

831
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
My liquor!

832
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,519
Hello.

833
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,039
My liquor!

834
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,519
Are you Lu Guangfu?

835
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,519
Wait a moment.

836
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,039
Are you Lu Guangfu?

837
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,280
Wait.

838
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,760
Lu Guangfu, please open the door.

839
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,400
Open the door and let us in.

840
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,719
Lu Guangfu!

841
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,599
Open the door!

842
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,039
What do we do now, Ms. Lin?

843
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,880
How about asking these neighbors?

844
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,360
It seems there's no one here.

845
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,360
Anyone here?

846
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:50,960
Anyone here?

847
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:52,559
Hello? Anyone here?

848
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,000
Xinwu.

849
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,840
Is there anyone here?

850
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,880
Is the address
from your classmate reliable?

851
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,280
Double-check it.

852
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,360
File says it too.

853
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,199
What a coincidence.

854
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,440
Why came here?

855
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,199
I found it.

856
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,519
Inspired by you,

857
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:06,440
I'm here for evidence.

858
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,039
Which one is Lu Guangfu's home?

859
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,440
Nothing to do with you.

860
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,440
How can it have nothing to do with me?

861
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:13,519
Lu Sheng has been
in the facility for two years.

862
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,320
I know him very well.

863
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:18,079
I swear on my life,
he wouldn't do anything bad again.

864
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,880
This all started with this old man.

865
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,559
He went to Lu Sheng's workplace

866
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:24,239
and said Lu Sheng
had been in the facility for theft.

867
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:27,119
The boss of the restaurant freaked out.

868
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:30,599
His father even spread rumors
that Lu Sheng stole things every day.

869
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,920
Of course they kicked him out!

870
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,920
Lu Guangfu spread rumors about Lu Sheng?

871
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,679
His dad slandered him?

872
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,440
Why did he do that?

873
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,920
We should ask about that.

874
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,119
But we can't ask now.

875
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,440
The door is locked.

876
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,599
With such a huge lock,
how can we get inside?

877
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,039
Let's

878
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,840
change the approach.

879
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:52,639
Drink it!

880
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,519
Is the liquor that Lu Sheng bought nice?

881
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,880
Lu Sheng bought

882
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,280
it for me?

883
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,079
Of course.

884
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,679
- What did you say?
- The liquor and food.

885
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:09,039
He had me buy them for you.

886
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:11,679
-Your stomach hurts?
-He wanted me dead.

887
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,079
- That's not true.
- What did you say?

888
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,440
Lu Sheng! Lu Sheng!

889
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,000
Lu Sheng! Lu Sheng!

890
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:18,119
What are you doing?

891
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,000
Sir.

892
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,519
Calm down.

893
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,440
Let's have a drink.

894
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,039
Sir.

895
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,760
Lu Sheng is so good to you.

896
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,639
It's improper for you
to treat him like that.

897
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,199
Why did you go to Xinyue Restaurant,

898
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,440
saying he had been in jail

899
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,880
and he stole things?

900
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,440
Now he's lost his job.

901
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,519
How'd he buy you food and drinks?

902
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,719
What restaurant?

903
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,880
Hasn't he always been working
at Uncle Xiong's place?

904
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,639
Uncle Xiong?

905
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,559
So you never went
o that restaurant, right?

906
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,480
I knew it.

907
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,559
You won't do that.

908
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,840
You really care about him.

909
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:12,679
Well, I'm going out to get some air.

910
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,159
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

911
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,360
Feel bad?

912
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,000
No.

913
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,599
I'm fine.

914
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,599
Do you think that Bai is reliable?

915
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,960
They're drinking inside.

916
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,679
Can you drink?

917
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,719
I can't do that.

918
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,079
Let him drink.

919
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:45,599
Maybe he'll spill something.

920
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,239
The person who...

921
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,000
You scared me!

922
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,800
I'll lower my voice.
Lu Guangfu will hear it.

923
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,239
- What?
- You got drunk?

924
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,280
This is important information!

925
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,280
Just speak, we can hear you.

926
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
The person who took Lu Sheng out

927
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,960
is Pan Xiong.

928
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,800
He mentioned that,

929
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,400
right?

930
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:05,239
Just continue.

931
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,719
Uncle Xiong must be Pan Xiong.

932
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:08,559
Keep your voice down. Everyone can hear.

933
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,280
He's really bold,

934
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,360
acting in front of me,

935
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,280
but I didn't notice.

936
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,440
Pan Xiong's

937
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,360
banking on these kids

938
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,440
being too scared to report him.

939
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:18,960
Now the kids don't go back.

940
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:19,840
So I guess

941
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,599
he might act soon.

942
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:23,519
Contact and inform the criminal

943
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:24,840
investigation department.

944
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,760
We're heading over now.

945
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,400
Alright.

946
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:26,960
Understood.

947
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,199
What do you understand?

948
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,079
I'll go with you to catch Pan Xiong.

949
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,440
Listen.

950
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,599
You,

951
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,360
as an enthusiastic citizen,

952
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,519
have already done enough.

953
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,480
The rest

954
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,920
is up to the police, okay?

955
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,760
Wait!

956
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,559
Am not I

957
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,599
an appropriate adult?

958
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,119
Just let me go with you.

959
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,239
I'm also a policeman.

960
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:49,039
We are colleagues!

961
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,000
You drank, right?

962
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,440
You just drank, right?

963
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,480
You can't participate.

964
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,920
Goodbye.

965
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,679
But I drank to help
with the investigation!

966
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,519
At least walk me downstairs!

967
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:04,448
(Pan's Fish Pot Shop)

968
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:08,360
Go.

969
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,000
Practice or not?

970
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,239
Practice!

971
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,360
Fast, be fast!

972
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:42,624
(Zhen, Shu, Xing, Lu Ming,
Xiaoxiami, Xiaomei)

973
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,159
(Don't lock me in the cage.)

974
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,599
(Who locked you in a cage?)

975
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,280
(I won't get caught again.)

976
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,440
Ms. Er.

977
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,039
Here's your goods.

978
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:28,880
Where's my money?

979
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,679
Just thirty thousand yuan.

980
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,719
Don't be that serious.

981
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:39,599
Okay.

982
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,000
Well.

983
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:41,880
Uh...

984
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:43,519
This child

985
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:45,119
calls me godfather.

986
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:47,000
Find him a good family.

987
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,559
Please.

988
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:49,159
Okay.

989
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,239
You look pale.

990
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:52,760
You didn't sleep well?

991
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,199
I played mahjong all night yesterday.

992
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:59,440
Alright, go back and rest.

993
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,320
Buddy,

994
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,960
you got a steady supply?

995
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:04,440
S-Supply?

996
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:05,400
Who is this?

997
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,920
I am her boss.

998
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,239
I heard you've got many kids.

999
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,880
If your supply is stable,

1000
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,840
we can do long-term business.

1001
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,159
The price is negotiable.

1002
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,679
I can decide.

1003
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:19,840
Okay. Let's talk about it later.

1004
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
Do you still remember me?

1005
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:29,920
Yes.

1006
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,920
Get off.

1007
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,599
Officer.

1008
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,440
