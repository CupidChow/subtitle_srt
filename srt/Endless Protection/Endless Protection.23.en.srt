Defendant Wan Xuemin

00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,319
is suspected of rape

8
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,400
and molesting children.

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
The court is now in session.

10
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,840
Bailiffs, please bring Wan Xuemin
into the courtroom.

(Prosecutor, Assistant Judge)

12
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,120
This is the inquiry record
of the students

13
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,680
at the Wannian Xingchen Dance School.

14
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,520
According to this record,

15
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,080
six girls stated

16
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,840
that Defendant Wan Xuemin

17
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,479
touched their private parts

18
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,159
(Defendant)
many times

19
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
under the guise of teaching dance.

20
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,759
Wan Xuemin.

21
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,080
Chief Judge,

22
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm the head of the dance school.

23
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,039
When I teach children,

24
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,680
it's normal to touch their bodies.

25
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,520
You can't say I molested kids

26
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,199
just because of this.

27
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
In my eyes, they are all children.

28
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,520
The statements of these children

29
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,439
are considered subjective evidence.

30
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,879
Besides, they all go to school together

31
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,840
and are easily influenced by each other.

32
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,240
For example,

33
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,039
if one kid says he has a stomachache,

34
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,919
other kids will suddenly claim

35
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,960
they have stomachaches.

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,120
This kind of unconscious lying

37
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,639
is common

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,919
among children.

39
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,280
Chief Judge.

40
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,360
What these children said
is supported by objective evidence.

41
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,479
For example, Wang Meng

42
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:11,879
explicitly stated

43
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,759
on Children's Day,

44
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,039
it was in the piano classroom.

45
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,639
The police collected

46
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,879
the dance school's schedule.

47
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,879
It proves that she took a lesson alone

48
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,199
in that classroom.

49
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,839
(Inquiry Record)
Zhao Chuntian said

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,319
Wan Xuemin touched her.

51
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,680
After test,

52
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,800
half of Wan Xuemin's fingerprint
was detected

53
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,120
(Fingerprint Identification Report)
where he touched her leotard.

54
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,199
Meng Jiaxin said

55
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
that when she was on duty
for a second time,

56
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,040
it was in the equipment room.

57
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,040
(Interrogation Record)
It matches the duty schedule.

58
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,000
It all corroborates the authenticity
of the kids' words.

59
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:44,720
Defense Attorney.

60
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,480
Given the evidence presented
by the Prosecutor,

61
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,560
cross-examine Prosecutor.

62
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,399
I acknowledge the authenticity,

63
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,279
legitimacy, relevance,

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,319
and purpose

65
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,759
of the evidence.

66
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:00,480
Prosecutor, please continue
to present evidence.

67
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
During the interrogation,
the victim Wang Yuqing

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,160
stated

69
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,439
that she was raped multiple times
by Wan Xuemin

70
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,519
in the equipment room on the rooftop

71
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,839
of the dance school.

72
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,399
The victim accurately said as follows.

73
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,360
I remember that sofa.

74
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,319
(To confirm the existence of the sofa bed)
It's a blue sofa.

75
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,439
It can be unfolded into a bed.

76
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,879
It's this sofa.

77
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,240
Wait a minute.

78
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,399
In the evidence materials presented
by the prosecutor in court,

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,199
this sofa bed isn't included.

80
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,279
The police's record

81
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,079
on the second inspection shows

82
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,560
blue threads were found

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,319
on two spots
on the door of the equipment room.

84
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,079
(Evidence)
And the floor

85
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,959
had scuff marks of the bed.

86
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,439
It corroborates that the children
were telling the truth.

87
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,800
The record

88
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
of the police's first inspection also

89
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
confirms the existence of this sofa.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,879
I'd like
to remind the collegial tribunal

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,920
Wang Yuqing clearly stated as follows.

92
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,360
I remember that sofa.

93
00:05:58,839 --> 00:05:59,759
It's a blue sofa.

94
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,680
It can be unfolded into a bed.

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,519
It is evidence only knowable
from personal experience.

96
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,040
Its credibility is extremely high.

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,639
Okay.

98
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,439
I acknowledge this sofa bed.

99
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
But what does this prove?

100
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,160
Rape?

101
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,920
If you accuse the Defendant of rape,

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,759
at the very least, you should
have biological fluid evidence.

103
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,480
(Evidence)
This was provided by Wang Yuqing.

104
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,319
She wore this underwear
during the assault.

105
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,879
The appraisal conclusion shows

106
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,680
Defendant's semen

107
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,199
and the victim's bodily fluids
were detected on this underwear.

108
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,439
It fully proves

109
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,399
that the Defendant committed rape
against the victim.

110
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,399
However, the three elements
of this evidence are not recognized.

111
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,040
Even if this underwear

112
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,199
was collected legitimately
and authentically,

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
it can't lead to the conclusion

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,399
that the Defendant raped the victim

115
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:51,360
because reasonable doubt
cannot be excluded.

116
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,680
Defense Attorney.

117
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,639
Please explain your point of view.

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,839
Chief Judge.

119
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,959
The Defendant

120
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,600
has presented new evidence.

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,160
Here are 40 pairs

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,639
of underwear worn by different women.

123
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,560
Due to the tight time frame
for identification,

124
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,360
they could not be submitted

125
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,680
before the court hearing.

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,399
Why did he present those?

127
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
What does he want?

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,759
Prosecutor.

129
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,160
Do you have any objections
to the new evidence?

130
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,160
I doubt the authenticity
of this evidence.

131
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,759
The origin of this evidence
is unverifiable.

132
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,040
Assistant Prosecutor.

133
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:32,079
We're now in the phase
of presenting and examining evidence,

134
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,759
not legal arguments.

135
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,839
I won't answer

136
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,360
your questions.

137
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,759
Defense Attorney,
please explain the origin

138
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,920
of your evidence.

139
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,199
According to the examination results

140
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:53,279
(Forensic Examination Report)

141
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,319
by the forensic center,

142
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,800
six pairs of underwear
have the Defendant's bodily fluids.

143
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,519
The Defendant also admits

144
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,839
he has mental issues.

145
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,439
He collected women's underwear

146
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:06,839
for lewd purposes.

147
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,160
Therefore, the evidence presented
by the Prosecutor

148
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,120
cannot prove

149
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,160
that the Defendant

150
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,720
committed rape.

151
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,680
Prosecutor, please continue
to present evidence.

152
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,199
Chief Judge.

153
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,600
We request that the victim Wang Yuqing

154
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:26,120
make a statement via video meeting.

155
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,439
Approved.

156
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,639
Do you know about the evidence

157
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,679
that can't be known
without personal experience?

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,360
Watch your tone.

159
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,919
It seems you're doing great

160
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,039
in jail.

161
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,080
When a child is giving a statement

162
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,399
and describes some things

163
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,799
that she can't know

164
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,080
unless she experiences them,

165
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,559
in this case,

166
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:51,159
her words will be admissible.

167
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,840
I've already reviewed the dossier.

168
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,279
I can only say that the current evidence
is sufficient to prove

169
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,000
that you've committed molestation
against the child.

170
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,159
Moreover,

171
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,320
there is a strong suspicion of rape.

172
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,440
Isn't it just a suspicion?

173
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,759
I just don't believe they have evidence.

174
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,080
Then I have a question.

175
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
Did you ever not

176
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,799
clean up the mess thoroughly?

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,919
You can choose to deny it,

178
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,759
but you'll be in jail in the end.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,559
Perhaps,

180
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,840
you could show a flaw

181
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,480
to minimize your loss.

182
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,039
You're my client.

183
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,639
You have the right not to listen to me.

184
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,480
But I must also remind you

185
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,039
that a lawyer

186
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,360
has right to independent defense.

187
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,639
Yuqing, don't be nervous.

188
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,759
Please recount

189
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,639
what happened to you.

190
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,799
During the summer vacation,

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,840
Mr. Wan gave me a lesson
for the first time.

192
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,600
He praised me and asked me

193
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,600
to get a gift in the equipment room.

194
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,320
Chief Judge.

195
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,600
May I begin cross-examination?

196
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,240
Approved.

197
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,919
Wang Yuqing.

198
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,879
I have a few questions.

199
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
You just said

200
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,200
the Defendant assaulted you.

201
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,879
So, at that time,

202
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,840
you were certain
of the Defendant's identity

203
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,159
and the fact that he affronted you,

204
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:18,799
correct?

205
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:19,960
Yes.

206
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,720
But I was too scared.

207
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,399
I didn't dare to resist.

208
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,399
According to your statement,

209
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,960
it happened several more times.

210
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,200
Did you resist?

211
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:34,320
No.

212
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,120
But...

213
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,799
But he is an adult, and I'm a child.

214
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,879
I didn't dare to resist.

215
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,840
Chief Judge.

216
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,399
Wang Yuqing

217
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,639
is a girl under the age of 14.

218
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,200
- We're...
- Chief Judge.

219
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,960
I'm asking questions now.

220
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,840
Could the Prosecutor not interrupt me?

221
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:52,679
I suspect she is interfering
with the victim's statement.

222
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,159
Prosecutor.

223
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,919
Your opinion

224
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,039
can be raised during the arguments.

225
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,919
Defense Attorney, please go on.

226
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,039
Wang Yuqing.

227
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,759
How old are you?

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,759
Thirteen.

229
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,120
I was 12 when he first assaulted me.

230
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,559
You specifically emphasized

231
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,399
your age when you were assaulted.

232
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,080
You also specifically mentioned

233
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,519
that he is an adult, and you're a child.

234
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:17,279
That is to say,

235
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,200
you knew very early on

236
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,799
that if he assaults you

237
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,240
when you're under 14 years old,

238
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,039
regardless of your consent,
it's considered rape,

239
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,919
correct?

240
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,879
Yes, but...

241
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,240
When you were speaking,

242
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,320
you repeatedly used

243
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
written terms like "assault".

244
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,519
So you know the law

245
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,279
and the elements

246
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,840
that constitute rape, right?

247
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,159
I learned a little from legal manuals.

248
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,679
Who gave you the legal manuals?

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,240
And how did you know

250
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,799
the elements that constitute rape?

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,960
How did you decide
to talk about all this?

252
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,320
Did someone teach you?

253
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,519
Speak.

254
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,600
Wang Yuqing.

255
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,879
I'm the one asking you questions now.

256
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Who are you looking at?

257
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,399
Are you at the Procuratorate?

258
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,919
Is there someone beside you
teaching you something?

259
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,720
No.

260
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,519
Chief Judge.

261
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,320
The Defense Attorney
is agitating the victim

262
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,759
and leading the victim's testimony.

263
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,519
Chief Judge.

264
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,639
The victim claims to have been raped
by the Defendant

265
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,679
without a physical examination done

266
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,000
and competent evidence left.

267
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,159
So the victim's statement,

268
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,240
whether factual or not,

269
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,399
is the core of this case.

270
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,799
It is the key to conviction.

271
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,600
The Defense Attorney may continue,

272
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,559
but watch your language.

273
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,720
Yes, Chief Judge.

274
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,000
Wang Yuqing.

275
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,039
Are you certain he first assaulted you

276
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,480
during the summer vacation?

277
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,039
Yes, I am.

278
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,240
Can you

279
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,240
describe in detail

280
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,399
what the weather was like at that time?

281
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,840
What were you wearing?

282
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,279
What was he wearing?

283
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,039
What did he do to you?

284
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,679
But I must remind you,

285
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,720
if the details are not accurate,

286
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,600
it will be difficult for us to believe
you're telling the truth.

287
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,039
Well,

288
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,320
it happened the week
before I participated in a competition.

289
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,320
In July.

290
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,399
It was a sunny Friday.

291
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,240
I was wearing a regular leotard.

292
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,399
He was wearing normal clothes

293
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:30,480
and a bracelet.

294
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,320
A bracelet?

295
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,720
Of what kind?

296
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
The one he always wore,

297
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,080
sandalwood.

298
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
Is there anyone else

299
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,279
who wears the same kind?

300
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,799
No.

301
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,159
Then how do you know

302
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,960
the bracelet is made of sandalwood?

303
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,279
Who told you that?

304
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,440
I overheard it.

305
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,840
Chief Judge.

306
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,679
I have a copy

307
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,440
of weather records

308
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,200
for July 2015 in Yunhai.

309
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:57,519
One week before and after the period
mentioned by the victim,

310
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
it was raining in Yunhai.

311
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,519
I remembered it wrong.

312
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,759
It was a rainy day.

313
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,480
That room has no windows.

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,159
I forgot.

315
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,720
I went to a store,
carrying an umbrella.

316
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,399
But the day you were talking about
was sunny Friday.

317
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,919
Do you not remember?

318
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,519
Or did this thing never actually happen?

319
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,080
Let me remind you.

320
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,480
This is a court.

321
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:25,480
If you lie in court,

322
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,320
it constitutes a false accusation.

323
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,440
Were you really assaulted by him?

324
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,440
Or are you just a bad kid?

325
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,639
You did wrong,

326
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,200
but not dare to let parents know.

327
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,679
So you cast the blame

328
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:59,000
on Mr. Wan.

329
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,679
Or you have a conflict with him,

330
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
and you're exploiting it.

331
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,720
I heard he once

332
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
reprimanded you
before your parents at school.

333
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,600
Is that right?

334
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:08,440
Chief Judge.

335
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,759
The Defense Attorney
is intimidating the victim.

336
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,960
Defense Attorney, watch your language.

337
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,559
If you continue

338
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,320
to make irresponsible statements,

339
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,919
the court will revoke your right
to questioning.

340
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,879
The Prosecutor repeatedly
obstructed my normal questioning.

341
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,080
If what the victim said isn't the truth,

342
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,679
the Prosecutor should
be held responsible for it.

343
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,919
Is that normal questioning?

344
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,240
You're forcing a thirteen-year-old kid.

345
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm inquiring about the truth.

346
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,759
Defense Attorney.

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,840
The court warns you.

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,879
You may not make arbitrary comments.

349
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:42,799
Chief Judge.

350
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:45,679
I was questioning around the core issue.

351
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,159
The victim didn't call the police
immediately.

352
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,759
During the first inquiry,

353
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,480
she also refused to state her case.

354
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,840
But now she clearly stated

355
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,440
she knew the Defendant raped her.

356
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Either

357
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,639
she lied back then

358
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,679
or

359
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,440
she is lying now.

360
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:02,600
Anyway,

361
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,879
in court,

362
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,359
any instance of lying

363
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,759
is not allowed.

364
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,559
Defense Attorney.

365
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,000
The court warns you.

366
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,359
If you make arbitrary statements again,

367
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,640
the court has the right
to expel you from the courtroom.

368
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,039
Wang Yuqing.

369
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,559
Did you or did you not

370
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,319
get raped by Mr. Wan?

371
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,000
Or

372
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,759
are you holding a grudge against him

373
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,799
because he criticized you?

374
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:25,559
I...

375
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,960
I...

376
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,319
I was wrong.

377
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,400
I...

378
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:39,960
Prosecutor.

379
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,960
I remember a child named Cui Jiayi.

380
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,480
You can also call her to testify.

381
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,119
I know

382
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,440
there is no such evidence

383
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
in the document.

384
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
But even if you present it now,

385
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,599
I don't mind cross-examining it
in court.

386
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,119
Chief Judge.

387
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,079
I'm sorry.

388
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,319
I just got emotional.

389
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:13,359
I've finished

390
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,880
asking questions.

391
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
Prosecutor.

392
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
Is there any other evidence?

393
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,119
Chief Judge.

394
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,319
We have no further evidence.

(Yunhai Intermediate People's Court)

396
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,799
Just now...

397
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,599
You wanted to protect Yuqing and Jiayi

398
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:31,079
from being further hurt.

399
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:31,920
I understand.

400
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,839
Five years for indecent assault.

401
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:34,839
That's enough.

402
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,319
My client won't appeal either.

403
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,944
Nice working with you.

404
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,200
If I'm not in this uniform,

405
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
I'll kick you out.

406
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,920
Do you think I don't feel disgusted
about this case?

407
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,880
But in court,

408
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,640
someone always has to do this job.

409
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,200
This is the right granted
to the Defendant by law.

410
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,279
Go away.

411
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,440
What a pity.

412
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:58,079
You could have won.

413
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,400
But you changed.

414
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,759
Your heart softened.

00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,920
Should we go see Zhitao?

421
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,160
I'll appeal.

422
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,319
Appeal.

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,839
(People's Procuratorate of Yunhai)
Mr. Fu must be crazy.

424
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,240
Is our reason insufficient?

425
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,599
Or is the evidence not solid?

426
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,279
Why won't it work?

427
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,039
Let's directly appeal to the SPP.

428
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,000
I'll see what he can do.

429
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,880
He always makes a show of authority.

430
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,160
I'll go find him.

431
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,079
I'm going with you.

432
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,839
I'm not going to fight.

433
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,440
Don't follow me. You stay.

434
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,279
I'll talk to him.

435
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,640
Why can't my appeal application pass?

Do you think this is reasonable?

439
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Are you asking me?

440
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,920
You should ask yourself.

441
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,720
You lost the case.

442
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,000
You should reflect on yourself.

443
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,559
The court is right in the ruling.

444
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,039
The ruling is based on evidence.

445
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,440
Your evidence doesn't
exclude reasonable doubt.

446
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,640
How will you appeal?

447
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,319
I've provided the chain
of evidence, right?

448
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,400
The assault

449
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,960
is difficult to prove.

450
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
It's unknown to non-experiencers.

451
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,920
And I've already argued very clearly.

452
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,240
Check it out again.

453
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,119
I've read your information.

454
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:41,760
Aren't you unclear about appealing?

455
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,192
Did the court have procedural errors?

456
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,240
Are there unclear facts
or insufficient evidence?

457
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,880
Do you have new facts or new reasons?

458
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,440
Can the sentence be changed
in that case?

459
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,000
If you appeal,

460
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,519
it is only wasting time and resources.

461
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,480
That's pointless.

462
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,880
Get out of here.

463
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,039
Give it to me.

Dad has problems.

466
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,839
I need to talk to someone.

467
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,680
Logically speaking,

468
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,359
it's confidential.

469
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,079
But you don't understand anyway.

470
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,720
Just be my listener, okay?

471
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,279
Zhitao and I

472
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,680
are handling a big case.

473
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,680
But the bad guy

474
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,920
is too cunning.

475
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,000
His lawyer is even more cunning.

476
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,480
He certainly isn't a good man either.

477
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,000
Zhitao has been working hard on it,

478
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,960
but she still can't find a way.

479
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:32,759
I want to help her.

480
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,319
However,

481
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
I barely passed the law exam.

482
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,240
I am

483
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,920
not an expert.

484
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,559
Yes,

485
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,160
my strength

486
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,519
is dealing with kids,

487
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,440
right?

488
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,880
I understand children.

489
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,119
But,

490
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,279
the victim is a little girl.

491
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,000
As a man, I don't know

492
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,680
how to communicate with her.

493
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,799
Bai Yexing.

494
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,799
I became a prosecutor

495
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,279
because of you.

496
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:20,640
I just hope

497
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,680
I can do something.

498
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,519
So when you grow up,

499
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,119
you can live in a world
without bad people.

500
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,279
Dad.

501

Yexing.

502
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,319
Yexing, what did you just say?

503
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,319
Dad.

504
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,319
Yexing.

505
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:00,279
Dad is here.

506
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,279
Dad is here.

507
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,680
Dad is here.

508
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,799
Yexing can speak.

509
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
Dad will definitely work hard

510
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,079
and get rid of all bad people.

It's good.

514

516
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,079
Didn't I get it right?

517
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
What happened?

518
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,480
You look so unhappy.

519
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,599
It's quite difficult.

520
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,200
How hard can it be?

521
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,279
I can't figure out a way.

Lin Zhitao.

523
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,519
Just do

524
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,880
what you can do.

525
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,799
You wanted to invest in my store.

526
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,160
How much money do you have?

527
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
How much can you give me?

528
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,519
Did you not want my money?

529
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,799
Didn't you complain about me
throwing money at you?

530
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:27,839
Throw money at me,

531
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:28,599
not chopsticks.

532
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:29,200
Get lost.

533
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,440

No fights in public places.

537
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,480
You can't hit people in public places.

538
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,559
This is a public place.

539
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,519

540
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,319

541
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,559
Enyu, overtime.

542
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,359
Come out.

543
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,160

544
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,799

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,920
- Prosecutor Fu.
- Morning.

547
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,480
You came quite early.

548
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,759
You haven't eaten yet?

549
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,039
Let me help you.

550
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,880
Bag.

551
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,160
We've had the grounds for appeal.

552
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,079
Take a look.

553
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,119
Regarding opinions

554
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:14,279
on the punishment of crimes
against minors,

555
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,559
please read Article 23.

556
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,240
It states

557
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,319
that rape and molestation of minors

558
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,519
in schools and other public places,

559
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,759
regardless of whether those present
have actually seen it,

560
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,799
it's considered public rape
and molestation.

561
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,119
A crime in public places

562
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:29,599
is serious.

563
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,640
Isn't this a clear error
in the application of law?

564
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,279
Don't oversimplify this case.

565
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
An appeal is not a small thing.
It needs to be reported to the superior.

566
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:46,559
If the provincial office
deems the appeal inappropriate,

567
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,000
the appeal will be withdrawn.

568
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:49,839
In that case,

569
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,000
how will the superior

570
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,680
evaluate our work?

571
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:55,519
What will

572
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:57,960
other authorities think of us?

573
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,279
And you.

574
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,279
As one of the top ten Prosecutors
in the province...

575
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,240
I don't care.

576
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,319
I don't care about titles.

577
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,279
He must be sentenced

578
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,079
heavily.

579
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,160
I have enough evidence now.

580
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,000
I want to sentence him for rape.

581
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,240
Right, a heavy sentence.

582
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,039
Calm down.

583
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:13,000
Don't be hot-tempered.

584
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,960
Think about the consequences.

585
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,480
If you appeal,

586
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,799
aim to win.

587
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,559
Before appealing,

588
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,920
think if the superior

589
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
will back you.

590
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,519
Will the judicial authorities
support you?

591
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,680
Will they think

592
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,400
we're wasting judicial resources?

593
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,000
Forget it.

594
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,880
We'll go directly
to the Prosecutor's Committee.

595
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,160
Let them make the decision.

596
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,119
Ms. Zheng misjudged you.

597
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,480
She told us you were a good man,

598
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,559
someone to rely on.

599
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,599
That's a lie.

600
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,119
Totally.

601
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,079
Get out of here.

602
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,200
Sit down.

603
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,039
Did I allow you to leave?

604
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,160
I haven't finished speaking yet.

605
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:01,599
I also think his sentence is too light.

606
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,359
You guys

607
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,319
took so long
to think of a legal article.

608
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,039
Article 23.

609
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,039
Good.

610
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,599
I'll submit it to the court.

611
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,000
If someone stops,

612
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,519
I'll clear the obstacles.

613
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,200
They say I am a big tree.

614
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,839
I have to shelter the children
from the wind and rain.

615
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,279
Working together as a team

616
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,559
and moving forward.

617
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:26,880
What are you waiting for?

618
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,559
Prosecutor Fu, please have breakfast.

619
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,319
Quick.

620
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,039
You've said many words.

621
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,279
You mentioned you were not feeling well.

622
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,240
I'll massage for you.

623
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,880
- Come on.
- Your neck hurts?

624
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:37,640
Let me check.

625
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,720
I know breakdance.

626
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,480
I'm feeling well now.

627
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,440
I'm just hungry.

628
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,160
Without music, it's a bit awkward.

629
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,880
Then take ballroom dancing.

630
00:30:56,403 --> 00:30:58,880
(Consultation Room)

631
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,599
Miss Su.

632
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,039
Prosecutor Lin.

633
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,000
How is Yuqing?

634
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,519
She is a bit depressed.

635
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,880
She's adjusting her emotions.

636
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,720
Okay.

637
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,799
Can I

638
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,240
speak to her alone?

639
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,599
Yes, you can.

640
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,160
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

641
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,599
Yuqing.

642
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,599
I'm sorry.

643
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,240
You don't have to say sorry.

644
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
I'm sad not because
of what he said about me.

645
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,319
It's just

646
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,440
that I think

647
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,640
he should be punished
for doing bad things.

648
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,839
I didn't do my work well.

649
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,559
But this is not over.

650
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,000
I'll do it well.

651
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,119
I must also apologize.

652
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,000
I promised you to fight the bad guy,

653
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,400
but I failed.

654
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,039
We're both responsible.

655
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,000
This is for you.

656
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,640
You did nothing wrong.

657
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:24,559
Don't need to apologize.

658
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,079
When facing such things,

659
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,440
we girls always feel like

660
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,240
we've done something wrong

661
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
because we're so scared

662
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,599
about what people think of us.

663
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,240
But think about it.

664
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,640
They are nothing at all.

665
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:42,839
After gossiping,

666
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:44,000
they just do their things.

667
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,640
But you will suffer in the end.

668
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:47,920
Yuqing.

669
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,359
Don't think of others.

670
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,920
Think about yourself first.

671
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:53,160
Just ignore those who hurt you

672
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,119
and talk about you.

673
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,680
Just shout to them,

674
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,799
"Get lost."

675
00:32:59,319 --> 00:32:59,872
Get lost?

676
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:00,680
Yes.

677
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:02,720
Get lost.

678
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:03,440
Yes.

679
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,279
Get lost.

680
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:13,408
(Yang's Diner)

681
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:17,759
Here.

682
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,000
I've fixed it.

683
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,079
Thank you.

684
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:29,160
(Yuedong People's Procuratorate)

685
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,680
This is the provincial procuratorate.

686
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,720
Looks so powerful.

687
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,960
Will we report

688
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,079
to the provincial chief prosecutor?

689
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,400
No, the liaison has been assigned.

690
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,960
Just go directly to him in the office.

691
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,000
Who is it?

692
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,759
What kind of person?

693
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,359
You know him.

694
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,440
Really? Who is it?

695
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:47,640
Yuan.

696
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,079
Good for you.

697
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:52,200
You got promoted from the grassroots
to the provincial office.

698
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:52,920
Congrats.

699
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,720
Thank you.

700
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,039
Address me by position at work.

701
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,839
I was transferred.

702
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,359
Have Wan Xuemin's case files
been transferred?

703
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,400
I've read them.

704
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,640
This case

705
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,960
is a juvenile case lacking

706
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,799
objective evidence

707
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,599
and direct evidence.

708
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,119
The Defendant didn't plead guilty.

709
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,480
No need to repeat what you said
in the appeal.

710
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,480
I handled many cases a year

711
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,920
at the grassroots level.

712
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,400
When I

713
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,400
got your appeal,

714
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,639
I knew your purpose.

715
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,840
You just want to use Article 23

716
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,119
to reverse the conviction.

717
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,039
It's not a problem
to sentence more years.

718
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,440
If you convict him of rape

719
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,280
for the life sentence,

720
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,679
I'll tell you right now

721
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,880
it's impossible without new evidence.

722
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,599
It's not like that.

723
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,800
The first trial found
that the facts are unclear.

724
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,679
But in fact,

725
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,400
we have a complete chain of evidence.

726
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,159
The forensic center has

727
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,599
taken the victim's underwear back

728
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,679
to re-examine it

729
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
another way.

730
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,559
We'll have news soon.

731
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,000
It means no news for now.

732
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,440
The victim's statement

733
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,519
was not accepted in the first trial

734
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,679
because Li Daoran

735
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,159
forced the victim to collapse.

736
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,320
Coercion made the victim
change the statement.

737
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,079
Why did you allow the victim
to speak in court?

738
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,000
- Yuan Jiaxin.
- Didn't you think of it?

739
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,119
Okay, I'll be there soon.

740
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,400
I need to see someone.

741
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,039
Suit yourselves.

742
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,840
I have to say something.

743
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,960
Once the case is transferred,
it's my case.

744
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Please respect the legal procedure.

745
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,400
Without consent,

746
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:29,280
do not intervene.

747
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:30,624
Okay?

748
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,159
I'll go down.

749
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,920
What's that attitude?

750
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,440
Who hasn't worked at a provincial level?

751
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,039
Keep your voice down.

752
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,079
Stop drinking.

753
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,559
He also has bad tea here.

754
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,800
I'm here to review files.

755
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:51,760
I called you

756
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,840
to see if you're here.

757
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,519
I see why he just had that attitude.

758
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,000
They're birds of a feather.

759
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:00,039
Why can he call him Yuan, but we can't?

760
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:01,320
It's official favoritism.

761
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,960
Take a picture.

762
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,480
It's evidence

763
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,039
- to report him.
- Go.

764
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,599
Why isn't it moving?

765
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,360
What's going on?

766
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,079
(Rule of Law Society,
Building Justice Together)

767
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,920
This way.

768
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,480
Hey.

769
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,119
Li Daoran.

770
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,559
You used to be a prosecutor.

771
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,480
How could you meet
a prosecutor privately?

772
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,360
What do you want?

773
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,159
Privately?

774
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,880
In your view,

775
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,599
this isn't a public place?

776
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,840
He came to review the files.

777
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,519
It's reasonable and legal.

778
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,079
Let's go.

779
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,039
Yuan, let's talk.

780
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:45,599
Wait a moment.

781
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,199
The sixth floor?

782
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,679
Go where you like.

783
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,239
You go up first.

784
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,400
Let's have a meal

785
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,320
after it's over.

786
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,000
We talk later.

787
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,760
I'll see you later.

788
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,119
- What's wrong?
- Yuan.

789
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,360
In the case of Wan Xuemin,

790
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,920
he's used every dirty trick.

791
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,696
Shouldn't you avoid suspicion?

792
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:07,320
Why should I?

793
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:11,199
Lawyers are part of the legal system.

794
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,840
Different people do different work.

795
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,760
Why are you two so hostile to him?

796
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,719
Don't you know
what kind of person he is?

797
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:21,280
People have desires.

798
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,159
Many people

799
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,159
use the prosecutor's position
as a stepping stone.

800
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
I've also seen many bad prosecutors.

801
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,320
But he's a law-abiding citizen for now.

802
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,880
I have to treat him with respect.

803
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,639
I hope when handling the case,

804
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,519
you can be fair

805
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:33,639
and objective.

806
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,599
Lin Zhitao.

807
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,400
Not everyone has to do things

808
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,360
in your way.

809
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,639
I'll say it again.

810
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,159
This is my case.

811
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,599
Should I walk you out?

812
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,719
We know the way.

813
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:53,360
No spectators allowed?

814
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:56,360
There must be something fishy.

815
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
If he bends the law for personal gain,

816
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,920
I will submit this photo.

817
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,320
I'll report him.

818
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,360
Cheng Wei.

819
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:04,480
Come with me

820
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,400
and lift the drum.

821
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,560
I'll petition for justice.

822
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:07,712
Okay.

823
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,119
It's a minor case.

824
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:12,519
It's standard procedure not
to allow participation in court.

825
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:15,280
It's unacceptable.

826
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,679
(Supervision Hotline, SPP Hotline)
12309 is the phone number.

827
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,800
Inspector's number.

828
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,719
SPP's reporting hotline.

829
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:20,960
I'll call them one by one.

830
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,639
I'll teach him a lesson.

831
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,800
This is the Yuedong High People's Court.

832
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,168
The court is now in session.

833
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,280
Summon the Defendant.

834
00:38:32,948 --> 00:38:35,648
(Defendant)

835
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:36,760
(Chief Judge)

836
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,199
Prosecutor, give your statement.

837
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,119
(Prosecutor)
The first trial found

838
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,360
that Defendant Wan Xuemin

839
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,519
committed obscene acts

840
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,239
against multiple girls

841
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:46,519
respectively

842
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:48,559
at the classroom,

843
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,679
the equipment room,

844
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,639
the office, and other places.

845
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,960
The crime in a public place

846
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,119
is very serious.

847
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,719
He should be sentenced
to more than 5 years in jail.

848
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,440
The first trial didn't consider this,

849
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,519
which constitutes
a legal application error.

850
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,039
Chief Judge.

851
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,360
I've carefully

852
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,519
verified the statements
of the victims collected

853
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,039
by the police.

854
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,440
(Defense Attorney)
I'd like to remind you

855
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,480
that among all the victims,

856
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,760
not a single child said

857
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,840
they were molested

858
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,519
in a public place.

859
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,039
Whether the scene is a public place

860
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:24,480
and whether it happened in public

861
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,159
requires a comprehensive assessment.

862
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,719
The school enrolls students
throughout the year.

863
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,239
(Evidence)
The classroom,

864
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,559
the equipment room,

865
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,599
and the office are open to parents

866
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,119
all day long.

867
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
At the time of the crime,

868
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,719
there were other teachers and students

869
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,559
engaging in training and activities.

870
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:43,199
Objection.

871
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,199
There were others present.

872
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:48,159
Is that considered a public act?

873
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,199
So which teacher,

874
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,400
parent, or student

875
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,719
saw Wan Xuemin molest children?

876
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,039
Or which page

877
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:56,960
in the evidence file in front of you

878
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,840
shows the truth?

879
00:39:59,119 --> 00:39:59,880
Unfortunately,

880
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,840
the Defense Attorney
lacks a correct understanding

881
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,239
of the legal provisions.

882
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,920
(Official Regulations)
Due to the need for minor protection,

883
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
the Supreme Court, the SPP,

884
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,440
the Public Security Bureau,
and the Ministry of Justice

885
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,800
clearly stipulated
that committing rape or molesting minors

886
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,039
in schools, swimming pools,

887
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,000
children's playgrounds,
and other public places

888
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,440
should be considered

889
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:23,960
acts of crime committed

890
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,400
in public.

891
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,679
A public place is a space

892
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,000
with public accessibility,

893
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,199
where people can freely enter or exit,

894
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,159
and stay.

895
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,880
That is to say,

896
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,000
to meet the criteria
for the aggravation,

897
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:39,039
two conditions must be met.

898
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,039
- First...
- You're right.

899
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,039
Public places have public accessibility.

900
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,920
So people can enter or exit.

901
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,679
But does it mean
the crime was seen by others?

902
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,000
In this case,

903
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,880
is there anyone who witnessed

904
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,760
Wan Xuemin

905
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:55,679
engage in indecent acts?

906
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,920
Defense Attorney. Do not speak
without the court's permission.

907
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:02,119
We're doing cross-examination.

908
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,519
If you have any objections,
wait your turn to speak.

909
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,119
Prosecutor, please continue.

910
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,840
As the Defense Attorney has said,

911
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,199
it's crucial to find out
if Wan Xuemin publicly committed crimes

912
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,239
or not.

913
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,440
In this case, Wan Xuemin

914
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,960
molested Wang Yuqing

915
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,039
and other victims in a dance class

916
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:21,000
during office hours.

917
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,000
At the same venue, teachers and students

918
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:26,079
were numerous.

919
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:29,320
Wan Xuemin's crime could
be discovered at any time.

920
00:41:29,559 --> 00:41:30,960
According to the law,

921
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,920
regardless of whether people present
actually witnessed it,

922
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,039
it can be proved

923
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:40,960
as committing a crime in public.

924
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Defense Attorney. The prosecutor
has answered your question.

925
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,519
The court noticed

926
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,440
this piece of evidence was mentioned
in Wang Yuqing's first statement.

927
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,679
Do you agree?

928
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,880
Yes.

929
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,239
However, it still

930
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:58,360
does not constitute the crime of rape

931
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,880
because there was

932
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,000
no direct evidence to confirm

933
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,239
that the Defendant had committed rape.

934
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,639
I request
to present another piece of evidence

935
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,119
issued by the forensic center

936
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,920
of the People's Procuratorate of Yunhai.

937
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,000
(Evidence)
The opinion on Wang Yuqing's underwear.

938
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,920
This evidence has been presented
in the first trial,

939
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:24,119
and it was

940
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,920
inadmissible.

941
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:26,960
Defense Attorney.

942
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,800
Listen carefully.

943
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,840
I just

944
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,360
got this paper today.

945
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,199
It's an evaluation opinion issued

946
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,800
by the forensic center
of the People's Procuratorate of Yunhai.

947
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:38,920
It says

948
00:42:39,639 --> 00:42:42,519
the sperm stains
and female body fluids on the underwear

949
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,039
are in a mixed state.

950
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,320
Chief Judge.

951
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,119
I request Lu Wenzhao,
a DNA analysis expert,

952
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,719
and former director

953
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:55,159
of the forensic center
at People's Procuratorate of Yunhai,

954
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,800
to testify in court.

955
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,320
(Witness)
A superimposed state is created

956
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,079
when a liquid dries
and then is overlaid by another liquid.

957
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:05,119
A mixed state

958
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:07,639
involves two liquids being mixed first

959
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:09,719
and then attached

960
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:10,599
to another substance.

961
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:11,719
Simply put,

962
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,440
the production of these two states

963
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,519
is related to the timing

964
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:17,760
and sequence
of mixing different liquids.

965
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,639
As the Defense Attorney said,

966
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,840
the Defendant
collected women's underwear

967
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:27,320
for his masturbation.

968
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,119
Due to the timing,

969
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,639
this should be a superimposed state.

970
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,639
But according to our examination,

971
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:35,159
this is a mixed state,

972
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,519
because on the underwear,

973
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,000
the two liquids were left
simultaneously.

974
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,039
It proves

975
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,480
that the Defendant raped young girls,

976
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,039
which is an indisputable fact.

977
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:49,280
According to this examination opinion,

978
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,840
it can directly prove

979
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:53,400
that Defendant

980
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:54,679
Wan Xuemin

981
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,280
had sexual relations with a girl

982
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,360
under 14 years old,

983
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:00,199
which should be classified as rape,

984
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,119
not a personal hobby as the Defendant

985
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,400
and Defense Attorney argued.

986
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,360
Therefore, we argue

987
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,000
the original judgment is unclear,

988
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,000
and application of the law is wrong.

989
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,800
It is suggested to reopen this case.

990
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,679
Chief Judge.

991
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,280
It's evidence without prior notice.

992
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:19,320
Defense Attorney.

993
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,679
Do you have any objections
to this new evidence?

994
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:22,840
Yes.

995
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,480
Prosecutor, give your reasons.

996
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,119
Indeed,

997
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:28,159
this evidence

998
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:30,360
is not submitted to the court
before the trial.

999
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:33,599
But this paper is based on the evidence

1000
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:35,599
proactively submitted

1001
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,920
by the victim before the first trial.

1002
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,000
The evidence collection is legal.

1003
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,880
The Prosecutor of the first trial
quickly conducted an identification.

1004
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:46,800
Due to the procedure issue,

1005
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,440
it was submitted in court.

1006
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,840
So, Defense Attorney,

1007
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:55,079
do you suspect the authenticity
of this evidence?

1008
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,760
Defense Attorney, you have right
to request adjournment.

1009
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,800
But I remind you,

1010
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,599
the examination opinion is legal.

1011
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,960
Are you applying?

1012
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:03,920
Li Daoran.

1013
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,679
Be quiet.

1014
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,519
All rise.

1015
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,320
The judgment:

1016
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:16,719
After the trial, the facts

1017
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,800
of the original judgment were unclear.

1018
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,320
The law was applied incorrectly.

1019
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,159
This court hereby rules as follows:

1020
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:25,119
The original judgment is revoked,

1021
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,680
and the case is sent back
to the original court for retrial.

1022
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:41,360
Warmly celebrate our successful appeal.

1023
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,519
This case is officially transferred
back to the juvenile prosecution.

1024
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,119
What is that?

1025
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:49,639
Let's celebrate. Let me see.

1026
00:45:49,639 --> 00:45:51,480
My daughter has been loving this.

1027
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,920
Do your work, okay?

1028
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,119
I bought a lot of it.

1029
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:54,880
Come on.

1030
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:57,376
- Stop it.
- Yuan Jiaxin

1031
00:45:57,536 --> 00:45:58,880
has some skills, right?

1032
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,119
He doesn't look like a good man,

1033
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,079
but he's a doer.

1034
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,039
Mr. Yuan.

1035
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,960
- Mr. Yuan.
- Great prosecutor.

1036
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,119
He's the savior of minors.

1037
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,480
I salute you.

1038
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:12,840
I'll get you a cup of tea.

1039
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,679
How come it doesn't work?

1040
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,719
12309 Inspectorate Report Hotline.

1041
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:20,920
What's that?

1042
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,719
Just in case.

1043
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,039
- Water.
- Thank you.

1044
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:26,079
Would you like to sit?

1045
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:26,920
No need.

1046
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:28,639
Well,

1047
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,960
I take back what I said to you before.

1048
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,320
You were right about Li Daoran.
No need to take it back.

1049
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,199
It's no loss if someone like him leaves.

1050
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,199
Making room

1051
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:41,800
for prosecutors

1052
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,639
with ideals

1053
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,239
and ambitions.

1054
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,519
Good prosecutors like you.

1055
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:48,840
I feel flattered.

1056
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,039
That's the truth.

1057
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,119
Or someone like him.

1058
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,440
Listen to him.

1059
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:00,519
I thought about it.

1060
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,199
I think Wan Xuemin

1061
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,239
hired Li Daoran to defend him.

1062
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,840
It must have cost him a lot.

1063
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,800
Li Daoran won't take it
without good pay.

1064
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,719
So I deduce

1065
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:10,519
Wan Xuemin must have hidden something.

1066
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:11,679
In other words,

1067
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,119
the victims may not only be Jiayi
and Yuqing.

1068
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:16,440
The retrial

1069
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,079
will buy you some time.

1070
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,800
So work hard on the investigation.

1071
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,079
No problem.

1072
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:24,880
The provincial procuratorate
attaches great importance to this case.

1073
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,840
He has a message for you.

1074
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,560
You have the prosecutor's emblem on your chest,
and the national emblem on your back.

1075
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,639
Just do it.

1076
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,480
Got it.

1077
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:49,159
So where will the river go

1078
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,079
in the end?

1079
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:54,119
The river will eventually flow

1080
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,960
into the sea.

1081
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:03,679
I also want to flow into the sea.

1082
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,559
Who is she?

1083
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,159
What do you think?

1084
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:34,320
What's with her?

1085
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,119
She fainted.

1086
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,440
You made her faint.

1087
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,639
Sure.

1088
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,360
Isn't this convenient for you?

1089
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:42,960
If you hadn't taken me

1090
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,719
out of Fujiang Bay,

1091
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:48,880
