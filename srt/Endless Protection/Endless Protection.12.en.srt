1
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,800
We didn't do anything wrong.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,039
Why can't we text each other?

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:17,320
Shut up!

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,480
You're just like your dad.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,199
Yeah.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,640
Go bother him

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,399
about his problems.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,960
Where are you going?

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,159
Xia Qiu is in trouble.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,840
Go back to study.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,079
We can't let anyone pull you back.

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,880
Pull me back?

13
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,359
No one is pulling me back.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,359
It's just a lie

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,759
you made up.

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,159
Xia Qiu is my classmate.

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,039
That's all.

18
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,320
When the others looked down on me

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,799
and called me sissy,

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,320
she studied with me every day.

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,200
She wasn't pestering me.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,719
She was protecting me.

23
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,760
What about you?

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,640
You only told me not to care.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,680
What you want is not a son,

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,719
but a puppet under your control.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
What? Xia Qiu is kidnapped?

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,400
No rush. Tell me everything.

29
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,799
Yeah, Ms. Lin.

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Tian Jun had photos of her.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
So Xia Qiu went to see him alone.

32
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,400
I received some photos

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,920
from the dam, I think.

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,599
Take a look.

35
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:11,045
=Endless Protection=

36
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:14,469
=Episode 12=

37
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,479
I just wanted to teach Tian Jun a lesson

38
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,039
to avenge those victims.

39
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,159
You didn't see how bossy his dad was.

40
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,199
My goodness.

41
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,319
I was just trying

42
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,719
to make it a win-win.

43
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,319
Stop talking nonsense.

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,919
You put a girl

45
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,280
to face the confrontation

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,439
against the rules just to look smart.

47
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,439
I just wanted to...

48
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:38,639
I didn't...

49
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,400
Forget it. Stop the car.
I'll look for her.

50
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,960
Where are you

51
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
going to look for her?

52
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,000
You think

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
you're so capable?

54
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm telling you, Bai Enyu.

55
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,400
If anything happens to Xia Qiu,

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,639
you are directly responsible.

57
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,360
Call the police.

58
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,400
Hello, Yunhai Emergency Center.

59
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,439
(Warning)
Xia Qiu.

60
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,879
Xia Qiu.

61
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Xia Qiu.

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,439
You woke up?

63
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,480
Look here.

64
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,279
Say hello

65
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,160
to the camera.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,408
Tian Jun.

67
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,639
Do you know what you're doing?

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Am I crazy?

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,360
Why would I let you go?

70
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,800
You think I'm so obedient?

71
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,120
We have only one job today.

72
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,759
Take photos.

73
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,439
More photos of you.

74
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,800
Tian Jun, let me go.

75
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,920
Put my clothes back on, okay?

76
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,160
Put my clothes back on.

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,360
Stop taking photos.

78
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,160
Keep it down.

79
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,120
There is

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,759
no one nearby.

81
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,879
Tian Jun, stop it.

82
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,040
Let's make it more exciting.

83
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,800
(Let me go!)

84
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,040
(Let go.)

85
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,279
(Don't.)

86
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
(Help.)

87
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,120
(Stop.)

88
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,959
(Help.)

89
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,319
I'm going to take photos of you
from every angle.

90
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:13,279
Officer, you found Xia Qiu?

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,720
She's there.

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
She called the police.

93
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,360
Otherwise, there would be huge trouble.

94
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,360
Hello, we are from

95
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,600
(Lin Zhitao)
the Yunhai Procuratorate.

96
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,079
You are...

97
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,560
You two are from the procuratorate?

98
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,079
Is that how you

99
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,600
protect the minors?

100
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:38,016
(Statement by Ma Wenwen)

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
Officer, could you please
tell us the details?

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,920
This girl's classmate

103
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,240
locked her up in the warehouse

104
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,439
and tried to take private photos of her.

105
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,040
Thankfully, that lady showed up.

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,360
Hei.

107
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,959
Thankfully, you came.

108
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,920
Or they'd take over this place again.

109
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,959
Didn't we agree

110
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,240
to stay on different sides?

111
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,519
Whenever you're not here,

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
they try to drive us away.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
They also took all those barrels

114
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,160
and tires we found.

115
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,120
Why?

116
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,680
We found

117
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,920
this place first.

118
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,199
Why are they claiming it?

119
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,839
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

120
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,680
Ask them out.

121
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,759
Tomorrow.

122
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,560
We'll take back our turf.

123
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,759
Show no mercy.

124
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,759
We'll talk first.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,720
If it fails,

126
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,480
show them what we've got.

127
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,199
Bro, I think it's Wen.

128
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,120
Hello, Wen.

129
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
- Wen.
- Hello, Wen.

130
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,639
Wen.

131
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,480
Hello, Wen.

132
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,240
- What's up?
- Hello, Wen.

133
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,040
It's so late. Why are you all here?

134
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,720
It's nothing.

135
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,959
We're riding a bit.

136
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,839
Oh yeah?

137
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,079
Don't pick fights. Do you hear me?

138
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,680
- We heard you.
- Yes.

139
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,040
We're buddies.

140
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,120
We won't fight.

141
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,639
Don't go home too late.

142
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,600
It's so late.

143
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,800
Let me know if anything happens, okay?

144
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,720
Alright, I'll have them go back now.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,759
Okay, I'll trust you guys.

146
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,839
I'm off.

147
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,680
Bye-bye.

148
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,399
- Bye-bye, Wen.
- Bye-bye, Wen.

149
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,000
Bye-bye, Wen.

150
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,920
Bye-bye.

151
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,480
Joining forces with the procuratorate

152
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,159
to combine sex education

153
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,559
and legal education

154
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,440
is a further improvement.

155
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,240
Our Communist Youth League
fully supports it.

156
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

157
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,600
It's just that

158
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,279
the idea of having boys and girls

159
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,279
listen to the lecture together

160
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,759
is too advanced

161
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,919
to be implemented smoothly.

162
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Listen.

163
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
He made the second proposal.

164
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
His ideas on this

165
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,720
are a bit more advanced than mine.

166
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,080
Tell Ms. Chen about it.

167
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,120
Me?

168
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,320
I don't know if I'm right.

169
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,200
I think the previous lectures

170
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,440
were quite vague.

171
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,799
The kids would be bored.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,720
The lecturer
was more embarrassed than the listeners.

173
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,279
If the adults are afraid
to talk about sex,

174
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,919
doesn't that further incite

175
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,480
the curiosity of those kids?

176
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,519
- Right?
- Yeah.

177
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,759
So this time, we want to

178
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,000
have a conversation with the kids

179
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
as if they're almost adults.

180
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,919
I see.

181
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,279
Director, what's up?

182
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,600
So you thought I was a troublemaker.

183
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
What a contrast.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,679
Thank you for what you did.

185
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,679
Thank you.

186
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,240
As long as that girl is fine.

187
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,840
But you brought up a great idea today.

188
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,720
I also think

189
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,639
those kids know everything.

190
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,216
This is the fig leaf
and the emperor's new clothes

191
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,639
for the adults.

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,360
Totally unnecessary.

193
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,279
That's right.

194
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,799
Our job as social workers

195
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,080
is not as superficial

196
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,559
as people imagine.

197
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,600
For example,

198
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
when I saved that girl,

199
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,080
I was carrying out
a late-night outreach.

200
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,279
What is that?

201
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,200
Basically, I dress up like they do

202
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,120
and go where they love to go,

203
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,679
making friends with them

204
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,519
utilizing my street smarts.

205
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,960
I see.

206
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,200
Infiltrate them.

207
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,320
Identify the risks.

208
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Yeah, that's the idea.

209
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,639
Got it.

210
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,440
Here's my car.

211
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,799
Rampage racer.

212
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,360
Your car is so flashy.

213
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,279
Come on.

214
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,480
Full of my equipment.

215
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,879
These are all yours?

216
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Don't touch it. You'll break it.

217
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,039
I'm going to break this ball?

218
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,000
Bai Enyu.

219
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,720
Why are you so harsh on yourselves?

220
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,279
Actually, that girl told me

221
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,759
she didn't blame him.

222
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,919
But we must reflect on ourselves

223
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,039
as reasonable adults, right?

224
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,279
Yeah, of course.

225
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,399
Bai has deeply reflected

226
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,279
on himself.

227
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,159
Yeah.

228
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,679
Very deeply.

229
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,360
Yeah.

230
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,720
Hello, kids.

231
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,519
My name is Ma Wenwen.

232
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,440
Those who have

233
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,799
a rich extracurricular life

234
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:22,679
might know me.

235
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,159
You can say I'm your old friend.

236
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:30,879
Thank you.

237
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,879
Today, I'm here

238
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,879
to share with you

239
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,440
my personal experience.

240
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
At my coming-of-age ceremony,

241
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,080
my father gave me

242
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,279
a very, very special gift.

243
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,960
Can you guess what it is?

244
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
It's a bit hard to guess.

245
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,120
Here's the answer.

246
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,559
C-o-n-d-o-m.

247
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,519
Condom.

248
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,799
For real?

249
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,240
Why are you so surprised?

250
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,720
It's such an ordinary item, kids.

251
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:10,480
Available at all major pharmacies
and supermarkets.

252
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,360
In addition to pregnancy,
it also prevents the cross-transmission

253
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,440
of sexually transmitted diseases.

254
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,279
So, it's a very good

255
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,080
protective measure

256
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,720
for both boys and girls.

257
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,279
So, I bet you have an idea

258
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,480
about the topic
we're going to discuss today.

259
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
Today, I'd like to talk to you about

260
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,360
sex.

261
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,879
- Sex.
- Can you believe it?

262
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:48,160
(Work hard for a hundred days
to have good grades in the exam)

263
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,240
We humans are born equal,

264
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,360
but we are also unique
in terms of everything,

265
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,279
including gender.

266
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,159
The opposite sex is not
a mystery or an enemy,

267
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,639
and certainly not
a tool to ease your desire.

268
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,639
I hope that you can

269
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,240
learn to respect others

270
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,320
and protect yourselves

271
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,240
and others.

272
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,799
I hope you can bravely

273
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,879
say no to assaults

274
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:22,360
and try to be your own hero.

275
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:29,720
So that's all

276
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,679
for the lecture today.

277
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,240
Alright, dismissed.

278
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,200
Xia Qiu.

279
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,639
What's wrong, Mr. Bai?

280
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,879
Letter of repentance.

281
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,480
Xia Qiu,

282
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,799
my recklessness...

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,639
Come on, read it on stage.

284
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,639
You're so nosy.

285
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,720
Mind your own business.

286
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,720
I'll start over.

287
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,600
Xia Qiu,

288
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,840
my recklessness and willful behavior

289
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,360
put you through things
you shouldn't have been through.

290
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,279
I'm deeply pained

291
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
and I deeply regret my actions.

292
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
I sincerely apologize.

293
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,159
I'm sorry.

294
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,679
By Bai Enyu.

295
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,519
I sincerely apologize to you.

296
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,000
If you don't forgive me,

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,279
(Xia Qiu)
I can write another 5,000-word letter.

298
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,360
I-It's not a problem.

299
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,960
What was that?

300
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,200
I signed.

301
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,519
I forgive you.

302
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,440
Let's go.

303
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,919
He's quite sincere.

304
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,399
Actually, he is

305
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,799
quite good with kids.

306
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,480
He knows what they are thinking.

307
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:02,919
That's good.

308
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:04,352
Well...

309
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,480
Next time you do a late-night outreach,

310
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,639
can you take us along?

311
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:09,399
You're interested?

312
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,120
Preventing juvenile delinquency

313
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
is also

314
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,399
an important part of our work.

315
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,919
You're concerned about them.

316
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,320
Good, I support you.

317
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,879
You should reach out to the kids

318
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,879
and blend in with them.

319
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:24,919
Or you won't know

320
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,039
what they are thinking.

321
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,519
Tag along next time.

322
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:28,480
Okay, thanks.

323
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,240
No problem.

324
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,080
Wait.

325
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:32,399
What happened to Tian Jun?

326
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,320
Prosecutor Yuan

327
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,440
has prosecuted him

328
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,480
with illegal detention.

329
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,919
He will pay the price.

330
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,360
Hello, Captain Du.

331
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,879
Prosecutor Lin, you're right.

332
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,399
Someone instigated Chen Huiwen
to commit suicide.

333
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,519
And you know that person.

334
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,399
You really don't need me there?

335
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,559
No.

336
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,240
I can handle my own matters.

337
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,559
How is that woman doing?

338
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,360
Wenxuan's mom

339
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,960
and I sometimes text each other

340
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,480
to say hi.

341
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,600
We'll leave the rest to time.

342
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,080
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

343
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,159
Get over it.

344
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,679
Let me bear my responsibilities

345
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,639
from now on.

346
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,799
Okay?

347
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,639
Prosecutor Zheng told me.

348
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
You took on

349
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,279
all the responsibility regarding this.

350
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,919
Thank you.

351
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,559
No problem.

352
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,159
Aren't we in the same department?

353
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,399
Once you start
handling cases independently,

354
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,240
bear all the responsibilities.

355
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,159
I'll stay out of it.

356
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,720
I hope so.

357
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,240
Actually, I know my problem.

358
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,679
I always tend to "jump over"

359
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,000
procedural justice.

360
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
Go hurdle jumping

361
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,440
if you like doing it.

362
00:16:58,039 --> 00:16:59,519
All those who study law know

363
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,919
the fruit of the poisonous trees.

364
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,360
It means

365
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,160
if you obtain evidence through

366
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
improper means,

367
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,359
even if it eventually turns the tide,

368
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,640
it's toxic.

369
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,240
You can't pursue true justice like this.

370
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,640
I know sometimes I am a bit rigid.

371
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,799
But if one day, someone finds fault

372
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,559
with

373
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,559
your evidence-gathering procedure,

374
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
all your efforts will come to nothing.

375
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,559
This is what upsets me the most.

376
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,640
The bad guy is right there.

377
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,400
The fact is so clear.

378
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,480
But to convict him,

379
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,680
it requires so much effort,

380
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,160
so many documents,

381
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,440
so much persuasion,

382
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,400
and so much evidence.

383
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,720
It's too difficult.

384
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,039
Remember the day
when Xiaohua and Xiaohu's case

385
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,279
reached a verdict?

386
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,000
Tell me

387
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,960
how you felt.

388
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,480
Satisfied.

389
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,359
But also very sad.

390
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,400
Just remember that feeling.

391
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,119
You remember her?

392
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,319
Is her guardian here?

393
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,599
Forget it.

394
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We didn't ask her to come.

395
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,920
We just made a phone call

396
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,240
to confirm some facts.

397
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,759
She came on her own

398
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,079
and confessed.

399
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,000
I checked her ID card.

400
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,359
She's under 14.

401
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:39,240
I wonder what these kids

402
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,119
are thinking.

403
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,160
You may leave.

404
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,640
A kind reminder.

405
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I can't see through this child.

406
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,039
But I can be sure of one thing.

407
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,160
She's after you.

408
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,000
Captain Du.

409
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,160
Here.

410
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,440
I'm from the Yunhai Procuratorate.

411
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,279
I'm Lin Zhitao.

412
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,599
We need to wait

413
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:16,000
until your family arrives...

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,559
Don't you know where my family is?

415
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,759
We need to wait

416
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,359
until your guardian arrives

417
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,440
to learn about

418
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,359
Chen Huiwen's suicide from you.

419
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:29,000
No need.

420
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,319
Ask away if you want.

421
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,839
- Call him again.
- Okay.

422
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:36,359
I made Chen Huiwen do it.

423
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,079
I kept her company

424
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,039
as if I was Zhang Wenxuan's shadow.

425
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,519
I posted those things on Weibo.

426
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,240
I taught her how to make a fuss,

427
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:48,640
including the jump.

428
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,319
I will avenge you.

429
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,119
I'm Zhang Wenxuan's classmate.

430
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,799
Tong.

431
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,319
Actually, I don't understand

432
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,359
why you hate Lin Zhitao so much.

433
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:25,440
It was Lin Zhitao
who caused my family's ruin.

434
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,240
Then

435
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
what should we do next?

436
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,359
We have already done our best.

437
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,319
That's the way it is.

438
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,720
Did you try your best?

439
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,279
Did you try your best?

440
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:36,839
You liar!

441
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,319
- What are you doing?
- Liar.

442
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,279
It's all your fault.

443
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,039
You are guilty. Do you know that?

444
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:50,759
You hold power over others' destinies.

445
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,519
You spare sinners

446
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,319
and harm victims.

447
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,559
You are a murderer.

448
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,559
Calm down.

449
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,440
Ning Kaitong.

450
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,920
I've explained

451
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,400
everything to you
about your mother's case.

452
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,200
My mom was innocent.

453
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,559
She just didn't want my dad
to suffer anymore.

454
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,799
She didn't kill anyone.

455
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:13,039
(Yunhai Intermediate People's Court)
(Trade Union Committee)

456
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,559
Where's Mom?

457
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,440
Why isn't she out?

458
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,480
Where did she go?

459
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,920
You don't need to know.

460
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:18,599
Lawyer, please tell me.

461
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:19,400
Where is my mom?

462
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,039
When back?

463
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,960
Stop making a scene, okay?

464
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,400
Miss.

465
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,920
Tell me. Where is my mom?

466
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Why the arrest?

467
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,279
She did nothing wrong.

468
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,160
Go home. Take care of her.

469
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,839
I'm not going home.

470
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,160
I'll wait for my mom.

471
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,680
Be good.

472
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,480
No!

473
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,440
Stop it.

474
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,119
I'll wait for my mom.

475
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,000
Be good.

476
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,160
Tong.

477
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,799
Crime committed.

478
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,319
How can she go home?

479
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,759
Tong.

480
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,359
Tong.

481
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,160
Everything was

482
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:28,880
legal and compliant from filing
to sentencing recommendation

483
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,759
and verdict

484
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,119
regarding your mom's case.

485
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,359
You just keep saying
it's "legal and compliant".

486
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,799
What else can you say?

487
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,799
Does legal mean it's right?

488
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,960
Do you know how much she was suffering?

489
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,319
Why did you arrest her?

490
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,160
Ning Kaitong.

491
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,200
Tell us.

492
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,799
What is right and what is wrong?

493
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,720
Listen to us.

494
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:53,039
Stop going to Chen Huiwen.

495
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,440
Scared of trouble?

496
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,839
Scared she'll kill herself?

497
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,079
Or scared of losing your future?

498
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,079
Leave the innocent ones out of it, okay?

499
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,680
My mom has been in prison for a year.

500
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,119
Her hair has turned gray.

501
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:08,720
And I?

502
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:11,519
I became homeless.

503
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,039
I have nothing left.

504
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,799
Yeah, you did your job.

505
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,839
But you ruined me.

506
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,839
What do you mean "we ruined you", kid?

507
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,880
If your uncle had written

508
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,240
a letter of understanding
for your mom, I...

509
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,519
Procedure is unlawful.

510
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,319
Rain check.

511
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,880
Prosecutor Lin, I just don't get it.

512
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,559
Why can't you

513
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,160
just tell her the truth?

514
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,359
How long are you
going to be the scapegoat?

515
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:52,960
I promised her mom.

516
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:54,119
Captain Du.

517
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,759
This is Ning Kaitong's guardian,
Ning Guochang.

518
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,359
Our Captain Du.

519
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,599
I've heard a lot about you.

520
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:01,599
Save it.

521
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,079
Why didn't you answer the call?

522
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,480
Want us to pay you a visit?

523
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,279
How could I dare?

524
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,559
I was really busy.

525
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,200
Busy?

526
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,079
What's more important, work or the kid?

527
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,640
The kid. The kid is important.

528
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,160
It won't happen again.

529
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,000
Remember her?

530
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,200
This is Prosecutor Lin Zhitao
from the procuratorate.

531
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,079
Prosecutor Lin.

532
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
Sorry for causing you trouble.

533
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,319
Did she stop going to school?

534
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,720
She's skipping classes. What can I do?

535
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,400
As her guardian,

536
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,799
you have to do something.

537
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,400
Send her back to school, understand?

538
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,599
Yeah, I understand.

539
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,400
Rest assured.

540
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,559
I'll keep an eye on her.

541
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,160
Alright, go back to work.

542
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,240
I will keep you updated.

543
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:40,839
Okay.

544
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,119
Take care.

545
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,519
Captain Du.

546
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,559
Why did you ask me to come?

547
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:48,960
Did you tell him?

548
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:49,920
Yeah.

549
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,559
Why are you playing dumb?

550
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,119
Receive the admonition.

551
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,200
Let's go.

552
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm warning you.

553
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,519
Stay away from him.

554
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,400
Who are you to him?

555
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,240
Why do you care?

556
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,480
If you show up again,

557
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,279
I'll kill you.

558
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,240
I offered him food out of kindness.

559
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,599
What did I do wrong?

560
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,000
Come on, kill me.

561
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,799
I dare you to kill me now.

562
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,000
Calm down.

563
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:41,200
Who are you?

564
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,319
Calm down.

565
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,039
We can talk it through.

566
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,240
Both of you, stay away from him.

567
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,559
Did you hear me?

568
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:58,400
Let's go.

569
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,319
What's your problem?

570
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,359
Where were you when he was

571
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,440
digging in the trash can?

572
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,880
Yeah, I've got a problem.

573
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
So what?

574
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,880
I'll let you off this time.

575
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,240
Let's see what happens next time.

576
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:24,319
You lunatic.

577
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,480
Enough.

578
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,200
Who is she? What's her problem?

579
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,880
I don't know.

580
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,000
I've never seen her.

581
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
(Maintain fairness and justice)

582
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,519
Just the right size.

583
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,200
Perfect pants.

584
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,119
- Right?
- Yeah.

585
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,960
I'm...

586
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,240
So cool, Bai.

587
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,519
You look sharp.

588
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,559
Not bad, huh?

589
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:53,279
Not bad.

590
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,480
What about this?

591
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,680
Isn't this too much?

592
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,359
Look at him.

593
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,400
You look a bit like a feather duster.

594
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,039
What is this?

595
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:02,920
It doesn't stay.

596
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,759
Is this okay?

597
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,079
Zhitao, don't move.

598
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:07,359
I'll add some color for you.

599
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,480
Style me up.

600
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,359
Put this on.

601
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,119
Okay, I look quite cool now, huh?

602
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,200
Looks good. And put this on.

603
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,279
A wig?

604
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,440
How convenient.

605
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,400
- Put this on and we're ready to go.
- Okay.

606
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,240
How about this one?

607
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,559
You look like a kind of bird.

608
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,960
You are the bird here.
You are a flamingo.

609
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,039
You are a feather duster.

610
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,480
Dust my table when you're free.

611
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,440
Clean the floor

612
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,599
with your mop once I'm done.

613
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,240
My wig looks just fine.

614
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,440
Let's take a picture.

615
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,119
Okay, hurry up.

616
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,279
Come take a picture.

617
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,240
One, two, three.

618
00:27:41,716 --> 00:27:43,652
(Yunhai, Yuedong Province)

619
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,880
Who are you?

620
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,039
No parking here.

621
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:52,880
Drive away.

622
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:55,799
Sir.

623
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,920
We are here to see Bai Enyu.

624
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:00,880
He's a prosecutor here.

625
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,759
Please go in and inform him.

626
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,400
Looks good.

627
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,920
Yeah.

628
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,440
Look.

629
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,599
This is the juvenile prosecution.

630
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,319
Bai Enyu? A visitor
at the security office.

631
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,039
Who is it?

632
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,279
Your great-grandma.

633
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,079
Who?

634
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:17,792
- Cheng Wei.
- Huh?

635
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Pick someone up.

636
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:19,920
Who?

637
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,000
My great-grandma.

638
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:22,559
She's your great-grandma.

639
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,240
Wait, let me make a call first.

640
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
I need to ask

641
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,279
my wife about it.

642
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,200
Where is she?

643
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,720
Get changed.

644
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,920
The security office.

645
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,839
Hurry up. Get changed.

646
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,920
- Why?
- Hurry.

647
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,839
I'll explain later.

648
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:35,160
Cheng Wei, stall her

649
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,559
for as long as you can.

650
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,519
Okay.

651
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Granny, this way, please.

652
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,559
I'm really sorry, Granny.

653
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,680
The procuratorate doesn't allow

654
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,920
so many visitors at once.

655
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:58,144
(Top Ten Prosecutors
of Yuedong Province)

656
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,319
Why isn't Enyu on this list?

657
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:06,880
It's a list

658
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,920
of excellent prosecutors.

659
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,559
He said he was one of them.

660
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:16,279
They haven't

661
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,960
put up his photo.

662
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,319
They will in a few days.

663
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,559
There aren't many people

664
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,359
at the procuratorate.

665
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,039
We're off work at this time.

666
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:28,839
Over here, Granny.

667
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,160
I heard from Enyu's wife

668
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,839
that you work overtime every day.

669
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,680
Yeah, our department
is particularly important.

670
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:37,480
So, we're busy.

671
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,279
She said you were the boy's grandson.

672
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,039
Or vice versa.

673
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,039
Who is whose grandson?

674
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,359
Honey, I don't understand
anything you said.

675
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:45,680
How many people came?

676
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,799
I didn't count. A bunch of people.

677
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,000
They need a favor from you.

678
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,119
- All fired up.
- Sure.

679
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,880
I'll play it by ear.

680
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,799
Put those away.

681
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,440
Is this necessary?

682
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,079
It's needed for our daily work.

683
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:58,680
You don't know.

684
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,039
My great-grandma hates it

685
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,519
when I deal with hooligans.

686
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,599
Besides, I told her

687
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:05,480
that I'm doing very well here.

688
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,000
But you look like a bird.

689
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,960
D-Do I have to...?

690
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:13,319
Let me sit here.

691
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,440
I-I told them I'm in charge.

692
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,720
Please.

693
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,599
- Thanks.
- You're...

694
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,200
Play along.

695
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,400
Somewhat pretentious.

696
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,480
Experienced actress.

697
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,359
Your clothes...

698
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,559
I forgot.

699
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,119
What about that necklace?

700
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,400
The necklace.

701
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,440
The necklace.

702
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,920
Just tuck it in.

703
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,640
Wait.

704
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,960
Here.

705
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,920
What about your pants?

706
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Granny, please.

707
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,480
Here.

708
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:41,640
Great-grandma.

709
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,480
Why are you visiting at this hour?

710
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,839
Give me a hug.

711
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Cheng, bring some water.

712
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,720
Lin.

713
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,920
Bring a chair.

714
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,599
Okay.

715
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:50,640
Enough.

716
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,039
I came so late because of you.

717
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,559
I went home.

718
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:57,920
Tao Jia complained to me,

719
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,839
saying that you always went home late.

720
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,400
Let me get my stuff.

721
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,960
Let's go home.

722
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,680
No need.

723
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,200
Let's talk here.

724
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:07,279
Sit, Granny.

725
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:07,799
Please.

726
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,319
Thank you.

727
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,480
Have some water.

728
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,240
Thank you.

729
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:15,920
This is...

730
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,079
We are colleagues.

731
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,319
Yeah, this is Prosecutor Lin.

732
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,480
This is my assistant, Cheng.

733
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,799
This office is not exclusive to you?

734
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,839
We share it.

735
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,559
Well...

736
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,519
Then

737
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,720
who's the leader?

738
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
Bai is our superior.

739
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,319
Yeah.

740
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,359
Young people.

741
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,799
Work hard.

742
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,119
There is so much for you to accomplish.

743
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,200
Alright, Granny.

744
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:56,720
Great-grandma.

745
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,960
- Who is this kid?
- Come here.

746
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,920
He looks familiar.

747
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,559
Come here.

748
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:01,799
Come here.

749
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,880
He is my cousin Jingxian's youngest son.

750
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,720
I've seen him before.

751
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,240
He's grown so tall.

752
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,240
You became an official

753
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,559
and lost your manners?

754
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,799
Hello, Granduncle.

755
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:26,880
Hi, Grandnephew.

756
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,720
His parents work out of town.

757
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,519
He's living with me.

758
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,119
What's the problem?

759
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
I brought him to turn himself in.

760
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,119
He's skipping school
and not coming home.

761
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,720
The teacher calls me every day.

762
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,680
I'm 80 years old.

763
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,720
I can't discipline him.

764
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,880
This is your granduncle.

765
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,559
You have to look after him.

766
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,759
Yeah.

767
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:54,960
I will look after him.

768
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:55,880
But,

769
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,000
Great-grandma, you see.

770
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,880
Skipping school and not coming home

771
00:32:59,279 --> 00:32:59,839
are not

772
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,480
criminal acts.

773
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:03,039
It's beyond our jurisdiction.

774
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,839
He also stole something.

775
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,119
He sold our heirloom vase

776
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,480
to buy a motorcycle.

777
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,680
Theft is a big deal.

778
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,839
You can be imprisoned.

779
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,440
"Heirloom"?

780
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,960
I asked my friend.

781
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,519
At most, it's a replica
from the pre-1949 era.

782
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,119
It's basically worthless.

783
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,039
You...

784
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,359
Granny.

785
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,480
Have some water.

786
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,880
Don't be upset.

787
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:28,880
Grandnephew.

788
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,720
Save your tricks for the little kids.

789
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,519
Look who's

790
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:35,720
being rebellious.

791
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,920
You are a prosecutor?

792
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:40,319
Excellent prosecutor?

793
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,200
You found a warehouse

794
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,559
and two people

795
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,799
to put on a show?

796
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:47,799
Get down here.

797
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:49,759
- What did you say?
- Get down.

798
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,920
Do you know where you are?

799
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,319
You said

800
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,119
you sold the vase to your friend.

801
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,880
Your friend said it's fake.

802
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,960
Right?

803
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,680
Why do you care?

804
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,400
I don't. But the police do.

805
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,119
Prosecutor Lin.

806
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,880
How many years for theft?

807
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,480
Well,

808
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,159
it depends.

809
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,679
But he will be in prison for sure.

810
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,760
Did you hear that?

811
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:18,760
Prosecutor Lin.

812
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,519
He recognizes his mistake.

813
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,000
Make an exception.

814
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,840
Cut some slack this time.

815
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,159
Go back home.

816
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:38,679
Listen to my great-grandma
and study hard.

817
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,760
Grandnephew.

818
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,239
Cool pants you've got there.

819
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
They don't suit you.

820
00:34:54,976 --> 00:34:55,519
I'm off.

821
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,079
Where are you going?

822
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,960
Auntie, I didn't do anything.

823
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,119
Just call the police.

824
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,400
You can send me to prison.

825
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,599
Don't talk nonsense.

826
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:11,840
What?

827
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,760
You're just an orphan.

828
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,039
You think you'd make it

829
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,000
without my auntie?

830
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,599
Mind your own business.

831
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:20,800
You...

832
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:29,880
Outrageous.

833
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,079
Outrageous.

834
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,440
Great-grandma.

835
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,559
Great-grandma.

836
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,039
Zhitao.

837
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,880
So Bai is an orphan?

838
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
I had no idea.

839
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,960
(Danger Zone)
Zhitao, let's dance.

840
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,360
Breakdance.

841
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,960
She's insulting you.

842
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,800
No, I'm paying tribute.

843
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:17,679
Well.

844
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,039
Excuse me.

845
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,519
Two beers and two dice cups.

846
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,400
Thank you.

847
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,199
Someone's having fun.

848
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,840
Are we here to play?

849
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,639
We are here to work.

850
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:29,480
Have water.

851
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:31,719
Zhitao allows it.

852
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,960
I won't drink much, okay?

853
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:37,280
Learn how to communicate with kids

854
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,960
from the social workers.

855
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,880
Focus on that, not the drinks.

856
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,519
- Have water. No alcohol.
- Okay.

857
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
When it's midnight,

858
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,000
send all these girls home.

859
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,880
And take pictures, okay?

860
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,800
How about 1:00 AM?

861
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,760
I swear I'll send them home by 1:00 AM.

862
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,440
Make it 11:00 PM then.

863
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,679
Okay, midnight.

864
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:04,760
Bai,

865
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
you're quite serious.

866
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,320
What's wrong?

867
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,119
I'm serious?

868
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,639
These kids

869
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:12,880
remind me of my buddies from childhood.

870
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,000
Those memories.

871
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,199
It's nice to be young.

872
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:19,079
He's being sentimental.

873
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:24,719
Leave those here, Wen.

874
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,280
Drinks on me today.

875
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:33,039
How did that happen?

876
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:41,519
So, how do you feel?

877
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,360
Are they underage?

878
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,199
They all look quite mature to me.

879
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,639
What do you think?

880
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Look at those kids.

881
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,199
Are they 16 or 18?

882
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,440
Can you tell?

883
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,400
They don't even check IDs.

884
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,679
Everyone can come in.

885
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,079
They drink as if

886
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,079
there's no tomorrow.

887
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,119
Once they get drunk,

888
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,159
anything might happen.

889
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,280
Can we submit a proposal

890
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,559
to the Administration
of Industry and Commerce?

891
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,960
Do you think it'll work?

892
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,800
If it can be implemented, yeah.

893
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:15,239
But it takes time, doesn't it?

894
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,800
So what can we do now?

895
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,280
Keep being friends with them.

896
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,599
What about

897
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,880
calling the police?

898
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,639
Inform their parents.

899
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,639
Tell them about it.

900
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,599
They're hanging out here

901
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,960
because their parents don't care

902
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,719
or can't manage them, right?

903
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:30,760
They'll be out

904
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,000
even if you put them in.

905
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,679
Then they won't trust me anymore.

906
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,760
- Right?
- Yeah, got it.

907
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:36,679
Then I can't

908
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:37,800
help with anything.

909
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,239
Makes sense.

910
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:40,559
You're pretty sly.

911
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,079
Just a little bit.

912
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:43,719
But kids these days

913
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,840
really need

914
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,159
trustworthy adults around them.

915
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,199
If they feel abandoned and that no one

916
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,519
cares about them,

917
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,679
they'll just go their own way.

918
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,079
Then it'll be too late.

919
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,960
So what can we do now?

920
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,239
Make sure these kids

921
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,280
don't go to you.

922
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,360
Then it'll be too late.

923
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,480
Why?

924
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,639
What's wrong with us?

925
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,920
Yeah, how can you tell?

926
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,000
Look at this necklace.

927
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,719
- Look how she dances.
- Yeah.

928
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,119
She's the only "granny" here.

929
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:10,159
What?

930
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,440
I said you're young.

931
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,039
You're awesome.

932
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,360
Yeah, I feel the street vibe.

933
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,280
Integrated.

934
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,719
Yeah, I'm just like them.

935
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:18,440
Totally.

936
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,159
Yeah.

937
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:21,039
You have no self-awareness at all.

938
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,199
- What?
- Nothing. You're awesome.

939
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,159
- Right?
- Very good.

940
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:28,896
(Yuandi Tavern)

941
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
My heart can't take it.

942
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:30,912
Zhitao.

943
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,000
Since I put on makeup today,

944
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,039
I'm meeting someone.

945
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,039
I'll just...

946
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,440
Don't you always wear makeup?

947
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,800
No, I never do.

948
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:40,679
- Go home early.
- Don't be late tomorrow.

949
00:39:40,864 --> 00:39:41,400
Okay.

950
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,239
(Wen, they'll fight!)

951
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:43,719
So? Shall we go home?

952
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,000
Wait, don't go.

953
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,000
Come with me.

954
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,760
Next round.

955
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,639
We need to sleep.

956
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,519
We have work tomorrow.

957
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,639
Stay awake and have fun.

958
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,880
- Come on.
- Come on, "Granny".

959
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,960
- Wait, I...
- Let's go.

960
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm exhausted.

961
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,599
Where are we going now?

962
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,320
Why is it getting rural?

963
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,559
Two groups of kids
are fighting over the turf.

964
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,519
This is serious.

965
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:08,960
But I've done that as a kid, too.

966
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,159
So who are

967
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,360
t-these kids?

968
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,679
Some are kids

969
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,880
left behind
by parents working out of town.

970
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,280
The others followed

971
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:19,800
their parents to the city for work.

972
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,000
So all of them

973
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,599
are left unattended.

974
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,760
They love to ride motorcycles.

975
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:25,719
There's a field

976
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:27,639
without surveillance
in the industrial area.

977
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,280
They love practicing there.

978
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,400
But then,

979
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,840
more and more people came

980
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,239
and started fighting for the turf.

981
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,679
Bai Zuhao.

982
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,440
I'm taking you to do something huge.

983
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,159
Don't pull us back.

984
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,880
Let's go.

985
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,559
- Go.
- Let's go.

986
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:58,400
- Go.
- Let's go.
