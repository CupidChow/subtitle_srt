Me? I had no money to learn.

following videos.

109
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,160
comes here to attend classes?

110
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,720
Kids preparing for art exams.

111
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,480
They usually rehearse until late.

112
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,839
So we set up a classroom
for them on the rooftop here.

113
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,759
And then...

114
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
Then when they have classes,

115
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
do they take this path?

116
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
No,

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,920
a door is in front.

118
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,439
The path surveillance?

119
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
It's not installed.

120
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,959
Why not install it?

121
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,039
There's no legal requirement
to install it, right?

122
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,679
I see there's a police car
parked outside.

123
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,960
Does the police now

124
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,759
also handle fire safety matters?

125
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,519
What is that room used for?

126
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,000
A storage room.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,399
Just for some sundries and stuff.

128
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,240
Open it.

129
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,480
Okay.

130
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,360
Is Ms. Min,
who is in charge of admissions, here?

131
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,039
Ms. Min?

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,960
Min...

133
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,919
I'm really sorry.

134
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,919
Since our school was established,

135
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,440
there hasn't been a teacher named Min.

136
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,159
You'd better ensure

137
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,519
that your teacher profiles

138
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,879
and certificates are all complete.

139
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:15,720
I can.

140
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,879
I can assure you, the police.

141
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,720
Xiaoyao,

142
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,360
copy all their data and surveillance

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,240
and take it away.

144
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,279
Got it.

145
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:24,919
Let's go.

146
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,840
By the way,

147
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,000
I believe

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,639
in the future,

149
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,639
we will have many areas
where we need your cooperation.

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,679
No problem.

151
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,519
So

152
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,799
see you.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,919
See you.

154
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,080
Let's go.

155
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,240
See you.

156
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Anything?

157
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,600
Master,

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,600
we have gone through all the data.

159
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,519
There indeed is no such person
as Ms. Min.

160
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:57,840
We even suspect

161
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
whether that person
is even surnamed Min at all.

162
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,159
The surveillance?

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,919
Can Cui Jiayi's testimony match?

164
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,399
The building

165
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,320
indeed matches her description.

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,639
The front door wasn't filmed.

167
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,879
No surveillance at the back.

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,080
Not even a wisp was captured.

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,559
That's impossible.

170
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,960
How could a living person

171
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,480
appear and disappear out of nowhere?

172
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,240
Do you expect them to gather

173
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,360
all the evidence for you?

174
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,519
That's a dream.

175
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,960
- Don't laugh.
- No evidence.

176
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,600
No materials.

177
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
No surveillance. No teacher.

178
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,559
Where can we find something?

179

Weixiang.

180
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:29,919
Master.

181
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,799
Have you found Hu Minmin's identity?

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
I'm still working on it.

183
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,799
I'm working on it.

184
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,159
You say that whenever I ask you.

185
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,200
But you give me nothing.

186
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,720
Are you a kindergarten toddler
fooling your teacher?

187
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,879
No.

188
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
Stop laughing.

189
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,480
Listen to me.

190
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,919
If we can't find that person,
no one goes home.

191
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,559
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,960
We found them, Master.

193
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,519
Hu Minmin was found?

194
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,200
No.

195
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,519
Those two abducted children were found.

196
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,080
My friend works
at the anti-trafficking office.

197
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,200
They said
they found a match in the DNA database.

198
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,799
You brat,

199
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:09,279
stop showing off.

200
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,559
No, I'm not.

201
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:12,960
Captain Du.

202
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,080
Someone from Forensic Center is here.

203
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,639
Hello.

204
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,279
Captain Du.

205
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,000
Director Lu told me

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to give this to you.

207
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,080
Thank you.

208
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,440
Alright, I'm leaving first.

209
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,039
Okay.

210
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,279
I won't see you off.

211
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,280
(DNA Test Report
on the Jane Doe of 2010 in Wangjiang)

212
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,559
Brat.

213
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,360
Master.

214
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,840
Take this to your classmate.

215
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,960
See if they match.

216
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,559
Okay.

217
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,399
Listen up.

218
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,039
You should all learn from Weixiang.

219
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,120
Use your brain.

220
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,559
There are always more solutions
than problems, understand?

221
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,679
Understood.

222
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,360
What?

223
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,600
Are you savoring my compliments?

224
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,720
No, I'm not.

225
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,399
Why the waiting?

226
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,399
Hurry and go.

227
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,559
I'm not used to being both criticized
and praised by you.

228
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,080
Brat.

229
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,639
Showing off, aren't you?

230
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,080
Brat.

231
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,000
Prosecutor Lin,

232
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,679
I'm not someone
who doesn't love children.

233
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,759
But Hu Li...

234
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,480
Please find somewhere else for her.

235
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,320
I can't help her.

236
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,720
Don't say that, Director Xu.

237
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,759
That's not what you said earlier.

238
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,440
Didn't you tell us to rest assured?

239
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
It's not that I don't want to help.

240
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,919
But this kid

241
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,480
bites whoever she sees.

242
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,960
She even bites me.

243
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,360
Other kids cry when they see her.

244
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,399
If it continues,

245
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,080
it'll be bad for other kids' growth.

246
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,840
Our welfare home

247
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,120
has more kids other than her.

248
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,600
About her biting issue,

249
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,639
she surely

250
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,639
wasn't born
with a tendency to bite, right?

251
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,799
Someone must have said or done something

252
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,600
that triggered her.

253
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,240
Even so...

254
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,200
Zhitao,

255
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,600
we can't be so overly protective.

256
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,519
- Exactly.
- Besides, no matter what,

257
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,120
biting people is definitely wrong.

258
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,679
That's true.

259
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,720
- Exactly.
- That's true.

260
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,879
Even if another kid
took her stuffed toy,

261
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:23,840
she shouldn't bite.

262
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,320
Right, biting people is wrong.

263
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,600
Our welfare home's

264
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,759
top priority is to ensure

265
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,559
the kids' physical and mental health.

266
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,559
You are right.

267
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,279
I have to be responsible
for the other kids too.

268
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,919
I didn't think it through.

269
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,279
I underestimated the difficulty
of changing Hu Li's behavior.

270
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,279
In her situation,

271
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,519
she probably needs
professional treatment.

272
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,559
How about this?

273
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,600
Give us some more time.

274
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
We will solve this problem for her

275
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,639
thoroughly. Is that okay?

276
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,159
Don't send her away for now.

277
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,759
Alright then.

278
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,240
Since she got in the car until now,

279
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,399
hasn't she been quiet?

280
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,519
She caused no trouble.

281
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,440
Do you think Director Xu
was making up a story?

282
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:15,840
If you dare,

283
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,399
bite my flesh off and swallow it.

284
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,120
Otherwise, you can stop biting.

285
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:27,600
You can't even

286
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,399
bite it off...

287
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,399
Bai Enyu, pull over.

288
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,279
I'll drive.

289
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,399
You get to the back. Hurry.

290
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,639
No.

291
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,399
Hurry up.

292
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,200
There are so many cars.
I can't pull over.

293
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,840
Hurry up.

294
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,120
Just pull over. Hurry.

295
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,559
No, I can't pull over.

296
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,360
How about I drive faster?

297
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,816
(Yang's Diner)

298
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:54,799
Lu Sheng.

299
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,399
Get in the car.

300
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Mr. Yang, I'm leaving.

301
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,080
You should do something.

302
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,240
Zhitao is going to be eaten up.

303
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
Hu Li, let her go.

304
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:11,759
It works pretty well.

305
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,799
Come on. Do it again.

306
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,720
Don't rush to close your eyes.

307
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,799
Look straight ahead.

308
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,159
That's right.

309
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,360
Relax.

310
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,039
Very good.

311
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,200
Okay, let's continue.

312
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,799
Walk steadily.

313
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,039
Then take the next step.

314
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,080
She learns quite quickly.

315
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,879
Maybe she should learn parkour.

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,519
It's sensory integration training.

317
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,080
You're an expert now?

318
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,840
Tell me about it.

319
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,960
Let me give you an example.

320
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,000
It's like when you first came
to the procuratorate,

321
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,279
you talked nonsense.

322
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,679
After my relentless hammering,

323
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,639
you gradually became a normal person.

324
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,679
Put it nicely.

325
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,759
She has to practice
controlling her emotions

326
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,639
like she's learning to walk.

327
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,600
That's what it means.

328
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,159
Then it should be easy
for her to do that.

329
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,159
Last quarter,

330
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,559
the Mandatory Reporting System
by the juvenile prosecution

331
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,039
has achieved some results in practice.

332
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:40,879
They promptly
discovered unreported cases

333
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,519
of sexual assault on minors.

334
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,639
During the inquiry process,

335
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:45,759
they also

336
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,919
have preliminarily discovered

337
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,759
the psychological characteristics
of minors.

338
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,519
Although the situation is different

339
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,679
for each specific child,

340
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,519
they understand the difference

341
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,559
and have found specific solutions.

342
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,559
Slowly summarizing experiences

343
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,879
is also a kind of progress.

344
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:02,639
Yesterday,

345
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,200
I attended a provincial meeting.

346
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,319
The superiors also highly value

347
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,472
the juvenile prosecution's
exploration and practice.

348
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,839
I hope you can keep working hard

349
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,319
and exploring in depth.

350
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,119
Keep up the good work.

351
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,279
That's all for today's meeting.

352
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,319
Prosecutor Zheng, please stay.

353
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,880
Do you need me?

354
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:27,240
Go ahead.

355
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,119
I'll see you.

356
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,799
Did he make Prosecutor Zheng

357
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,240
stay to assign important work?

358
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,680
What important work
needs to be arranged privately?

359
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,359
You really don't
understand social niceties.

360
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:44,920
Keeping her alone
is definitely for a conversation.

361
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,079
Zheng is about to be criticized.

362
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Impossible.

363
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,920
The chief prosecutor just said

364
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,759
the provincial superiors
highly value her.

365
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
They value
the juvenile prosecution work.

366
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,799
Zheng

367
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,680
should've focused
on juvenile prosecutions.

368
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,920
She shouldn't have
pursued the Wangjiang case.

369
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,839
All those notices posted and TV time

370
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,079
still got her nowhere.

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,319
It wouldn't be that bad, right?

372
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,759
No evidence has been found
for five years.

373
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,200
The public didn't know
about this at first.

374
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,680
Now that she yelled about it,

375
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,119
the whole world knows.

376
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
It's a big impact on our reputation.

377
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:25,440
This afternoon, I led Hu Li
in sensory integration training.

378
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,640
The good discovery is that she has

379
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,000
a sense of communication.

380
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,440
Sometimes she wants to communicate.

381
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,880
She understands what you say

382
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,440
and can sense your emotions.

383
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,440
But internally, she might be resistant.

384
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:39,119
The doctor said
her vocal system has no issues.

385
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,440
So I guess...

386
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,160
Yes?

387
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,319
Is it possible that her not speaking

388
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,920
is a psychological issue?

389
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,799
Or

390
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,319
is it a form of self-protection for her?

391
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,680
Just like she actually
isn't that dark-skinned.

392
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,000
She... Look. Is she speaking?

393
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:00,359
Look.

394
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:03,440
Lu Sheng,

395
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,680
have you ever seen her speak before?

396
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,119
I don't think so.

397
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,119
Why are you...

398
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,440
Argued with your sister again?

399
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,119
Where's her sister?

400
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,240
She's crying at the door.

401
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,440
- What...
- Well...

402
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,480
Do I know you?

403
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,000
Do I know you? Let go.

404
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,559
Hu Li.

405
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,240
Hu Li.

406
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,359
Hu Li,

407
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,640
do you know her?

408
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,519
Put your thing away quickly.

409
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,559
And get into bed.

410
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,359
Boys,

411
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,240
get into bed.

412
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:53,880
Go to sleep.

413
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,519
Tuck yourself in. Who'll be the first?

414
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,039
Put it away. Right.

415
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,880
Here you go.

416
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,160
Be good.

417
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,160
Was the window
of Hu Li and the others' room closed?

418
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:21,480
I closed it this afternoon.

419
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,039
I'll go back and check again.

420
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,920
No need. You should go back and rest.

421
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,599
- Okay. I'm leaving now.
- Bye.

422
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:47,799
Sister.

423
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:48,799
Come back.

424
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,880
Come back.

425
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,400
Sister.

426
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,279
Sister.

427
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
I want to be at home.

428
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,640
Well done.

429
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,240
Hu Li,

430
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,519
is this your friend?

431
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,480
Is this your sister?

432
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:40,839
Minmin,

433
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,839
can you let little Hu Li talk to me?

434
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,480
Okay.

435
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,200
Hu Li,

436
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,839
tell me,

437
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,400
have you ever seen Jiayi?

438
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,359
Yes.

439
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,920
I've seen her.

440
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,640
Where?

441
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,680
At home.

442
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,079
(Criminal Investigation Brigade Office)
We prepared ten suspect photos

443
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:06,640
for Jiayi to identify them.

444
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,880
(Hu Minmin's death case)
Jiayi immediately recognized Hu Minmin

445
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,079
and pointed out

446
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,720
that this person

447
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,279
was precisely Ms. Min,
who brought her to dance school.

448
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,759
That is to say,

449
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,200
Hu Minmin was the Ms. Min

450
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,559
we have been looking for.

451
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,960
And now all Hu Li's descriptions

452
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,319
match with Cui Jiayi's testimony.

453
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,759
Therefore, we believe

454
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:27,160
that after Cui Jiayi passed out,

455
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,920
she was taken to Hu Minmin's home.

456
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,680
So Hu Minmin

457
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,759
was very likely the accomplice

458
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,759
to the rape case.

459
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,720
We thoroughly
searched the entire school,

460
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,599
watched all the available
surveillance footage,

461
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,240
and questioned everyone we could.

462
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,279
No one knows Hu Minmin.

463
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,599
And the surveillance cameras
didn't capture anything.

464
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:49,839
We could say

465
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,079
that she hid herself very well before.

466
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,799
Furthermore,

467
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,759
Jiayi was drugged and raped.

468
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,599
We can't ask her too much now.

469
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,039
All the clues

470
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,359
end up broken around Hu Minmin.

471
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,000
Right now, the suspect is still unknown.

472
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,079
About the location
where the rape was committed,

473
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,319
is it unknown too?

474
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,680
Theoretically, yes.

475
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,039
Xiaoyao, sorry to interrupt you.

476
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,079
Let's assume that, hypothetically,

477
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,400
Hu Minmin is just

478
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,039
a fishing net.

479
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,319
Then there must be someone
manipulating this net behind the scenes.

480
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,359
Look.

481
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,359
A rape case

482
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,799
and a murder case.

483
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,960
I can't help but feel

484
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,759
behind these two cases,

485
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,200
there is an even bigger net.

486
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,400
Your intuition is not enough,
Captain Du.

487
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,119
Explain what you mean.

488
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,440
I think this net is right
in that school.

489
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,599
Now, these two cases

490
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:53,319
are likely pointing to the same suspect.

491
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:55,559
Can we

492
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,759
first

493
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,640

Sorry,

519
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,279
I was looking at this.

I have a music player here.

It's broken like this.

522
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,559
I asked several stores.

523
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,039
They couldn't fix it.

524
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
Is this yours?

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,839
Okay.

Lu Sheng?

533
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:12,880
Lu Sheng,

534
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,200
you're at home.

535
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,960
- Captain Du.
- What's this?

536
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,359
Considering a job change?

537
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,720
Are you going to work at the circus?

538
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:25,839
No.

539
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,360
I'm still at Yang's Diner.

540
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,440
Still at Yang's Diner.

541
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:35,640
I'll pour you a glass of water.

542
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
No need.

543
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,039
Don't be nervous.

544
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,079
I was just joking with you.

545
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,160
I'm not here to catch you.

546
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,119
By the way,

547
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,839
I wanted to ask you about something.

548
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,200
I remember you said before

549
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,400
that Hu Minmin always disappeared.

550
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,480
Do you know

551
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,960
where she went when she disappeared?

552
00:28:59,039 --> 00:28:59,839
She never said.

553
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,400
And her hometown?

554
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,359
Do you know where her hometown is?

555
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:04,880
I don't know.

556
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,200
Did she ever bring any unfamiliar girls

557
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,119
back here?

558
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,079
Don't be nervous.

559
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,000
It's not about you.
I'm asking about her.

560
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,480
I'm not sure.

561
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,799
I'm usually
between day and night shifts.

562
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,480
I'm not always at home.

563
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,799
What did she do for a living?

564
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,759
Do you know?

565
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,920
Were you two really close?

566
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,119
How come
you don't know anything about her?

567
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:39,720
No.

568
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,160
She never mentioned it.

569
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,640
So I didn't ask.

570
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,680
You brat.

571
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,559
Quite a gentleman, huh?

572
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:49,519
Alright.

573
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:50,319
Go ahead.

574
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:52,680
Captain Du,

575
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,559
was there something more to her?

576
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,160
Nothing.

577
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,920
Just go.

578
00:29:58,519 --> 00:29:59,160
It's nothing.

579
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,279
There's really nothing?

580
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,319
Listen up.

581
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,079
What we're going to talk about next

582
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,759
is all confidential.

583
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:12,839
Do you really want to know?

584
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,319
Want to hear it?

585
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,799
Then I'll tell you.

586
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,440
He's terrified.

587
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,720
That brat.

588
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,359
Captain Du,

589
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,640
Wan Xuemin was beaten.

590
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,640
What?

591
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,079
Yes, he was beaten.

592
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,640
Wan Xuemin was beaten?

593
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,960
Wang Hengquan,

594
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,839
about your assault on Wan Xuemin,

595
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,519
do you have anything to say?

596
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm going to kill him.

597
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,839
Wan Xuemin, that scoundrel.

598
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:49,119
I'm going to kill him.

599
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,759
During class,

600
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,480
you must listen carefully.

601
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Listen to the teacher.

602
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,680
Practice moves a lot.

603
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,799
Ask the teacher
about what you don't understand.

604
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,000
If you could win a prize

605
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,599
in a dance competition,

606
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,039
the tuition your mom and I paid
won't be in vain.

607
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:06,880
Do you agree?

608
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,119
What's wrong?

609
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,279
Dad,

610
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,119
I don't want to learn dance anymore.

611
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:21,119
You don't want to?

612
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,519
Didn't you tell me

613
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:24,759
that you love dancing the most?

614
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:28,000
Just keep it up.

615
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,400
Excuse me.

616
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,359
Why did you bring your kid here?

617
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,680
The school is closed.

618
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,359
What's wrong?

619
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,960
I don't know.

620
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,960
They said a kid had an accident.

621
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,440
An incident?

622
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,240
I just heard it from the teacher.

623
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,200
It seems like sexual assault.

624
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:08,880
Sexual assault?

625
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
I don't know either.

626
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,240
I shouldn't have let Yuqing learn dance.

627
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,519
It's all my fault.

628
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,839
It's my fault.

629
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,400
Wang Hengquan,

630
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
tell us first

631
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,920
what happened to Yuqing.

632
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,359
This parent group is in an uproar.

633
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:50,799
The police have visited

634
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,759
several families for more information.

635
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,000
It's just for more information.

636
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
Also, it's a school.
Such things can't happen there.

637
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,440
No.

638
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,039
The parents said

639
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,400
the police were speaking evasively.

640
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,920
They wanted to ask

641
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,279
if any little girl was...

642
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,440
The police didn't come
to our home, right?

643
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,799
Did they come to our house?

644
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,920
Don't overthink, okay?

645
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:20,920
I haven't told you something.

646
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,720
The grading exams are incoming.

647
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,359
I was anxious.

648
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,000
So I took Yuqing

649
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,720
to Mr. Wan's place to give him a gift.

650
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,880
I didn't mean anything else.

651
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,960
I just wanted Mr. Wan

652
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,480
to give Yuqing more class hours

653
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,880
or a one-on-one session.

654
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,039
Yuqing,

655
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,000
I want to ask you something.

656
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:54,960
Well...

657
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,680
Yuqing,

658
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,759
I want to ask you something.

659
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,559
Has Mr. Wan

660
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,799
given you one-on-one classes?

661
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,880
Yes.

662
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,679
Was he

663
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,039
the only one teaching you?

664
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,920
He was alone with you?

665
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Did he ever do anything to you?

666
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,800
For example,

667
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,039
did he grope you

668
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,159
or touch you?

669
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:33,800
Yes.

670
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,079
Just

671
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,880
my waist

672
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,199
and legs.

673
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,760
And...

674
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,440
And what else?

675
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,079
Say it.

676
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,280
Apart from touching you,

677
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,079
what else did he do to you?

678
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,239
Please let me in.

679
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,079
He's not here.

680
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:08,000
Let me go.

681
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,320
Let me go.

682
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,639
(Wannian Xingchen Dance School)
Calm down.

683
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:33,039
Do you know why

684
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,559
Yuqing committed suicide?

685
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,239
She just wanted to tell me,

686
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,840
"Dad,"

687
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:44,480
"even you"

688
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,800
"couldn't protect me."

689
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,599
Yuqing

690
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,039
is our baby girl.

691
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,960
That beast, Wan Xuemin,

692
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,559
harmed her,

693
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,199
a child.

694
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,159
When I took Yuqing to the police,

695
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,239
she couldn't say anything.

696
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,840
The police couldn't help.

697
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,559
They said they'd investigate.

698
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,440
But I couldn't wait that long.

699
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:31,960
I couldn't.

700
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,639
So I went to reason with Wan Xuemin.

701
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,119
(Wannian Xingchen Dance School)

702
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:41,920
Wan Xuemin.

703
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,440
Who is it?

704
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,880
You beast!

705
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,039
Why are you insulting me?

706
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,920
You beast!

707
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,559
You harmed my daughter.

708
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,079
You harmed my daughter!

709
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,280
Are you crazy?

710
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,519
Tell me.

711
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,639
If the same thing happened to you,

712
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,079
what would you do?

713
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,199
Could you endure it?

714
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
Wouldn't you want...

715
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,480
Wouldn't you want to kill him?

716
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,559
Yuqing's life is ruined.

717
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,679
So

718
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
you assaulted Wan Xuemin

719
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,280
and caused minor injuries to him

720
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,199
because you believe

721
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,159
Wan Xuemin
sexually assaulted your daughter.

722
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,360
