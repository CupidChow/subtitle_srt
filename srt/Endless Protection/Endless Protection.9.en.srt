Hua.

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:31,879
Hua!

4
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,719
Mom, this is Grandma Chen.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,759
Look, I bought you this!

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,679
Thank you, Grandma Chen.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,920
Hua.

8
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,600
Grandma Chen.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,200
Why hasn't Xiaohu come?

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,520
I saved some candy for him.

11
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,840
Good girl.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,479
Xiaohu is

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,960
at kindergarten.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,000
Grandma Chen.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,599
After he finishes school,

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,480
can you bring him over?

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,400
Hua.

18
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,359
Hua.

21
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,000
You're really Xiaohua
and Xiaohu's grandma, right?

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,680
Do they know that?

23
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,919
Why don't you tell them?

24
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,840
Seeing your grandkids every day

25
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,208
but pretending not to know them.

26
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,039
Isn't it absurd?

27
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,479
Tu Huaiwei said,

28
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,560
as long as I don't admit I'm his mother,

29
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,080
I can live with them.

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,960
And he'd give me money

31
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,280
to buy food for the kids.

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,544
How long do you live together?

33
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,319
More than a year.

34
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,120
Didn't Yang Xiaoying notice anything?

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,800
I am just a nanny.

36
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,280
Nothing special.

37
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,719
Did those two

38
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,199
ever hit the kids?

39
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,240
The two kids are quite unfortunate.

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,159
Yang Xiaoying

41
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
really spoils her daughter.

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
Every time Huihui complained

43
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,199
the two kids bullied her,

44
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,479
she would argue with Tu Huaiwei

45
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,240
and even raised hell.

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,479
Who hit the kids,
Tu Huaiwei or Yang Xiaoying?

47
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,079
Tu Huaiwei.

48
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,839
Last time Xiaohu was found injured

49
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,120
at kindergarten.

50
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,079
It was Tu Huaiwei who hit him, right?

51
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,839
Who took Xiaohu to the hospital
for a cast?

52
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,000
I did.

53
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,584
Where's the medical record?

54
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,279
I put it on the back of the sofa.

55
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,680
Ma'am,

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,720
can you testify in court about this?

57
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,560
No, no.

58
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,720
Tu Huaiwei's actually in a tough spot.

59
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,920
He...

60
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,279
He...

61
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,000
Ma'am!

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,319
Xiaohu has passed away.

63
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,759
And Xiaohua is now
lying in the hospital.

64
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,600
If you turn a blind eye to this,

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,360
how will she face

66
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,240
the rest of her life?

67
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,600
It's your stubbornness and indulgence

68
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,519
that hurt these children.

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,079
Where are you going, Bai Enyu?

70
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,720
What else? To issue a search warrant!

71
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,920
Ma'am, let's calm down.

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,879
Think about it.

73
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,759
You can't pretend this

74
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,079
as if it never happened.

75
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,920
Xiaohua is only six years old.

76
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,560
How is she going to live
the rest of her life?

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,560
This will be her lifelong trauma.

78
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,319
What are you doing?

79
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,759
Step aside.

80
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,959
We're from the Procuratorate.

81
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:52,920
Here, a search warrant.

82
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,048

86
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,800
he found the evidence
of injuring Xiaohua and Xiaohu.

87
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,800
Injuring, right?

88
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
Right.

89
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,639
That's not enough for murder.

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,360
Abuse works.

91
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,279
Arrest him.

92
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,160
Arrest him.

What now?

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
You two are suspected

97

of abusing Tu Xiaohua and Tu Xiaohua.

you are hereby arrested.

- Cuff them.
- Is there a mistake?

I've said everything I can.

103

Wait.

This's already late.

Charging Tu Huaiwei
and Yang Xiaoying of child abuse

114

is just the first step.

I've got something.

120

See if you can use it.

121

130

Right.

131
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,759
I heard Xiaohua has woken up?

132
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,560
Right.

133
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,240
She's the key witness in this case.

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,199
Communicating with her
must be methodical.

135
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,899
- Right.
- I get it.

136
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:06,439
Just like conducting evaluations.

137

About asking Xiaohua,

00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,319
I think we shouldn't rush for now.

We're here for a child.

Is it your child?

162

Is that what Truman Show means?

Isn't it?

169
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,440
This is called sandplay therapy.

170
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,720
How does it work?

171
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,279
Look at those sand tools behind you.

172
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,600
You can let the children

173
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,399
pick any and place them
however they want.

174
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,240
From that,

175
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,440
you can analyze

176
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,399
and discover some of their thoughts

177
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,120
or issues.

178
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,440
Well,

reveals their thoughts?

182
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,919
Maybe it sounds simple.

183
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,759
However, sandplay

184
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,639
is like drawing and writing a journal.

185
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,879
It helps children lower their guard

186
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,320
and express themselves

187
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,600
in the most comfortable way.

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,320
Understood.

189
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,159
You can try it first.

190
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:53,960
Try placing some items.

191
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,360
Okay, I'll start with these.

192
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,039
And then?

193
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:05,840
Just place them.

194
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,159
- Can I move the sand?
- Sure.

195
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,120
It's blue underneath.

196
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,559
Yes, it is.

197
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,279
You can imagine it as an ocean.

198
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
Or a river, right?

199
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,039
Right.

200
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,559
This goes here.

201
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,000
Then...

202
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Done.

203
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,000
The first thing you picked is a boat.

204
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,879
Right.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,559
It represents yourself.

206
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,000
The shells and bottles on the shore

207
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,080
are all far away.

208
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,720
Except this one in the corner.

209
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,360
I just wanted to put it here.

210
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,519
Alright.

211
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,440
The boat is isolated

212
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,840
in the middle of the vast ocean.

213
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:11,759
The bottles and shells on the shore

214
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,080
are a bit far from the boat.

215
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,799
Right.

216
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,120
Of course, I think you care about them.

217
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,919
But in your view,

218
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,120
between the boat

219
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,759
and the bottles and shells,

220
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,120
there is quite a distance.

221
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,000
In other words,

222
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,799
this is

223
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,480
a solitary boat.

224
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:42,840
Wait, a solitary boat?

225
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,399
Aren't I still here?

226
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,440
Right?

227
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,759
I think...

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,759
Miss. Su.

229
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,799
I think this result

230
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,600
is not that accurate.

231
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,200
Please interpret mine.

232
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,240
All be together.

233
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,320
To understand a child,

234
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
it's best not to have preconceptions.

235
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,240
That

236
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,200
only blinds you to their deeper thoughts

237
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,600
in their unconscious mind.

238
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,600
But that's precisely

239
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,679
where their

240
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,639
truest emotions lie.

241
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
Got it. Don't predict.

242
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,168
Think from their perspective.

243
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,399
Right.

244
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,600
To understand a child's inner world,

245
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
as I suggested,

246
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,039
your first lesson is

247
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,279
to learn to squat down to speak.

248
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,360
Talk to them eye to eye.

249
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
It's the first step.

250
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,559
Understood.

251
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,519
I may remind you,

252
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,360
given your current situation,

253
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,480
you're not suitable
to communicate with the child.

254
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,320
Well,

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,679
then

256
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,919
I will play the role

257
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,279
of a warmhearted brother.

258
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,080
Kid,

259
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,919
let me tell you

260
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,279
a story about a little white bunny
and a big bad wolf.

261
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,240
One day, there's
a meeting in the forest.

262
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:10,720
All the little animals came.

263
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,159
Little rabbit, little turtle,

264
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,120
little tiger, big wolf,

265
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
and the little bear.

266
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,120
Just then,
the starting gun went off with a bang.

267
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
The little rabbit
dashed out like a flash,

268
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,080
leaving the little turtle far behind.

269
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,279
Then, the big wolf appeared.

270
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,120
Bai.

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,960
What are you doing?

272
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,159
Nothing.

273
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,360
What little rabbit?

274
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,039
Little rabbit?

275
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:31,960
What little rabbit?

276
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,320
I said little spots.

277
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,679
Look at the mirror.

278
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:37,159
There's one here, and here, and here.

279
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:37,840
So many!

280
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,559
They'll ruin customer experience.

281
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,279
I'm just cleaning.

282
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,279
I'll clean it later.

283
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,440
Can you help me
put this on that counter?

284
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,759
I can't reach.

285
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,200
You shouldn't

286
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,320
lift such heavy stuff anymore.

287
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,279
What if you hurt yourself?

288
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,279
Right?

289
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,720
For these things below,

290
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,440
the lighter ones

291
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,399
that are easy to lift,

292
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,559
I'll also help.

293
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,440
Okay. It's all your job.

294
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,639
You give birth too.

295
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,480
That's your job.

296
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,639
I'll help with the second kid.

297
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,679
I'll help.

298
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,159
Now, let's play a storytelling game

299
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,200
with our new friends.

300
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,120
Sound good?

301
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,879
Yes!

302
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,879
Awesome.

303
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,159
Let's get started then.

304
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:56,200
Let's start.

305
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,840
In the fairy tale kingdom,

306
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,519
there was a beautiful big forest.

307
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,879
Many cute little animals

308
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,399
lived there.

309
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,960
They liked to travel in groups.

310
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,440
Xiaohua,

311
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,960
which animal do you think you are?

312
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
I am this little rabbit.

313
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,240
You're the little rabbit, right?

314
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,559
Does the little rabbit have a friend?

315
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,679
Yes.

316
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,399
The little tiger and the little rabbit
are good friends, right?

317
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,320
Right.

318
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,000
So, besides the little tiger
and the little rabbit,

319
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,120
who else went to play out

320
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,919
with them?

321
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,480
Was the little rabbit a bit scared?

322
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,519
Why?

323
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,919
Because the big wolf
and the little fox were both bad.

324
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,279
The little fox scared the little rabbit

325
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:01,840
and the little tiger.

326
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,799
The big wolf's bad too.

327
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:06,720
He threw the little rabbit
and the little tiger

328
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,840
into the water.

329
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,960
But don't worry.

330
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,639
They had

331
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,879
life jackets.

332
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,799
Don't worry.

333
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,159
No.

334
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,240
The big wolf taught us
to sing and to unbutton.

335
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,480
How do you unbutton?

344

Does the little rabbit know

345
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,400
why the big wolf threw her

346
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
and the little tiger

347
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,759
into the water?

348
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,160
Because daddy doesn't want us anymore.

349
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,319
Mom is here.

350
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,640
Mom.

351
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,880
Mom is here.

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,200
Mom is always here.

353
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,440
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:58,464
(Protect the Nation for the People,
Secure Stability for the Country)

355
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,759
Xiaohua,

356
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:20,160
take a look.

357
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,440
Do you see the big wolf
that pushed you into the water?

358
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,359
Look, both of us are here.

359
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,079
Look back at him.

360
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,240
See?

361
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,519
We are all here with you.

362
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,880
So don't be afraid, Xiaohua.

363
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,480
Tell me,

364
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,440
is there the big wolf inside?

365
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,359
Xiaohua, don't be afraid.

366
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,960
Through this layer of glass,

367
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
the big wolf can't see you.

368
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,039
Only you can see him.

369
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,079
Dad is the big wolf.

370
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,440
Auntie, I know it's you.

371
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,359
Xiaohua,

372
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,599
don't be afraid.

373
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,799
Auntie will always protect you.

374
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,440
I'm not afraid, Auntie.

375
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,359
Xiaohu said

376
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:44,640
both of us are very brave.

377
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,119
Right. You and Xiaohu

378
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,400
are brave little heroes, right?

379
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
No. Xiaohu is not a hero.

380
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,839
He is a pirate.

381
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,559
Why is Xiaohu a pirate?

382
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,920
Because his eye was hurt by dad.

383
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,599
He said after he became a pirate,

384
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:01,440
he would protect me.

385
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,799
Does it hurt?

386
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,759
No.

387
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,000
Xiaohua, do I look like a pirate?

388
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
Yes. Be a pirate and protect us.

389
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,599
Good girl.

390
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,720
In the future, we will protect you.

391
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,480
I promise.

392
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,400
Okay?

393
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,559
Defendants Tu Huaiwei and Yang Xiaoying,

394
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,359
charged with attempted murder
and child abuse.

395
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,676
The court is now in session.

396
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:05,680
Bring Defendants Tu Huaiwei
and Yang Xiaoying to court.

397
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:12,448
(Yunhai Intermediate People's Court,
Prosecutor)

398
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,166
(Defendant)

399
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,039
Xiaohua, tell me,

400
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,039
is there the big wolf inside?

401
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,880
(Defendant)
Dad is the big wolf.

402
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,599
Does the little rabbit know

403
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,279
why the big wolf threw her

404
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,319
and the little tiger

405
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:42,559
into the water?

406
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,559
Because daddy doesn't want us anymore.

407
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,680
Your Honors, please allow me

408
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,359
to make an explanation

409
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:55,680
on victim Tu Xiaohua's testimony.

410
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,359
She didn't directly say

411
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,400
that her dad threw her into the water,

412
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,319
because Tu Xiaohua
is only six years old.

413
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,559
We can only use a storytelling method

414
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,920
to help her recall what happened.

415
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,960
When Tu Xiaohua said

416
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,880
"Dad is the big wolf",

417
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,000
the big wolf refers

418
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,960
to Tu Xiaohua's biological father,

419
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
Defendant Tu Huaiwei.

420
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,240
Judge,

421
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,559
Xiaohua is only six years old.

422
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,000
She...

423
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,039
She made all these up.

424
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:25,640
Or someone told her to.

425
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,319
My ex-wife hates me.

426
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,880
It must be her.

427
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,359
She taught the kid to say this!

428
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,319
Prosecutor, is there objective evidence?

429
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,680
We request
to present the next set of evidence.

430
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,319
We restored the scene

431
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:37,880
of the incident on the boat

432
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,559
by video simulation.

433
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,359
Please allow

434
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,680
the expert, Director Lu Wenzhao

435
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,680
of the Judicial Evaluation Center
from People's Procuratorate of Yunhai

436
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,400
to give an explanation.

437
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,160
The boat was 4.2 meters long,

438
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,880
(Investigation Report)
1.2 meters wide,

439
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,200
and 1.5 meters high.

440
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,400
The total weight

441
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,799
of the four people aboard

442
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,240
was 142.5 kilograms.

443
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,200
When they were on board,

444
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,440
the draft depth of the boat
was 32 centimeters.

445
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,640
Based on the wind speed, water speed,

446
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,759
the boat's own weight,

447
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,880
and the total weight of the four people,

448
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,720
we can calculate

449
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,599
that to throw the child overboard,

450
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:18,200
it would take

451
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,880
at least 5,200 Newtons of force.

452
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,039
Let me elaborate on this concept.

453
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,319
The force of a kick
of a professional male football player

454
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,319
is approximately 4,900 Newtons.

455
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,079
When the Defendant was interrogated,

456
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,119
he claimed that the ten-year-old girl
Yang Huihui sitting in the front row

457
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,680
rocked the boat

458
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,839
and caused the children to fall.

459
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,519
Do you think this is possible?

460
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,160
Collegial tribunal, please watch

461
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,119
the simulation video
of the boat rocking to its limit.

462
00:23:45,684 --> 00:23:47,000
(3D modeling reconstruction of the incident
issued by the Judicial Evaluation Center)

463
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,839
Chief Judge,

464
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,759
the inner width of the boat
is 90 centimeters

465
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,920
and the defendant's hip width
is 45 centimeters.

466
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
The hip widths

467
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
of the two children in the back are

468
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,359
20 centimeters and 23 centimeters.

469
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,640
Even if the girl in the front

470
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,079
is a strong person

471
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,599
who rocked the boat to the extreme,

472
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:08,279
the two children in the back

473
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,160
would be wedged

474
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,359
and stuck inside the boat.

475
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,640
Therefore, for Tu Xiaohu to fall out,

476
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,920
the only reason is

477
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,240
an external force.

478
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,720
Director Lu, please explain
in simpler terms.

479
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,240
The children were thrown into the water.

480
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,559
Impossible.

481
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,920
They fell out of the boat on their own!

482
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,319
That animation is fake!

483
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,640
They fell by themselves, really!

484
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,440
Chief Judge,

485
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,400
I request to present
the next set of evidence.

486
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,880
(DNA Analysis Report)

487
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
We found human skin tissue

488
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,079
human skin tissue

489
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,359
under Tu Xiaohu's

490
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,200
right fingernails.

491
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,319
DNA analysis

492
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,160
confirms it belongs
to Defendant Tu Huaiwei.

493
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,440
That indicates

494
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:53,440
when Tu Xiaohu
was thrown into the water,

495
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,880
he scratched Tu Huaiwei.

496
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,920
I-I...

497
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,200
He did scratch me

498
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,559
because I was trying to save him.

499
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
The boat captain! They all saw it,

500
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,799
They can testify.

501
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,799
How did you save him?

502
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,079
I just grabbed him.

503
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:05,039
Show me.

504
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,039
Just like this.

505
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,000
Okay, don't move.

506
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,680
You grabbed his hand like that?

507
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,079
If so,

508
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,960
the injuries on you hand

509
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,079
wouldn't be like these.

510
00:25:17,908 --> 00:25:19,640
(Defendant Tu Huaiwei's hand injuries)

511
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,920
The photo shows

512
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
the place where Tu Huaiwei got injured

513
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,839
is the upper part of the right fingers.

514
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,640
Right here.

515
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,519
This kind of injury

516
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,880
could only be caused in one way.

517
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,000
That is, at that time,

518
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,279
Tu Xiaohu's hand was

519
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,680
clinging tightly to the boat railing,

520
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,480
and you used your right hand

521
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,200
to pry open his fingers one by one,

522
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
which caused the injuries.

523
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,079
Is that right, Tu Huaiwei?

524
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,039
I... I was too panicked at the time.

525
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,839
I really can't remember clearly.

526
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,200
The situation was too urgent.

527
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,279
I really don't remember.

528
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,559
(Tu Xiaohu's Autopsy Report)
This is Tu Xiaohu's autopsy report.

529
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,559
As we can see,

530
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,400
three fingers of Tu Xiaohu's right hand

531
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,559
had varying degrees
of soft tissue contusions.

532
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,319
After identification,

533
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,160
they were caused
by external force and twisting.

534
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,920
So, Tu Xiaohu was

535
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,119
in an extremely fearful state,

536
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,559
he gripped the railing tightly,

537
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:24,759
and Tu Huaiwei
pried open his fingers one by one,

538
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,359
then threw him into the water.

539
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:36,519
The next set of evidence

540
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:39,200
relates to the joint crime
by the two defendants.

541
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,759
I don't know.

542
00:26:41,216 --> 00:26:42,559
What does it have to do with me?

543
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,880
Stop using the word "solve"

544
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,200
to justify everything, okay?

545
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,240
I do not plead guilty.

546
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,519
Defendant, pay attention to court order.

547
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,240
Without Chief Judge's consent,

548
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,799
Defendant is not allowed to speak.

549
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,560
Prosecutor, please present the evidence.

550
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,000
(Chat Records)
This is the transfer records

551
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,599
between Tu Huaiwei

552
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:01,720
and Tu Huaiwei's ex-wife, Jie Yangyang,

553
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240
the victim's mother.

554
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,039
The records show

555
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,839
that in addition to
a regular living expense

556
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,200
payment of 2,000 yuan,

557
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,680
Jie Yangyang also made
irregular transfers to Tu Huaiwei,

558
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,240
which cover what Tu Huaiwei claimed

559
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,319
as the children's
exorbitant living expenses,

560
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,160
entertainment and educational costs.

561
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,599
Yang Xiaoying.

562
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,759
Are you aware of this?

563
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,000
Impossible.

564
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,039
That woman never cared
about those two kids.

565
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,359
And Tu Huaiwei promised me

566
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:32,039
he'd never contact that woman again.

567
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,400
Defendant Yang Xiaoying.

568
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,079
Take a look at this chat record.

569
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,000
"Today I took them
to eat fried chicken and fries."

570
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,519
"After all, they're our kids."

571
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:40,599
"Don't worry."

572
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,720
Here's another message.

573
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,200
"If you send me 520,"

574
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,240
"I wouldn't mind."

575
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,880
What does 520 mean?

576
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,079
Think about it.

577
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,680
Aren't they too intimate?

578
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,519
Don't listen to his provocation.

579
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,880
They spliced it together like this.

580
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,440
I... I never said such things.

581
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,720
They spliced it to frame me!

582
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,240
Tu Huaiwei receiving money
from Jie Yangyang

583
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,400
has no bearing on
whether my client incited murder.

584
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,119
I request to present
the next set of evidence.

585
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,599
At that time,
Yang Huihui was steering the boat.

586
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,119
She constantly rocked the boat.

587
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,359
I tried to stop her
because the two kids were scared.

588
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,000
She ignored me.

589
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,160
She kept rocking it.

590
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,759
I reached out to stop her,

591
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,519
but it made

592
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,000
the boat shake more.

593
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,200
When I turned back,
the two kids had already fallen in.

594
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,400
You mean, Yang Huihui rocked the boat

595
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,839
to make the kids fall in on purpose?

596
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,759
This was Tu Huaiwei's first statement.

597
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,799
He deliberately suggested

598
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,200
that it was Yang Huihui's rocking

599
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,880
that caused the incident.

600
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,880
Thereby

601
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,799
he tried to mislead the investigation

602
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,480
onto Yang Huihui.

603
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,319
Defendant Yang Xiaoying.

604
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,799
Yang Huihui is just a child.

605
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,440
Bearing such a terrible accusation

606
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,640
would ruin her life.

607
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,680
This is malicious editing!

608
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,079
I didn't say that!

609
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,640
It's really malicious editing!

610
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,000
Chief Judge,

611
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,880
I request
witness Chen Bixian to testify.

612
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,720
Witness Chen Bixian.

613
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,279
What is your relationship
with Defendant Tu Huaiwei?

614
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,079
I am

615
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,200
Tu Huaiwei's mother.

616
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,272
He...

617
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,519
Didn't you tell me
your parents were died?

618
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,599
Defendant, pay attention to court order.

619
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:48,880
Chen Bixian.

620
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,279
Please tell us what you know

621
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,000
related to this case.

622
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,319
Yang Xiaoying

623
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,720
and her daughter have terrible tempers.

624
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,240
Xiaohua and Xiaohu often got beaten,

625
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,440
very severely.

626
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,279
Let me play.

627
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,640
Give it to me.

628
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,519
Let go! Give it!

629
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,519
- No.
- Give it to me!

630
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,359
- No!
- No!

631
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,200
Give me!

632
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,240
No!

633
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,480
- No.
- Give it to me!

634
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,519
No!

635
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,200
Mom, they're bullying me again!

636
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,119
Give it to me!

637
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,480
Huihui, move.

638
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,119
Stop it!

639
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,000
Give it or not?

640
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
Give it or not!

641
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,440
What did I tell you?

642
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,920
Why are you so meddlesome?

643
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,039
Why annoyed her?

644
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:47,000
Why so meddlesome?

645
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,039
Are you being nice?

646
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,000
Dare run?

647
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
Stop!

648
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,759
Pretending here?

649
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,519
Xiaohu

650
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,599
even got

651
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,880
his bone broken.

652
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:06,599
Who did that?

653
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,200
Should I tell the truth?

654
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,519
Yes.

655
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,559
It was

656
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,119
Tu Huaiwei.

657
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,960
Mom, don't help them.

658
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,759
Witness Chen Bixian.

659
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,920
When you saw the children being abused,

660
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,519
why didn't you call the police?

661
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,119
I... I thought,

662
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,519
my son isn't a bad person.

663
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,519
I talked to him in private

664
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,519
not to treat the kids that way.

665
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,920
He told me
he was just acting out of anger.

666
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:49,279
He promised that Xiaohua and Xiaohu

667
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,519
would live a good life.

668
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:52,079
What did he mean by "a good life"?

669
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,839
Housing compensation.

670
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,319
My house is being demolished.

671
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,599
That's my house!

672
00:31:58,599 --> 00:32:00,039
You're coveting my house?

673
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,119
Shameless!

674
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,240
Your whole family is nothing
but a bunch of thieves.

675
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,640
You deserve

676
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,480
to be wiped out!

677
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,240
Objection.

678
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,400
The witness's statements

679
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,839
are irrelevant to the case.

680
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:10,599
Shut up!

681
00:32:10,599 --> 00:32:12,039
I paid for your expenses too!

682
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,599
Tu Huaiwei.

683
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,599
Now I finally understand

684
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,799
why you tried to frame Huihui.

685
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,319
You just wanted both of us

686
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,160
to get into trouble,

687
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,839
so that you could take over my house!

688
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,920
Tu Huaiwei!

689
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,480
What did you say the night before?

690
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,200
What did you say to me?

691
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,960
Chief Judge,

692
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,640
my client is emotionally unstable.

693
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,119
I am perfectly stable!

694
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,079
Tu Huaiwei.

695
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
You said I was your family,

696
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,519
your only family,

697
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,279
the closest person to you.

698
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:36,119
Is this how

699
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,799
you treat your closest family?

700
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,079
Objection.

701
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,039
He said...

702
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:42,920
He said

703
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,400
there were no cameras out there.

704
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,720
The kids would die
without anyone knowing.

705
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,039
Let's go down together.

706
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,559
Defendant Tu Huaiwei.

707
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,799
Do you admit

708
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,880
to conspiring
with Defendant Yang Xiaoying?

709
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:20,839
I do not.

710
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,039
I've been framed.

711
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Son,

712
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,359
we cannot

713
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,279
live like parasites anymore.

714
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,759
We need to live like human beings.

715
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,079
It's all my fault

716
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,279
for not educating you well.

717
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,559
It is all my fault.

718
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,240
Judge,

719
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,079
can I take the blame for him?

720
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:48,799
I'll take it, okay?

721
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:49,720
Judge.

722
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,279
Can you stop pretending?

723
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,599
What are you doing?

724
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,920
You are pushing me to my death!

725
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,599
What good does it do you if I die?

726
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,440
Even a tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

727
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,759
I can't believe that's from your mouth.

728
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Tu Huaiwei.

729
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,079
You

730
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,599
took Xiaohua

731
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,719
and Xiaohu

732
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,119
for a boat ride.

733
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:23,400
Do you know how happy they were?

734
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,320
A tiger doesn't abandon its cubs?

735
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,000
Then how could you hurt Xiaohu?

736
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,840
Thinking of this makes me hate you.

737
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,800
How could you be so cruel?

738
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:00,920
(Out of the maze)

739
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,000
Why are you looking for us?

740
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,360
I plead guilty.

741
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,480
Yang Xiaoying,

742
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,639
you are an instigator
of intentional homicide.

743
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,840
Your actions are as vicious
as Tu Huaiwei's.

744
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,719
Are you clear?

745
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:15,000
Even you plead guilty now,

746
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,760
it won't affect your sentencing.

747
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,312
Will having a letter of forgiveness
save me from death?

748
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,119
What?

749
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,200
A letter of forgiveness.

750
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,960
I'll pay the money.

751
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,440
I'm willing to pay.

752
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:27,960
800,000.

753
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,639
I have a house. I can pay.

754
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:30,960
Is it okay?

755
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,079
Xiaohua will need a lot of money
on medical treatment.

756
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,159
They have no money.

757
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,119
I'm willing to pay for that.

758
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,840
I have a house, I can do it.

759
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,119
Even a million.

760
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,199
Only if it can save me.

761
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,119
You regret it now?

762
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,480
What were you doing back then?

763
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,400
I also have a daughter.

764
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,079
You realize you have a daughter now.

765
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:03,072
(To Sister Huihui)

766
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,800
As a Prosecutor,

767
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
I know

768
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,840
I should be calm and rational.

769
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:13,519
But at this moment,

770
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,239
I am furious.

771
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:18,079
A child aged five or six

772
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,400
should be running around outside,

773
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,920
laughing loud,

774
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,320
and be loved and cherished.

775
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,320
But at such a young age,

776
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,320
Xiaohu has left this world forever.

777
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,480
His sister

778
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,719
will carry the trauma of her injuries,

779
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,559
and the shadow

780
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,559
of her own biological father
wanted to kill her,

781
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,639
for the rest of her life.

782
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,239
I don't know how this girl

783
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,719
will face

784
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,480
her future life.

785
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,599
Even a fierce tiger won't eat its cubs.

786
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,480
But he used such cruel means

787
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
to kill his own kid.

788
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,159
This is a complete loss of humanity,

789
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,960
utterly heartless.

790
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,519
Tu Huaiwei and Yang Xiaoying

791
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,320
regarded Tu Huaiwei's
biological children

792
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,800
as obstacles to their marriage.

793
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,159
They conspired together

794
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:11,639
to murder the children
by faking an accidental drowning,

795
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,320
resulting in one child's death

796
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,039
and the other's severe injury.

797
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,159
Their actions severely violated the law,

798
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,840
disregarded human morals,

799
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,480
and trampled on societal conscience.

800
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:23,760
Their motive was despicable,

801
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,840
their conduct particularly vile,

802
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,599
their methods heinous,

803
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,800
the consequences extremely serious,

804
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,039
and the social impact extremely adverse.

805
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,239
They should be severely punished
according to the law.

806
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,639
Defendants Tu Huaiwei and Yang Xiaoying

807
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,559
violated Articles 232 and 260

808
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:39,920
of the Criminal Law

809
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,559
of the People's Republic of China,

810
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,800
constituting intentional homicide
and abuse.

811
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,199
According to Article 29 the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China,

812
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,280
multiple crimes applies.

813
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,880
We suggest to sentence
Tu Huaiwei and Yang Xiaoying

814
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,480
to death penalty.

815
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:01,280
The court pronounces the judgment.

816
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:02,656
(Supervised by
the Supreme People's Court)

817
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,400
All rise.

818
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,159
According to Articles 232,

819
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,760
Article 260 and Article 29

820
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,360
of the Criminal Law

821
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,920
of the People's Republic of China,

822
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,159
the judgment is as follows.

823
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,239
One.

824
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,320
Defendant Tu Huaiwei,
for the crime of intentional homicide,

825
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,519
is sentenced to death penalty,

826
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,320
and for the crime of child abuse,

827
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,119
sentenced to two years in prison.

828
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,320
Combined punishment,

829
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,599
Tu Huaiwei is sentenced to death.

830
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,800
Two.

831
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,360
Defendant Yang Xiaoying,

832
00:38:37,472 --> 00:38:39,039
for the crime of intentional homicide,

833
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:40,280
is sentenced to death penalty.

834
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,639
Defendant Yang Xiaoying,

835
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:42,679
for the crime of abuse,

836
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:44,719
is sentenced to two years in prison.

837
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,079
Combined punishment,

838
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,960
Yang Xiaoying is sentenced
to death penalty.

839
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:54,440
Is it necessary to come here?

840
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,199
We're all quite busy.

841
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,079
You're not the sentimental type.

842
00:39:58,336 --> 00:39:59,159
It's been years.

843
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:00,559
Still can't get past this?

844
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,400
Come on.

845
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,280
I can.

846
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,360
They've renovated this place.

847
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,599
Look, the decoration.

848
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,199
There's even
a legal education room here.

849
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,912
(Legal Education Room)

850
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:23,880
Look.

851
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,119
Now there are desks and chairs.

852
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,159
When we first met,

853
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,960
you were barely

854
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,360
taller than this podium, right?

855
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:36,800
Right.

856
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,639
At that time,

857
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:41,199
I am a headstrong prosecutor.

858
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,119
I wanted to do everything

859
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:44,800
and convince everyone.

860
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,000
But when it comes to actual practice,

861
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,320
it's not that simple.

862
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,280
Did I do something wrong?

863
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,480
If I did,

864
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,840
you can criticize me.

865
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,679
Feel free.

866
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,199
Don't be that nervous.

867
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,079
No.

868
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,000
It's not like that.

869
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,519
I just

870
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,360
want to say thank you.

871
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,000
Because it was you

872
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,760
that made me feel

873
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,760
my persistence was meaningful.

874
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,519
Look at the pamphlet.

875
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,639
Full of words.

876
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,480
I remember those I read
when I was a kid,

877
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,719
are all picture books, barely any text.

878
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,239
The literacy rate really has gone up.

879
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,320
Everything is changing for the better.

880
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,920
Your hometown as well.

881
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,079
Back then, people were used

882
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,280
to those backward things.

883
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,679
When you told them it was wrong,

884
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:45,119
they simply wouldn't listen.

885
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,159
That's why

886
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:50,079
we must send Lin Zhengfeng in prison.

887
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,039
Only then would people understand

888
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,208
that domestic violence is illegal.

889
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:59,320
I was lucky to have met you

890
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,960
when I was a kid.

891
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,344
You don't blame me for recommending you
to juvenile prosecution?

892
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,440
I can do well anywhere.

893
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,119
Juvenile prosecution
has a beginning but no end.

894
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,840
Understood.

895
00:42:17,248 --> 00:42:18,159
When you were a kid,

896
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,360
you planted a seed in me.

897
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:21,880
Now, we'll watch the tree

898
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,599
grow together.

899
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,519
You've made me a tree
gets too much attention.

900
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,119
I'm just worried that one strong wind
might knock it all down.

901
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,960
Who taught you to talk like that?

902
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,440
I'm talking seriously to you.

903
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,159
It used to be so hard
to make progress on one case.

904
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,440
Now, you've got support
from so many departments.

905
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:40,719
Don't waste the opportunity.

906
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,719
The case of Xiaohua and Xiaohu

907
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,039
is not over.

908
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:45,039
I know what to do.

909
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:45,880
Don't worry.

910
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,639
Prosecutor Zheng.

911
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:52,360
You're back!

912
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,960
We're her to see you.

913
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,519
Here, I brought you some dried fish.

914
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:56,639
This is mine.

915
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,800
Please accept it.

916
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,239
You have helped us so much.

917
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,800
We are so grateful to you.

918
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,039
- Please, take it.
- Please.

919
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:04,760
- Take it.
- Take it.

920
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,896
(Mandatory Reporting System)
Today I want to share with you

921
00:43:08,896 --> 00:43:10,360
about the Mandatory Reporting System

922
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,960
for child abuse cases.

923
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,800
This system requires

924
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,679
that state agencies, organizations

925
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:18,440
and officials authorized

926
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,360
to exercise public power by law,

927
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,679
and personnel working in sectors

928
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:24,960
that frequently interact with minors,

929
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:25,960
If they found

930
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,639
or even suspect,

931
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:30,159
that a minor has been harmed

932
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,480
or is at risk of unlawful harm,

933
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:34,960
they must immediately
report to the police

934
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,000
or authorities.

935
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,039
Let me

936
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,119
tell you

937
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:50,960
about

938
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,360
a case I handled recently.

939
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,960
There are two children

940
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,159
who are twins,

941
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:57,400
both six years old.

942
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,199
One named Xiaohua and the other Xiaohu.

943
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,320
(The father of the two children)

944
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,320
(remarried.)

945
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:06,039
(From that point on,)

946
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,960
(the twins never had a good day.)

947
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,599
(Living under another's roof,)

948
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,039
(being beaten and scolded,)

949
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,719
(and getting many injuries.)

950
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,360
(During the whole year,)

951
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,480
(the happiest day for them)

952
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,079
(was when)

953
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:18,679
(their dad said he'd take them boating.)

954
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:20,639
(They were so excited.)

955
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:23,960
(But they never expected)

956
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,360
that on that day,

957
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:27,480
their dad

958
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:29,880
tried to kill them.

959
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,559
You might ask,

960
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,480
when such things happened

961
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,000
and the children suffered,

962
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:39,719
didn't anyone see it?

963
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,039
Didn't anyone try to stop it?

964
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:43,639
Someone saw that.

965
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,480
The neighbor saw it.

966
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,360
The teacher knew it.

967
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,519
The doctor knew it.

968
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,039
Even pedestrians on the road knew it.

969
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,440
But among so many people,

970
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,599
not a single person stood up to help.

971
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:04,760
Not even one.

972
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,800
Maybe they were

973
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,679
afraid of retaliation

974
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,760
from the parents.

975
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,239
Or they believed

976
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:17,960
good people don't get rewarded.

977
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,679
Is there any chance

978
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:21,320
that some of those people are kind?

979
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,480
I think there is.

980
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,599
But,

981
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:26,159
we indeed never encouraged them

982
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,920
to stand up.

983
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,679
We never told them

984
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,719
that they could

985
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,960
and should step in

986
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,920
and help,

987
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,840
even if it was a misunderstanding.

988
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,480
Actually, I've been through

989
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,360
the same things these kids have.

990
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,239
I know very well

991
00:45:49,239 --> 00:45:51,760
the color of those bruises

992
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:55,400
and the pain it is on the body.

993
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,119
When I was very young,

994
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,400
I truly wished someone could stand up,

995
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:02,400
speak for me

996
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,199
and help me.

997
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:06,639
So in this case,

998
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,360
when I meet Xiaohua,

999
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,159
I promised her

1000
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,880
that I'd protect her.

1001
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:15,880
I want to keep that promise.

1002
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,800
So,

1003
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:24,320
today,

1004
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,159
I sincerely ask you all

1005
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,159
to join me in helping children
like Xiaohua and Xiaohu,

1006
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:34,159
and help them live their lives in peace.

1007
00:46:47,892 --> 00:46:53,888
