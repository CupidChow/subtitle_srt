Huihui?

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,879
Huihui!

00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,079
Huihui!

00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,000
Huihui!

Xiaohu!

00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,600
Xiaohu!

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,759
I-I saw him push Xiaohua into the water.

13
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:48,799
So I guessed he pushed them both.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,840
You guessed that?

15
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,880
Are you sure what you said is true?

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,560
It's absolutely true.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,079
If I lied, my dad and mom would die.

18
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:07,400
The last question.

19
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,439
Xiaohua and Xiaohu fell from the slide.

20
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,439
Did you push them?

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,879
No.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,560
I was the one who fell from the slide.

23
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,000
Then why did they have injuries?

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,000
I told Tu Huaiwei

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,480
that they pushed me down

26
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,959
and let Tu Huaiwei beat them.

29
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,639
I was reckless this time.

30
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,280
It's not recklessness.

31
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,479
It's a procedural violation.

32
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:28,320
(Interrogation Records
of People's Procuratorate of Yunhai)

33
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,240
Prosecutor Lin,

34
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,599
can we

35
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,879
communicate like normal colleagues?

36
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,159
We can chat or discuss things.

37
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,680
The records are well taken.

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,199
I mean it. They are good.

39
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,680
Aren't you worried

40
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,039
that Yang Huihui still lied
to you this time?

41
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,319
She admitted driving fast deliberately.

42
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Maybe at that time,

43
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,879
evil overpowered reason in her.

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,919
With an impulse...

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,639
Tu Huaiwei must know

46
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,639
that Yang Huihui
hates those two children, right?

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,960
So he deliberately said

48
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,520
that Xiaohua and Xiaohu were scared,

49
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,520
so Yang Huihui
shook the boat more badly.

50
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,919
Could it be the case?

51
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
It could be.

52
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,040
Isn't this also
your subjective speculation?

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,959
Is it?

54
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,279
Isn't it?

55
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,360
No speculation.

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,480
Let's go find evidence.

57
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,399
Let's go.

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,199
Here you are.

59
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,160
Dad.

60
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,680
- Are you good?
- Let's go.

61
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
Let me hold you.

62
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,040
Slowly.

63
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,000
Lin,

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,680
to do investigative experiments,

65
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,199
it's about disproving.

66
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,879
The way shall be scientific.

67
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,040
Do you want
to do this experiment or not?

68
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,199
You need to think it through.

69
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,199
You shouldn't do this on your own.

70
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,240
We'll do it.

71
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:29,720
It's too dangerous.

72
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
The counterweight?

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,360
Give it to me.

74
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,360
Stop.

75
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,480
Why the counterweight?

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,839
What if you fall down?

77
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,720
I caught fish in the river at six.

78
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,120
What could happen if I fell down?

79
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,279
So stubborn, huh?

80
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,240
The back.

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,824
Okay.

82
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,120
Let me do it. Wait.

83
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,800
Stay away.

84
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,360
Life jacket.

85
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:46,399
Give it to me.

86
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:47,296
Hurry.

87
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,120
Put on the life jacket before you go.

88
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,959
I know. It's fine.

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
Be careful.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
Got it.

91
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:07,920
Where was it again?

92
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,079
About there.

93
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,879
About there?

94
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:10,400
Right.

95
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:16,160
Listen.

96
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,879
Tilt over.

97
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,079
Then slightly straighten.

98
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,040
Turn right.

99
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,519
Okay, almost there.

100
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,959
- Is the engine off?
- It's off.

101
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:26,199
Okay, now let's shake this boat

102
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,079
to the fullest extent.

103
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,879
Okay.

104
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,399
There's a railing blocking each side.

105
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,399
How could they possibly fall out?

106
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,920
Let's try again.

107
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,040
Let's exert force.

108
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,319
How is it?

109
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,639
They couldn't be shaken off.

110
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,079
Turn the boat to the right.

111
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,759
So they could only be thrown down.

112
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,160
What a beast!

113
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,959
Come on.

114
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,319
Yang Huihui didn't lie.

115
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,079
Tu Huaiwei killed the kids.

116
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,079
No physical evidence
or victims' statements.

117
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:13,959
The experiment result
is not direct evidence.

118
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,319
Can we nail him down?

119
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,879
You are back.

120
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,240
How was the result?

121
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,000
I confirmed

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,079
Tu Huaiwei lied.

123
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,040
Those two kids

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,839
couldn't be shaken off the boat.

125
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,480
We can now

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
exclude reasonable doubts.

127
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,639
Even if it's not direct evidence,

128
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
we can arrest Tu Huaiwei.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,120
Let's arrest Tu Huaiwei.

130
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:37,519
The request needs to be submitted to
the Prosecutor's Committee for review.

131
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,480
The result of the review
will be the same.

132
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
Tu Huaiwei will be arrested.

133
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,480
Just prepare the materials, okay?

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay.

135
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,360
How about
letting the police work harder?

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,799
Doctor, please help us.

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,399
She's only six.

138
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,080
I've lost my son.

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,720
I can't lose her too.

140
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm begging you, doctor.

141
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,759
I'm begging you.

142
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,960
Please help us.

143
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,919
I'm begging you.

144
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,240
We have been doing our best.

145
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,639
Her brain and chest

146
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,840
have fluid accumulation.

147
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,799
Whether or not she wakes up
depends on fate.

148
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
Hua.

149
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
On the day of the crime,

150
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
Tu Huaiwei and the two victims,
Xiaohua and Xiaohu,

151
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,320
(Tu Huaiwei, Tu Xiaohua, Tu Xiaohu,)
as well as Yang Huihui,

152
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,399
(Yang Huihui and Yang Xiaoying)
boarded a boat.

153
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,279
The boat was like this.

154
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,039
The police found two fingerprints

155
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,240
(Photos of the boat)
on the steering wheel

156
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,399
and confirmed

157
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
they were Tu Huaiwei's

158
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,600
and Yang Huihui's.

159
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,279
(Case information)
Tu Huaiwei is Yang Huihui's guardian.

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,320
He ignored the boat owner's warning

161
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,240
and let the only ten-year-old
Yang Huihui steer the boat.

162
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,159
Yang Huihui claimed

163
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,960
Tu Huaiwei took advantage

164
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,960
of her discord with Xiaohua and Xiaohu

165
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,200
to deliberately let her

166
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,399
shake the boat vigorously

167
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,080
while steering.

168
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,559
At this point,

169
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,559
Yang Huihui's and Tu Huaiwei's
statements

170
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,480
diverged.

171
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,720
Yang Huihui said...

172
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,399
I saw him push Xiaohua into the water.

173
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,000
But Tu Huaiwei said...

174
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,159
Yang Huihui was driving the boat
at that time.

175
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,919
She constantly shook the boat.

176
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,240
Then an accident happened,

177
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,759
causing the kids to fall off the boat.

178
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,159
It's our investigative experiment.

179
00:10:56,576 --> 00:10:59,200
(Investigative Experiment Video Record)

180
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,360
I actually shook the boat
quite vigorously.

181
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:17,240
Yang Huihui is a ten-year-old girl.

182
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,559
With her strength,

183
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,080
even if she shook the boat vigorously,

184
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
the experiment proved

185
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,519
it was impossible
to toss two kids overboard,

186
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,279
unless there was an external force.

187
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:27,960
Therefore,

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,679
Tu Huaiwei's confession
was completely falsified.

189
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,360
We believe

190
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,360
suspects Tu Huaiwei and Yang Xiaoying

191
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,679
are guilty of criminal conduct,

192
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:38,639
and this is

193
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,600
a filicide case.

194
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,279
It's against humanity

195
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,200
with severe social repercussions.

196
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,919
It is recommended
to immediately arrest them.

197
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,639
I viewed those records.

198
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:53,960
Yang Huihui's testimony

199
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,960
was altered two or three times

200
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,759
and was contradictory.

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,720
In the situation
where there's only witness testimony,

202
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,120
testimonial shifting is a major taboo.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,320
What if the judge does not believe it?

204
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,720
We did an investigative experiment

205
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,320
(Voice records)
and have voice records of the suspect.

206
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
They can fully prove

207
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,120
those two had a motive for murder

208
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,320
and the behavior of them
acting together.

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,519
Tu Huaiwei, let me tell you.

210
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,080
If you don't get rid of the two kids...

211
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,519
In other chat records,

212
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,240
Yang Xiaoying mentioned multiple times

213
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,879
her dissatisfaction with these two kids

214
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,240
and her desire to get rid of them.

215
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,919
The suspect's word choice
was "getting rid of."

216
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,120
She never said "killing"

217
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,960
or other explicit words.

218
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,480
Prosecutor Fu,

219
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,840
doesn't "getting rid of" mean "killing"?

220
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,879
Who says in everyday speech that they

221
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,879
want to kill someone?

222
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,480
They use "getting rid of" instead.

223
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,320
It's an issue
of colloquial language, okay?

224
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,080
Our experiment can also prove it.

225
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,000
He was doing it, right?

226
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,919
The experiment can only prove

227
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,159
that without external force,

228
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,799
the two kids
could not fall into the water.

229
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,639
But it can't prove

230
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,279
that Tu Huaiwei

231
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:06,000
pushed them into the water.

232
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,919
Then who did?

233
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,360
Then who did, Mr. Lu?

234
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,120
Also,

235
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,240
Lin,

236
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,519
isn't your investigative report

237
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,360
a bit

238
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,360
insufficiently rigorous?

239
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,279
Where is the weather data
on the day of the incident?

240
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,799
Have you fully considered

241
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,639
the weather on the day of the incident?

242
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
Wind strength
and hydrological conditions

243
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,039
must be consistent
with those on that day.

244
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,679
Also,

245
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,240
I must remind you.

246
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,279
The key is

247
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,840
these are two kids.

248
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,679
Even if the weight is consistent,

249
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:45,399
any subconscious movement by them

250
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,120
could lead to a distorted

251
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,840
or even completely opposite conclusion.

252
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,000
We did our best to replicate the scene,

253
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:54,840
Mr. Lu.

254
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:56,919
Your best?

255
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,480
What does it mean?

256
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,240
We shall do it in a scientific way.

257
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,000
How about this?

258
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:21,200
Those in favor of arrest,
please raise your hand.

259
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,759
Those who oppose,
please raise your hand.

260
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,879
We'll reject
the Juvenile Prosecution Office's

261
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,960
request for arrest.

262
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,480
Meeting adjourned.

263
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,919
No arresting?

264
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,360
No arresting?

265
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,080
What is a scientific way, Mr. Lu?

266
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,320
Do you also think

267
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,799
she's been a bit strange these days?

268
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,799
She's okay.

269
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,759
Is she always this impatient?

270
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,840
Not really.

271
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,879
Hello, Zhitao.

272
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,399
Retrieve all filicidal case files
from the last five years.

273
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,840
We need to get approval
from Prosecutor Zheng for this.

274
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,440
Got it.

275
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,320
I'll go see her.

276
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,759
Emotional agitation
in investigative experiment,

277
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,399
presumption of guilt against suspects,

278
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,840
unfounded yelling at us,

279
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,159
and yelling at the leaders.

280
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,399
Are you sure she's okay?

281
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,399
She's indeed very emotional.

282
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,440
- Come in.
- Prosecutor Zheng, Lu...

283
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,440
Director Lu, how did you beat me?

284
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,759
I'm not here to complain.

285
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,519
Director Lu, I discussed it
with you before

286
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,120
and sought your consent, right?

287
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,200
I told you.

288
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:26,879
Sometimes,

289
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,200
experiments are meant to disprove.

290
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,879
Your experiment can only prove

291
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,679
that Tu Huaiwei lied.

292
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:35,480
It can't prove that he committed murder.

293
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,759
My experiment can prove

294
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,639
that the two kids

295
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:39,360
were not shaken off the boat,

296
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,679
but were pushed off.

297
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,000
And the one who did that

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
can only be Tu Huaiwei.

299
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,279
If this doesn't count
as ruling out reasonable doubts,

300
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,039
what does count?

301
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,480
I am ruling out reasonable doubts.

302
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,919
Lin,

303
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,480
you asked me if eggs
can be used to make rice rolls,

304
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,079
and I said yes.

305
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,359
But now you're saying

306
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,920
eggs are just rice rolls.

307
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,200
Is this scientific?

308
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,880
He acts like a ghost every day.

309
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,848
I...

310
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,160
We shall do it

311
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,119
in a scientific way.

312
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,640
Just look how stubborn he is.

313
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,160
You two are equally matched.

314
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,599
I am deeply convinced

315
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:36,680
that it's Tu Huaiwei.

316
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,000
Ma'am, it must be Tu Huaiwei.

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,799
It's really him.

318
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,519
You put yourself

319
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,240
in the shoes of those two poor kids?

320
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,279
I didn't.

321
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,839
A person's subjective state

322
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,640
is not about what he says,

323
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,839
but is verified
through his objective behavior.

324
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,759
- Okay, I admit...
- You're handling the case emotionally.

325
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,000
I admit I'm angry.

326
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:55,799
Tell me if you are angry.

327
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,319
I didn't put myself in it.

328
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,079
I simply believe

329
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,079
Tu Huaiwei absolutely did it.

330
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:01,599
And why?

331
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,759
Xiaohua and Xiaohu could not

332
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,839
have jumped on their own.

333
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,720
They couldn't have unbuckled

334
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,519
and jumped.

335
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,359
They could only have been pushed by him.

336
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,440
Otherwise, convince me.

337
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Is there any reasonable doubt?

338
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,400
What else can be ruled out?

339
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:15,440
Here, take a look.

340
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,640
Do you remember this case?

341
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,880
Wangjiang's Jane Doe case
five years ago.

342
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,920
You were on this case.

343
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,279
This case

344
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,880
had confessions from the suspect

345
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,079
and DNA evidence,

346
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,160
but the victim's identity was unknown.

347
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:29,160
The suspect withdrew the confession

348
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,759
and evaded the murder charge.

349
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,599
I didn't accept that.

350
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:35,440
But we need to have
a complete chain of evidence.

351
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,720
Director Lu is a technical expert.

352
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:39,200
He only acknowledges evidence.

353
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,039
He takes an objective view

354
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,799
to oversee our rationality.

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,559
He is slow

356
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,319
at everything.

357
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,400
He supervises slowly too.

358
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,119
Because you never know

359
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,359
what unbelievable things

360
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,440
the defendant will say in court.

361
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,720
Xiaohua woke up.

362
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,559
Thank you.

363
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,680
Hua,

364
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,559
Dr. Sun and the nurse came to see you.

365
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:20,000
Let them check you out, okay?

366
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,839
Be good, Hua.

367
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:25,599
If you think it's okay,

368
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,759
open your little hands, okay?

369
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,519
Hua, be good.

370
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:33,279
Come on.

371
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,640
Open your little hands.

372
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,960
Let Dr. Sun

373
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,680
give you a small checkup.

374
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,640
Okay?

375
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,480
Good girl.

376
00:20:07,552 --> 00:20:08,640
- Captain Du.
-You are here.

377
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,200
They're inside.

378
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Hua.

379
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:12,880
Dr. Sun went in too.

380
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,240
Are you good today?

381
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,599
They're doing a check.

382
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:21,559
Tu Xiaohua, let's do a checkup.

383
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,920
Who is she?

384
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
Xiaohua's mother.

385
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,000
Biological one.

386
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,000
You found her?

387
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,319
An illegal truck driver.

388
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,160
A couple of days ago,

389
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,720
the traffic police
caught illegal transporters.

390
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,920
She rammed the checkpoint
and was detained and just released.

391
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,640
Let's do a checkup.

392
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,559
Don't move.

393
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,640
No.

394
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,920
Come on.

395
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,279
- I am holding you.
- No.

396
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,519
No.

397
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:46,759
I am holding you.

398
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,599
This way.

399
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,759
Dr. Sun, how is she?

400
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,559
She has severe PTSD.

401
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,720
I don't recommend you go in now.

402
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,720
Has the arrest request been approved?

403
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,000
No.

404
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,920
Only two days are left.

405
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,240
We're running out of time.

406
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,079
You're telling me now
that it's not approved?

407
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,480
Should we pursue this case or not?

408
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,160
Lower your voice.

409
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,039
What's this? She just woke up.

410
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:35,720
Let go.

411
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,839
Calm down.

412
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,319
I know what I'm doing.

413
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,559
Let go.

414
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,680
Hello, sorry to disturb.

415
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm a prosecutor.

416
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm a police officer.

417
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,799
The thing is,

418
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:52,559
we are very sorry,

419
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
but we are running out of time.

420
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,799
So I'd like to ask Xiaohua
a few questions.

421
00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:58,400
Is that okay?

422
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,039
We really can't wait any longer.

423
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:06,720
Hua,

424
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,440
is it alright?

425
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:18,880
Xiaohua,

426
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,599
don't be afraid.

427
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,759
I'm here to help you.

428
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,799
I want to ask you something.

429
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,319
That day, your dad took you and Xiaohu

430
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,880
to the park together, right?

431
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,880
Before you got on the boat,

432
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,640
did you and Xiaohu

433
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,839
both wear a jacket

434
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,799
that could protect you?

435
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,400
Here is my question.

436
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,319
The safety buckles of the jackets

437
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
were fastened.

438
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,599
Why were they unfastened later?

439
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,920
It's okay, Xiaohua.

440
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,359
Take your time.

441
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,119
They were fastened at first, right?

442
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,720
Then they were unfastened.

443
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,559
Why is that?

444
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,039
I don't know why.

445
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,240
Can you tell me?

446
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,759
Do you still remember

447
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:38,119
how you fell into the water?

448
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:41,559
- Captain Du.
- I don't know. I don't know.

449
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,680
Leave.

450
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,400
I don't know.

451
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,519
Leave. Now!

452
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,119
I'm sorry.

453
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,720
Let's go.

454
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,839
I'm sorry.

455
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,079
What were you doing?

456
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,079
Why were you so hasty?

457
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm running out of time.

458
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,920
I'm running out of time.

459
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,000
What's the medicine you took?

460
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,000
To treat irritability?

461
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,400
I don't mind

462
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,599
your bad attitude towards me.

463
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:36,880
But when facing kids,

464
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
we need to take it slow.

465
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,440
Especially kids with such experiences.

466
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,839
Fear can trigger stress responses.

467
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,960
I don't want you in my car. Get off.

468
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,119
Wait, how about
we analyze the situation again?

469
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,680
Let's pool our ideas.

470
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,599
I just feel that you are impatient

471
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,599
with kids.

472
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,839
Isn't our ultimate goal

473
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:59,160
to protect the kids?

474
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,200
You can't scare each kid
one by one, right?

475
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,319
Move! The car ahead!

476
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:25,079
Why are you back here?

477
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,119
I'm working overtime.

478
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:26,640
What?

479
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,839
I need to work.

480
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:28,920
You've been busy all day.

481
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,000
Go back and rest.

482
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,680
I don't have time to rest.

483
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,920
Bai Enyu,

484
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,440
are you cleaning the windows?

485
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:19,680
Ma'am,

486
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
you're still here?

487
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,039
Come in quickly.

488
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,640
Sit.

489
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,119
You've done well these days.

490
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,920
It's my job.

491
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,400
You're not used to it, are you?

492
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,880
Not really.

493
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,880
It's just that compared to the work
at the Juvenile Correctional Facility,

494
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,839
I've seen

495
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,359
more heartbreaking things.

496
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,799
I mean, with Prosecutor Lin.

497
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,279
Do you have any conflicts?

498
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,079
No.

499
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,160
Not at all.

500
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,559
Well,

501
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,119
please don't misunderstand.

502
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:10,599
I'm not here to tattle.

503
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm feeling very energetic right now.

504
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,440
But I don't know how to use it.

505
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,960
I want to share her burden of Xiaohua

506
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,000
and Xiaohu's case.

507
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,200
But I don't know how.

508
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,119
It has only made things
more complicated.

509
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,559
No need to overthink it.

510
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,000
It has nothing to do with you.

511
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,319
Let's give Prosecutor Lin some time.

512
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,599
She went through
what those two kids went through.

513
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,000
Is this the place?

514
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,240
Hello.

515
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,920
Hello.

516
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,759
I'm a prosecutor
from the mobile procuratorate station

517
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,480
of Linwan Village.

518
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,640
My name is Zheng Yanlai.

519
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,160
Are you Zhitao's mother?

520
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,519
Yes, I am.

521
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,039
And Mr. Lin...

522
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,759
Mr. Lin is resting.

523
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,839
Wait a moment. I'll go call him.

524
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,079
Hurry. Someone
from the government is here.

525
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,559
Get up.

526
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Mr. Lin,

527
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm a prosecutor from
the mobile procuratorate station

528
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,039
of Linwan Village.

529
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:15,960
I'm Zheng Yanlai.

530
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,759
Your daughter reported some issues.

531
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,839
If there are any problems,

532
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,160
let's not resort to violence.

533
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:25,000
Don't be violent with your wife either.

534
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:27,360
Come here.

535
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,000
Domestic violence is illegal.

536
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,359
Can't you sit down
and talk calmly about whatever it is?

537
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,680
Why must you resort to violence?

538
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,880
They're my family.

539
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,559
What does it have to do with you?

540
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,079
If you keep doing this,

541
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,559
I can report you to the police.

542
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,240
What are you doing?

543
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,799
Move!

544
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:48,839
Move!

545
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,279
You...

546
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:52,400
Stop it.

547
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,440
If you continue,

548
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,912
I'll report it to the police.

549
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,039
Let me go.

550
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,039
Village Chief,
I didn't do anything wrong.

551
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,359
Help, Village Chief.

552
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,640
Disperse.

553
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,680
You can't take him away.

554
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,039
How can his family live without him?

555
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,079
You can't take him away.

556
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:07,920
Tell the police

557
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,839
he didn't hit you.

558
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,200
You fell down by yourself.

559
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,599
Her dad didn't hit her.

560
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,920
He did nothing wrong.

561
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,519
Why are you arresting him?

562
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,200
Zhengfeng.

563
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,799
Ma'am,

564
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,599
please calm down.

565
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,240
Can you help me?

566
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:23,119
Help me.

567
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,559
He can't go to jail.

568
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:26,528
(Article about Little Tao's situation)

569
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,279
Come in.

570
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,400
Why didn't you go home?

571
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,759
My mom has been crying all day.

572
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,920
Now she scolds me whenever she sees me.

573
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,519
Take a seat.

574
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:57,519
Do you blame me?

575
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,279
You did the right thing.

576
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,599
Here, look.

577
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,079
(Little Tao)
Who is this?

578
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,119
Little Tao.

579
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,599
Is it me?

580
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,319
It's the brave Little Tao.

581
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,480
I'm writing this into an article

582
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,400
to let more girls
like you be courageous.

583
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,480
I will become braver.

584
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,720
If he dares to hit me again,

585
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,599
I'll beat him.

586
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,359
No.

587
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,559
You need to learn to use this

588
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,480
to protect your younger brother

589
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,519
and yourself.

590
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:37,759
When you grow up,

591
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,400
you can also use it
to protect more people.

592
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,279
I shouldn't have said this.

593
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,839
But...

594
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
Actually, I also want
to help Prosecutor Lin.

595
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,759
But I don't know where to start.

596
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,359
She always gives the impression

597
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,319
that she can solve all the problems

598
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,920
and overcome all the hurdles.

599
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,480
I will do my best to help her.

600
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,720
Rest assured, ma'am.

601
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,200
Our department

602
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,039
is different from other departments.

603
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,839
Sometimes,

604
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,480
there will be a conflict

605
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,920
between pursuing the truth

606
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,079
and protecting minors.

607
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,319
At such times, you'll need

608
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,359
to make a choice between those two.

609
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,279
What do you plan to do?

610
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:41,960
I must find

611
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,359
a case where he can be convicted
without direct evidence.

612
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,240
In this area, you're better than me.

613
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,400
But when it comes to the kids,

614
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,759
I'm better.

615
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,000
Just say what you want to say.

616
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,000
I know you feel upset.

617
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,880
I feel the same.

618
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,880
I also know you're anxious.

619
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,400
And I know why.

620
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,119
Now Yang Huihui's testimony
is unreliable

621
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,319
because she always lies.

622
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,480
And the experiment

623
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,559
was just

624
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,440
the simulated one.

625
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,839
The only breakthrough

626
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,359
is Xiaohua.

627
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,160
But she has just woken up.

628
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,680
Her current state is not...

629
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,599
I know.

630
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,839
I know very well.

631
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,880
Every time I pressed her for answers,

632
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,000
I knew

633
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,160
it was making her remember

634
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,799
the time her father tried to kill her.

635
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,839
Seeing her like that,

636
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,079
I felt like I was no different

637
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:41,440
from a criminal.

638
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,880
You used to work in major crimes.

639
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,079
Truth is the top priority.

640
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,519
But now we handle cases related to kids.

641
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,000
Sometimes,

642
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
we must make the kids

643
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,079
the top priority.

644
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:11,200
I'll go to the hospital again tomorrow.

645
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
Will you continue asking?

646
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,319
No, I'll just go see her.

647
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,839
Let me help you.

648
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,839
(Inpatient Department
of the First Building)

649
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,480
This is the blue sky.

650
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,039
Let's draw some small trees as well.

651
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,480
You go ahead. I'll step out for a while.

652
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:02,119
(General Ward)

653
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,359
Hello, Xiaohua's mom.

654
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:05,000
Why are you here again?

655
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,880
Our last inquiry

656
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,239
brought secondary harm to Xiaohua.

657
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,800
We want to apologize to you.

658
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,159
As long as she is well,

659
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,960
the truth is not important

660
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:21,800
to me.

661
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,079
Don't worry.

662
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:25,840
We won't bother Xiaohua again.

663
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,639
We

664
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,400
have something to ask you.

665
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,400
Is that okay?

666
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,559
Do you suspect Tu Huaiwei?

667
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,119
He and I

668
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,760
met in the factory.

669
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,880
I was young and naive back then.

670
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,440
He was good at

671
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,679
coaxing me.

672
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,159
We somehow ended up
having Xiaohua and Xiaohu.

673
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,679
I hadn't even met his parents

674
00:34:58,679 --> 00:34:59,760
before marrying him.

675
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,519
I knew it wouldn't work.

676
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,519
Because everyone said he was too lazy,

677
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,440
and he just muddled through each day.

678
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,639
But back then I thought,

679
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,719
since we already had kids,

680
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,639
he would change

681
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,800
and become better.

682
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,280
However,

683
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,000
nothing changed.

684
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,480
I took care of everything inside

685
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,880
and outside the house.

686
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,480
Every day, he just asked me for money.

687
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,039
I had no money for him.

688
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,440
So he borrowed money from others

689
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:36,880
and forced me to repay it for him.

690
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,960
I really couldn't stand it anymore.

691
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,840
So I separated from him.

692
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,039
We agreed that the kids would be with me

693
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,280
and he'd provide child support.

694
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,880
But he never gave me a single cent.

695
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,639
I had no choice.

696
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,840
I ran out of money.

697
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,480
The kids grew older,

698
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,760
and there were more expenses.

699
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,039
I heard others say

700
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,119
being an illegal truck driver
could earn money faster.

701
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280
So I did it.

702
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:58,960
As you know,

703
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,880
driving a truck
made caring for kids hard.

704
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,920
And no one in my family
could help with the kids.

705
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,199
So I left the kids with him.

706
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,840
Then,

707
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,199
he started asking me for child support.

708
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,960
He asked for more and more.

709
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,199
Not long ago, I was caught.

710
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,199
When I got released,

711
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,519
they told me something

712
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,239
happened to my kids.

713
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,079
This might be abrupt.

714
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,639
But has Tu Huaiwei
ever hit you or the kids?

715
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,599
How is Tu Huaiwei's swimming ability?

716
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:03,880
Can he swim?

717
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,000
He's from a fishing village.

718
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,119
So of course, he can swim.

719
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,440
There was another witness at the scene,

720
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,800
the owner of the boat.

721
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,199
He said that before he arrived,

722
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,000
he did see

723
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,639
Tu Huaiwei attempting a rescue.

724
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,119
But perhaps his swimming skills
were not good,

725
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,000
as he was seen struggling in the water

726
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,039
and almost drowning.

727
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,559
Are you Tu Xiaohua's family?

728
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,320
It's time to pay.

729
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,440
It's delayed for two days.

730
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:56,639
I'll do it.

731
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,559
No need.

732
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,848
Alright.

733
00:37:58,848 --> 00:38:00,544
- Come on.
- Let's not fight over it here.

734
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,079
It's a hospital. No need. Take mine.

735
00:38:03,392 --> 00:38:04,679
What are the charges for bed 37?

736
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:05,920
Okay.

737
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,960
The fee was just paid in full.

738
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,199
Who paid it?

739
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,639
It seems it was an old lady.

740
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,159
She gave some small change.

741
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,519
She just left.

742
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,480
Where did she go?

743
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,079
Seems like that way.

744
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,400
Okay.

745
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,079
Thank you.

746
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:24,992
(Drinking Water Area)

747
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,280
Ma'am.

748
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:52,880
Ma'am,

749
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,639
you paid for Xiaohua's
medical expenses, right?

750
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,440
Ma'am, just tell the truth.

751
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,840
We all care about Xiaohua's well-being.

752
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,400
Last time you told me,
