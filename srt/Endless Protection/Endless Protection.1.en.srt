Turn around.

Well...

43
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,919
Has his case been brought here?

44
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:09,840
We forwarded it

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
to the responsible department.

46
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,520
It's out of our control.

Look, it's very severe.

52
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,839

Listen,

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,279
Wenxuan was a really good kid.

Those three kids are villains.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,120
They deserve death.

57
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,879
The district
can't sentence them to death.

58
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,199
Only you people can do that.

59
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,240

we have no jurisdiction over it.

87
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,680
It's so infuriating.

88
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,680
Isn't there anyone handling it?

89

Aren't we handling it now?

90
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,199
I don't think we can handle it.

This case is really tricky.

the suspects' behavior

98
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,480
and the victim's death

99
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,759
have no causal connection,

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,480
and the suspects are minors,

101
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,480
so it's not suitable to prosecute.

102
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,480

made it hard for him at school

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
and always bullied him.

193
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,200
(Defense Attorney)
He wanted us to stand up for him.

194
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,919
So we took Zhang Wenxuan

195
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,759
from the school gate
to the unfinished building.

196
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:28,896
(Joyfully Welcome
the International Labor Day)

197
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,320
Zhang Wenxuan.

198
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,279
I-It was me who called them

199
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,159
to help me teach Zhang Wenxuan a lesson.

200
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,080
I...

201
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,799
I-I just wanted to scare him a bit.

202
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,240
I never expected he would...

203
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,759
According to
the victim's autopsy report,

204
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,600
apart from the skull fracture
caused by falling from a height,

205
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,320
which resulted in intracranial
hemorrhage that caused death,

206
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,600
we also found

207
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,559
(The victim's autopsy report confirmed)
the ninth and tenth ribs

208
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,799
(he suffered serious external force trauma)
of the victim's left chest fractured,

209
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:16,519
and his body
had multiple soft tissue bruises.

210
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,159
(Fracture of the ninth and tenth ribs
of the victim's left chest)

211
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,000
(Multiple soft tissue bruises)
It can prove

212
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,919
that before the victim fell,

213
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,240
he had suffered
serious external force trauma.

214
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,240
(Judge, Chief Judge, Judge)

215
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
Defendant Huang Jiawang,

216
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,840
is this what you called

217
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,879
"a few curses and a few hits"?

218
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The defendant has never denied

219
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,799
that there was violent behavior

220
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,279
against the victim before he died.

221
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,600
However,

222
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,240
the victim died

223
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,679
due to intracranial hemorrhage

224
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,519
caused by falling from a height.

225
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,360
Let me put it this way.

226
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,960
Just now, the prosecutor

227
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,919
hit me twice in the corridor.

228
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,120
I became so angry after I got home

229
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
that I broke down

230
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,440
and jumped the building.

231
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,559
At that moment,

232
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,120
can we charge the prosecutor

233
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,519
with the crime of intentional homicide?

234
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,440
What I mean is that

235
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,919
the result of death

236
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,600
was not directly caused by the harm.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,919
This does not constitute causation
in criminal law.

238
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,840
Therefore, we insist that

239
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,600
the prosecutor's charge
of intentional homicide

240
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,399
is unfounded.

241
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,200
Chief Judge,

242
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,279
we apply to present

243
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,039
the first group of video evidence.

244
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,559
Please present the video evidence.

245
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,399
Hold him down.

246
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,608
Don't move.

247
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:41,360
Don't move.

248
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,176
How is it?

249
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,712
- Don't move.
- Do you like it?

250
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:46,480
You like this, right?

251
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,639
Drink up.

252
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,480
Drink.

253
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Look at his face.

254
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:51,720
What's wrong?

255
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,440
What's wrong?

256
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,799
I'm giving you some holy water.

257
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,480
Drink it.

258
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,879
Hold on.

259
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,399
You want more, huh?

260
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,600
I have no more.

261
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,919
Bro. Bro.

262
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,399
Just stop.

263
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,000
He can't take it.
It'll go wrong if you go on.

264
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,879
What?

265
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,360
He can't take it anymore. He...

266
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,519
It'll go wrong if you go on.

267
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,200
Shut up.

268
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,679
It'll go wrong?

269
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,720
What do you mean by that?

270
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,000
Answer me.

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,080
Didn't you ask me to come?

272
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,279
Didn't you ask me to come?

273
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,159
Listen.

274
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:35,720
Since

275
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,879
I came today,

276
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,000
I have to have enough fun.

277
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,080
If you spoil the fun,

278
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,919
I'll kill you.

279
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,080
- Alright?
- Bro.

280
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,488
- Didn't you ask me here?
- Li Hui didn't mean it that way.

281
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,840
Are you going to jump?

282
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,480
Zhang Wenxuan,

283
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,559
what are you doing?

284
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:55,759
You want to jump?

285
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:56,679
Well.

286
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,759
Do you dare to jump?

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,799
Do you dare?

288
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,840
Will you jump?

289
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,399
I'm waiting.

290
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,440
Are you bluffing?

291
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,639
He wouldn't dare to jump at all.

292
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,679
Come on, jump.

293
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,159
Just jump.

294
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm recording this for you.

295
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,039
Jump, will you?

296
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,120
This video

297
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,320
was found in the defendant
Chen Xiaobin's phone

298
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,519
through phone data recovery.

299
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,279
It was recorded before the victim fell.

300
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,159
Defendant Huang Jiawang,

301
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,679
did you record this video?

302
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,879
Yes.

303
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,679
But it has nothing to do
with me that he jumped.

304
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,840
In the video, you said to the victim,

305
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,600
"Jump, and I'll let you go."

306
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,039
What did you mean by that?

307
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,120
What did I mean?

308
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,240
I was just trying to scare him.
That's all.

309
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,960
I knew he wouldn't dare to jump.

310
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,639
Wait, why are you staring at me?

311
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:55,639
Would you dare to jump?

312
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:56,440
It was so high.

313
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,200
He didn't dare to jump
after several glances.

314
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,759
Please let me go, I beg you.

315
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,679
Let you go?

316
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
Jump, and I'll let you go.

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,879
Come on, let me record this for you.

318
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,240
You'll go viral if I post this.

319
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,200
I'm telling you.

320
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,399
Don't push me.

321
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,600
Don't push you?

322
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,039
I'll soon put the video

323
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:19,120
of me peeing on your face

324
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,919
online

325
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,440
for more people to see.

326
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:22,960
Your family,

327
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,399
your widowed mother,

328
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,480
and your classmates.

329
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
I'll send it to them all

330
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,080
to have a good look.

331
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:31,399
Will you jump?

332
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,840
Coward.

333
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,480
But the fact is, he jumped,

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,799
didn't he?

335
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:49,759
How would I know?

336
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,559
We noticed

337
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,559
you said three sentences in the video.

338
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,799
Every sentence

339
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,240
was to coerce the victim

340
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:00,799
to jump from a height.

341
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,879
You said,

342
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,720
"Just jump.

343
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,079
I'm recording this for you."

344
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,319
You said,

345
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,599
"Jump, and I'll let you go."

346
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,119
You said,

347
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:12,519
"Will you jump? I'm waiting."

348
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,000
The outcome

349
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,039
was that the victim jumped down.

350
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,759
You think all of this
has nothing to do with you,

351
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,519
right?

352
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,160
Objection.

353
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,200
The prosecutor is leading the witness.

354
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,319
The focus of controversy in this case

355
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,519
is whether there is

356
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,880
a legal causality

357
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,839
between the victim's jump
and the actions of the defendants

358
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:32,519
and

359
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,319
the defendants' subjective intent.

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,400
My earlier questions

361
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,079
aim to prove this issue.

362
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,839
Objection overruled.

363
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,960
Defendant, answer the question.

364
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,359
I don't know.

365
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,720
He...

366
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:50,200
What if he just didn't want
to live anymore?

367
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,039
He wanted to die,

368
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,039
so he killed himself.

369
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,799
Then why do you have to blame me?

370
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,000
Huang Jiawang,

371
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,599
you just said

372
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,559
he looked downstairs several times
but didn't dare to jump.

373
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,359
And now you say

374
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,079
he wanted to kill himself.

375
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:07,880
Which one is your real thought
at the time?

376
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,160
Answer me.

377
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:36,720
Bro.

378
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,039
W-What to do?

379
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,519
What to do?

380
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,000
He won't be dead, right?

381
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,680
He really jumped.

382
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,160
He really jumped.

383
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
He really jumped.

384
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:50,920
What?

385
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
Why looking at me?

386
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,200
Did I make him jump?

387
00:18:57,759 --> 00:18:58,759
Did I push him?

388
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,519
Did I push him?

389
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,680
Did I push him?

390
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,680
Tell me, did I push him?

391
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,799
Did I push?

392
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,559
He jumped on his own. Did I push?

393
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Did I push him?

394
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,039
Listen to me.

395
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,799
Don't put on an act here.

396
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,279
No need for you to be scared.

397
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,079
Listen to me.

398
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,440
Now that he's dead,

399
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,839
you're doomed.

400
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,400
Didn't you ask me here?

401
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,839
Didn't you want me to help you?

402
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,240
Didn't you want me to help you?

403
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,240
What's this?

404
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,799
What are you doing?

405
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,920
Are you waiting for someone
to come and find you?

406
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,559
Are you leaving or not?

407
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Back at the scene,

408
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,319
Zhang Wenxuan
had clear cognitive ability

409
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:52,240
and self-control ability

410
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,799
towards his behavior.

411
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
As you can see in the video,

412
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:57,559
when he fell,

413
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:59,000
there was no external force.

414
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,359
It was a suicidal behavior.

415
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,279
Even if my client

416
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,279
was reckless about his words,

417
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,799
it can't be concluded

418
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,759
that he hoped the victim

419
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,559
would have the possibility of death.

420
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,960
In the video,

421
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,960
Zhang Wenxuan clearly stated,

422
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,680
as I quote,

423
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,599
"If you come closer, I will jump."

424
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,720
This indicates
that if no one forced him,

425
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,799
he would not have jumped.

426
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,839
It was because the defendant

427
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,039
repeatedly coerced,

428
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,279
humiliated, insulted,
and beat Zhang Wenxuan

429
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:34,880
that he could not bear the humiliation

430
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,279
and jumped from the building.

431
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,880
Therefore,

432
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
Zhang Wenxuan's jumping

433
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,720
and the defendants' actions

434
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,599
have a legal causality.

435
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,680
Chief Judge,

436
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:47,599
three defendants

437
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,079
are all minors under 16 years old.

438
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,720
At this age,

439
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
their minds are generally immature,

440
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,839
and they don't have a complete awareness
of their actions.

441
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,960
Because they are all still kids.

442
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,759
The victim was also a kid.

443
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,279
Defense attorney,

444
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,880
you just said the defendants' minds
are immature.

445
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,000
You also said the victim
had clear cognitive ability

446
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,400
towards his behavior.

447
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,759
For people of the same age,

448
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,640
can different standards be used

449
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
to judge them?

450
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,359
When it happened,

451
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,680
both the defendants and the victim
were 15 years old.

452
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,839
At such an age,

453
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,000
they were aware of

454
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,680
the result of jumping

455
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,440
from such a height.

456
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,960
However, one side could not avoid it,

457
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,559
while the other side
knew but did not stop.

458
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,480
Even an adult

459
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,039
would find it hard

460
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,519
to endure such humiliation and torture
in such circumstances.

461
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,400
More so a minor.

462
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,680
Therefore, the victim's jumping

463
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,799
has a causality in criminal law

464
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,960
with a series of actions
taken by the defendants.

465
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,240
The defendants
bear criminal responsibility

466
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,559
for the victim's death.

467
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:54,759
Even if my client

468
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,519
has rationally realized

469
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,240
the victim
may have the consequence of death,

470
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,839
he at most bears negligence

471
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,880
for the result.

472
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,119
Article 17 of the Criminal Law

473
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:08,119
stipulates that minors
under the age of 16

474
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,319
bear no criminal responsibility
when causing death

475
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:11,960
due to negligence.

476
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:12,920
Of course,

477
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,279
out of humanitarian concern,

478
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,920
the defendants' families

479
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,160
are willing to pay the victim's family

480
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,839
a one-time compensation of 200,000 yuan

481
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,039
to show comfort and concern.

482
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,000
A life for a life!

483
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,640
Calm down.

484
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,680
Death penalty for them.

485
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,240
Calm down.

486
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,480
Death penalty for them. I want no money.

487
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,160
A life for a life!

488
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,000
Death penalty for them.

489
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:34,839
Silence!

490
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:36,039
Death penalty for them.

491
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,599
Order.

492
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,279
Defense Attorney,

493
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,920
pay attention to your speech.

494
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,759
The victim's family

495
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,119
did not mention

496
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:47,519
incidental civil action.

497
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,400
The issue of civil compensation

498
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,960
is not within the scope
of this case at present.

499
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,119
Okay.

500
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,359
I acknowledge authenticity and legality,

501
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,000
but not relevance and purpose of proof.

502
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:01,799
My reason

503
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
is the same
as the first defendant's defender's.

504
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,000
Over.

505
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,680
Say a few more words.

506
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,400
Xiaobin was not the leader.

507
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:12,880
Chief Judge,

508
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,319
we request
to present the next set of evidence.

509
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:21,568
(Defendants escaping
the unfinished building)

510
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,480
It's the surveillance footage

511
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,680
outside the construction site

512
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,200
at 18:58 on the day of the incident.

513
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:31,240
It shows three defendants
escaping the unfinished building.

514
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,559
According to the time code

515
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,400
on defendant Chen Xiaobin's
mobile phone video,

516
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,440
the victim fell at 18:50.

517
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,000
The two videos
are only a few minutes apart.

518
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,240
After it, the defendant

519
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,240
did not provide timely assistance
to the victim

520
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,759
but chose to flee immediately.

521
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,400
Regarding the consequences
of whether the victim died,

522
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,519
the defendants adopted
a completely indifferent attitude.

523
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:56,960
This can also prove
their subjective intent.

524
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,400
He fell from such a height.

525
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,839
Who would dare to look?

526
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
I was scared too.

527
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,839
These are Defendant Li Hui's

528
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,240
mobile phone call records
at the time of the incident.

529
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,039
At 18:52,

530
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,920
he once called an ambulance,

531
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,839
but the call was hung up

532
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,359
before getting through.

533
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,680
Defendant Li Hui,

534
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,599
why did you
hang up the call at that time?

535
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,839
Chief Judge,

536
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,480
when Li Hui was being questioned,

537
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,839
he might have been interrupted.

538
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,079
We suggest removing
the other defendants from the courtroom

539
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,240
and questioning Li Hui alone.

540
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,839
Bailiff, remove defendants
Huang Jiawang and Chen Xiaobin

541
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,880
from the courtroom.

542
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,079
Defendant Li Hui,

543
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,559
your call records show

544
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,640
at 20:26,

545
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,000
you called an ambulance anyway.

546
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:12,519
I...

547
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,480
I-I wanted to make a call at first.

548
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:17,279
But...

549
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,559
but we saw that he was no longer moving,

550
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,519
so I didn't call.

551
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,279
Did you call an ambulance

552
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:26,240
as you thought

553
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,279
the victim might still have a chance
to be rescued at that time?

554
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,759
Or

555
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,720
did you want to rescue him?

556
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,559
Is that so?

557
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:39,880
I want to remind you, Li Hui,

558
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,160
Zhang Wenxuan is your classmate

559
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,240
who you shared a desk with
for three years.

560
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,079
So

561
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,519
tell me what you saw.

562
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:57,960
Objection.

563
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
This is a speculative question.

564
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,079
Chief Judge,

565
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,200
Li Hui's act of calling an ambulance

566
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,000
is an attempt to rescue.

567
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,960
He was still alive.

568
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,839
He was still alive.

569
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,599
What are you doing?

570
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:18,359
What are you doing?

571
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,240
Why called an ambulance?

572
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,240
He's still alive.

573
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,079
He's still moving. He's still moving.

574
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,720
Scram.

575
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,119
Are you messing with me?

576
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:27,680
Come over here.

577
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,640
I...

578
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,920
Are you messing with me?

579
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,400
Bro.

580
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,480
Are you messing with me?

581
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,799
Hurry and leave, bro.

582
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,440
Move aside.

583
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,440
Stop hitting me.

584
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:40,680
Stop hitting.

585
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,640
Come.

586
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,519
Bro.

587
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,440
Bro.

588
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,480
He's still moving.

589
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,240
He can be saved.

590
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,359
D-Don't let him die.

591
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:01,559
Don't.

592
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,200
It's okay.

593
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,079
It's only right if he dies.

594
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,160
Or he'll be disabled.

595
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
What if he survives

596
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,720
and becomes disabled?

597
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
You and your

598
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,039
pauper dad

599
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,319
won't afford compensation at all.

600
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,440
Can you afford it?

601
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,759
Don't cry. Fear not.

602
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,039
I won't hit you anymore.

603
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,000
I was wrong.

604
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,079
Here.

605
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,279
Trust me.

606
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,160
Just keep quiet.

607
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,400
It's okay.

608
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,839
Alright?

609
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,880
Alright?

610
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,759
It's okay.

611
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,720
It's really okay.

612
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,359
Don't be afraid.

613
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:40,799
Let's go.

614
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,119
Let's go.

615
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,119
Let's go.

616
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,000
Let's go.

617
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:46,960
Let's go.

618
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,359
It's okay.

619
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,920
Let's go. Hurry.

620
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,519
After forcing the victim

621
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:21,559
to jump off the building,

622
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,480
the three defendants

623
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,920
didn't take any rescue measures

624
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,119
but instead left him alone

625
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:28,720
in an almost deserted,
unfinished building.

626
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,480
In fact, at that time,

627
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,279
only the three of them

628
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,119
could possibly rescue the victim.

629
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,960
But they did nothing.

630
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,440
All this can prove

631
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,640
the defendants

632
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,559
had subjective intent
towards the victim's death.

633
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,200
This is a typical case
of intentional homicide.

634
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:54,680
I...

635
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,480
I really didn't expect that.

636
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,119
I...

637
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,920
I really didn't expect he would die.

638
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,200
Li Hui,

639
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,319
I have one last question for you.

640
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,440
Why did you want to beat Zhang Wenxuan?

641
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,079
Because he was

642
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
the health committee member
of the class.

643
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,000
I skipped duty,

644
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:21,839
and he noted me down.

645
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:22,880
I...

646
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,720
The teacher

647
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,319
punished me to do duty for a week.

648
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
Can you see this?

649
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:35,039
This is the duty schedule Zhang Wenxuan
gave to the teacher.

650
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,640
(Class duty schedule)
On this,

651
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,000
except for his own name,

652
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,720
he didn't write anyone else's name.

653
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:43,519
No?

654
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:44,960
In the investigation,

655
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,359
we verified through the school

656
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,240
that as the health committee member,

657
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,359
Zhang Wenxuan
never recorded anyone's name.

658
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,240
He never informed the teacher

659
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,519
about any of the students

660
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,920
who skipped duty.

661
00:30:57,559 --> 00:30:58,960
In fact, it's more than that.

662
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,519
After school,

663
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,000
he'd also help other students
make up for their duty.

664
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,160
Skipping duty was your own doing.

665
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,279
Punishing you would be
the teacher's fair handling.

666
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,880
As your classmate, Zhang Wenxuan

667
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,119
had always been helping you.

668
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,599
And what about you?

669
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,039
How did you repay him?

670
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,759
Impossible.

671
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,920
Huang Jiawang and Chen Xiaobin

672
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,200
had no grudge against Zhang Wenxuan.

673
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,680
They beat him

674
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,359
not to seek justice for you,

675
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,799
but because they thought
Zhang Wenxuan was an easy target.

676
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,279
I'm sorry.

677
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,440
I'm sorry.

678
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,720
(Yunhai Intermediate People's Court)

679
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,759
According to Article 232
of the Criminal Law

680
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,440
of the People's Republic of China,

681
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,519
intentional homicide

682
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:06,440
is punishable by death,
life imprisonment,

683
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,512
or fixed-term imprisonment
of more than ten years.

684
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,799
For less serious cases,

685
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,359
fixed-term imprisonment
of three to ten years is imposed.

686
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:13,440
Meanwhile,

687
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,519
Clause 3 of Article 17
of our country's Criminal Law stipulates

688
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,200
when minors over 14

689
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,519
and under 18 commit a crime,

690
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,480
they should be given a lighter
or mitigated punishment.

691
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,440
As the three defendants are under 18,

692
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,680
in accordance

693
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,119
with Article 266
of the Criminal Procedure Law

694
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,599
of the People's Republic of China,

695
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,839
the policy of education, reform,

696
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,839
and salvation for juvenile offenders
should be implemented

697
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,680
with a focus on education

698
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,279
and supplemented by punishment.

699
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,960
Based on the facts, evidence,

700
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,519
and other factors of this case,

701
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,960
we suggest the following sentencing

702
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,920
of the three defendants:

703
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,200
the defendant Huang Jiawang

704
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,279
shall have eight years of imprisonment.

705
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,359
The defendant Chen Xiaobin

706
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,319
shall have six years of imprisonment.

707
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,440
The defendant Li Hui

708
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,839
shall have five years
of fixed-term imprisonment.

709
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,720
People's Procuratorate of Yunhai.

710
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:09,880
Adjourned.

711
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,920
Son, don't be afraid.

712
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,720
Eight years will pass quickly.

713
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:17,759
It's okay.

714
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:20,000
Eat well. I'll wait for you.

715
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,319
Eat well inside there.

716
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:23,759
Stop!

717
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:25,160
I'm going to kill you.

718
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,319
I'll kill you.

719
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:26,640
Let go.

720
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,079
I'll kill you.

721
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,559
Let go. Calm down.

722
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,039
I'll kill you.

723
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,519
I'll kill you.

724
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,160
Move.

725
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:33,920
Calm down.

726
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:37,960
Why?

727
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,000
Why not the death penalty?

728
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,720
Why not the death penalty?

729
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,079
Lin Zhitao,

730
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:46,799
you promised me.

731
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:49,079
You promised to help me.

732
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,880
Why? Why not the death penalty?

733
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:54,640
Why not the death penalty?

736
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,000
Congratulations.

737
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,039
I've talked to the families.

738
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,480
They will not appeal.

739
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,400
You should report to your boss.

740
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,320
Not to me.

741
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,280
Not even a word of thanks?

742
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,559
For what?

743
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,840
For your act

744
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,119
when knowing they wouldn't

745
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,079
be heavily sentenced?

746
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,199
For your playing innocent?

747
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,760
You are a lawyer.

748

so we have different stances.

Happy Qixi Festival in advance.

00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,576
- Zhitao.
- Long time no see.

- I have no umbrella.
