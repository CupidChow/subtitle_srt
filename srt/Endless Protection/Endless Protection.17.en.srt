(Yuedong Province Yunhai Procuratorate,
Lin Zhitao, Bai Enyu, Cheng Wei)

3
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,199
The influence of education bureau

4
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,560
is particularly substantial.

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,000
The scope of mandatory reporting
is expanding.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,159
Indeed.

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,799
And there's the health bureau.

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,280
It is cooperating too?

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,000
Right.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,719
Our next step is

11
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,200
to oversee all hotels in the city.

12
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,119
Okay.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,399
You can think it.

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,640
Kids spend five days a week in school.

15
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,719
Wouldn't teachers

16
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,399
- spot any issues first?
- Yes.

17
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,119
Our next step is to make sure...

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,439
Good morning, Ma'am.

19
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,560
Zhitao!

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,479
You've finally returned.

21
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,200
I didn't die.

22
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,759
- You look.
- You're so thin.

23
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,479
You're skin and bones!

24
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,400
It's alright.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,040
You look...

26
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:08,439
Are you the dumpling skin?

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,640
Trying to stuff us?

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,920
Quick, let go.

29
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh my God.

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,760
Bai,

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
quickly let go!

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,239
You're affecting our style.

33
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,040
Really.

34
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,400
Take a look at your office.

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,040
- It's my own private office.
- Right.

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,239
You have your own office now.

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,480
Sit here and feel it.

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,359
It feels like I've been promoted.

39
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:30,959
Where are you two?

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,680
I'm over there.

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,359
We are face-to-face.

42
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:35,680
You should get a little stool

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,799
and sit here as a doorman.

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,879
What else?

45
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,680
A cup of coffee?

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,560
Come on, everything, like spicy chicken.

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,640
Four dishes and a soup.

48
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,480
Very good, perfect.

49
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,959
Zhitao, look.

50
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,079
This is the exclusive counseling room
for juvenile prosecution.

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,719
All these toys

52
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,519
were taken by Bai from his wife.

53
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,200
You're welcome.

54
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,879
Your family is pretty...

55
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,199
Good.

56
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,840
Very good.

57
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,759
Pretty good.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
Zhitao, how about this room?

59
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,439
Inquiry room.

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,400
See this?

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,479
One-way glass.

62
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,919
There's another room.

63
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,960
From here you can see there.

64
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,520
For example,

65
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,680
during questioning,

66
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,759
when we need a guardian around,

67
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,319
but

68
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,840
we're afraid they'll affect the kid,

69
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,400
they can

70
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,599
stay in here.

71
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:41,919

are you hungry?

78
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,879
Good Writing.

Come on.

80
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,279

it's time to eat.

Come on, let's eat.

93
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,680
And this soup.

94
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,800
It's especially delicious.

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Fine, I'll cut it.

114
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,920
Kids are all curious.

115
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,639
My brother was like that too.

116
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,560
Because of curiosity,

117
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,639
he even got hit

118
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,480
by my alcoholic dad.

120

But now, it's fine.

121
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,879
He has been sent to the welfare home.

122
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,360
He'll be fine.

123
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,480
The state can protect him.

124
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,240
Here.

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,240

126
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,439
there is a fork.

127
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,959
Use it.

128
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,800
Does being in a welfare home

129
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,800
mean he'll be protected by the state?

130
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,800
Of course.

131
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,519
What are you thinking? Enjoy it.

132
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,559
This meat is said to be delicious.

133
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,759
I haven't ordered it.

134
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,480
Try it.

135
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,279
Delicious.

136
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:54,879
Which one?

137
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,279
Is the meat delicious or the cake?

138
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,159
Go! Go!

I suspect she might have been raped.

Didn't she get her period?

but vaginal injury

No, that's impossible.

193

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,720
is not yet fourteen years old.

197
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,440
Whether she was willing or not,

198
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,679
the one violating her

199
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,919
is guilty of rape.

200
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,960
Can you investigate further?

201
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,679
This is...

202
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,080
Impossible.

203
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,840
Jiayi, don't be afraid.

204
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
Don't be nervous.

205
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,759
We are all here to help you.

206
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,120
Please answer me a few questions.

207
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
If you can remember,

208
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,480
answer us truthfully.

209
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,919
If

210
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,159
you forget,

211
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,120
just tell us.

212
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:16,720
Take it easy.

213
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,480
It's alright.

214
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,759
Can you tell me

215
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:24,120
what you have been doing?

216
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,759
Go to school,

217
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,879
eat,

218
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,320
finish school,

219
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,279
go home and sleep.

220
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,639
Do you still remember

221
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,639
how you got hurt at that time?

222
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:36,320
I was running.

223
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,879
While running, I began to bleed.

224
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,159
Before running...

225
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,240
Just tell us

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,960
which boy did you go out with?

227
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,360
I didn't mess around with anyone.

228
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,159
Those who hang out with you

229
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,120
- are all unbecoming.
- Ms. Cui.

230
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,399
They are all my friends.

231
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,600
- We're inquiring.
- Cui Jiayi,

232
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,360
you are like this,

233
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,639
and you still argue with me?

234
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,679
Can you...?

235
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,679
Can't you be obedient?

236
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,519
Ms. Cui,

237
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,000
we are inquiring right now.

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,559
What?

239
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,759
Do I have to smile at her?

240
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,879
Don't pull me.

241
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Regardless of the reason,

242
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,039
this matter can't be spread out.

243
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:08,600
Go home.

244
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,840
Stop here. Let's go home.

245
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,639
Come on.

246
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,120
Ms. Cui!

247
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,679
What?

248
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,440
Mandatory Reporting System is activated.

249
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,919
Don't stop us from protecting her.

250
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:16,679
We are the ones protecting her, okay?

251
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:17,240
Please

252
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,624
protect her properly, okay?

253
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,399
Madam, how about this?

254
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,360
If there's really a problem,

255
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,799
we will educate her.

256
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,639
Don't make it so troublesome.

257
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,919
After all, she is a child.

258
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,559
Yes.

259
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,919
A child is dating.

260
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,159
Why make

261
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,320
such a big deal?

262
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,200
Do you still want her to get married?

263
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,840
Ms. Cui, calm down first.

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,200
Besides,
this isn't merely about education.

265
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,519
She isn't of sexual consent age yet.

266
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,120
She's unaware

267
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,840
of the potential harm
it could cause her.

268
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,559
Her age,

269
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,519
her consent and action,

270
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,399
can I decide them?

271
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,000
Don't bother.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,480
Thank you.

273
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,159
You can go back.

274
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,320
Stop here. Follow me home.

275
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,799
We must find the assailant.

276
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,559
Check if he's an adult.

277
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,360
And see if he'll hurt her again.

278
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,879
As a sister,

279
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,759
are you clear on this?

280
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,759
No, so what?

281
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:55,360
Figure it out.

282
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,440
You can figure it out.

283
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,159
Don't bother.

284
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,120
Follow me home.

285
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,039
As a sister,

286
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,320
how could you not figure it out?

287
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,679
What are you going to do?

288
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,879
I didn't do anything.

289
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,559
Ms. Xia,

290
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,759
do we have any other way?

291
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,200
To be honest,

292
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,879
in our district,

293
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,679
juvenile prosecution isn't established.

294
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,279
Mandatory Reporting System

295
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,480
is led by city procuratorate.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,039
All reports

297
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,840
will also be synchronized to you.

298
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,080
The way.

299
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,000
Maybe we could ask

300
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,519
City Juvenile Prosecution Office

301
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,440
for guidance?

302
00:14:42,644 --> 00:14:45,536
(Practice the law
with virtues and righteousness)

303
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,559
That's the current situation.

304
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,960
The difficulty of this case lies in

305
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,080
the police did not find
any biological evidence

306
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,559
on the victim's body.

307
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,679
Nor did they find any indirect evidence.

308
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,159
However, this victim

309
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:00,960
indeed shows signs of sexual assault.

310
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,759
You mean

311
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,200
this victim's statement

312
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,159
is the only breakthrough
in this case, right?

313
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,320
Sorry, can I interrupt?

314
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,799
Isn't her sister
hindering the investigation?

315
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:12,320
She's hiding something, isn't she?

316
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,440
Is it possible that she

317
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,200
actually knows who the murderer is?

318
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,039
Stop nonsense.

319
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:17,799
No, it's not.

320
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,320
If I were her sister,

321
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,000
I'd want

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,559
to figure out the whole thing quickly.

323
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,440
What about her?

324
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,639
Unless she has other thoughts,

325
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,639
like wanting to hide the criminal.

326
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,480
You have to consider

327
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,720
their social environment,

328
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,759
and public pressure.

329
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,279
Things are not that simple.

330
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,720
But to be honest,

331
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,519
without

332
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,000
Mandatory Reporting System,

333
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,639
this case would probably

334
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,039
be swept under the rug.

335
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,600
In rape cases,

336
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,360
victims often don't report it

337
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,639
because of shame.

338
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,679
Parents are the same.

339
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,360
Moreover, looking at past data,

340
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,799
many are committed by acquaintances.

341
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,399
How can they report it?

342
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,039
Should we prepare a list

343
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,399
of all the males she might've met

344
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,759
between school and home?

345
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Don't worry.

346
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,320
Mandatory Reporting System

347
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
has just been implemented in our city.

348
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,840
This is deemed the first case.

349
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
So if you need anything,

350
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,639
we'll surely cooperate fully.

351
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,480
I have another concern.

352
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,159
If she really has

353
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,759
a boyfriend under sixteen years old,

354
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,879
whether he committed a crime

355
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,200
is another matter.

356
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,639
Investigate it first,

357
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,159
and then discuss the results.

358
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,039
Okay.

359
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,000
Cui Jiayi's in the middle school.

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,320
Her head teacher

361
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,440
is quite with her situation.

362
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,600
This way, please.

363
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,320
Come on, this way.

364
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:40,399
Please.

365
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,279
Hi, Miss.

366
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,879
We're from
Yunhai Public Security Bureau.

367
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,960
Don't need to be nervous.

368
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,840
We mainly want to ask you about

369
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,559
Cui Jiayi's personal situations

370
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,879
at school.

371
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,240
Just tell the truth.

372
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,840
She

373
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,559
usually has average grades.

374
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Managing her isn't hard,

375
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,399
but she has a strong-willed streak.

376
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,799
How does she get along with classmates?

377
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,279
Not very well.

378
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,200
She doesn't really have
any friends at school.

379
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,480
However,

380
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,200
I heard she interacts with young people
from society.

381
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,559
Someone said

382
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,920
they saw her checking into a room
with some boys.

383
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Cui Jiayi.

384
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,559
Her family runs a hair salon.

385
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,759
Her sister is a shampoo girl.

386
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,400
I don't know what kind of person she is.

387
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,720
Everyone knows she.

388
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,039
She spends all day preening
in front of the mirror,

389
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,960
and goes to dance with others
as soon as school is over.

390
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,839
Be careful!

391
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:52,480
Sorry, let me wipe this for you.

392
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,000
Sorry.

393
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:13,536
(Welcome)

394
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:19,720
I'll call you and come over.

395
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:21,000
- Take care.
- Cui Mingli.

396
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,240
We've met before.

397
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,720
Li Xiaoyao, City Public Security Bureau.
And Juvenile Prosecution Office's staff.

398
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,799
We need to know
Jiayi's specific situation.

399
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,759
About her,

400
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,400
I know best.

401
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,519
Why are you making such a fuss?

402
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,799
Afraid the neighborhood won't know?

403
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,119
Cui Mingli,

404
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,880
we need to find out who this person is.

405
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,039
Whether she's willing

406
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,880
is not your call.

407
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,480
- Got it?
- Mingli, wash my hair.

408
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:47,000
This way,

409
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,559
we won't interfere with your business.

410
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,359
We'll quickly ask.

411
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:50,359
Once done, we'll leave.

412
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:52,799
She's inside.

413
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,000
Go ask.

414
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,960
Come on, I can handle it myself.

415
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Cui Jiayi.

416
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,359
We're from Juvenile Prosecution Office.
We have a few questions to ask you.

417
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,599
If you don't want to be here,

418
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,680
we can change the place.

419
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,119
Come in.

420
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,359
I'm coming.

421
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,720
Xie Zhihua, right?

422
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,920
This isn't men's business.

423
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,759
Come on. Have a chat.

424
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,559
I'll close the door.

425
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,160
Please.

426
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,039
Is business good here?

427
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,359
It's okay.

428
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
It's mostly neighbors.

429
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,440
And some students.

430
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,200
All stylists

431
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,279
are all this unique?

432
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,759
Such a long braid.

433
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,680
My wife told me

434
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,240
to have the top part of my hair

435
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,440
permed

436
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,119
and the sides cut shorter.

437
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,759
She said this is trendy now.

438
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:09,799
It is quite trendy.

439
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,920
But that hairstyle

440
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,720
is more suitable for younger people.

441
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,720
Exactly,

442
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,599
as this age,

443
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,480
we should be more proper.

444
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,880
Go ahead.

445
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,880
Why bother?

446
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,920
Just say it yourself.

447
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:31,960
Who is that boy?

448
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,440
How old is he, and how did you meet?

449
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,160
Cui Mingli, we're questioning here.

450
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,200
Don't speak when you're not allowed to.

451
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:42,599
Take it easy.

452
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,279
Jiayi, no need to be nervous.

453
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,920
We just dropped by.

454
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,480
Let's have a casual chat.

455
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,079
After school,

456
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:55,119
where do you like to play?

457
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,359
The park

458
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
and the snack street next to the school.

459
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,039
Who do you usually like to go with?

460
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,160
Who else can it be with?

461
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,200
Of course those boys she dances with.

462
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:07,599
Aren't you annoyed?

463
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:08,559
I've told you

464
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,839
they're just my friends.

465
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,160
Are you being stubborn?

466
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,799
I think you might be making things up.

467
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,160
Look at all this.

468
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,200
Do I have to show it?

469
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,119
- What is all this?
- Stop that!

470
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,039
What are you doing?

471
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,400
Friends, right?

472
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,440
What are you doing?

473
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,599
Cui Mingli, you're disrupting
the questioning.

474
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,680
Please leave here.

475
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:34,000
Why so? This is my home.

476
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,960
I am her sister.

477
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,680
Do you have no sense of the law?

478
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,000
Cui Jiayi,

479
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,279
I don't care about the rest.

480
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,319
Tell the truth today.

481
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,480
I've told you, I didn't.

482
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Can you be quiet?

483
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,839
We're questioning.

484
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,720
Where were you that night

485
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
you didn't come home?

486
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,119
Which guy were you with?

487
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,279
- Is it often like this?
- Yes!

488
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:55,960
- They both have bad tempers.
- Okay? Satisfied?

489
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,160
- So they often argue.
- You confessed?

490
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,720
Tell me, who exactly is he?

491
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,799
Don't use force.

492
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,480
- Did you marry her sister?
- We stop asking, okay?

493
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,559
I work hard to support you.

494
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,480
- Soon.
- And you do this?

495
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,200
Cui Mingli.

496
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,759
Can you speak nicely her?

497
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,720
As her brother-in-law,

498
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,039
you can't act like her dad.

499
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
- Mingli manages more.
- Use words, not hands.

500
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,759
I only handle the finances.

501
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,279
Give as much as needed.

502
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,279
Is there a restroom?

503
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,519
Inside.

504
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,519
It's broken and hasn't been fixed.

505
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,480
It's available.

506
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,640
Okay.

507
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
A bit drafty.

508
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,079
You need a new door.

509
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,079
Right.

510
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,079
Originally we planned to renovate.

511
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,519
So, we didn't bother with it.

512
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,039
Cui Mingli, speak nicely to her!

513
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:44,680
Okay?

514
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,880
Let's go.

515
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,680
Calm down.

516
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:49,240
Let's go.

517
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,279
Speak nicely, don't use force.

518
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,160
You're uncontrollable!

519
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,960
You've got your mind set.

520
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,400
So stubborn.

521
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:01,984
(Qiuman Hotel)

522
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:09,279
(Zhihua Hair Salon, Accommodation)

523
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,359
So little useful information this time!

524
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,480
Inquired by a crowd each time,

525
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,880
I'd also say nothing if I were her.

526
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,720
We have no choice.

527
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
Shouldn't we still follow the procedure?

528
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,200
Next time, find an appropriate adult

529
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,640
to separate Cui Mingli from her.

530
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,799
Okay, leave this to me.

531
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,599
And that Xie Zhihua

532
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,759
isn't good either.

533
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:29,119
Make him get far away from her.

534
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,640
The mirror on the bar

535
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,839
frames a direct view of

536
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:34,039
Jiayi's bed.

537
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,759
And the bathroom door won't close.

538
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,960
The lattice underneath
has almost fallen off.

539
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,200
I guess he broke them himself.

540
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:41,119
Speaking of this,

541
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:42,319
I find it a bit odd.

542
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,720
Jiayi's bed and bed of theirs

543
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,279
are separated by just a curtain.

544
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,839
Moreover, Jiayi sleeps outside.

545
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:48,319
When Xie Zhihua comes and goes,

546
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,559
he has to pass by Jiayi.

547
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,039
Right, his door lock

548
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,799
has surely been broken for some time.

549
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,039
Jiayi's mental state

550
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,279
is really worrying.

551
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,319
Jiayi is not even the most abnormal one.

552
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,839
They are even more abnormal.

553
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,559
What's with Li Xiaoyao?

554
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,079
Here.

555
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:04,880
How's it going?

556
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,240
I briefed Weixiang about the clue

557
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,400
of disposable toothbrush.

558
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,480
- He'll look into it.
- Okay.

559
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,119
Go ahead!

560
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,519
Okay, I'm going back.

561
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,319
- Go.
- Bye-bye.

562
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,559
Is my car key with you?

563
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:16,880
Don't you know where it is?

564
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,880
Let's go.

565
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,960
Rewind it a bit.

566
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,759
These two.

567
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,759
Zoom in here.

568
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,480
Bring up their registration information.

569
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,279
The girl's name is Cui Jiayi.

570
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:46,480
It seems unregistered.

571
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,839
Probably they sneaked in secretly

572
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,880
when we weren't looking.

573
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,480
It's possible that
they weren't the ones who registered.

574
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,759
There were more than just us two.

575
00:25:57,759 --> 00:25:58,880
Other girls were there too.

576
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,160
Li Xinyue, right?

577
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,880
Last Tuesday, at 10 PM,

578
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,920
you and three boys

579
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,200
and two girls

580
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,960
went to Qiuman Hotel
and got a big bed room.

581
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,799
You left around 9 AM the next day.

582
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,079
Isn't that the case?

583
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:16,839
I'm sorry.

584
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,359
I won't dare next time.

585
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:19,680
What did you all do?

586
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,680
Tell us.

587
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,000
Just played together.

588
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,279
Played?

589
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,240
Played what? Be specific.

590
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,240
First, let me declare.

591
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,519
I have nothing to do with Cui Jiayi.

592
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,880
We're just anime friends.

593
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,720
Listen,

594
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,759
this is police station.

595
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,319
Have a proper attitude, got it?

596
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,200
See for yourself.

597
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,960
What is this?

598
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,599
Hurry up.

599
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:43,720
Just here.

600
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,960
She was...

601
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,519
She was the one who insisted I take her.

602
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,640
Jiayi really didn't want to go home.

603
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,559
She begged us to take her
to experience it.

604
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:53,559
Experience what?

605
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,079
What are you holding in your hands?

606
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,079
It's our first time doing this.

607
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,599
We have no experience. I...

608
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,400
I really didn't know this was illegal.

609
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,160
We just went to celebrate a birthday.

610
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,240
Nothing more, Officer.

611
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,720
Whose birthday is it?

612
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,039
It's...

613
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,839
Sai Qi.

614
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,119
Sai Qi?

615
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:38,720
Mr. Bai.

616
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,119
Hurry up.

617
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:41,920
Ms. Lin.

618
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,519
So fast.

619
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,119
Go.

620
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,000
With legs that long,

621
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,400
you walk so slow.

622
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,000
Hurry up.

623
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,839
Ms. Lin.

624
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,359
Ms. Liu.

625
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,240
Come on.

626
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,279
Come on.

627
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,799
Please.

628
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:57,559
Hi.

629
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,359
Various colors.

630
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:02,640
Just the five kids, right?

631
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,039
Are they there the parents?

632
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,480
Right.

633
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,640
We are from Procuratorate.

634
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,079
What's going on now?

635
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:14,960
Well,

636
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,440
what they moved to the hotel

637
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,720
is this,

638
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,680
Sai Qi.

639
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,079
They celebrated her birthday.

640
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,599
We were just supporting her birthday.

641
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:24,440
We spent many months
just on merchandise.

642
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,480
Celebrating a birthday
for an anime character?

643
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,720
Of course not.

644
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,559
They said

645
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,799
this is a virtual idol.

646
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,759
That's different.

647
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,839
Confused, right?

648
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,119
Indeed.

649
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,960
As for these kids,

650
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,000
they were just taking photos
and playing.

651
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,960
Nothing else.

652
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,240
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪

653
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,680
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪

654
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,160
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪
- ♪Happy birthday to you♪

655
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,880
Blow the candles.

656
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:56,920
Happy birthday, Sai Qi.

657
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,480
They're all under eighteen now, right?

658
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,440
This wonderful world.

659
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,279
I can't understand it.

660
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,119
Send a recommendation
to the relevant units.

661
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,920
Is there no procedure
for checking into a hotel?

662
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,720
Age restriction for entry is needed.

663
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:12,440
Rectify it!

664
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,759
Write it down.

665
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,480
Write? Okay.

666
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,279
Didn't ask you to.

667
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,039
Madam,

668
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,559
Jiayi texted me.

669
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,759
She ran away from home.

670
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,119
- Jiayi.
- Jiayi.

671
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,000
Jiayi.

672
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,359
- Jiayi!
- Cui Jiayi.

673
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,519
- Jiayi!
- Cui Jiayi.

674
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:28,880
Jiayi.

675
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,559
Jiayi.

676
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,119
- Jiayi.
- Jiayi.

677
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,720
Jiayi.

678
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,640
Cui Jiayi.

679
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,240
Jiayi.

680
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,160
Jiayi.

681
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,680
Jiayi.

682
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,359
Where are you hiding? Come out.

683
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,599
Cui Jiayi.

684
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,359
Jiayi.

685
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,519
- Cui Jiayi.
- Cui Jiayi.

686
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,279
Jiayi.

687
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,559
- Jiayi!
- Cui Jiayi.

688
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,920
Jiayi.

689
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,559
Cui Jiayi.

690
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,240
Cui Jiayi.

691
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,079
Jiayi.

692
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,880
Madam, we dance there every time.

693
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,039
It seems there.

694
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:00,799
Cui Jiayi.

695
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:02,720
Jiayi.

696
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,200
Cui Jiayi.

697
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,640
- It's her.
- Cui Jiayi.

698
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,519
Cui Jiayi.

699
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,839
Cui Jiayi.

700
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,720
Are you crazy? Why not go home at night?

701
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:21,880
I'm not going back.

702
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:22,880
Don't mess with me

703
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,759
before this crowd!

704
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,200
Don't touch me.

705
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,359
I'm not going back.

706
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,279
Give me back earphones.

707
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,279
- Hello.
- I'm not going back with you.

708
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,759
We found her.

709
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:32,640
- Go.
- I wouldn't.

710
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,440
- She's dead set against going home.
- That's not my home.

711
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,279
Don't come over here.

712
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:35,920
Not my home.

713
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,400
Go home.

714
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,880
- Don't touch me.
- Yes.

715
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,079
Zhihua's waiting you.

716
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,880
- She'll run out even if she goes home.
- Go home. Be good.

717
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,400
- Leave it to me.
- I just want to get out. So what?

718
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,559
- I'll take her home.
- Are you feeling strong?

719
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,319
- Give it back to me.
- Okay.

720
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,480
Aren't you going home?

721
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,039
- Cui Jiayi.
- Go home.

722
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
How about this?
Come home with me tonight.

723
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:56,039
Both of you calm down.

724
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,920
Once you're calm, take her back.

725
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,640
Okay?

726
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,759
Come on, please come in.

727
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,400
I'll get a pair of shoes.

728
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,039
You must be hungry. I'll get you food.

729
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,200
Let me check what's edible
in the fridge.

730
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,680
There's some tofu here.

731
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,200
I can mix it.

732
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,759
But it has gone bad. I'll toss it.

733
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,359
This dish isn't good either.

734
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,319
Forget it.

735
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,440
Let's order takeout.

736
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,440
Choose something you want to eat, here.

737
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,680
I'll make a bed for you.

738
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,079
Did you order?

739
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,759
Can you play this?

740
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:40,960
Play a round?

741
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
I haven't lost here.

742
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,200
You...

743
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,599
Alright, I'll let you have this one.

744
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,559
You're quite ruthless.

745
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,839
You're quite-quite ruthless.

746
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,279
You're quite-quite...

747
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,640
You're quite-quite...

748
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,119
Don't you have anything to ask me?

749
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,759
What?

750
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:33,799
What do you expect?

751
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,880
I thought you would ask me something.

752
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,240
No.

753
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:01,160
I'm full.

754
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,279
Full? It's fine, just leave it here.

755
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,000
I've set up room for you.

756
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,400
If you want to sleep, just go.

757
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,559
Thank you.

758
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,159
You're welcome.

759
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,159
Miss.

760
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,159
Can I lock the door?

761
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,119
Sure, you should lock it when sleeping.

762
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,719
Thank you.

763
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,199
Jiayi, it's me.

764
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,000
You two chat for a while.

765
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,280
Don't bring emotions into it.

766
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,400
Say the key points.

767
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,119
I'm going out.

768
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:38,960
Thanks, Ms. Lin.

769
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,440
Nothing.

770
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:53,719
Eat hot,

771
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,719
and go home with me.

772
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:56,679
I'm not hungry.

773
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,599
Cui Jiayi.

774
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,639
Let go of me.

775
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,079
I gave you face, didn't I?

776
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Fine, I was wrong, okay?

777
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,280
Stop messing with me.

778
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,880
Finish eating and go home with me.

779
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,039
Don't keep staying others' place.

780
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,519
Don't you also always do so?

781
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:13,800
You're relentless, aren't you?

782
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,400
I don't have time to waste words.

783
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:17,000
It's just your brother-in-law.

784
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,159
He's not my brother-in-law.

785
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,360
I don't have him as family.

786
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,199
What did he do to you? Tell me.

787
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,840
You're relentless?

788
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,519
Don't you know

789
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,199
we're both supported by him?

790
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
He supports us?

791
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,000
What does he support?

792
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,800
Aren't you the one washing hair?

793
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,440
Aren't you the one accounting

794
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,840
and putting on a smiling face?

795
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,639
What's he given us?

796
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,840
It's me with a smiling face.

797
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,119
So what?

798
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:38,840
This porridge.

799
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,239
I earned it with my smiling face.

800
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,199
Did I ask you to buy it?

801
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,880
Pour it out, okay? No one drink it.

802
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,119
Can you be more sensible?

803
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,960
- I looked for you all night.
- Cui Mingli!

804
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,400
If you need a man to support me,

805
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,280
forget it.

806
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,400
I didn't beg you.

807
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
What's wrong with having this ability?

808
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,840
What else do you want me to do?

809
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,360
Why are you pretending
to be so aloof here?

810
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,000
About your dances,

811
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,679
don't your classmates
take a second look?

812
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,039
Cui Jiayi, tell me the truth.

813
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,400
Are you in an early relationship?

814
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,480
This is what you said.

815
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,360
