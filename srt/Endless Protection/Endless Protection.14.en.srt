00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,799
You chat with him.

3
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,280
Drink with him.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,280
No need to do that.

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,359
It's been so many years.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,960
Just this one time.

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,520
It won't happen again.

8
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,039
Okay.

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,200
Be careful.

10
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:13,799
Junjie.

11
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,280
Your mom has a problem with her neck.

12
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,480
She has trouble sleeping.

13
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,879
I gave her a massage.

14
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,640
She feels better.

15
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,120
Jia is pregnant.

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,640
She loves spicy food now.

17
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,319
I guess she's carrying a girl.

Bai.

21
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,039
Get that motorcycle up.

22
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,080
He helped others modify that.

23
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,240
Get it up.

24
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:35,919
Junyan.

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,919
We haven't seen each other
for years, right?

26
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,919
Bai said he saw you today.

27
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,639
You modified vehicles for kids.

28
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,360
I have a question for you.

29
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,759
Did you make their vehicles faster

30
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,199
or slower?

31
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,960
Ignite the engine.

32
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,759
The idle speed is too low.

33
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,720
The resistance is too high.

34
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,560
Got it?

35
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,360
Turn it off.

36
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,079
And you.

37
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,920
What have you learned at the facility?

38
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,839
Don't pretend like it's all fine.

39
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,600
Who had nightmares
and couldn't sleep well?

40
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
Who's been thinking of ways

41
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,519
to get those kids back?

42
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,399
Everyone's trying to make things right.

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
You can't you talk

44
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,680
and solve problems?

45
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
You must fight?

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,480
It happened before.

47
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,120
It happened again?

48
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,800
Fine, just keep it like this.

49
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,399
So many years have passed.

50
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,959
You still can't figure out

51
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,360
why it happened back then.

52
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,439
Back then,

53
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,519
if we had listened to Junjie

54
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,360
instead of acting on impulse,

55
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,720
we wouldn't have

56
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,160
done anything we regret now.

57
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,519
We didn't do things with reverence

58
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,279
like these kids.

59
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,240
Honey.

60
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,360
Honey.

61
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,800
Why did you come so late?

62
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,680
The bicycling was time-consuming.

63
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:14,839
I...

64
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,839
Are you okay?

65
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,560
Yunhai Seven Heroes.

66
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,720
We're back.

67
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,120
Come on!

(Parking Lot)

71
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,720
Someone's coming to the crossroads.

72
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,800
Just one person?

73
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,279
Sure, it's a woman with a bag.

74
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,000
Go!

75
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,279
What do you want to do?

76
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,120
Get out of the way!

77
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,799
What are you trying to do?

78
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:42,919
Stay back.

79
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,799
Take a look.

80
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,639
Come on. Look.

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,759
I got into a fight at 17

82
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,759
and got hit on the head.

83
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,600
If you think it's fine to go bald,

84
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,519
just keep fooling around.

85
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,919
Whose idea was it?

86
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,440
Mr. Yan.

87
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,000
You still remember me, huh?

88
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,919
Boss?

89
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,080
Please, Mr. Yan.

90
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
I'm not.

91
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,120
Fight?

92
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,000
My brother was stabbed to death.

93
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,559
Look at my leg.

94
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,159
You.

95
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,799
You want to be a robber?

96
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,039
Follow in my footsteps?

97
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,600
You think it's cool and exciting?

98
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,679
Do you know what price I paid?

99
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,399
Just a year and a half.

100
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,840
Sure, a year and a half in jail.

101
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,519
Give it a try

102
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,799
if you want.

103
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
If you like studying,

104
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,639
go back to school.

105
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,440
If you don't,

106
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,559
learn some skills

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,840
for a living.

108
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,360
Being a gangster is not a real man.

109
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,679
A real man can support himself

110
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,000
and his family

111
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
with his skills.

112
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,080
Come find me if you want to fight.

113
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,399
I'll do it with you.

114
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,799
We just want you to know

115
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,200
we all went through

116
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,039
what you've experienced.

117
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,559
We can't always make choices for you.

118
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,639
You have a long way to go.

119
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:56,360
Whether you leave

120
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,519
or stay

121
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,399
is up to you.

122
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,159
If you go astray,

123
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,759
it's hard to go straight.

124
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,120
Honey.

125
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,399
Thank you.

126
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,279
(Police Station)
No problem.

127
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,240
Sorry for this.

128
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,360
You can't just know you're wrong today.

129
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,039
Got it?

130
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,720
You have to think the same way tomorrow.

131
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,320
Say thank you.

132
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,440
Wrong is wrong.

133
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,399
Don't do it again.

134
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a lesson.

135
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,919
It won't happen again.

136
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,919
Alright, you can go.

137
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,960
Come on.

138
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,600
You may go.

139
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,320
What are you doing?

140
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,120
Stop it!

141
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,960
Stop! Don't you know where this is?

142
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,840
You trouble maker.

143
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,879
Look where this is.

144
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,679
This is the police station.

145
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,159
Heizi, what are you doing?

146
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,799
You think I want to clear up his mess?

147
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,159
I don't need you.

148
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,120
You get my vehicle back

149
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,360
and I'll leave tonight.

150
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
You're an ingrate.

151
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:03,279
I've treated you so well,

152
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,879
but you still prefer your bad mom.

153
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:05,799
Go find her.

154
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,639
Fine!

155
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,399
I don't need your care.

156
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,519
You get my vehicle back

157
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,519
and I'll travel

158
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,799
all over the city.

159
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:12,799
Be nice.

160
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,720
Lower your voice.

161
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,200
Sorry.

162
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,720
We contacted your mom
through the authorities.

163
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,000
I gave her your phone number.

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,080
She would call you.

165
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,320
You know why he can't find his mom.

166
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,279
She's avoiding you.

167
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,200
My parents

168
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,840
were truck drivers.

169
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,480
You know about that job.

170
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
They barely came home.

171
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,039
Twenty years ago,

172
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,000
the whole village knew

173
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,600
I was left behind.

174
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,399
I looked carefree,

175
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,440
pretending not to care at all.

176
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,519
But actually, I cared so much.

177
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,000
Those families

178
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,039
of three or five

179
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,399
looked warm

180
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,120
and happy.

181
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:10,120
So I kept thinking

182
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,279
if my parents came back,

183
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,919
would I also be that happy?

184
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,600
One day,

185
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,639
I made up my mind

186
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,879
and jumped off a steep slope.

187
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,919
My shin was fractured,

188
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,799
and I lay in bed for months.

189
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,519
I thought

190
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
I was already so miserable,

191
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:44,279
almost crippled,

192
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,000
and they would come back to see me.

193
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,399
Would they not come back?

194
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,679
They didn't come back.

195
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,960
They didn't have time to see me.

196
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,320
My great-grandma got sick

197
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,879
because of looking after me.

198
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,440
Even now, when it's cold,
her back still hurts.

199
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,000
Later,

200
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,639
to take on one more business deal,

201
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,600
they had a car accident

202
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,600
because of drowsy driving.

203
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,919
Both of them passed away.

204
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,519
Do you think

205
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,440
that only if you make a big mistake,

206
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,200
your parents will come back?

207
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,759
I understand.

208
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,200
Because I thought so too.

209
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,440
Nobody can compare to our own parents.

210
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,600
Back then, I did things

211
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,480
aimlessly.

212
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,000
I didn't even know
what I was living for.

213
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,759
I made one mistake after another.

214
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:05,200
Thanks to my great-grandma.

215
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,440
She said

216
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
if I made mistakes,

217
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,639
I should learn my lessons
and make things right.

218
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,320
If I don't,

219
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,120
I'll always have a home.

220
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,240
Has Bai Zuhao's family arrived?

221
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,960
Yeah.

222
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,879
I'm his Grandnephew.

223
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,799
Mr. Yan.

224
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,759
Junyan.

225
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
What happened again?

226
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,440
Nothing.

227
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,320
I'll sell my vehicle.

228
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,360
His motorcycle.

229
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,000
Are you sure?

230
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,879
I have to sell it.

231
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,080
Then sell it.

232
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,759
You aren't a kid anymore.

233
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,879
If you drive

234
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,679
without a license,

235
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,159
you'll get fined.

236
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,960
Study well from now on,

237
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,559
and set an example.

238
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,120
Got it.

239
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,360
I'll keep my promise.

240
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,840
You have problems?

241
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,120
No.

242
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,840
Cheer up.

243
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,080
I know a professional racer,

244
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,559
who can teach you racing.

245
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,480
But,

246
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,559
you must be my apprentice

247
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,600
until you come of age.

248
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,399
Do you accept it?

249
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,120
Of course, I do.

250
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,720
Mr. Yan.

251
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,279
As long as you let me learn racing,

252
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,559
I'll not ride for two years

253
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,799
and do whatever you ask.

254
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,240
Then you should now call me...

255
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,720
Mentor.

256
00:16:58,356 --> 00:16:59,720
Come on.

257
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,559
Good for you.

258
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,519
You should study hard.

259
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,768
Don't just focus on repairing.

260
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,759
You can't drive if you

261
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,880
don't pass the driving test.

262
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,559
Don't worry. Grandnephew.

263
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,079
I promise to complete the task.

264
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,696
(Clinic)

265
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,960
(Image Files)
It's time for your surgery.

266
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,759
I'll try to arrange it for you

267
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,079
by the end of this month.

268
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,799
You said
it could be conservatively treated.

269
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,200
That's what was said last time.

270
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,599
The prerequisite
for conservative treatment

271
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,279
is that you do as I say
and take your medicine on time.

272
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,680
Have you taken your medicine on time?

273
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,079
Sure, I-I have.

274
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,119
I can tell

275
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,599
if you have.

276
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,440
The medicine makes me dizzy.

277
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,559
It affects my work.

278
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,519
Is there any other way?

279
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,079
Yes, there is.

280
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,440
Listen.

281
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
You get out of the hospital gate

282
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,000
and take a taxi directly

283
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,039
to the crematorium.

284
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,960
How can you give up on me so soon?

285
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,920
It's been years.

286
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,160
You don't take your medicine

287
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,720
and rest properly.

288
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,119
You don't receive the surgery.

289
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:21,799
I'm puzzled.

290
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,000
Why are you so busy?

291
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,240
What kind of job do you do?

292
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I work

293
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:28,680
at the Procuratorate.

294
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,359
Then I have a legal question.

295
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,640
If a patient doesn't
listen to the doctor,

296
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,559
can the doctor

297
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,000
sue this patient?

298
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,039
Come on, doctor.

299
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,240
Think of another solution.

300
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:57,760
(Yunhai People's Hospital,
CT Examination Report)

301
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,192
(Procuratorate)

302
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,519
Alright.

303
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,680
I see.

304
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,079
Leave it to me.

305
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:04,880
Don't worry.

306
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,599
Alright, bye.

307
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,279
- Ms. Zheng.
- Come in.

308
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:11,839
Ms. Zheng.

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,680
Please sit down.

310
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,519
The provincial office asked us
to revisit the minors

311
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,720
who committed crimes

312
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,279
over the past six months.

313
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,119
You submit the materials.

314
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:20,880
You do this job.

315
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,200
Okay, leave it to me.

316
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,759
They'll set up an interview

317
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,079
for publicity.

318
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:26,519
Forget about the interview.

319
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,880
Why?

320
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,359
What to publicize?

321
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,640
The juvenile's cases

322
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,079
only have regrets left.

323
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,599
Forget about it.

324
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,559
I will let them promote

325
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:41,000
how to prevent crime.

326
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,319
Okay.

327
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,759
There's one more thing.

328
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,839
Ning Kaitong's mom passed away.

329
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,480
Heart attack.

330
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,960
I just received the news.

331
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,039
So sudden.

332
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,279
Okay, I'll go check on the kid.

333
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,960
Okay.

334
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,960
You don't look well.

335
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,079
You need to rest more.

336
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:01,839
I'm fine.

337
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,480
Anything else?

338
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,200
No.

339
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,720
Okay, I'll go then.

340
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,984
(Yang's Diner)

341
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:11,960
Bai.

342
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,480
How's this kid doing lately?

343
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,079
Pretty good.

344
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,519
The other day,

345
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,799
a woman came to make a scene.

346
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,480
A woman?

347
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,680
How old is she?

348
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,200
Older than him.

349
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,400
He is a young man.

350
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:53,119
I hope he won't become a scumbag.

351
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,799
Hello.

352
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,920
Alright, good.

353
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,920
Let's do it at my buddy's shop.

354
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:08,640
Okay.

355
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,559
When are you free?

356
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,079
Tomorrow.

357
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,279
I'll be busy after tomorrow.

358
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,559
I'll go back to the village

359
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,240
to relocate my dad's grave.

360
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,279
Then let's do it tomorrow.

361
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,000
You communicate with them.

362
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:24,599
About what?

363
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:26,400
My leader

364
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,480
will revisit Lu Sheng.

365
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,440
She wants to ask you

366
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,104
about what you think of Lu Sheng.

367
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,744
Is it okay?

368
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,240
Are you talking

369
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,359
about the annoying leader of yours?

370
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,119
Under my influence,

371
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,799
she's become better.

372
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,119
Occasionally,

373
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,359
she is humane.

374
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,440
It's okay,

375
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,519
but what should I say?

376
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,119
I don't want to mess it up.

377
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,839
Just tell the truth.

378
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:50,720
Just say

379
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,160
under my inspiration,

380
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,640
Lu Sheng has changed himself

381
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,920
and become a good man.

382
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,200
That's all your credit?

383
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,000
I give you

384
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,960
half of the credit.

385
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,039
My buddy Yang

386
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,240
is a straightforward man.

387
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,319
He let Lu Sheng work for him

388
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,720
without a second thought.

389
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,960
He offered a good job.

390
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,240
Well,

391
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,279
I was just thinking.

392
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,920
Could we issue him an award

393
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
in the name

394
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,119
of the Procuratorate?

395
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,839
Of course, it's okay

396
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,480
if we don't do that.

397
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
We can do that.

398
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,640
I'll apply for it.

399
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,720
Agreed?

400
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
Shouldn't I?

401
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,400
Yes, you should.

402
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,559
He deserves it.

403
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,680
Come on. Stop writing.

404
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,160
Eat your food.

405
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,559
It's getting cold.

406
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,519
Shall I feed you?

407
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,519
No, I can eat by myself.

408
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,880
You're being greasy.

409
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,039
Please come inside.

410
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,359
Please come in.

411
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,040
- They're waiting.
- Hello.

412
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:57,120
(Menu)

413
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,079
What are you doing here?

414
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,720
What do you mean?

415
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,519
This is his shop.

416
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,200
Shouldn't he be here?

417
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:11,960
You know each other?

418
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:14,759
Mr. Yang, this is my leader.

419
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,000
Is his surname Yang now?

420
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,319
It can be Bai.

421
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,400
Come on.

422
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,160
That's not appropriate.

423
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,960
Let me make an introduction.

424
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,079
This is my leader,
Lin Zhitao, a prosecutor.

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,680
Mr. Yang.

426
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:34,400
My buddy, Yang.

427
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,720
The porridge here

428
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,599
is the best in Yunhai.

429
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:45,680
Today,

430
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,400
we're here for Lu Sheng.

431
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,880
You talk to Lu Sheng?

432
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,160
Let's talk outside.

433
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Bai, I'll go.

434
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
What's that about?

435
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,119
Come on.

436
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,279
Didn't we make a deal

437
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:03,240
about today's visit?

438
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,079
She's my sister.

439
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,680
And I'm your uncle.

440
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:08,880
(Yang's Diner)
Are you used to your job?

441
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,200
Yeah, I am.

442
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,680
My boss treats me well.

443
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,000
I heard from Bai Enyu

444
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,480
that you live nearby, right?

445
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,960
Yes, just a few minutes' walk from here.

446
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,039
Live nearby.

447
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,480
Ms. Lin.

448
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,880
If...

449
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,440
I mean, what should

450
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,839
be done if a child is abused?

451
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:32,440
Who? How old is the child?

452
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,200
Five or six years old.

453
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,519
What kind of abuse?

454
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,599
If the kid is abandoned

455
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,039
or physically abused,

456
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:39,880
call the police.

457
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,799
He wasn't beaten

458
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:45,640
or abandoned.

459
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,480
Well,

460
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,839
he wears dirty clothes

461
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,839
and finds food in the trash.

462
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,200
He has bad habits.

463
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,039
In this case,

464
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,279
it's not a criminal case.

465
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,119
Specific problems
need specific analysis.

466
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,480
Who is it, Lu Sheng?

467
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,400
It's nobody.

468
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,480
I'm just curious.

469
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,599
I was just asking.

470
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,839
If you remember something,

471
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:15,000
or if you need me,

472
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,240
call me anytime.

473
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,480
You can also call Bai.

474
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,720
Isn't your last name Yang?

475
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,480
My full name is Lin Zhiyang.

476
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,319
Lin Zhiyang and Lin Zhitao.

477
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,440
So there was a poplar tree

478
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,296
and a peach tree in front of your house?

479
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,240
A waxberry tree

480
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,720
and a kiwi tree.

481
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
That makes sense.

482
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,400
It's not good
to be named after two fruit trees.

483
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,400
I've heard a bit

484
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,039
about your family.

485
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,440
Your dad

486
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,880
wasn't a good father.

487
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,839
Did she mention

488
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,599
that she left home
and walked away alone?

489
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:53,480
She left?

490
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,519
She ran away from home?

491
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,519
It's been 16 years.

492
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,079
She hasn't contacted the family
even once.

493
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,119
But it's all in the past.

494
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,799
You are brother

495
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,559
and sister through blood.

496
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,440
I don't believe
she doesn't care about you.

497
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,400
You two are

498
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,519
each other's only family.

499
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,359
Just let go of the past.

500
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,872
She doesn't need me.

501
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,359
She doesn't need anyone.

502
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,039
She only needs herself.

503
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,792
She deserves to have no family.

504
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,960
She is your sister.

505
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:29,880
No family?

506
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,519
Then who are you?

507
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,400
I don't need her as my sister.

508
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,960
All these years without her,

509
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,640
I still grew up on my own.

510
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,559
I also don't need anyone.

511
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,359
You're quite stubborn.

512
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,319
I mentioned the relocation
of my dad's grave.

513
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:48,079
I've been thinking about this.

514
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,039
The relatives want her to go back too.

515
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,960
I don't know how to bring it up to her.

516
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,880
She won't listen to me.

517
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,319
She won't go back.

518
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,759
The main point is not
about the relocation of the grave.

519
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,519
You two should go back together

520
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,839
and untie the mental knot.

521
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,759
Maybe the two of you

522
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,880
will become reconciled

523
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,279
and move on together.

524
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:14,640
I don't want to.

525
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,160
I'm good now.

526
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,039
That's all.

527
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,920
Mr. Yang.

528
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,680
Although I

529
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,559
haven't known you for long,

530
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,200
I've found

531
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,279
you and your sister have a common flaw.

532
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,279
You two say things that you don't mean.

533
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,079
I dealt with my families
when I was little.

534
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,039
I've seen a lot of things like this.

535
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,559
Listen to me.

536
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,039
There is no relationship

537
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,240
that cannot be repaired,

538
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,079
let alone a relationship
with your family.

539
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:44,440
Look,

540
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,759
I'll help you.

541
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,880
Bai Enyu, time to go.

542
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,240
No rush.

543
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,519
I haven't finished my job.

544
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,359
You do your job.

545
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,400
This work is only half done.

546
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,079
Set an example.

547
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,880
It helps me handle cases independently.

548
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,519
You two talk.

549
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,920
What's wrong with your hair?

550
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,079
Nothing.

551
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,519
I like it.

552
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,279
Love it.

553
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,799
Are you nearsighted?

554
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:23,480
How much have you read?

555
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,440
I don't read.

556
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,376
The smoke hurt my eyes.

557
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,160
This is deception, you know?

558
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,960
I don't know.

559
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,240
No one taught me.

560
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:48,519
How long has Lu Sheng been working here?

561
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,559
How about the working hours?

562
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,319
Have you paid taxes?
The public-health license?

563
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,480
What are you doing?

564
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,160
Are you interrogating a criminal?

565
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,279
I'm talking to you about business.

566
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,880
Any private business?

567
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,839
I'm not your enemy.

568
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,359
I have a grudge against you.

569
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,480
You always run away.

570
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,160
You always show me your back.

571
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,400
Keep it up.

572
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:50,480
Go back.

573
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,279
Why did you two fight?

574
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,119
Well,

575
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,960
when I asked Lu Sheng,

576
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,519
he mentioned a child
who might need help.

577
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:04,039
He refused to tell me.

578
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,119
You ask him later.

579
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
What about your brother?

580
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,480
Just stay out of this, okay?

581
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,240
Watch your language later.

582
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,880
That child is quite sensitive.

583
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
Her mom just died.

584
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,640
Okay, I won't say anything.

585
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,960
I'll do whatever you say.

586
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,720
When did you handle this case?

587
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:37,839
Before I do my job?

588
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,400
I don't remember at all.

589
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:41,119
Much earlier than that.

590
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:42,759
Is that so?

591
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,000
(Guili Home, Building 7)
You and Yang...

592
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,359
Stop coughing.

593
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,160
Here we are?

594
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:58,559
202.

595
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:02,559
Coming.

596
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:05,408
(Location, Time)

597
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:06,880
Hello.

598
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,039
You're...?

599
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,079
We're from the Procuratorate.

600
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,400
Is this Ning Guochang's home?

601
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,559
Ms. Lin.

602
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,640
Please come in.

603
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,216
Thanks.

604
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:14,680
Please.

605
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,160
Honey, make more dishes.

606
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,720
You two stay for dinner.

607
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,400
No, thanks, we have other things to do.

608
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:22,160
Get them some fruit.

609
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:23,640
- Sit, please.
- Okay.

610
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,680
- Please sit.
- Thanks.

611
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,319
I'm sorry for your loss.

612
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:35,839
Kaitong's mom had high blood pressure.

613
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,920
I just didn't expect

614
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,480
she would die young.

615
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,559
When will Kaitong go back to school?

616
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm still working on it.

617
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,440
Okay.

618
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,680
She can't go to public schools.

619
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,240
I'll send her to a private school.

620
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,960
But the procedures are complicated.

621
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,680
Kaitong's mom suddenly died.

622
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,400
I've been busy

623
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,720
with her mom's funeral.

624
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,720
I still need some time.

625
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,880
I understand.

626
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,400
How's Kaitong doing?

627
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:06,480
Tong?

628
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,400
I call her out?

629
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,799
No need. Don't force her.

630
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,720
Have some fruit.

631
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,559
Okay, thank you.

632
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,519
Hello, Ms. Lin Zhitao.

633
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,839
Hello.

634
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:29,599
Thank you.

635
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:30,920
But I'm fine.

636
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:33,960
It's just that I

637
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,559
didn't see my mom one last time.

638
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,559
Tong.

639
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,960
Watch your tone.

640
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,400
I'm glad you're okay.

641
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,400
We just came to see if you're okay.

642
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:47,079
Then we're leaving.

643
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,920
Thanks for your time.

644
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,480
Let me walk you out.

645
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,000
No need.

646
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,839
Thank you.

647
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,039
Why are you following?

648
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:00,960
It's not easy

649
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,279
to discipline Tong.

650
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,200
We have tried our best.

651
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,400
She behaved better

652
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,920
because you came.

653
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,960
She's usually impolite.

654
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,680
Understood.

655
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,279
After all, she's not my own kid.

656
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,400
It's hard to become close.

657
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,680
Don't worry.

658
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,279
We'll take good care of Tong.

659
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,359
If we don't,

660
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:18,799
- we'll...
- Please make way.

661
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,799
If we don't care,

662
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,519
we won't be talking with you.

663
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,799
Alright, call us if you have a problem.

664
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,319
Okay.

665
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,519
Take care, Ms. Lin.

666
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,279
Alright, see you.

667
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:31,440
Well, see you.

668
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,039
Alright.

669
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,400
Let's eat. I'm starving.

670
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,799
Tong.

671
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,839
We specially made delicious food
for you. Come out quickly.

672
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:48,559
I'm not eating.

673
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,400
This meal wasn't made for me.

674
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,160
If it wasn't, who was it made for?

675
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,200
For the sake of appearances.

676
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,839
If those two prosecutors didn't come,

677
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,640
would you let me eat such good food?

680
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,280
Look, this case is interesting.

681
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,360
A brother and sister stole

682
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,199
at supermarkets.

683
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,639
After they got caught,

684
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,519
the sister took the blame on herself.

685
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,840
The brother said

686
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,920
it was his idea.

687
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,920
Is there a problem?

688
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,880
What does that show?

689
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,280
It shows

690
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,159
biological siblings

691
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,159
are related by blood.

692
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,440
They care about each other.

693
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,519
They're family.

This case

695
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,039
deals with two kids

696
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:48,039
who are too young

697
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,519
to be criminally responsible.

698
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,920
It shows how to educate them.

699
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,760
You don't speak.

700
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,159
The point is,
they care about each other,

701
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,639
so they take the blame on themselves.

702
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,519
That's not right.

703
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
It constitutes obstruction
of the investigation.

704
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,559
Shut up.

705
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,119
Bai Enyu.

706
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,719
Don't you think I make a point?

707
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,400
Since you're so interested in this case,

708
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,519
write a report about it.

709
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,760
I'm off work.

710
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,920
- Bye.
- Bye.

711
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,719
Go ahead if you want to say something.

712
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,639
Don't try to imply anything, okay?

713
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,159
I didn't.

714
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:20,079
I...

715
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,480
As a leader,

716
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,000
you're doing great.

717
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,639
I've made progress.

718

721
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,840
Let's sing.

722
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,599
- Can you sing?
- No, I can't.

723
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,360
Then why should we sing?

724
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,320
Are you going?

725
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:37,800
Sure.

Why must we sing here?

727
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,679
It's Ning Kaitong's family's business.

728
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,280
Why come here?

729
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,239
No questions.

730
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,159
Have you booked a room?

731
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,519
Yes, I have.

732
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:53,960
Stop filming.

733
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,599
This way.

734
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,400
What?

735
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,840
You're not wearing your uniform.

736
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,920
If you look inside,

737
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,960
they might hit you.

738
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,639
I'm just looking. Why hit me?

739
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:17,719
What are you looking at?

740
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,639
People like them?

741
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,800
Hey, they might hit you.

742
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,320
Come on.

743
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,079
The room is booked.

744
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,519
Well, you go first.

745
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,320
I'll wander around.

746
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,599
You sing first.

747
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,840
Are you kidding?

748
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,480
Let's sing

749
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,079
and relax ourselves.

750
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:32,679
Listen, my singing is really good.

751
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:33,360
Yes, I know.

752
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,039
- Come on.
- Wait.

753
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,440
I need to go to the bathroom.

754

I'll come find you soon.

755
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,320
Alright, be good.

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,480

Excuse me.

Does this place

762

have a new boss?

763
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,400
I'm not sure about this.

764
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,119
How old are you?

765
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,280
I'm 30.

766
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,320
Are you that old?

767
00:36:59,159 --> 00:36:59,920
Yes.

768
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,639
Are you a guest?

769
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,840
Sure, I am.

770
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,719
I'm a guest.

771
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm going to V16.

772
00:37:06,784 --> 00:37:07,760
Go straight, turn right.

773
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,288
Okay.

774
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,760
You need to watch your tone later.

775
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,480
Stay calm whatever happens.

776
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:24,639
You're serious, right?

777
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,199
Make things right

778
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:27,920
between you and your sister.

779
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:28,920
Well...

780
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,679
You're pretty quick.

781
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,639
Come.

782
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,080
Come and sit.

783
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,719
I'm getting ready to sing.

784
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:36,880
Look, it's all set up.

785
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,559
You're quite free.

786
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,199
Why are you so nosy?

787
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,119
I'm not.

788
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,880
The more, the merrier,

789
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,639
right?

790
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,920
What do you say, Mr. Yang?

791
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,559
Watch your tone.

792
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,800
Stay calm.

793
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,280
Are you ventriloquizing?

794
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,440
I didn't say anything.

795
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,159
What's the matter?

796
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,760
Watch your tone.

797
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:01,960
Nothing.

798
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,079
I...

799
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,119
I spoke too harshly yesterday.

800
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,159
I just want to...

801
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:11,760
It's alright.

802
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,159
Here you go.

803
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:19,039
Well, you two are good now.

804
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,880
Let me sing

805
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,599
first.

806
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,679
Start.

Join the fun. Get closer.

824
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,119
Come on.

825
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,760
You sing a song.

826
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,930
Sit.

let's go home together.

833
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,504
The relatives will
relocate Lin Zhengfeng's grave.

834
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,760
They want you to be there.

835
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,960
You need to do something.

836
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,400
I won't come to the foolish event.

837
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,559
I can pay for it.

838
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,079
Watch your tone.

839
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,360
How much will you pay?

840
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,639
What do you want me to do?

841
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,960
Lin Zhitao, do you think

842
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,280
I have nothing else to do

843
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,400
instead of talking to you?

844
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,039
You tell me to go back, but I can't.

845
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,039
I can pay for the event.

846
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,559
I've already made it very clear.

850
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:28,280
You have a big mouth.

851
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
You can sing well.

852
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,039
To the restroom.

853
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:32,119
Why are you taking your bag then?

854
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:34,639
Miss.

855
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,239
Don't go.

856
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:36,960
I can't drink.

857
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,880
I'll get someone else.

858
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,760
Hey. Let go.

859
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,800
I really can't.

860
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,159
Let go of her.

861
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,760
What are you doing?

862
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,840
What did you do?

863
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,119
I warned you

864
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:47,920
to watch your tone.

865
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,679
Remember?

866
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,760
Why were you yelling?

867
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,960
Thank you, Bai.

868
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,519
Forget it.

869
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,960
Why couldn't you stay calm?

870
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,039
It's okay.

871
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,800
If you can't do it this time,

872
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,440
do it later.

873
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,239
Let's not sing.

874
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,719
No need for that.

875
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,199
Thank you, anyway.

876
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,039
She won't change.

877
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,679
She can't change.

878
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:09,599
What do you want to do?

879
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,360
You stay out of this.

880
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:11,920
Go away.

881
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,199
We're just playing with her.

882
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,519
I have things to do.

883
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,079
You sing here.

884
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:17,599
Wait.

885
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,880
She can't change, but you can.

886
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,559
Mr. Yang.

887
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,880
Again, go away.

888
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,119
Stay away from her.

889
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,000
Go away.

890
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,440
Come here.

891
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,239
Be good.

892
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:27,199
Let go.

893
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:29,039
Back off.

894
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,880
- Calm down.
- Who are you?

895
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,000
If you fight, I'll call the police.

896
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,639
You'll be in trouble in the end.

897
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,320
Who are you?

898
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,679
Don't try to scare me.

899
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,280
Call the police? Go ahead.

900
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,000
I dare you to do that.

901
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,400
What happened?

902
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:44,320
What's wrong?

903
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,599
Calm down, guys.

904
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,880
Let go.

905
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,519
Let go.

906
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,239
Well...

907
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,719
Mr. Wang?

908
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,840
Ning, I was hit in your place.

909
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,119
Ms. Lin.

910
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,239
Why are you here?

911
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,000
They just

912
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,440
bullied a child.

913
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,199
Shame on you.

914
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,039
Nonsense.

915
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,199
Don't talk rubbish.

916
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,519
We were just chatting.

917
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
You're here to have fun.

918
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:07,000
No fights.

919
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,480
It's on me tonight.

920
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,360
Just let it go.

921
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,519
Do me a favor.

922
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:12,559
Take them away,

923
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:13,400
or we'll call the police.

924
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,199
Alright.

925
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,719
Please. Thanks.

926
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,760
Ning, let me tell you.

927
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,079
I'll compromise for you.

928
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:18,679
Thanks.

929
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,159
Let's go.

930
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,559
What bad luck!

931
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,480
Are you alright?

932
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,159
Give you a rub.

933
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,400
Are you alright?

934
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,079
Thank you so much.

935
00:42:31,296 --> 00:42:32,119
How old are you?

936
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,280
What are you doing here?

937
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:35,559
I...

938
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,239
Show me your ID card.

939
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,760
Don't kill the mood.

940
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,800
Enjoy your time here.

941
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,960
I'm not here for fun.

942
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,960
She is still a kid.

943
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,400
- Barbecue again?
- Sure.

944
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,400
Is she your employee?

945
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,840
Are you going for hot pot?

946
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,960
We can have hot pot too.

947
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,320
Do you have an ID card?

948
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,599
Come with me.

949
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,320
Listen.

950
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,639
I'm calling the police now.

951
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,119
What is your name?

952
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:56,880
Beibei.

953
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,000
Beibei and those girls
who just walked away

954
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,239
can't leave here.

955
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,480
You got it?

956
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
Wait for the police.

957
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,360
Yes, I see.

958
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,079
Ms. Lin.

959
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:08,159
Come on.

960
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,239
Give me a pen and paper.

961
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,440
No paper.

962
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,719
Look.

963
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,079
- I'm doing business.
- Here it is.

964
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,519
(Opinion Book)
They are all grown up.

965
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,840
- It's true.
- Complaint.

966
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:17,400
You come.

967
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:19,880
You know the law?

968
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,599
Yes.

969
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,599
Then why you decorate this place
like this?

970
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,639
Entertainment personnel aren't

971
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,039
allowed to offer companionship

972
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,559
for profit.

973
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:28,239
Got it?

974
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:28,760
Yes.

975
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:31,400
(Phone Number)
No companionship, just selling liquor.

976
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,239
This is my number.

977
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,519
Call me if you need anything.

978
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,840
They are regular waitress.

979
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,920
Regular waitress wearing short skirts?

980
00:43:45,427 --> 00:43:47,039
(Jiaoyang KTV)

981
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,352
Hello, police station?

982
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:49,559
The police will come.

983
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:51,599
I'm currently at the Jiaoyang KTV.

984
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,079
Here's the thing.

985
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,679
I found...

986
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,000
I'm from the Procuratorate.

987
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:58,719
I found a few minors working here.

988
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:01,360
Yes, but I don't know how old they are.

989
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,599
I'm waiting for you here.

990
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,719
Please come as soon as possible.

991
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:06,599
Do you drink?

992
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:08,519
I didn't get their ID cards.

993
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:09,719
What's wrong? Got hurt?

994
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:10,800
I'll wash it with water.

995
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,159
Yang, what's wrong with your arm?

996
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,199
Did you break your arm?

997
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:14,840
Does it hurt?

998
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,719
It's okay.

999
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:17,280
Just wash it with water.

1000
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,760
Come on.

1001
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,000
Come and take a look.

1002
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,760
I'll buy medicine.

1003
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
He might have a fracture.

1004
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,320
Bai, no need.

1005
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,400
I'll go buy meds.

1006
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,880
You go home.

1007
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,639
I'll wait for Bai.

1008
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,639
Do you get angry as soon as you see me?

1009
00:44:58,639 --> 00:44:59,320
I don't.

1010
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,199
Can you tell me why?

1011
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,159
Didn't you hear me?

1012
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,039
I said I don't.

1013
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:14,960
Lin Zhitao, you're a coward,

1014
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,880
you know?

1015
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,079
Wash it with water and it won't hurt?

1016
00:45:23,616 --> 00:45:24,519
You remember it all.

1017
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,480
Why are you pretending
to be a stranger to me?

1018
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,039
I don't know what I did to you.

1019
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:30,800
I mean it.

1020
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,000
You left us and walked away.

1021
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,480
Must we talk about this here?

1022
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,320
Yes.

1023
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:38,239
I came here

1024
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,280
just to talk about this.

1025
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,679
What else?

1026
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,440
About moving graves?

1027
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
I don't care
where Lin Zhengfeng is buried

1028
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,000
at all.

1029
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,440
I don't want to bring up the past.

1030
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,840
I was also in your past, right?

1031
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:56,679
All these years,

1032
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,039
I've been keeping your number,

1033
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,639
but I've never called you

1034
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:00,320
because I know

1035
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,000
you've gone

1036
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,239
to where you can be better.

1037
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,800
I want you to be better.

1038
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,440
I am not a jinx.

1039
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,440
I've been running into you.

1040
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,559
That's not what I want.

1041
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,320
I don't know what to do.

1042
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,000
Should I talk to you?

1043
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,440
Should I make everything clear?

1044
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,360
We are family.

1045
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,079
Lin Zhiyang, you go home.

1046
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,159
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1047
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,760
There is no tomorrow.

1048
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,320
I won't talk to you tomorrow.

1049
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,880
Today,

1050
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,880
I want to give myself one last chance.

1051
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:53,000
You should also give yourself a chance.

1052
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:54,480
If you want to be a stranger,

1053
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,679
it's okay.

1054
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:57,960
Anyway,

1055
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,360
I have always been alone.

1056
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,719
Just now,

1057
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,119
you pretended you had a method

1058
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,559
and you could solve anything.

1059
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:11,199
Actually, you're a total coward,

1060
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,039
you know?

1061
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,519
Yes, I haven't read as much as you,

1062
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,920
but I know very well

1063
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,880
what you are avoiding.

1064
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,639
The past is already gone.

1065
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,360
None of us can change it.

1066
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:25,920
You and I

1067
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,320
shared experiences.

1068
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,119
It happened.

1069
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,639
I've already moved on.

1070
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,840
What about you, Lin Zhitao?

1071
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
What about you?

1072
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,440
Some people can get over the past.

1073
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,239
Some people can't.

1074
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,559
Sadly,

1075
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:39,960
I'm the one who can't get over it.

1076
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,119
Where can I go?

1077
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Where should I go?

1078
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,280
I left you.

1079
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,199
But where can I go?

1080
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:48,400
I'm not the old me anymore.

1081
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,960
I'm a selfish person.

1082
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,400
I've been selfish for a long time.

1083
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,440
I don't deserve to have a family.

1084
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,280
I shouldn't.

1085
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,239
Did I make myself clear?

1086
00:47:56,599 --> 00:47:57,800
