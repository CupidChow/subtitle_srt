00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,079
Lawyer Xiao
has told you everything, right?

2
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,399
Just tell me the plan.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,519
Mr. Wan,

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,920
before discussing the plan,

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,920
I suggest

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,640
you should first suspend
your school's external activities

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,920
for a while.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,399
What we are paying for

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,119
is your legal service,

10
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,439
not for you to tell me how to do things.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,600
A competent lawyer

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,039
helps their clients avoid risks,

13
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,159
especially when these risks

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,840
could lead to

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
criminal liability.

16
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,399
I have drafted the affidavit

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
of forgiveness.

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,600
If there are no issues,

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,479
you can just sign it.

20
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:15,488
(Criminal Affidavit of Forgiveness)

21
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,280
Haven't we paid you

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
enough legal fees?

23
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,519
All of this

24
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:25,799
is for your own good.

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,760
We intend

26
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,719
to get a suspended sentence

27
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:31,359
for Wang Hengquan

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
or even

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,760
not to prosecute him,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,000
so that this matter

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,040
can quickly pass.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,200
Pass?

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,920
He came to the school to assault me.

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,159
And you want me to let it go?

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,079
What will the other parents think?

36
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,400
They will think I'm guilty of something.

37
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,760
If I don't pursue this,

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,359
how will my school recruit students?

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
And if

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,439
the school is without you,

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
does recruiting still matter?

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,719
You know very well

43
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,159
whether you have done it.

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,280
But

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,360
if you push them too hard,

46
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,039
it'll be a lose-lose situation

47
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,319
that benefits no one.

48
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:46,533
=Endless Protection=

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,957
=Episode 21=

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,560
Lin Zhiyang.

51
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,719
Lin Zhiyang?

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,479
Don't you have anywhere else to go?

53
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:14,199
Why do you keep coming here?

54
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,039
Lin Zhitao,

55
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,720
why didn't you

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,800
eat the food I brought you?

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,879
It's all gone bad.

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,399
I didn't have time to eat it.

59
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
What are you talking about?

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,120
You've got to eat.

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,480
Did you bring a bunch again?

62
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,120
The food will spoil again
by the next time you come.

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,519
Don't wait for next time.

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,240
Haven't eaten, right?

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,040
Oh my.

66
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,079
Look at you.

67
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,040
You can stay in your own kitchen.

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,680
Why do you keep coming here to show off?

69
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,199
What?

70
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,759
Lin Zhitao,

71
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:52,000
I truly admire you.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,279
It's not easy

73
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,879
for you to survive.

74
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,879
I forgot.

75
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,240
Don't act like a big shot

76
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,480
as if you're the one in charge.

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,079
At your age,

78
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,000
shouldn't you date someone, get married,

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,519
and have a child if you have the time?

80
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,279
Quickly have one.

81
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,759
I'll take care of them for you.

82
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,720
If I have a child

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,399
and bring them here,

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,879
wouldn't you feed them

85
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,160
spoiled food?

86
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,839
Lin Zhiyang, tell me.

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,160
If one day you really become a dad

88
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,839
and your kid

89
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,839
is bullied by an old scoundrel,

90
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,759
what would you do?

91
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,600
I'd fight him.

92
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,360
I'd call Bai

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
and Lu Sheng

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
to fight him together.

95
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,639
So you'd definitely go all out, right?

96
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,040
Of course.

97
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
We didn't get a responsible dad.

98
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,879
But I have to find a way to become one.

99
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,680
How is grave relocating going?

100
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,639
Are we doing it?

101
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,959
Forget about that.

102
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,480
He should be thankful
we didn't dig him up.

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,879
Let him stay away from Mom.

104
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,079
Stop doing that.

105
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,279
Stop smelling over there.

106
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,759
Come here and smell these.

107
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,920
Don't touch the soy sauce.

108
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,879
I haven't finished yet.

109
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,639
Hurry up.

110
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,439
My hands are dirty.

111
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,319
Look at my books here.

112
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,439
I have so many of them.

113
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,480
No one else reads them.

114
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,879
Read them if you're free

115
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,879
to get further education.

116
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,800
Look at Bai Enyu.

117
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,639
He even passed the judicial exam.

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Further what?

119
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,040
Get further education and study.

120
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,040
Read books and take exams.

121
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,720
Will you do that?

122
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,879
Do what?

123
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,959
At my age, I shouldn't be studying.

124
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,240
Stop comparing me to others.

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm not comparing you to others.

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,480
That's Bai Enyu, okay?

127
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,000
That's the minimum standard.

128
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,240
Listen to me.

129
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,720
Whether you

130
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,759
get married or have kids,

131
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,680
I won't get involved.

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,600
That's your business.

133
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,800
But you must study.

134
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,879
If you don't study,

135
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,160
you'll suffer in the future.

136
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,759
Okay.

137
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,560
I'll study

138
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,120
and get married.

139
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,079
Promise me one thing too.

140
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:07,680
What?

141
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Learn to cook.

142
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,639
- What?
- I mean it.

143
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,560
Cooking is very simple.

144
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,000
It's not as difficult as you think.

145
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,319
Think about it.

146
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,040
One day, I may have kids

147
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
after I'm married,

148
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,680
and I may be busy studying

149
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,839
to improve myself

150
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,480
and progress like you said.

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,959
If you make yourself sick,
who cares for you?

152
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,160
I can cook, okay?

153
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,199
Wash your hands before cooking, alright?

154
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,240
I'll wash my hands.

155
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,399
You can cook,
and you act like it's a big deal.

156
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,279
I'll wash my hands.

157
00:07:53,396 --> 00:07:58,240
(Dance Competition Scholarship)

158
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:08,800
Captain Du.

159
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:09,759
Go ahead.

160
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,759
Master.

161
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,600
He's asleep. Keep it down.

162
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:38,759
How's the Wan Xuemin case going?

163
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
Yuqing has been examined.

164
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,399
Her medical record.

165
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,080
Take a look.

166
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,000
There are lacerations
in her private parts.

167
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,200
What about Wan Xuemin?

168
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,440
We got nothing from him.

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,799
Why?

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
We verified with the civil police.

171
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,159
They said they've asked him.

172
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,679
But he wouldn't admit it.

173
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,799
I could tell

174
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,440
from last time.

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,720
He's very composed.

176
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,960
Couldn't we get anything useful at all?

177
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
They said they've looked thoroughly.

178
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,840
They took him in for questioning

179
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,320
but could get nothing out of him.

180
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
No crime time or crime location.

181
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,240
Simply nothing.

182
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,799
More importantly, the victim

183
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,120
wouldn't say anything either.

184
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,279
We got nothing.

185
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
Master.

186
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,080
Master.

187
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,039
If he really did it,

188
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,679
let's bring him here for questioning.

189
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,320
No need.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,840
He's cunning.

191
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,600
Hu Minmin's and Jiayi's cases
have been merged.

192
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,440
Plus the fact that Yuqing
was sexually assaulted,

193
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,639
it's reached the criteria
for escalation.

194
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,600
Don't worry.

195
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,080
None of them could get away with these.

196
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,679
I don't worry.

197
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,600
I just noticed
you've been quite hot-tempered lately.

198
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,840
I made some soothing tea.

199
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:12,960
No, thanks.

200
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,240
It's bitter.

201
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
I made it especially for you.

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,559
Anything sweet?

203
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,080
You surely don't have it.

204
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,159
That's not your thing.

205
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,559
I remember
there was a time the two of us

206
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,759
went on a business trip.

207
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,000
Then the local management

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,919
praised their beef noodles

209
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:30,960
in their cafeteria.

210
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
And you asked them,

211
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,919
"Is there rice?"

212
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:33,799
Do you remember?

213
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,360
Well, I don't like noodles.

214
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:39,720
When we were young,
we went to the grassroots for training.

215
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,519
I recall that place
had only sweet potatoes.

216
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,080
Every time we came back,

217
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,279
Prosecutor Fu ate

218
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,120
tons of bowls of rice.

219
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,200
He seems stingy usually.

220
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,960
But he always brought candy
for the local kids.

221
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,039
He is

222
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,000
just a bit

223
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,159
stingy

224
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,440
and very cautious in doing things.

225
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,559
Please don't mention him.

226
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,759
He always overreacts
over trivial matters.

227
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,039
But he is still a very honest person.

228
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,039
In your future work,

229
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,679
you should trust him
and rely on him more.

230
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,559
Why would I?

231
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:13,600
I rely on you.

232
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,000
Perfect.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
Give these two to me.

234
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,519
Do you have any other instructions?

235
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,679
Work hard.

236
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,879
Of course, I will.

237
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,039
I just don't know
where to put all my energy.

238
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:27,840
I'm leaving now.

239
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,568
(Prosecution for the public good,
Law enforcement for the people)

240
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,879
Hello?

241
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,639
Ms. Zheng,

242
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,039
can you come to our office?

243
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Got some clues to Wangjiang case.

244
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,320
Okay, I'll be right over.

245
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:24,065
(Notice on the Appointment and Removal
of Zheng Yanlai)

246
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,279
Come in.

247
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,600
Everyone, be careful.

248
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,559
You're here.

249
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,360
You've found her?

250
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:49,720
(National Police DNA Database,
Shen Aping)

251
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,279
Look,

252
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,720
here is

253
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,159
the final comparison result.

254
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,159
Here.

255
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,440
Look at this information.

256
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,519
It all basically matched.

257
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,200
We now have enough evidence

258
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,759
to prove the identity of Jane Doe.

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,720
Her real name

260
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,279
is Shen Aping.

261
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:13,639
When Director Lu

262
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,720
gave me the information
about Jane Doe earlier,

263
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,919
I put it into the database.

264
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,000
As soon as our database was updated,

265
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,000
it directly matched

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,440
with Jane Doe's immediate family.

267
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
I did not expect this.

268
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:19,392
(To Lu Wenzhao: We found out
she was called Shen Aping.)

269
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:30,368
(From Lu Wenzhao: As I expected,
she had a beautiful name.)

270
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:38,799
The defendant He Guoqiang

271
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,159
used violent means to rape the victim

272
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,279
and killed her

273
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,960
with extremely cruel methods.

274
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,399
When the victim's body was found,

275
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,960
she was unclothed and unrecognizable.

276
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,399
It's hard

277
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,559
to imagine what torment

278
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,039
a blooming young girl

279
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:56,080
suffered at the end of her life

280
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,879
and what kind of longing

281
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,399
she had

282
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,360
for her family

283
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,679
and life when she was dying.

284
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,440
The defendant refused

285
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,639
to confess after being caught,

286
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,120
leading to the victim's family

287
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,080
being unaware

288
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,159
of her death for five years.

289
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,120
They did not even get

290
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,320
to say goodbye to her.

291
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,840
Moreover,

292
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,639
during the first trial,

293
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,399
the defendant made all kinds of excuses

294
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,360
and slandered the victim's identity

295
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,720
and profession in a frantic manner.

296
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,080
To protect himself,

297
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,240
he smeared the victim's

298
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,919
spotless reputation,
the only thing she had left

299
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,519
in this world.

300
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,159
The defendant's

301
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,679
rape and murder behaviors

302
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,000
have violated national law

303
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,480
and shouldn't be tolerated.

304
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,399
He should be severely punished by law

305
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,879
to uphold justice

306
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,360
and to comfort the victim.

307
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,120
Defendant He Guoqiang's

308
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,279
facts of the crime are clear

309
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,639
with true and sufficient evidence.

310
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,440
His criminal actions
are particularly heinous

311
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,279
with severe consequences.

312
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,840
He should be punished accordingly

313
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,559
with charges of rape
and intentional homicide.

314
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,399
He should get the death penalty

315
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,320
and be executed immediately.

316
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,840
All rise.

317
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,759
Based on defendant He Guoqiang's
criminal facts,

318
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,360
nature, circumstances,

319
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,399
and the degree of harm to society,

320
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,240
considering the prosecution's
sentencing recommendation,

321
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,679
according to Article 236
and Paragraph 1 of Article 237

322
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,399
of the Criminal Law

323
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,320
of the People's Republic of China,

324
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,799
the judgment is as follows:

325
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,240
For Defendant He Guoqiang, the penalties
for multiple crimes should be combined.

326
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,600
He's sentenced to death penalty

327
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,279
and deprived of political rights.

328
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,000
All sit down.

329
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,200
Take the defendant away.

330
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:26,368
(Lin Zhitao, Bai Enyu, Cheng Wei,
People's Procuratorate of Yunhai)

331
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:02,480
Ms. Zheng.

332
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,240
Ms. Zheng.

333
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,200
Jia.

334
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:10,880
Congratulations.

335
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
What are the flowers for?

336
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:14,920
Look at you.

337
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,039
Why did you buy flowers?

338
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,759
It's a big event.

339
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,079
- Flowers are necessary.
- Zheng.

340
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,279
Zheng.

341
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,200
Fu.

342
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,839
Jia, you're here.

343
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,640
Hello.

344
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,720
Give me the car keys.

345
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,319
Okay.

346
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,839
You guys chat first.

347
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,839
Jia is quite romantic.

348
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,160
I told him not to send flowers.

349
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,319
Why didn't you say goodbye to them?

350
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,920
They all

351
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,480
have their own work.

352
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,000
My reassignment is quite normal.

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,680
So there's no need for a farewell.

354
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,440
Are you here to see me off?

355
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,759
I'm not.

356
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,279
You are being promoted,

357
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,799
and we both serve the people.

358
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,039
We'll meet again.

359
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,839
That's right.

360
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,599
When I first met you,

361
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,279
you were just a little girl.

362
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,240
Right.

363
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,039
Since we knew each other
and worked together,

364
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:06,880
it's been

365
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,559
almost 30 years.

366
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,079
It's 29 years and five months.

367
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
On the orientation day,

368
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,079
we took a group photo.

369
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,559
You were on the left in the first row.

370
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,000
And I was on the right
in the fourth row.

371
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,799
You still remember that?

372
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,119
Here is a gift for you.

373
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,279
Women's Federation work requires travel.

374
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,279
Fu, you...

375
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,200
Are you worried about my travel safety?

376
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,519
Who gives shoes as a gift?

377
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,359
No.

378
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,319
I wish you
a bright and smooth journey ahead.

379
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:32,920
Okay.

380
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,680
Thank you.

381
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,400
You're welcome.

382
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,920
Then those kids

383
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,960
are in your care now.

384
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,640
Okay.

385
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,880
The next time we meet,

386
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,720
I'll have to call you

387
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,960
Chairwoman Zheng.

388
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,359
The revolution is not yet successful.

389
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,400
We need to work harder.

390
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,119
Come on, let's have a hug.

391
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,200
Okay.

392
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,559
Director Xu.

393
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:19,960
You're here.

394
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,519
Thank you.

395
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,640
Brother.

396
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
Haven't washed their hands.

397
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,519
Ming.

398
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,608
What are you playing?

399
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:29,359
Hu Li,

400
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,440
are you happy?

401
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
Yes.

402
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,160
Keep playing.

403
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:36,160
Take me to see what you're playing.

404
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,160
Let me see.

405
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:38,839
Look.

406
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,720
I didn't build it well.

407
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,359
It's that ball, right?

408
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,279
Then you can build a block.

409
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,519
Show me how to build.

410
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,039
Do you want to build a staircase?

411
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,279
Yes, we can.

412
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,559
It might collapse.

413
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,079
Just try.

414
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,160
Mine looks good too.

415
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,200
Yours looks good too.

416
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,519
You're doing it wrong.

417
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,960
Don't sleep.

418
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,640
Try it,

419
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,440
Lu Ming.

420
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,519
No.

421
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,519
Have you grown taller?

422
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,079
No, it's an arm.

423
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:25,799
It's an arm?

424
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:26,599
- Hu Li.
- Right.

425
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,160
Hu Li.

426
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:30,920
Hu Li.

427
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,640
Come on, give me the scissors.

428
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,400
This is dangerous.

429
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:33,920
Okay?

430
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:37,200
Okay, I know, I know.

431
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,680
Director,

432
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,119
let me speak with Hu Li alone.

433
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,200
I'll ask her.

434
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,359
Kids,

435
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,640
come with me to wash your hands.

436
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
We will eat something delicious later.

437
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,759
Come on. Wash our little hands.

438
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,640
Then we will
eat something delicious, okay?

439
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,599
Wash hands.

440
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,480
Follow me.

441
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,119
Come on.

442
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,519
There's food.

443
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,839
Yes, there's something tasty.

444
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,759
Look, done. It's shorter.

445
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:18,440
I know.

446
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,839
Actually,

447
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,160
you just wanted to get your hair cut.

448
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,759
In the future,

449
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,079
you can ask them or me

450
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,680
for help.

451
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,079
You don't need
to keep many things inside.

452
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,559
You can ask for help.

453
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,680
Hair. Cut.

454
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,160
C-Cut hair.

455
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:43,119
Right.

456
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,000
It's just a haircut.

457
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,960
We're getting a haircut right now.

458
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,200
I still want to cut.

459
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,960
Where else?

460
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,359
Here.

461
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,599
This is called the forehead.

462
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,480
The hair here is called bangs.

463
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,720
Forehead.

464
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:03,839
Bangs.

465
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,680
Did your sister also cut your hair?

466
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,680
My sister cut.

467
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,599
And those older sisters
who came to your place to play,

468
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,880
did they also cut hair?

469
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,680
Then what did they do?

470
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
I still want to cut.

471
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:29,920
Okay.

472
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,319
Come on.

473
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,319
Cut here.

474
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,559
Hu Li,

475
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
I can't cut here.

476
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,359
You can.

477
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,599
My sister cut here.

478
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,799
Remember.

479
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:12,319
In the future, don't listen to anyone

480
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,519
except for Lu Sheng.

481
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,279
And your face.

482
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,079
Make sure to blacken your face
before going out.

483
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,119
And your hair.

484
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,799
Cut it when it goes past the ears.

485
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,039
Hair that's past the ears should be cut.

486
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,920
Sister, no.

487
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,880
Sister, no.

488
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:45,839
No, no.

489
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,519
No.

490
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,160
Don't cut.

491
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,839
You never listen to what I say.

492
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:04,200
Sister,

493
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,119
I...

494
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,839
You must cut your hair today.

495
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:09,599
I... No...

496
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,119
No, stop!

497
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,359
Sister, don't.

498
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,200
I don't want to.

499
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,079
Come out.

500
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,599
Are you afraid of me?

501
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,519
Why are you afraid of me?

502
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,359
Do you know who I am?

503
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,279
Do you know who I am?

504
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,799
Do you know who I am?

505
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:31,072
(God of Wealth)

506
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,039
Sister?

507
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,240
Sister?

508
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,279
Sister?

509
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,559
Sister?

510
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,119
Sister,

511
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,480
I'll cut my hair.

512
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,440
Sister.

513
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,664
(Office Area)

514
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
It's confirmed.

515
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,519
Come on.

516
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:20,880
Hu Minmin committed suicide.

517
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,359
Here, take a look.

518
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,200
The autopsy report

519
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,759
and Hu Li's testimony

520
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,000
can corroborate each other.

521
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
Besides, on the scissors,

522
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,200
there were indeed only Hu Minmin's

523
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,519
and Hu Li's fingerprints.

524
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,000
So our analysis is

525
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,000
that after Hu Minmin died,

526
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Hu Li thought her sister
was ignoring her out of anger,

527
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,839
so she pulled out the scissors

528
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:47,039
to cut her hair herself.

529
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,440
You mean

530
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,680
Hu Li has no concept of death?

531
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,759
I think Hu Li is really pitiful

532
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,000
being like this.

533
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,039
Wait.

534
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,200
What was Hu Minmin's motive for suicide?

535
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,880
It couldn't just be because

536
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:04,960
Hu Li argued

537
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,200
with her, right?

538
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,160
We went to see Hu Li again.

539
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,079
She still can't communicate well.

540
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,000
But we asked Lu Sheng
to act as a translator.

541
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,160
We are sure that

542
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,279
she had seen Wan Xuemin.

543
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,920
So our analysis is

544
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,960
that Wan Xuemin and Hu Li

545
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,079
must have met

546
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,200
in Hu Minmin's place.

547
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,680
Sister, be happy.

548
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,920
Be happy, sister. Don't cry.

549
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,240
You're the younger sister, right?

550
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,640
What do you want?

551
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:39,759
I...

552
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,519
You stopped recruiting students.

553
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,559
I can only come to you.

554
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,039
You've hidden for so long.

555
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,079
That's impressive.

556
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,000
So she is actually a girl.

557
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,000
Move aside.

558
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,119
Move!

559
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,079
I promise you.

560
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,200
I promise you.

561
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,480
I will recruit students.

562
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,319
I promise you.

563
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,799
Till 9th.

564
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,319
You know what I will do
if you can't recruit anyone.

565
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,519
Ma'am.

566
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,119
Ma'am.

567
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm sorry.

568
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,000
She is naturally introverted.

569
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,519
She's been even more so these days.

570
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,119
Her door has been closed all day.

571
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,039
And she won't talk to me.

572
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,359
I really don't know what to do.

573
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,680
Leave it to us.

574
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,119
Yuqing.

575
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,920
Look, there are two chairs over there.

576
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,680
Later, you can

577
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,880
choose one and sit down.

578
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,920
Then imagine

579
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,480
there's a person on the opposite chair.

580
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,799
And you can talk to them.

581
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,119
You can ask them anything

582
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,599
and talk about anything with them.

583
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,039
Don't worry.

584
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:14,920
You can stay alone in this room.

585
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,960
We will go out.

586
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,199
But when you need me,

587
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,880
I will come in to accompany you.

588
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,159
Alright?

589
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:27,880
Go ahead.

590
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,559
I will go out first.

591
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,280
Ma'am, don't worry.

592
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,760
Let's give her some time.

593
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:02,039
You saw the house-tree-person test's result too.

594
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,320
Right now,

595
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,519
her self-evaluation

596
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,840
is very low.

597
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,199
That's why she relies on you

598
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:10,679
and the teacher.

599
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,159
She even wants to rely on us strangers.

600
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,039
But

601
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,119
if she really encounters

602
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,559
a difficult situation,

603
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,159
she might choose not to tell you.

604
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,599
She might doubt and harm herself.

605
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,719
Because to her,

606
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:29,159
she cannot solve such things.

607
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,079
She cannot handle them.

608
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,559
But if she just talks

609
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,800
to a toy like this,

610
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,199
will that help?

611
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,239
Let's try it first.

612
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,440
Let's give her a private space

613
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:48,679
for her to face the toy.

614
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,000
Then we will try to guide her

615
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,199
to speak to a real person.

616
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:53,960
Don't you also want

617
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,599
to know what she's thinking?

618
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,239
Yes, I do.

619
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,119
Don't worry.

620
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,119
Trust us.

621
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Trust Yuqing.

622
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,519
Okay?

623
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,559
Who do you think she sees this bear as?

624
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,679
Anyone is possible.

625
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,480
From her interaction with the toy,

626
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:26,800
we can probably guess
who she sees it as.

627
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,960
Wasn't she nervous
during her last treatment?

628
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:29,960
Yes.

629
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,280
It wasn't very obvious before.

630
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,920
But with the toy

631
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,039
as a clear projection object,

632
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,079
her emotions intensified.

633
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,039
Can you let me go?

634
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,320
I...

635
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,039
I was wrong.

636
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,320
I was wrong.

637
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I was wrong.

638
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,119
I was wrong.

639
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,920
I know who the toy is now.

640
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:33,400
Yuqing,

641
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:35,480
don't be afraid. We are all here.

642
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,440
We can protect you.

643
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,840
Did I do something wrong?

644
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,480
No.

645
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,079
You didn't do anything wrong.

646
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,199
I...

647
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,199
I don't...

648
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,880
Ma'am, can you tell me the answer?

649
00:37:56,159 --> 00:37:57,800
What kind of answer do you want?

650
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,239
You came in

651
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,840
because I did something wrong.

652
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,320
In this empty chair test,

653
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:11,719
I must have done something wrong.

654
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,360
Yuqing, look at me.

655
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:17,280
Look at me.

656
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,880
This is not a test.

657
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,920
No one is asking you for an answer.

658
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,559
You didn't do anything wrong.

659
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,599
You are a very good child.

660
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,360
But I hurt Dad.

661
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,239
I made everyone unhappy.

662
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,320
