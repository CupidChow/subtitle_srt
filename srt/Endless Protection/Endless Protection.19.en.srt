6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,520
(Hu Minmin Death Case Analysis)
The time of death was about 1:30 AM.

7
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,159
The weapon

8
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,120
is suspected to be scissors
found at the scene.

9
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
(Victim: Hu Minmin)
The fingerprints collected

10
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,199
was sent to the forensics department.

11
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,520
Additionally, we also found

12
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,639
a male footprint.

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,479
(Suspect: Lu Sheng, missing)
The shoe size

14
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,159
matches the size

15
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
of Lu Sheng.

16
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,639
What's the victim's identity?

17
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
This house was rented.

18
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
On the rental contract,

19
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,199
it's under the name Hu Minmin.

20
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,879
But the ID number she provided

21
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,199
could not be verified.

22
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,879
It is very likely fake.

23
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,680
Other information she left behind

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
also matches the fake ID.

25
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,840
Let me add a key point.

26
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,120
There should be

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,479
two people living there.

28
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,000
There's a little boy.

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
The boy

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
(Hu Li, victim's brother, missing)
should be her brother.

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,039
But he is currently missing.

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,759
Have you interviewed the neighbors?

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,000
What was Hu Minmin's relationship

34
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,319
with Lu Sheng?

35
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,159
Possibly romantic.

36
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,000
Because

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
the neighbors said

38
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,439
they often saw Lu Sheng
buying food for her brother.

39
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,680
Lu Sheng.

40
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,159
Have you mentioned this

41
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,000
to Bai Enyu?

42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,112
(Yang's Diner)

43
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,840
Is anyone here?

44
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:57,919
Is anyone here?

45
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,800
Not open right now.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,159
Is the owner here?

47
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,039
We're closed now, sir.

48
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,639
Please wait.

49
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,960
Are you the owner? Come over.

50
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,680
Come.

51
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,599
What do you want?

52
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
(Police, Du Guofeng)
We are police.

53
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,639
Relax.

54
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,360
We just want

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,439
to ask you some questions.

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,240
Lu Sheng

57
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,279
works here, right?

58
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,439
Yes.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
What's wrong with him?

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,959
Here.

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,879
Do you know this person?

62
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:34,600
I remember her.

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,920
She caused a scene here once.

64
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
Caused a scene?

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,879
With whom?

66
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,639
With Lu Sheng.

67
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,800
I don't know the specific situation.

68
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,199
Where is he?

69
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:51,800
Where's Lu Sheng?

70
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,319
I don't know.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,879
It's working time and he hasn't come.

72
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,800
If you see him,

73
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,079
call the police.

74
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,680
Officer,

75
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,319
has anything happened to him?

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,040
None of your business.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,759
If you see him, remember to report.

78
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:08,600
Let's go.

79
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,600
What are you doing?

80
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,079
Check if it's hanging securely.

81
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,959
Still checking?

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
It's been over half an hour.

83
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,519
I must hang it properly.

84
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,560
A comfortable environment

85
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,639
helps the kids relax.

86
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,600
Alright, it's straight now.

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,839
Tilted again.

88
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,120
Are your eyes okay?

89
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,120
Mr. Yang.

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,808
Why are you calling so early?

91
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,279
Where is he?

92
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,240
Alright. I got it.

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,759
My brother, right? What's up?

94
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:55,776
About dinner reservation tonight.

95
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:56,600
I'll make a call.

96
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,560
The number you dialed is powered off.

97
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,639
Sorry.

98
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,160
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

99
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:21,920
So cute!

100
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,040
Look here, look here!

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,120
You're back.

102
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:34,920
Lu...

103
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,399
Lu Sheng has been waiting for you.

104
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,680
Come out!

105
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
What exactly do you want?

106
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,800
Not enough in prison?

107
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:58,639
You know the situation?

108
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,519
Why ignore my calls

109
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,560
and texts?

110
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,079
Still being stubborn, huh?

111
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm afraid he did it.

112
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,319
Bai.

113
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,639
Save that child, please.

114
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,800
(Public Security)

115
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,600
I thought her brother was pitiful,

116
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,279
so I helped a few times.

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
But she's really scared

118
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,759
when I got close to him.

119
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,480
Once she even followed me to the stall,

120
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,519
scolding me for meddling.

121
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,600
Later, her brother got lost.

122
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,160
I helped her find him,

123
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
then, we became closer.

124
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,680
You said you helped her brother.

125
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,639
How did you help?

126
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,959
She was often not home.

127
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
Her brother had nowhere to eat,

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,959
so I brought him food.

129
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,360
I had people helping me,

130
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:57,439
but they didn't.

131
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,879
So I wanted to help them.

132
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,639
Let me confirm again.

133
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,360
Hold on a moment.

134
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,000
When was the last time you went

135
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,279
to Hu Minmin's house?

136
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,000
The night of September 9th,

137
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,439
her birthday.

138
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,279
Did you notice
anything unusual that night?

139
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,560
No.

140
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:28,120
From September 9th to the incident,

141
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,000
there was a week.

142
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,919
Didn't you have any contact?

143
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,519
Thank you for today.

144
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,759
It's my first time
celebrating a birthday.

145
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,639
Are you happy?

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,840
By the way, when is Hu Li's birthday?

147
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,024
Let's celebrate at the stall.

148
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,399
You better head back early.

149
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,200
Okay.

150
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,080
Don't send flowers anymore.

151
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,679
Don't celebrate birthdays anymore.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,279
Don't meet again.

153
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,559
That day,

154
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,360
she said,

155
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,200
"You should go."

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,879
"Don't meet again."

157
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,639
No conflicts, no arguments.

158
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,679
Why did she suddenly

159
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,799
not want you to see her?

160
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,639
I don't know.

161
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,919
She's always like this.

162
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,159
Suddenly appearing,

163
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,399
and suddenly leaving.

164
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,240
Always.

165
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,960
On the night of September 15th,

166
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,799
what time did you get off work?

167
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,879
That night, a group of customers

168
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,679
drank too much.

169
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,679
I got off work at nearly 2:30 AM.

170
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,559
After work,

171
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,384
you went straight
to Hu Minmin's house, right?

172
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,919
No.

173
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,120
I went home.

174
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Approximately

175
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,919
dawn,

176
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,639
Hu Li came to find me.

177
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,399
Who is it?

178
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,360
What's going on?

179
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,648
Let's go.

180
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,200
Go.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,960
Then why didn't you

182
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,519
report it immediately?

183
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,000
And

184
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:12,360
why was your first reaction

185
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,159
to buy a ticket to flee?

186
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:17,960
I did buy a ticket,

187
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,399
but I didn't flee.

188
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,919
I didn't want to.

189
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,879
Please.

190
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:27,600
Prosecutor Lin.

191
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:32,440
I didn't intend to hide this from you.

192
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,159
I just wanted to understand
what's going on first.

193
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,120
Then what's next?

194
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,600
There's nothing next.

195
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,440
Lu Sheng really learned well from you.

196
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,320
You two are

197
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,200
quietly plotting some big move.

198
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,320
Prosecutor Lin.

199
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,559
Captain Du.

200
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,159
Lu Sheng's suspicion can be ruled out.

201
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:53,039
The food stall owner confirmed

202
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:55,440
that Lu Sheng was at the stall
the entire time

203
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,799
when the victim's killed.

204
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,920
No time to commit the crime.

205
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,960
- Oaky.
- Lu Sheng's worry was not unfounded.

206
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,000
The weapon only has

207
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,000
fingerprints from the victim

208
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,799
and this child.

209
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,360
Kid,

210
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,279
look how dirty your clothes are.

211
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,600
Let me help you change
into something clean.

212
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,240
Come on, I will help you.

213
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,159
Let's put the little bunny aside.

214
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,559
Come on.

215
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,080
Don't bite!

216
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,240
Kid.

217
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
Are you scared I'll take your bunny?

218
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,279
I won't.

219
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,480
Let's change into clean clothes.

220
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,159
Okay?

221
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,159
Take off the coat first.

222
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,320
No biting, alright?

223
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,879
Or I'll be angry.

224
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,559
I won't take your bunny.

225
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,840
Really.

226
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:58,840
Okay?

227
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,320
Take off the coat first.

228
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:04,679
Come on.

229
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,320
Good.

230
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,080
You mean he is a suspect.

231
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:10,440
He's just a kid.

232
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,519
If the victim

233
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,039
was completely off guard,

234
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,320
it's not impossible.

235
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,120
Moreover,

236
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,559
Hu Minmin

237
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:19,240
died at

238
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,840
about 1 AM.

239
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,480
But Hu Li

240
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,279
went to find Lu Sheng

241
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,600
the next morning.

242
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,879
He stayed with the body all night?

243
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:30,879
This...

244
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,840
Is it possible?

245
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,519
He's so young.

246
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,440
What do you plan to do?

247
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Just keep him here?

248
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,120
We'll release him,

249
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,679
but not casually.

250
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:39,559
Look.

251
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,600
We haven't figured out

252
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,879
Hu Minmin

253
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:42,759
and Hu Li's identity,

254
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,080
so far.

255
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,399
Without relatives,

256
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,080
where can he go

257
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,399
if we release him now?

258
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,720
Well, just give him to us.

259
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,480
We'll take him

260
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,879
and think of another way. Okay?

261
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,480
- That's great.
- That's the only way.

262
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,879
Captain Du.

263
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:58,799
How is he?

264
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,679
- It's a girl.
- Girl?

265
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:01,840
Hu Li?

266
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,480
Director.

267
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,480
Hi.

268
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:41,440
I'm really sorry

269
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
to trouble you.

270
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,320
It's okay.

271
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,759
I'll tell briefly

272
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,080
about this kid.

273
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,039
She may be non-verbal

274
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,039
and hasn't been exposed to society.

275
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,639
When hungry, she'll ask for food.

276
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,879
When sleepy,
she'll find a place to sleep.

277
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,799
However,

278
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,159
she may have issues managing emotions.

279
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,399
Sometimes,

280
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:00,759
she could show

281
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,320
violent tendencies.

282
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
So I have to tell you in advance.

283
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,480
It's okay. I understand.

284
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
For a child with no social exposure,

285
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,839
this reaction is normal.

286
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,759
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

287
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,400
Okay.

288
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,039
Coming.

289
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,880
You... What's wrong?

290
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:11,160
Minmin.

291
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:13,359
Minmin.

292
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,000
I...

293
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,680
I...

294
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,960
I have made up my mind.

295
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,279
I can support

296
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,119
both Hu Li and my brother.

297
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,599
I-I...

298
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,400
I've calculated it.

299
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,920
Their tuition fees
aren't that expensive.

300
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,079
They don't eat much either.

301
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,200
I can afford it.

302
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,160
I know I am quite good at lying.

303
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,799
But I haven't lied to you yet.

304
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,359
Why did you take it seriously?

305
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,039
Don't take it seriously.

306
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:21,216
(Practice the law
with virtues and righteousness)

307
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:27,712
(Yunhai the Judicial Evaluation Center
Test Report)

308
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:49,440
I forgot to pour you tea.

309
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,559
Here, have a cup.

310
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:56,480
As soon as you arrived,
I basically guessed the result.

311
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,400
Lu.

312
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,920
Do you think there's any chance

313
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,559
the DNA comparison result
could be wrong?

314
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,359
Impossible.

315
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,759
Science cannot be wrong.

316
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:16,680
Alright. I'll keep searching

317
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,480
at the TV station.

318
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:20,000
I believe I'll find it.

319
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,559
There's no time left.

320
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:26,200
I...

321
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:32,279
Forget it.

322
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:33,279
Forget it.

323
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,480
I know.

324
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,319
I know we are all unwilling to give up.

325
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:46,640
But we've done

326
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,440
what we could do.

327
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,599
Right?

328
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,000
Zheng.

329
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,319
At our age,

330
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,000
we should understand one thing.

331
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,759
Not every effort will be rewarded.

332
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,559
Maybe it's time for us to give up.

333
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,039
But it's hard to accept.

334
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,680
(Every tear carries endless longing.)

335
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,799
(Every reunion shines
with the light of hope.)

336
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,480
(Let's join hands)

337
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,799
(to embark on journeys
of family reunion.)

338
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,119
(Help separated families reunite.)

339
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,920
Cui Mingli called,

340
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,079
saying Jiayi hasn't been well lately

341
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,559
and doesn't want to go to school.

342
00:22:42,304 --> 00:22:43,240
What about the others?

343
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,359
Those who also like Sai Qi?

344
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,680
Sai Qi?

345
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,400
What Sai Qi?

346
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,960
A virtual character.

347
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,279
Her mental support.

348
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,200
I've checked.

349
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,296
Not in contact for a while.

350
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,480
(Today, the person seeking family)

351
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,559
(is a special guest.)

352
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,119
Victims of sexual assault

353
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,319
have different reactions.

354
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:07,440
Some seem fine at first,

355
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,759
but after days,

356
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,240
the trauma

357
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,680
might come back.

358
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,839
So how long is

359
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,359
the incubation period?

360
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,400
Not sure.

361
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,880
Maybe one day, one month,

362
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,160
one year, or several years.

363
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,519
The key is after it happened,

364
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,440
the condition
will definitely deteriorate.

365
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,160
About Hu Li,

366
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,319
there's no clue.

367
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,559
And Lu Sheng keeps asking me every day.

368
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,279
(Hello, everyone.)

369
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,039
(I am Prosecutor Zheng Yanlai)

370
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,720
(from People's Procuratorate of Yunhai.)

371
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,000
(Today I came to
Waiting for Your Return)

372
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,240
(for a case)

373
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,000
(I've been pursuing for five years.)

374
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
(I don't know if today)

375
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,640
(will bring us hope,)

376
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,152
(or another round of disappointment.)

377
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,200
(Waiting for Your Return)
(But I still want to try.)

378
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,559
(We will seize every opportunity)

379
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,599
(to help this little girl find herself,)

380
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,079
(and find her way home.)

381
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,039
(Ms. Zheng.)

382
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,960
(I actually have a personal question.)

383
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,240
(I know)

384
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,680
(you have no personal connection
to this girl.)

385
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,839
(What has kept you so committed)

386
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,519
(to tracking down the truth)

387
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,440
(behind her story)

388
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,200
(for five whole years?)

389
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,839
(This is the duty of a prosecutor.)

390
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,279
(Punishing crime and upholding justice,)

391
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,720
(to bring peace to the deceased.)

392
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,000
(However,)

393
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,559
(this little girl left us)

394
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:26,759
(very little clues.)

395
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,119
(Only a cold corpse,)

396
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,200
(and sets of cold data.)

397
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:33,799
(She's between 15 and 17 years old,)

398
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,759
(1.58 meters tall,)

399
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,799
(with type A blood.)

400
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,599
(Name unknown,)

401
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,000
(place of birth unknown,
appearance unknown.)

402
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,759
(But why should she be unknown?)

403
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:46,160
(Who erased everything about her,)

404
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,920
(a living, breathing person?)

405
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,440
(In my mind's eye, I see her.)

406
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,960
(A blooming young girl,)

407
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:55,519
(someone like my own child.)

408
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,799
(I also want to say to this little girl,)

409
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,680
(please believe in us.)

410
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,759
(The country will not abandon you.)

411
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,559
(The law will not abandon you.)

412
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,240
(We will not abandon you either.)

413
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,079
(This is the bus)

414
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,920
(she took that day.)

415
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:18,799
(Ticket)
(And a ticket, soaked with water.)

416
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:22,559
(This is the floral dress she wore.)

417
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,160
(Such a bus,)

418
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,240
(I believe)

419
00:25:30,304 --> 00:25:32,359
(many people in Yunhai
who've lived here for years)

420
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,880
(have probably taken a bus like this.)

421
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,240
(This ticket.)

422
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,839
(It doesn't even
have a license plate number.)

423
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,440
(But I believe)

424
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,039
(many people)

425
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,680
(in front of the TV)

426
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,120
(might have seen such tickets.)

427
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,559
(Here, I want to call on all of you)

428
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:49,759
(watching our program.)

429
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,960
(If you have ever taken such a bus,)

430
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,319
(or have received such a ticket,)

431
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,039
(or if you remember)

432
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,960
(maybe in a moment)

433
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,319
you've seen

434
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,200
or been impressed

435
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,359
by this little girl

436
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,279
in a red floral dress,

437
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,279
please

438
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:08,200
call our program hotline

439
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,319
to provide us with more clues.

440
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,279
When the girl passed away,

441
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,400
she still wore a red string

442
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,480
on her ankle, like this.

443
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,000
It is still kept in our evidence room.

444
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,279
A red string threaded
through a peace knot

445
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,559
is a symbol every Chinese person understands.

446
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,160
(Peace and safety.)

447
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,680
(Return home soon.)

448
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
A good prosecutor.

449
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,799
(If her relatives and friends)

450
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,200
(are watching our program,)

451
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,039
(please contact us.)

452
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,119
(Help her find the way home.)

453
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,279
(In the end,)

454
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,880
(once again, we'd like to encourage)

455
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,200
(everyone watching our program)

456
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,559
(in front of the TV now.)

457
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,160
(If you,)

458
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,640
(your family,)

459
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,640
(your friends,)

460
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,599
(or colleagues)

461
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
(have any clues,)

462
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,680
(please)

463
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,480
(pick up the phone)

464
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,960
(and call our hotline.)

465
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,680
(We don't know)

466
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,319
(how many more such children are there.)

467
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:17,599
Please give this to Captain Du
of the Criminal Investigation Team.

468
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,680
This is the last thing

469
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,440
I can do for this girl.

470
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,440
Okay.

471
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Remember.

472
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,319
In our line of work,

473
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,599
you need to develop a good habit,

474
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,519
which is returning.

475
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,079
Always return things

476
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,480
to where you got them.

477
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Everything should be in order.

478
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,759
And also,

479
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:46,839
remember.

480
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,079
The things we deal with

481
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
aren't just data,

482
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,839
but real lives.

483
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,119
Alright.

484
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:00,480
It's time.

485
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,079
I'm off work.

486
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,319
I have to go see someone off.

487
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:20,359
(Body Identification Card,
Unidentified Body)

488
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,039
In the end,
I still don't know your name.

489
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,759
Sorry.

490
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,400
Doing that again? Give it!

491
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Give it!

492
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,880
What are you doing?

493
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,319
Playing?

494
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:16,920
Zhitao!

495
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,440
How old are you?

496
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,519
Get to work.

497
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,319
Get to work!

498
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:20,400
I am working!

499
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,839
Everything's handled already, okay?

500
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,880
I've already communicated
with Director Xu.

501
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,720
She'll update me with Hu Li.

502
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,519
I also sent her

503
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,160
a few articles on child psychology.

504
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
As for Cui Jiayi,

505
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,200
we need to pay attention to her emotion.

506
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,880
If it gets serious,

507
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,839
we'll call in a therapist.

508
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,920
Her school pressure is heavy too.

509
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,480
Maybe she should take a break?

510
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,400
Stop giving

511
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,680
any suggestions.

512
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,519
We should listen to professionals.

513
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,519
Okay, I'll listen to you.

514
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,680
Where's that legal awareness brochure

515
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,119
from the school visit?

516
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,039
I've got it.

517
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:49,920
Task completed.

518
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,200
By the way,

519
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,480
I'll show you something fun.

520
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,559
Guess what she packed in this box?

521
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:58,039
Bai Enyu, give it back!

522
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,880
A box of Sai Qi.

523
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,200
Isn't that the colorful thing
that kids like?

524
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,839
Yes.

525
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:07,000
The one Jiayi imitates?

526
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,839
That's right.

527
00:30:08,119 --> 00:30:09,160
Why did you buy this?

528
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,079
What are these for?

529
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,000
I didn't buy these, Zhitao.

530
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,039
Where did you get them?

531
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,279
Where?

532
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,759
About this thing,

533
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,480
I'll be honest with you.

534
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,240
I drew Sai Qi.

535
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,119
I am the creator.

536
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:23,359
You?

537
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,688
I built this house.

538
00:30:26,688 --> 00:30:28,039
I'm the Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

539
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:28,839
Why deputy?

540
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,119
You're the chief now.

541
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:30,839
You answer to me.

542
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,599
You can't.

543
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,680
- Always be one level above you.
- You don't believe me?

544
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,759
Let me show you.

545
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:34,880
Here, this is my manuscript.

546
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,000
Look.

547
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:48,680
Ready?

548
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,400
Almost.

549
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,359
Alright.

550
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:57,599
Don't be nervous.

551
00:30:59,279 --> 00:30:59,920
Jiayi.

552
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,480
Once you're ready, we'll start.

553
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,839
Wait a moment.

554
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,119
Jiayi, don't be nervous.

555
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,680
I have a gift for you.

556
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,559
An original Sai Qi sketch?

557
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,640
With No-Overtime Lady's signature!

558
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,000
Where did you get it?

559
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,640
This is No-Overtime Lady...

560
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,480
Sorry, I just...

561
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:24,839
Traffic was terrible.

562
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,400
This is No-Overtime Lady.

563
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,680
These are all drawn by her.

564
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:33,920
Yes, it's me.

565
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:35,279
Jiayi, hello.

566
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,880
To be not controlled by fate.

567
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,839
Or ruled by darkness.

568
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,680
Hope to break out of the cocoon
and emerge as a butterfly.

569
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:48,200
Director Lin, this is...

570
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,119
Let her be.

571
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:51,599
You look pretty!

572
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,799
Lin Zhitao is really amazing.

573
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,039
Even while sick,

574
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,359
she went and got certified
as a therapist.

575
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:02,528
Is the whole city procuratorate
this diligent?

576
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,680
Tell me why you like Sai Qi so much.

577
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,960
Because she is pretty.

578
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,920
Anything else?

579
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,920
I remember

580
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,960
you once said,

581
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
Sai Qi was something you imagined

582
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,519
from a garbage dump.

583
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:22,039
I feel like I am like her.

584
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,279
Neither of us is cared about.

585
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,559
Why would you think that?

586
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,039
Let me tell you

587
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,640
why I went to the garbage dump that day.

588
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,920
My parents threw away my computer

589
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,079
and tablet.

590
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,039
So I ran off and dug them out

591
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,119
of the dump myself.

592
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,680
That's why I say

593
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,119
Sai Qi is a spirit born
from the garbage dump,

594
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,920
a hope from the filth.

595
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,079
Do you also like watching her dance?

596
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,079
Because she is always

597
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,000
full of energy, right?

598
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,519
She wants everyone to know,

599
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,920
even if

600
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,319
with such a past,

601
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,680
so what?

602
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,920
She can still dance confidently.

603
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,599
She tries hard to be seen by others.

604
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:09,279
No hiding.

605
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,519
No fear.

606
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,799
She is the bravest girl I've ever seen.

607
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,920
You also like her for this, right?

608
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,160
Jiayi, you know what?

609
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,880
You're just as brave as Sai Qi.

610
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,240
Or,

611
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:28,000
in a sense,

612
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,880
you are braver than her.

613
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,240
Sit down, let's talk.

614
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,200
Jiayi.

615
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,880
Did you start dancing

616
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,119
because you like Sai Qi?

617
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:55,392
When dancing,
I don't need to think about anything.

618
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,440
It feels really good.

619
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,319
Besides school,

620
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,839
are you always dancing?

621
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,119
Pretty much.

622
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,839
Just be with those friends.

623
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:09,360
Do you talk to other people

624
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,800
outside that circle?

625
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,960
Anyone.

626
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,199
Yes.

627
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,199
An older sister.

628
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,280
Can you tell me more?

629
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,599
That day,

630
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:25,000
I argued with my sister about dancing.

631
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,199
I was very angry,

632
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,360
so I ran out.

633
00:34:38,803 --> 00:34:40,832
(Wannian Xingchen Dance School
Enrollment Open for Basic Dance Class)

634
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,920
I saw the fees.

635
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,920
I couldn't afford it.

636
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,519
Then an older sister came over.

637
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,440
She said she was in charge
of the new dance class recruitment.

638
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,920
She could teach me to dance for free.

639
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,599
I didn't believe it at first,

640
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,440
but she sounded very sincere.

641
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:12,039
She said she could take me
to the dance school

642
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,000
to take a look first.

643
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:15,800
I thought it was a dance school,

644
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,920
and she was a woman,

645
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:20,400
so it should be okay.

646
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,039
Moreover,

647
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,639
she said

648
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,920
that she could provide
free accommodation.

649
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,559
After going to that school,

650
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,480
did anyone do anything to you?

651
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,280
I kept on dancing.

652
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,000
Later, I got tired,

653
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,079
so I fell asleep.

654
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,679
When I woke up,
I found myself at her house.

655
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,440
Do you remember where it was?

656
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,719
I only remember it was a bungalow.

657
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,440
A bit dark.

658
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:46,239
It was too late. I couldn't see clearly.

659
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,079
Anyway, it wasn't big inside.

660
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,856
An inner room and an outer room.

661
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,559
Was there anyone else inside?

662
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,320
No, just her.

663
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,679
Then how did you get home?

664
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,159
She got me a ride.

665
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,800
Jiayi, can you remember

666
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,039
if you drank

667
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,960
or ate anything

668
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,159
before falling asleep?

669
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,320
She gave me a bottle of water.

670
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:13,280
Besides what you just mentioned,

671
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,519
can you recall

672
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,199
any other details?

673
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,559
When I got home,

674
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,079
I found that my underwear was missing.

675
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:13,360
(My underwear is missing.)

676
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,119
(Later,)

677
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,480
(when I woke up at home,)

678
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,159
(I wasn't wearing underwear.)

679
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,880
(And it hurt down there.)

680
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
(I thought it was Xie Zhihua.)

681
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,159
When the shadow appeared,

682
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,840
did anything come along with it,

683
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:39,880
like any noise,

684
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,559
smell, or color?

685
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:42,480
Anything?

686
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,119
(I smelled)

687
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
(wood.)

688
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,400
(Burnt wood or forest wood?)

689
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,440
(Which type?)

690
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,679
(I'm not sure.)

691
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,280
(It was just)

692
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,480
(a wood fragrance.)

693
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:57,440
Do you remember her name?

694
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,679
I called her Ms. Min.

695
00:37:58,932 --> 00:38:05,504
(Mu'en Children's Home)

696
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,639
Little girl, do you like dancing?

697
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,159
I'm a recruiter from Wannian Xingchen.

698
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,679
My surname is Min.

699
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,280
(Wannian Xingchen Dance School)
Wannian Xingchen?

700
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,079
A professional institution
that teaches kids how to dance.

701
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,239
If you are interested,

702
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,559
come talk with us.

703
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,400
No, thanks.

704
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,679
I just dance around with friends.

705
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,519
Your family doesn't support
you dancing, right?

706
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,840
I was like you when I was young.

707
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,360
They think it's shameful, don't they?

708
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,199
Trust me.

709
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,239
