Alright, have food first.

Where is the baby's heart?

89

It's only five weeks.

90
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,800
The heart is invisible.

91
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,519
It's a big day.

92

He's locked up inside.

It's been ten years.

96
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,879
What's the point of this now?

97
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,039
You didn't show up

98
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:20,000
when I set up the file for our baby.

99
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,360
I swear I'll ask for leave early
next time, okay?

100
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,000
You keep saying that.

101
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,399
But you've never made it.

102
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,720
Keep looking for a job transfer.

103
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,279
Any news from my third uncle?

104
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,080
Let's not trouble him with this.

105
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,399
He's going to give me such a hard time.

106
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
But you have to ask around.

107
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,159
The baby is growing day by day.

108
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,559
You must do something.

109
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,240
Honey, I have to go.

110
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,399
I'll be your servant at home.

111
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:47,039
I'll massage your feet

112
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,879
and rub your legs.

113
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,279
Love you.

you'll get to see my handsome face.

116

(Seize the moment)
You pissed her off?

117
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,759
You think I still have the nerve?

118
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:08,679
You...

119
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,159
Sir.

120
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,799
So what happened?

121
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,519
She's pregnant.

122
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,240
She is?

123
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,440
Bro.

124
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,440
What's wrong?

125
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,320
Keep your mouth shut.

126
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,279
Don't tell others.

127
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,360
Don't worry. I won't.

128
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:24,919
By others, you mean?

129
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,840
Come on, I was kidding.

130
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,480
I won't.

131
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,080
Always so serious.

132
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,000
Right, here's something serious.

133
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,279
Huang Jiawang

134
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,799
and the other two are assigned.

135
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,360
To whom?

136
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,279
Us.

137
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,080
Lu Sheng.

138
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:42,960
Here.

139
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:44,960
We have newcomers today.

140
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,639
Set an example for them.

141
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,720
Alright.

142
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,240
Name tag.

143
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,720
Go ahead.

144
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,759
Come on, what are you doing?

145
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,159
I can already

146
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,360
imagine you as a dad.

147
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,200
Fine. I'll shut my mouth.

148
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:11,080
No sense of humor.

149
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,639
The title of my essay is

150
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:14,919
"I have a long way to go."

151
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,320
I'm getting out soon.

152
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,480
I grew my hair long.

153
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,679
I look no different from others.

154
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,039
The instructor said

155
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,240
that it'd help me integrate.

156
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,360
But deep down,

157
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,759
I know I'm different.

158
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,559
It's just like a scar on the chest.

159
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
Others can't see it.

160
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,000
(Cherish youth)
But I know it's there.

161
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:34,639
Sometimes,

162
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,759
I think

163
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
it's okay to stay.

164
00:11:37,728 --> 00:11:38,784
It's more like home here.

165
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,639
Trade my freedom for family members.

166
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,559
I know how to do the math.

167
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,000
But Instructor Bai said,

168
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,960
"People have to grow up."

169
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,279
"When faced with things
beyond your control,"

170
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,679
"if you're scared,

171
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,440
"think about the ones waiting for you."

172
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,559
"Live for them"

173
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,799
"if not for yourself."

174
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
As long as I work hard,

175
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,960
there will be hope.

176
00:11:58,688 --> 00:11:59,712
I have a long way to go.

177
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,919
When faced with things we can't control,

178
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,080
fear and avoidance

179
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,759
are not the solutions.

180
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:08,320
We should learn
to face everything bravely.

181
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm grateful for

182
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:12,840
everything I've learned
and everyone who's supported me.

183
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,039
I will brave into the world,

184
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,200
carrying these experiences and insights.

185
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:27,480
Huang Jiawang.

186
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,399
Here.

187
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:33,440
Is it funny?

188
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,480
Am I not allowed to smile?

189
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,440
Am I allowed to fart then?

190
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,240
Won't it stink?

191
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,840
Let me show you something funnier.

192
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,879
Can you do multiplication?

193
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,919
Too complicated. I can't do it.

194
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:08,519
Li Hui.

195
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,039
Here.

196
00:13:10,784 --> 00:13:11,712
Do the calculation.

197
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,759
Sir, I'm done.

198
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,120
Go back.

199
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,840
Can you read it?

200
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,919
4204800.

201
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,639
Four million two hundred thousand
four hundred and eighty

202
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:54,879
minutes.

203
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
This is your eight-year sentence.

204
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,919
The person you mocked

205
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,240
will soon be released and gain freedom.

206
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,159
But you

207
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,919
will have to stay
for another four million minutes.

208
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,919
Feeling pissed, huh?

209
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,679
Four million minutes.

210
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,840
You'll have many chances to feel pissed.

211
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:16,960
The days are still long.

212
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,360
Think about what to do.

213
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,240
How come those kids

214
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,519
are so energetic these days?

215
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,240
What?

216
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,919
Isn't the break time over?

217
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,960
Wang Lei from Ward 3

218
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,840
beat up Li Xinyao.

219
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,720
Why?

220
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,320
Li Xinyao insulted his mom

221
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,200
with the f-word.

222
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,020
Wang Lei's mom passed away early.

223
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,440
It probably hit a sore spot.

224
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:46,840
Tomorrow,

225
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,799
let's teach him a lesson.

226
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,879
Alright, I'll leave it to you.

227
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,200
Those three newcomers

228
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,559
are no good either.

229
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,720
Huang Jiawang and the other two?

230
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,720
Intentional homicide.

231
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,540
Huang Jiawang is the main offender.

232
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,240
Li Hui and Chen Xiaobin are accomplices.

233
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,639
I looked through the files.

234
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,639
It's not that complicated.

235
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,399
Let's deal with Huang Jiawang first

236
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,039
and discipline the other two.

237
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,960
It's not that easy.

238
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,399
Huang Jiawang

239
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,440
has obviously been unrestrained
for too long.

240
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:21,879
He has no boundaries.

241
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,600
We can't take him head-on.

242
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,840
Ignore him for now.

243
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,799
Give him no attention.

244
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,240
Alright.

245
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:33,080
I know what you're up to.

246
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,759
Then, leave those two followers to me.

247
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,679
Okay.

248
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,039
Pay close attention.

249
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,799
Chen Xiaobin is different from Li Hui.

250
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,919
He is also a troublemaker?

251
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,720
(Personal Profile)
He definitely isn't.

252
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,919
This kid

253
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,159
is easily influenced

254
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,320
by the people he meets.

255
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,600
He can easily turn bad

256
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,799
but he's also
the most likely to be better.

257
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,360
Separate him from Huang Jiawang.

258
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,559
Keep him away from Huang Jiawang

259
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,480
and he'll naturally
follow the right path.

260
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,840
This is called
breaking the power structure.

261
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
So you've come up with a plan.

262
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,799
Carry on.

263
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,399
Tell me how to deal with Li Hui.

264
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,320
How can you be so lazy?

265
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,279
Hurry up.

266
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,320
I have to patrol.

267
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,559
There's a high chance

268
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,159
that Li Hui used to be

269
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,840
constantly bullied.

270
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,399
By Huang Jiawang and Chen Xiaobin?

271
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:26,720
The bullied has become the bully.

272
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,000
And see?

273
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,480
He was the first to confess.

274
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,600
So his relationship with the other two

275
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,799
isn't that good.

276
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,720
So it's simple, isn't it?

277
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,600
Contact his parents.

278
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,679
Tell them to come and see him.

279
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,960
Show him that

280
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,399
someone cares about him.

281
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:50,480
That's it?

282
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:52,799
Well...

283
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,240
I thought it was complicated.

284
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,120
(Family call)
This is the most important.

285
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,399
We can't let them
develop psychological problems.

286
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,879
Got it. Leave it to me.

287
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,039
But seriously,

288
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,799
they did something quite nasty.

289
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:10,279
Are you sure

290
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,799
you can reform them?

291
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,000
Children

292
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,480
are like blank slates.

293
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,680
There's no good or bad.

294
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,680
They can't control
what people draw on the slates.

295
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,519
Our job is to

296
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,279
erase the stains and repaint the slates.

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,920
But Huang Jiawang's slate

298
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,000
has been painted dark.

299
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,480
We can only try our best

300
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,799
to erase as many stains as we can.

301
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,160
Bai Enyu.

302
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:41,119
You're sounding

303
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,039
somewhat like the Chief.

304
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,759
Stop making fun of me.

305
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:49,160
Does our chief have
my level of expertise?

306
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,839
He's just good at writing reports.

307
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,039
Chief.

308
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,920
Chief.

309
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,839
You're still here?

310
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,720
You're doomed.

311
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:02,720
It's your fault.

312
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,039
You make me say that.

313
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,359
I didn't say anything.

314
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
Chief.

315
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
I-I was just joking with Xinwu.

316
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,680
Don't take it seriously.

317
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,079
Are you trying to get transferred?

318
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:19,079
Who told you that?

319
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,240
Who "told" me?

320
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,079
They called me

321
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,079
in the office.

322
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,640
Someone is slandering me.

323
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,119
Wouldn't I report to you

324
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,640
if I wanted to get transferred?

325
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,240
Have a baby coming?

326
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,359
Chen Xinwu can never keep a secret.

327
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,400
That's enough.

328
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,720
Xinwu meant well by asking me

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,480
to cover your shift.

330
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,599
You know what it's like

331
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,680
in my family, Chief.

332
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,359
People in our line of work

333
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,839
are never home.

334
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,240
Alright, that's enough.

335
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,440
Oh, right...

336
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,079
The municipal procuratorate

337
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,840
is recruiting within the legal system.

338
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,160
I submitted your name.

339
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:08,079
Huh?

340
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,759
What?

341
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,799
Are you not happy about it?

342
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
It's a rare chance.

343
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,200
No, no.

344
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,920
I-I'm more than happy about it.

345
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,640
But they have to accept me.

346
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:20,319
The procuratorate has

347
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,319
all the talents there.

348
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,599
I-I'm just self-taught.

349
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,640
Of course, I know your background.

350
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,039
You're the only one

351
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,759
who passed the judicial exam here.

352
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,048
You think I have another choice?

353
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,519
Yeah.

354
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,880
Changing jobs is not embarrassing.

355
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,960
If you are intimated,

356
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
then you embarrass me.

357
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,400
Of course not.

358
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,160
Have I ever been intimidated?

359
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,480
I'm just scared. What if...

360
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm saying, what if.

361
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,039
What if I was not selected,

362
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,680
can I...

363
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,519
In that case,

364
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,039
just come back to work here.

365
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,559
Thank you, Chief.

366
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,039
I won't embarrass you.

367
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,480
Procuratorate.

368
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:15,264
(Serve the people,
People's Procuratorate of Yunhai)

369
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,279
Prosecutor Lin.

370
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,640
Just a second.

371
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,279
Wenxuan's mom?

372
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,079
What's wrong?

373
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,599
Prosecutor Lin.

374
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:42,440
I-I came to apologize to you.

375
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,720
I was wrong that day.

376
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,952
It's okay. I understand.

377
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,279
I have submitted the appeal application.

378
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
I don't know if I can

379
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,440
appeal again to change the verdict.

380
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,400
You should have received

381
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,440
the rejection notice.

382
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:59,240
There won't be an appeal.

383
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,640
Prosecutor Lin.

384
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,599
Didn't you say you would help me?

385
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,279
You said you would help Wenxuan.

386
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,839
Why were they only sentenced

387
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,119
to a few years?

388
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,400
How can they pay for Wenxuan's death?

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,680
The sentencing is based on law.

390
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,720
Law?

391
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,920
Can't the law help me?

392
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:20,559
Why does it help them?

393
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,119
We have put in our best effort.

394
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:25,160
That's the way it is.

395
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,880
You did your best?

396
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,839
With your hand on your heart,

397
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,440
can you say you did your best?

398
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,519
Did you do your best?

399
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,640
Did you do your best?

400
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,599
What's going on?

401
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,400
What's going on?

402
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,039
What's going on?

403
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,279
Did you do your best?

404
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,599
You liar!

405
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:40,480
Stop.

406
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,400
Liar!

407
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,880
Why?

408
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,039
Lin Zhitao.

409
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,519
Zhitao.

410
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:44,480
Everyone, come and see.

411
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,680
What are you doing? Calm down.

412
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,720
Oh my god.

413
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,319
What are you doing?

414
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,200
Prosecutor Lin Zhitao
from People's Procuratorate of Yunhai

415
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,640
abused her power and bent the law
to shield criminals.

416
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,920
Come and see.

417
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:01,240
- Get me the car.
- She's a fraud.

418
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,759
My son was killed by his classmates.

419
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:06,000
They're only sentenced for a few years.

420
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,200
(Make the murderers pay)
She abused her power...

421
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,079
Lin Zhitao!

422
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,720
She bent the law to shield criminals
and gave an overly lenient sentence.

423
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,319
My son was only 15 years old.

424
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,871
(Procuratorate of Yunhai)

425
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,880
Prosecutor Lin Zhitao
from People's Procuratorate of Yunhai

426
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,200
gave an overly lenient sentence.

427
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,079
Follow the procedure
if you have an issue.

428
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,519
Come and see.

429
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,480
My son was called Zhang Wenxuan.

430
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,680
He was only 15

431
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,519
when he got murdered.

432
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,519
Stop filming.

433
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,400
Won't you stop them?

434
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,680
The people who killed him...

435
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,319
Madam, don't do this.

436
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,880
If you feel wronged

437
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,759
or have problems,

438
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,480
file a complaint and seek justice.

439
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
We can't do this here.

440
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,960
Look, people are watching.

441
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
You're a police officer?

442
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,880
Yeah.

443
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,079
Can you help me?

444
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:39,599
Yes, I can.

445
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:42,759
Please help me.

446
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,599
Police officer.

447
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,240
I beg you to help me.

448
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,119
My son died

449
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,359
at such a young age.

450
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,680
Please help me.

451
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,519
Excuse me.

452
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,648
I'm here for the interview.

453
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,160
Is there a restroom?

454
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,319
M-My shirt is dirty.

455
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,400
I want to clean it up.

456
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:04,832
Which unit are you from?

457
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,816
Juvenile Correctional Facility.
My name is Bai Enyu.

458
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,039
So you are Bai Enyu?

459
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,680
We already called you.

460
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,319
You're No. 7.

461
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:11,200
It's your turn soon.

462
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,000
Hurry up.

463
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,720
Okay, thank you.

464
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm Li Wei, No. 9. Hello.

465
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,920
I obey any arrangement.

466
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:23,640
Excuse me.

467
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,160
You look familiar to me.

468
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,816
Which school did you graduate from?

469
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,320
Southern University
of Political Science and Law.

470
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,279
I'm from the Law School
of Yuedong University. We're close.

471
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,000
- Yeah, which unit are you from?
- Provincial Department of Justice.

472
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,359
Really?

473
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,936
Nice to meet you.
I'm from the District Procuratorate.

474
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,440
Nice to meet you.

475
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,000
Thank you for coming.

476
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,240
Please wait for our call.

477
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,079
Okay, thank you.

478
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,680
Prosecutor Zheng.

479
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,319
We have so many staff.

480
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,720
There's no need to look outside.

481
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,880
We could use some fresh blood.

482
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,688
Li from the Appeals Dept.
has been here for three years.

483
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,279
I recruited him.

484
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,039
Excellent kid.

485
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,960
Won't you consider him?

486
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:09,960
Liu.

487
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,920
Next one.

488
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,880
Okay.

489
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,279
No. 7.

490
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,200
No. 7.

491
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,720
Here.

492
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,519
It's your turn.

493
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:22,880
Okay.

494
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,240
Thank you.

495
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,880
Have a seat.

496
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,599
Okay.

497
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:55,839
Thank you.

498
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,359
Please introduce yourself.

499
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:02,839
Okay.

500
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,119
What's wrong?

501
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:10,599
Nothing.

502
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
My name is Bai Enyu.

503
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,359
(Resume)
Age 34.

504
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,759
I'm working at

505
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:24,359
Yuedong Juvenile Correctional Facility.

506
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,079
I've been there for ten years.

507
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
During these ten years,

508
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,759
I have earnestly studied instructions

509
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,279
and philosophies of the superior,

510
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,440
combining theory with practice,

511
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,920
and insisted...

512
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,279
insisted on being children-centered...

513
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,920
You don't need to recite those.

514
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,400
We remember you already.

515
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
I mean, don't be nervous.

516
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,440
Make your self-introduction

517
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,240
a bit shorter.

518
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,559
O-Okay.

519
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,680
Then I prepared it in vain.

520
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,000
It's okay.

521
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,359
Let's move on.

522
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,279
Your resume says

523
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,519
that you graduated from

524
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,720
Yuedong Sports University.

525
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:07,559
Yeah.

526
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:09,279
What was your major?

527
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,200
Sports Medicine.

528
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,359
What?

529
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,200
Sports

530
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,759
Medicine.

531
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,000
Therapeutic massage. Physiotherapy.

532
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,200
Bone setting.

533
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,359
You know that, right?

534
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,119
That was my major.

535
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,880
That is a formal major.

536
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,880
I can massage you a bit.

537
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,839
Let me show you.

538
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:29,759
Don't be absurd.

539
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,880
You...

540
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,119
You didn't really

541
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,559
ask for candidates
from specific majors, right?

542
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:41,640
You're right.

543
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,039
That is not specified.

544
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,839
So you studied for the judicial exam

545
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,839
by yourself and passed it in one go?

546
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:48,759
Yeah.

547
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,920
Why did you think of

548
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,640
taking the judicial exam?

549
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,599
I made a bet.

550
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,480
A bet?

551
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,160
With a kid serving at the facility.

552
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,480
I told him if he behaved well

553
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,688
and got his sentence reduced,

554
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,680
he could ask me to do something.

555
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,759
Who knows he'd tell me to take

556
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,640
the judicial exam?

557
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,599
You took the judicial exam

558
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,119
because of a bet with a kid?

559
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:14,880
Yeah.

560
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,480
Wouldn't it be humiliating

561
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,759
to lose the bet to them?

562
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,440
What's with your clothes?

563
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,039
Don't you know you should look decent

564
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,680
during an interview?

565
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,000
Well...

566
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,960
This is a long story.

567
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,759
Let's skip that.

568
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:28,920
I don't think

569
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,359
you're taking this interview seriously.

570
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:37,079
Why did the facility
recommend someone like this?

571
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:38,279
Examiner.

572
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,119
Sir.

573
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,880
I'll answer your question.

574
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:49,880
Someone was protesting downstairs.

575
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,759
She accused the prosecutor
of giving overly light sentences

576
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,839
and being partial.

577
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
She even

578
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,559
threw paint all over

579
00:28:57,559 --> 00:28:58,440
a prosecutor.

580
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,400
This

581
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:01,720
happened when I tried to appease her

582
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,400
out there.

583
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,480
That's my answer.

584
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,519
I was extremely polite.

585
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,440
I was very humble.

586
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,720
I almost knelt to him, Chief.

587
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
You've got some nerve to talk back

588
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,400
to the Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

589
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:23,279
Did you forget everything I told you?

590
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,000
Are you serious?

591
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,160
Chief, calm down.

592
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,240
I swear I didn't talk back to him.

593
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,720
He asked me to explain.

594
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,160
Besides, I was telling the truth.

595
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,359
You think I don't know your attitude?

596
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,160
You want a job transfer
with such an attitude?

597
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:40,960
Hello?

598
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,440
You're driving me crazy.

599
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,119
Knock it off.

600
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:43,839
Yes, Chief?

601
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,440
I can hear you.

602
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,680
Reception is poor here.

603
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:47,359
Hello.

604
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:48,039
I'll hang up.

605
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,559
Don't you dare hang up, Bai Enyu.

606
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,680
Don't give me that...

607
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,119
Honey.

608
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,480
You're back early.

609
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,000
I missed you so much.

610
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,160
Why did you come back?

611
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,759
You've worked hard.

612
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,319
I thought you'd stay another two days.

613
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,119
Why are you doing this again?

614
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,880
The doctor forbade you
from sitting for long.

615
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,759
Let me massage you.

616
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:19,319
But I can't stay standing.

617
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,240
Why can't you?

618
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,599
You need to move.

619
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:22,480
- Right?
- Yeah.

620
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,232
- Here.
- Alright.

621
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,880
Legs. Let me massage them.

622
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,680
No. Don't.

623
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,799
You're in uniform. It's inappropriate.

624
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:30,079
Here. Come here.

625
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:31,279
I bought this.

626
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:32,799
I need to make some clothes.

627
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,359
The holidays will start soon.
The kids will be out.

628
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,200
I'll wear this to do promotions.

629
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,119
Cute, huh?

630
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,160
You're way too cute, Madam.

631
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,119
You'll hand out flyers?

632
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,240
Let me do

633
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,400
the tiring job. See?

634
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,759

Dine.

643

Still no news from

644

the Procuratorate?

645
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:29,960
No chance.

646
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,359
I talked back to their leader.

647
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,400
Bro, just tell me the truth.

648
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,680
You didn't want to go, right?

649
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:40,519

650
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,519
They're all so overbearing

and lack humanity.

652
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,880
We should bring them over here

653
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:46,880
to learn.

663
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,759

664
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,400
You're right next door.

665
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,599
You're so mistaken.

666
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,160

667
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,359

I rest when she works.

671
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,640
We never get to meet.

672
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,240
We are like online friends.

673
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,000
You can meet on Sunday.

674
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,920
Stop teasing me, okay?

675
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
I'm quite upset.

676
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:36,440
Fine.

677
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:45,440
Hey.

678
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:52,839
Huang Jiawang.

679
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,079
What did you do?

680
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,200
He was spilling soup.

681
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,400
What did I do wrong?

682
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,240
Stand up.

683
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,279
I'm still eating.

684
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,279
Why should I stand up?

685
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:05,000
Li Hui, up.

686
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,519
What did he do?

687
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,559
Speak.

688
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:16,720
What are you doing?

689
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,319
We know each other out there.

690
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,000
We're buddies.

691
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,559
I see you don't want to eat.

692
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:26,160
Fine, I won't eat.

693
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,880
Then don't eat.

694
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,039
Keep eating.

695
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,179
Sit down and eat.

696
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,759
You can make a living

697
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:01,039
out there if you master a skill.

698
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,240
Muster the courage to start over.

699
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,720
Lift your head like a lion.

700
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,039
Keep your heroic spirit.

701
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,360
Grasp the essence and spirit.

702
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,199
Keep these words in your heart.

703
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,079
Go away.

704
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,599
What's wrong?

705
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,519
Why keep shunning me?

706
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,880
I'm not.

707
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,000
The instructor won't let us team up.

708
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:22,639
I'll deal with him one day.

709
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,320
Keep it neat.

710
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,119
What about Li Hui?

711
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,320
Who is he spending time with?

712
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,480
Li Hui?

713
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,760
He's spending time
with the essay reader.

714
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,159
That guy is looking out for him.

715
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,480
Keep up, will you?

716
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,320
They're both pissing me off.

717
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,000
Keep up with the pace.

718
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:39,639
Bro.

719
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,159
D-Didn't we just get in here?

720
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,079
Don't cause trouble.

721
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,199
Yeah, very good.

722
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,159
And also...

723
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,199
What do you want to say?

724
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,719
Isn't that instructor

725
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,199
quite fond of Li Hui?

726
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,159
He's nice to him.

727
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,320
And I heard that

728
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,679
he used to be some kind of gang leader.

729
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,519
You know?

730
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,440
Let's not mess with him.

731
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,559
You think I'm scared?

732
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,719
I'm a killer.
You think I'm scared of him?

733
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,880
That's not what I meant.

734
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,800

737
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,119
Okay.

738
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,280
He Chuang.

739
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,920
What are you doing?

740
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,639
Don't you know your tail is missing?

741
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:17,280
Chen Xiaobin.

742
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:19,519
Come with us.

743
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,639
Alright.

744
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,679
Watch your step.

745
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,880
Stay steady.

746
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,079
Left.

747
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,840
Right.

748
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,519
Left, right,

749
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,280
left.

750
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,760
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!

751
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,159
- Let him go.
- Stop fighting.

752
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:34,400
- Hands on your head.
- Let go.

753
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,400
Squat down.

754
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,519
Stop it. Squat down.

755
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,400
Go away.

756
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,480
Huang Jiawang, I'll kill you.

757
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:40,960
Squat down.

758
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,199
Lu Sheng, what are you doing?

759
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,719
Squat down.

760
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,159
Who started it?

761
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,079
Who hit you?

762
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,519
Report.

763
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:03,840
Speak.

764
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,400
Huang Jiawang started it.

765
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,760
Say it again.

766
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:08,760
Behave.

767
00:36:09,056 --> 00:36:10,752
- Squat down.
- Confinement for three days.

768
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,480
Three days?

769
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,840
So what? Three days it is.

770
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,512
One more word,
and it will be seven days.

771
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,280
Don't move.

772
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,960
Wang, take Li Hui to the infirmary.

773
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,280
Okay.

774
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,960
Lu Sheng.

775
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,519
Come with me.

776
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:27,159
Yes, sir.

777
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,320
Don't you want to be released?

778
00:36:32,908 --> 00:36:33,840
You'll be out tomorrow.

779
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,239
Want to serve two more years?

780
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,280
Huang Jiawang was such a bully.

781
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,719
So you're allowed to fight?

782
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,239
You haven't

783
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,599
learned anything in two years?

784
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,440
Still so reckless.

785
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Always stay calm.

786
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,280
When you feel like hitting someone,
slap your face

787
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,519
to wake yourself up.

788
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,679
Sorry, Sir.

789
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,280
I was reckless back there.

790
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,360
It's good that you realize your mistake.

791
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,119
Before you leave,

792
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,679
tell everyone

793
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,400
to look after Li Hui.

794
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,920
Don't let him get bullied.

795
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:10,599
Okay.

796
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,840
Go back.

797
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,679
139...

798
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,440
04 0314...

799
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,480
5 and what?

800
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,119
(Righteousness)
So you don't remember it.

801
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:34,039
Sheng, do you remember my number?

802
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,840
He hasn't even memorized my number.

803
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,119
I was really close.

804
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,880
Yours is 136...

805
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,679
Forget it, Sheng.

806
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You can forget my number.

807
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:45,280
But don't forget

808
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,400
the welcome-back banquet.

809
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,960
When did you promise him that?

810
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,559
What about me?

811
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:51,880
I want one,

812
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,320
as well.

813
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,039
Wait.

814
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:54,719
L-Let me memorize your numbers first.

815
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:55,800
Memorize mine first.

816
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,800
Go on.

817
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,519
Try again.

818
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,000
1...

819
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,480
That's about it.

820
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,440
Wash up and get ready to rest.

821
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,599
Sir.

822
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,159
Sir.

823
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:05,639
What?

824
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Lend me a pen.

825
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,440
What for?

826
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:12,239
Sheng is leaving soon.

827
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,400
We want to write him our phone numbers.

828
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,320
I'll wait here.

829
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,079
Two minutes.

830
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:19,440
Okay.

831
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,039
Thank you, sir.

832
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:22,480
Give me your arm.

833
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,079
Not on my arm.

834
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:24,559
Wait.

835
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,320
Mine.

836
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,280
Don't rush.

837
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,159
Come on.

838
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:27,719
It's my turn.

839
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:28,480
My turn.

840
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:29,679
My number.

841
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,840
It's time for bed.

842
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,280
The pen.

843
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,239
It's time. Hurry up.

844
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:33,440
Put the chess pieces away.

845
00:38:33,843 --> 00:38:35,584
(Propriety, Righteousness)

846
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,639
Li Hui.

847
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,912
What about you?

848
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,280
I...

849
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,039
Sheng.

850
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,960
Can you do me a favor?

851
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:50,599
What?

852
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,159
Could you give this to someone?

853
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,960
This is very important to me.

854
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,320
We have regulations.

855
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,679
We can't take personal items out.

856
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,519
How about this?

857
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,160
I'll ask the instructors tomorrow.

858
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,840
Maybe they'll let me take it out
after checking

859
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,119
the content.

860
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,280
Who is it for?

861
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:25,880
My classmate's mom.

862
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,160
Give it to me.

863
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,000
Come on.

864
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,079
Why are you here?

865
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:24,000
To eat in front of me?

866
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm not hungry.

867
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:33,800
This is a place for reform

868
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,039
and education.

869
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,960
But this isn't a school.

870
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,559
Remember.

871
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,599
I am in charge here.

872
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:48,159
Behave and you'll be fed.

873
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,239
If you disobey,

874
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,519
this is what you get.

875
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,719
Eat if you get it.

876
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,400
Otherwise, stay hungry.

877
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:05,440
I'm not hungry.

878
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:08,599
But

879
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,920
I don't mind having some.

880
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,239
From now on,

881
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,760
get rid of your aggressiveness.

882
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,039
Otherwise, we'll do it for you.

883
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,960
If I see you starting a fight...

884
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,960
You want to win me over just like that?

885
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,360
Are you serious?

886
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm done.

887
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,880
Are you trying to discipline me?

888
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,880
Hit me if you can.

889
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Come on, hit me.

890
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:58,360
Hit me.

891
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,639
Aren't you an instructor? Say something.

892
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,920
Where are you going?

893
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:12,679
This is the last thing I'll say to you.

894
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,239
From now on,

895
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,960
during your seven days here,

896
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,360
even if you want to talk,

897
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,559
heed any advice,

898
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,039
and reflect,

899
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,679
we will ignore you.

900
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,119
See these surroundings?

901
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,159
Amazing soundproofing.

902
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,039
We can't hear a bit of your roar.

903
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,679
You can't hear any sound, either.

904
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:34,159
Stay for seven days.

905
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,880
Enjoy it.

906
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,639
Let's begin.

907
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,559
My name is Chen Huiwen.

908
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,599
My son died unjustly.

909
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,000
The People's Procuratorate of Yunhai
did nothing.

910
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:03,119
Here, I sincerely ask for your help.

911
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,559
You can say her name.

912
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,360
Okay.

913
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,599
My name is Chen Huiwen.

914
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:18,239
My son died unjustly.

915
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:20,800
I am now making a real-name report

916
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,519
against Prosecutor Lin Zhitao
from People's Procuratorate of Yunhai

917
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,360
for bending the law to shield criminals.

918
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:30,639
I now formally report her
