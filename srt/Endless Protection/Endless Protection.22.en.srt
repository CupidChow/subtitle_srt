1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,120
- Please.
- Ms. Zheng.

2
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:21,280
Why are you here, Mr. Fu?

3
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:23,359
Ms. Zheng's transferred.

4
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,239
Promoted.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
When did that happen?

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,120
Two days ago.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,160
Have a seat.

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,079
What's the matter?

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,119
Nothing important.

10
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,799
I will be in charge
of your office from now on.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,840
Ms. Zheng knows you are busy.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,759
So she left a message

13
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,039
to you.

14
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,399
Yes?

15
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:45,679
You are a seed.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,920
Wait.

17
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,439
She said, actually,

18
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,679
the work of juvenile prosecution
is like a seed.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,039
And children need this seed.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,159
She always hopes you will grow quickly

21
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,039
to provide shelter.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,640
And she is very pleased

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,000
that you've become a strong tree.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,319
I-I shall leave now.

25
00:02:47,827 --> 00:03:01,028
=Endless Protection=

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,452
=Episode 22=

27
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,800
Wang Hengquan was

28
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,479
suspected of intentional injury,

29
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,520
but he actually aimed

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,639
at securing his daughter's

31
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,639
legal rights at school, right?

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,960
And it's his first offense.

33
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,319
I know that.

34
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,960
We also want to handle it leniently.

35
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,984
But we need

36
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,879
the investigation result of Wan Xuemin.

37
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,120
Yuqing already said

38
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,960
she was assaulted

39
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,240
by that slug!

40
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,800
Watch your language.

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Speak properly.

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
The point is,

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,424
did she clarify to Wang Hengquan?

44
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,520
We don't know!

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Prosecutor Xia.

46
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,840
Ms. Xia.

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Let's put ourselves in his shoes.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,479
If your child was bullied,

49
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,759
could you still remain so calm?

50
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,520
Wouldn't you slap that man?

51
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,960
Go ahead.

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,960
Parents' communication with children

53
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,759
isn't always verbal.

54
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,639
My baby's only a few months old.

55
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,520
She only cries.

56
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,240
But I know why she cries.

57
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:01,080
I can tell if she is hungry
or she has pooped

58
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,800
and needs

59
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,840
a diaper change.

60
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,199
If I were Wang Hengquan,

61
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,560
and my child became mute,

62
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,919
and locked herself in,

63
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,199
I'd know she was scared

64
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,919
or encountered something terrifying.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,639
Even if she said nothing,

66
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,520
I'd know,

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,960
because I am her father.

68
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,319
Prosecutor Bai made a good point.

69
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,759
This is a child's cry for help.

70
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,639
Even if parents are over worried,

71
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,040
it's human nature.

72
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:28,959
Right.

73
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:34,240
(Practice the law
with virtues and righteousness)

74
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
(Prosecution for the public good,
Law enforcement for the people)

75
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,639
Miss Su.

76
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,439
Questioning her the day after tomorrow,

77
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,079
I'm afraid it will

78
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,879
have a great impact on her emotion.

79
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:43,680
If so,

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,959
I'd rather not ask.

81
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,319
We can wait.

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,120
The child must come first.

83
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,439
Yuqing is a child who has been hurt.

84
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,439
Whenever she talks about her trauma,

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,399
her emotions can't be totally stable.

86
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,639
Moreover, now she's willing to talk

87
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,839
and cooperate.

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
From a professional point of view,

89
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,480
I believe we can proceed.

90
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,639
What if

91
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,519
it causes secondary trauma?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,839
How about

93
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,319
you do the questioning?

94
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,399
I'm afraid...

95
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,639
She's familiar with you.

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,000
She trusts you.

97
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,040
Exactly.

98
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,319
It's not easy to achieve this.

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,920
And we trust you too.

100
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,319
Procedurally,

101
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,240
you just need to

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
file a report.

103
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,839
You're the most suitable one.

104
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,480
Fine. I'll do it.

105
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,800
Had lunch?

106
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,959
Come in, please.

107
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,040
Have a seat.

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,160
Sit wherever you like.

109
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,680
I'll get you some water.

110
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,720
Isn't it quite comfortable here?

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Not too scary, right?

112
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
Thank you.

113
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,399
You're welcome.

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,759
Do you think we're friends now?

115
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,199
Can I?

116
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,360
Anyway, I consider you a friend.

117
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,800
If you think the same,

118
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,079
then we are

119
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,319
friends now.

120
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,480
Not bad, huh?

121
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,160
Have some water.

122
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,160
Since we're friends now,

123
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
and you told me a lot
about yourself last time,

124
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,680
today, I'll also

125
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,040
share with you

126
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,279
some of mine.

127
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,040
I won't tell anyone.

128
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,279
You'd better keep it secret for me.

129
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,759
When I was a little younger

130
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,360
than you are now,

131
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,759
I also ran into some trouble.

132
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,839
I kept getting beaten up.

133
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,160
There was someone

134
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,240
who hit me when in a bad mood,

135
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,720
when drank too much,

136
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,600
and when saw me annoying.

137
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,959
Basically, if he saw me, I'd get hit.

138
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,680
I had a pretty miserable time back then.

139
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,879
That person was

140
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,560
my dad.

141
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,040
So in this world,

142
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,199
not all fathers

143
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,839
love their kids

144
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,040
like your dad does.

145
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,240
Back then,

146
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,199
there were a few times
I really wanted to fight back,

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,360
but I was

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,720
pretty timid,

149
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,000
just like you are now.

150
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,079
So I totally understand you.

151
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,079
Later, there was a time I couldn't

152
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,319
take it anymore,

153
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,079
and I happened to meet a prosecutor.

154
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,720
After getting to know this prosecutor,

155
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,399
I sued my dad.

156
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,879
The prosecutor directly arrested my dad.

157
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,079
After that, no one hit me anymore.

158
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,160
But new troubles appeared.

159
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,199
The other family members all thought

160
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,439
I was unfilial.

161
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,120
They were very displeased.

162
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,600
And no one was willing

163
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,920
to talk with me.

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,319
I was actually isolated.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,039
But even so,

166
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,279
I never think I did anything wrong.

167
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,159
Great job, Lin Zhitao.

168
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,159
I also think so.

169
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,559
You are very brave.

170
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,080
You can also be very brave.

171
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,960
Yuqing.

172
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,879
You...

173
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,480
Actually,

174
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,039
I have

175
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,200
understood you a bit.

176
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,720
You are a good kid.

177
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,799
You can distinguish right from wrong.

178
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,080
You can also tell the truth.

179
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
You don't lie.

180
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,480
So, a child like you

181
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,639
should have a good life.

182
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,480
If someone is displeased

183
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,320
by your actions,

184
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,679
that's their problem.

185
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,120
Let them be displeased.

186
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,080
If someone talks badly about you,

187
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,519
just tell them to get lost.

188
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:52,279
In fact,

189
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,080
I don't like dancing.

190
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,679
I seem to be less smart than other kids.

191
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,679
In parent-teacher meetings,

192
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,559
teachers said I'm obedient

193
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,840
and quiet.

194
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,879
But I think

195
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,159
they praised me that

196
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,512
because I have no other virtues.

197
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,320
My parents said I needed a talent,

198
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,399
so they sent me to learn dance.

199
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,559
Okay, together.

200
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,639
Listen to my command.

201
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,200
Okay, down.

202
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,080
Down.

203
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,039
Okay.

204
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,960
Hold it.

205
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,759
Arch your back.

206
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,840
More.

207
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,159
Down.

208
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,080
Arch your back.

209
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:55,039
Mr. Wan,

210
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:56,679
I don't feel well.

211
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,679
I want to ask for leave.

212
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,840
You've only practiced for a few days.

213
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,919
Do you even want to learn?

214
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,600
Yuqing, it's okay.

215
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
Keep going.

216
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,320
Take a rest,

217
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,960
then, we'll continue, okay?

218
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,039
It's okay.

219
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,480
Mr. Wan.

220
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,399
It's our fault.

222
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,679
Sorry for causing you trouble.

223
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
It's okay.

224
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
But your child has no talent.

225
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,240
I really can't teach her.

226
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,279
No.

227
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,799
Please don't say that.

228
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,879
You're so skilled.

229
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,279
You can teach her well.

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Besides,

231
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,679
all kids

232
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,440
start from zero, right?

233
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,320
Please be more patient.

234
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,879
Yuqing

235
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,840
wants to learn from you.

236
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
Isn't that right?

237
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,279
Speak up!

238
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,559
I do.

239
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,639
Right.

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Yuqing.

241
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,000
It's for your best.

242
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:02,960
Stop learning dance.

243
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,679
Ma'am,

244
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,600
go and get a refund for the tuition.

245
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,759
Mr. Wan.

246
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,919
She'll be starting
middle school next year.

247
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,960
She needs one award certificate.

248
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,519
We are just an ordinary family.

249
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,679
I beg you.

250
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,360
Please help us.

251
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Ma'am,

252
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,919
I understand your concern,

253
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,120
but don't push her anymore.

254
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,000
At her age, learning to dance

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,159
is a bit late.

256
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,399
It's not a problem!

257
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
You can give her private lessons.

258
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,360
Yeah, private lessons.

259
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:31,879
We will pay more.

260
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,279
I didn't mean it.

261
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,120
- A token of appreciation.
- Ma'am, like I said.

262
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,919
Don't push your kid anymore.

263
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,679
Yuqing, come here.

264
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,039
Tell him.

265
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:44,080
Express yourself.

266
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,480
You want to learn dance

267
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,399
and work hard, right?

268
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,039
I was wrong.

269
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,519
I'll work hard.

270
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,200
That's right.

271
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,639

Knees straight!

276
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,799
Yes, head up.

277
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:19,559
Not bad.

278
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,559
Come on.

279
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,559
Hands tight!

280
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,200
Release it.

1, 2, 3, 4... 5, 6, 7, 8...

282

Slowly down.

283
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,159
That's right.

284

285
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
Good job today.

286
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,039
Come here.

287
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,960
Yuqing.

288
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,559
Come over.

289
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,000
Come on.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,159
You did well today.

291
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,799
Go to that room.

292
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
I have a reward for you.

293
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,600
Alright, kids.

294
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:31,480
Hurry.

295
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,832
Okay, take your positions.

296
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,759
Alright.

297
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,480
Today, let's review yesterday's dance.

298
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,240
Raise this hand higher.

299
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,960
Right.

300
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Mind your expression!

301
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,519
I remember that sofa.

302
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,679
It's blue

303
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,919
and could be unfolded

304
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,480
into a bed.

305
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,879
Later,

306
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,720
did he do the same thing again?

307
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,639
Yes. And I was awake.

308
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,279
I wanted to resist,

309
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,399
but I just couldn't move.

310
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,879
He said this meant I like him,

311
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,240
admire him,

312
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,080
and he likes me too.

313
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't know.

314
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,279
Did you tell any adults about this?

315
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Auntie,

316
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:00,120
he really let me join the competition.

317
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,799
And I won an award.

318
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,240
I don't want to upset my parents.

319
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,879
Now,

320
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,200
they must think

321
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,639
I'm a very bad child.

322
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,799
No.

323
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,120
That's not true.

324
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,639
Did he do anything else?

325
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:23,480
No.

326
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,440
He told me

327
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,000
not to tell my dad.

328
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,720
Or my dad would be disappointed.

329
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,120
He didn't know that I already did.

330
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,919
I'm very scared.

331
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,559
Don't be afraid.

332
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
It's okay.

333
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,679
Nothing will happen.

334
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,679
Can you do me a favor?

335
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,080
I have

336
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,279
some photos here.

337
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,240
Can you pick out anyone you recognize?

338
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,360
Take your time, no need to rush.

339
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,359
Have you seen anyone at his place?

340
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,480
No.

341
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,039
Not even one.

342
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,440
Are you sure?

346
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,000
- Yes?
- Take our men

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,480
and block all the exits.

348
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,519
Come with me.

349
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,759
(Wannian Xingchen Dance School)
Stay still.

350

(I remember that sofa.)

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,519
Where's the thing

357
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,759
in this room?

358
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,799
We need to expand the classroom.

359

and threw things away.

Wan Xuemin,

362
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,519
you are suspected of rape.

we now decide

365
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,519
to execute criminal detention on you.

366
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,400
(Warrant)
Cuff him.

367
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,359
On what basis?

368
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Do you have evidence?

369
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,279
We wouldn't arrest you

370
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,336
without evidence.

371
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,720
Please cooperate.

372
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,359
Captain Du. It's a misunderstanding.

373
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,839
I am a law-abiding citizen. You...

374
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:50,119
We'll find out
whether it is a misunderstanding.

375
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:50,960

381
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
look carefully.

382
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,599

00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,416
(Yunhai First Detention Center)

386
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,640
It's no use switching interrogators.

387
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,319
I won't confess
to something I didn't do.

388
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,279
When did you start teaching Wang Yuqing?

389
00:19:23,712 --> 00:19:24,832
Less than half a year ago.

390
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:26,759
We have a record of the class hours.

391
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,519
Hey,

392
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:30,720
I've been asked many times
by the police.

393
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,799
If you want to accuse me,

394
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,000
you should have evidence.

395
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,079
We are prosecutors,

396
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,200
not the police.

397
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,559
The police has submitted
an arrest request.

398
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,680
We're just verifying the facts.

399
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,319
If they made a mistake,

400
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,559
we will not arrest you.

401
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,960
If you insist

402
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,920
we follow their evidence and arrest you,

403
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,799
that's fine.

404
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
We'd like to get off work early too.

405
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,000
This summer,

406
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,480
her parents sent her here.

407
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,000
I really regret taking her in.

408
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,000
No talent, yet falsely accusing me.

409
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,079
It's like the farmer and the snake.

410
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,880
Your school seems quite famous.

411
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,279
What year was it founded?

412
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,720
2007.

413
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,400
Up until now,

414
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,039
it's almost eight years.

415
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,920
Is this business profitable?

416
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,400
In Yunhai, we're the only dance school

417
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,000
that actually gets results.

418
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,680
You also do charity work?

419
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,559
Not exactly.

420
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
Some kids want to learn dance

421
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,839
but their families are poor.

422
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,519
Since teachers also agreed,

423
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,359
we decided

424
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:37,480
to accept them all.

425
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,720
Teaching more kids is no big deal.

426
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,200
Just a bit more tiring.

427
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
I read in the news

428
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,400
that you invest quite a lot in this.

429
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:46,759
It's alright.

430
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,759
We take in an extra dozen kids
for free each year.

431
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,519
Talented students are few.

432
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,160
Such things,

433
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,759
for the children from poor families,

434
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,720
are their greatest hope in life.

435
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,519
You think that what you do

436
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,680
gives them hope.

437
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,480
Is that so?

438
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:02,519
Of course.

439
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
I came from a hard background myself.

440
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:07,936
How's your relationship with the kids?

441
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,079
Anyway,

442
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,799
I give my all to them.

443
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,920
As for how they see me,

444
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:16,920
I don't know.

445
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,039
Kids these days mature early
and are very perceptive.

446
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,599
Maybe

447
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,119
I've been a bit strict,

448
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,720
but it's for their own good.

449
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,000
Wan Xuemin.

450
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,640
What do you think is the basis

451
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,880
of arresting you for rape?

452
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,839
Those kids were lying!

453
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,000
It's all hearsay.

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,319
There's no real evidence at all.

455
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:41,119
You told Wang Yuqing

456
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
that you liked her?

457
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,359
Yes.

458
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:47,279
Yes, I said it.

459
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,799
But it was that kind of a teacher

460
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,279
has for a student.

461
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,160
You got that?

462
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,839
Students of this age

463
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,599
love watching romantic dramas.

464
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,240
They sometimes get carried away

465
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,079
by all those romantic scenes.

466
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,319
I never implied anything to you.

467
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Why

468
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,279
is your head

469
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:09,000
filled with romance?

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
On October 6th,

471
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,039
officers from Xinli District

472
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,559
went to ask questions, right?

473
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,680
Forget it.

474
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:19,872
It was because that little liar
Wang Yuqing framed me.

475
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,759
We've seen the interrogation record.

476
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,839
You didn't know that Wang Hengquan
had called the police.

477
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
Why did you go to Wang Yuqing's house?

478
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,319
No, I didn't.

479
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:30,640
I didn't go there.

480
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,440
You didn't?

481
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,759
Who is this?

482
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,759
Right, right!

483
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,039
I forgot.

484
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,880
Yes. I did go there.

485
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,960
I forgot about it.

486
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:46,240
Just a routine home visit.

487
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:55,920
Sit down.

488
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,519
Sit a bit closer.

489
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,519
Sit next to me.

490
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,720
Go wash the cup clean.

491
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,359
Routine home visit?

492
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,480
You deliberately chose work hours

493
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
to go to her community

494
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,119
and went up

495
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,039
when her parents weren't home.

496
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,559
Just for a home visit?

497
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
Which other students' homes
have you visited?

498
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,680
Even if I did go to her home,

499
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,599
that's not a crime, is it?

500
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Do you know Ms. Min?

501
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:23,559
Um,

502
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,640
Minmin?

503
00:24:28,896 --> 00:24:30,079
Haven't seen her in a while.

504
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,039
How long?

505
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,119
We were in a relationship two years ago.

506
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,920
For three to five months.

507
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,200
We broke up over a year ago.

508
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,680
By the way,

509
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,440
she knows

510
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,880
some basics about our school.

511
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,319
Stop pretending.

512
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,599
She is your accomplice.

513
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,720
That's slander.

514
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:53,960
Do you have evidence?

515
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,839
It must be Minmin who told you this.

516
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,920
She framed me because she hates me.

517
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,759
Where is she?

518
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:00,096
I'll confront her face to face.

519
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,279
Wan Xuemin.

520
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,480
You think you've destroyed
all the evidence,

521
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,200
but actually,

522
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,079
all traces of evidence still exist.

523
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,400
All the victims' testimonies are there.

524
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,519
So you better think carefully

525
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,119
whether you want to tell us everything.

526
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,880
In a bit.

527
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,920
- Ma'am.
- Prosecutor Lin.

528
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,559
Where is Yuqing?

529
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,440
Yuqing.

530
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:38,920
Hello, Auntie.

531
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,319
Yuqing, look who is here.

532
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,400
Hengquan?

533
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,240
First

534
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,640
offense.

535
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,480
Right.

536
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,279
Less serious,

537
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,640
and there's a confession
that warrant lenient punishment.

538
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,799
I recommend

539
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,359
non-prosecution.

540
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,720
Perfect.

541
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,359
You are an excellent prosecutor

542
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:35,440
and must be a great mother too.

543
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,039
No one knows this.

544
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,319
I don't know if this can help.

545
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,240
Auntie,

546
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,359
I can do one more thing.

547
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,200
I can testify in court

548
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,720
to prove he is a bad person.

549
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,480
I've already noted down
everything you said.

550
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,440
Court is more complicated
than you think.

551
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,160
Besides me,

552
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,000
the opposing lawyer
will also question you.

553
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,240
He might make things difficult for you.

554
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,880
So it's okay if you don't go.

555
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,559
I have those notes. That's enough.

556
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,119
Will I be helpful if I go?

557
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:44,680
Yes.

558
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,799
But it might hurt you.

559
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,799
I want to go.

560
00:27:53,376 --> 00:27:54,039
Say hi to dad.

561
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,880
Listen to me.

562
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,279
If anything happens, tell me.

563
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,880
I'm your strong support.

564
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,799
Alright?

565
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,279
Stop messing around.

566
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:04,759
Be serious.

567
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,319
I'm not joking with you.

568
00:28:07,614 --> 00:28:08,562
You...

569
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:10,759
She... She's hungry.

570
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,240
I'll...

571
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
I'll feed her first.

572
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,400
I'll hang up.

573
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
I'll continue when I get back.

574
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,359
Bai, how long have you had
these symptoms?

575
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,079
This is a psychological suggestion.

576
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,160
She can't understand now,
but one day she will.

577
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,519
Why are you leaving so early?

578
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,488
None of your business.

579
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,799
Don't move.

580
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,160
Boss.

581
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,320
(National Judicial Exam Guide)
Judicial Exam Guide.

582
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:37,640
What?

583
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,119
Cheng Wei is going to be a lawyer.

584
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,279
Bai Enyu.

585
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,599
Are you saying
I can't pass the prosecutor exam?

586
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,160
You need to pass two exams
to be a prosecutor.

587
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,880
I know.

588
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,640
You passed it.

589
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,480
Why can't I?

590
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,400
She goes to training classes
after work every day.

591
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,880
You should encourage her.

592
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,079
Exactly.

593
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:56,799
Alright.

594
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,519
Then I hope you score higher than me.

595
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,119
Is that okay?

596
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,000
How much did you get?

597
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,640
360.

598
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,160
Just passed.

599
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,920
360? What's there to be proud of?

600
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,480
Go now. Stop chattering.

601
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,559
Then, I'm off.

602
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,400
Give it to me!

603
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,960
I'm leaving, Zhitao.

604
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,079
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

605
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,119
Goodbye.

606
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:14,759
Pass it earlier.

607
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,599
Goodbye.

608
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:17,119
Hello.

609
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,839
What's up?

610
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,400
I know, half past eight.

611
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
You sent me the room number.

612
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,440
I remember.

613
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,680
See you later.

614
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:27,920
Goodbye.

615
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:29,799
Under my influence,

616
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,319
your EQ skyrocketed.

617
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,599
Starting to socialize, huh?

618
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,039
Your face is really big.

619
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,400
My face is not big.

620
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:38,880
The power of example is.

621
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
Chatterbox.

622
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,400
Right on time.

623
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,880
- You're here.
- Mr. Xiao?

624
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,079
Isn't this the debate team reunion?

625
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
Mr. Xiao said he missed you.

626
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,039
He asked me

627
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,839
to invite you for a meal.

628
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,680
Come on.

629
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,839
Have a seat.

630
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,119
Please.

631
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,039
Today is

632
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:01,480
mainly a catch-up session.

633
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,839
If I hadn't said that,

634
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,200
you wouldn't have come.

635
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,640
I think

636
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,039
your current state

637
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,920
is perfect for joining our law firm.

638
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,640
I've mentioned it before,

639
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
but I feel

640
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,119
I must insist again today.

641
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,319
Li.

642
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,984
People have their own aspirations.

643
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,519
Let's not repeat

644
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,160
what's been said.

645
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,599
Yes.

646
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,400
You were the best students in your year.

647
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:28,359
No matter where you are,

648
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,440
you can achieve results.

649
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,880
If Lin stays in the prosecution office,

650
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,200
that's still contributing to Yunhai.

651
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:40,920
However,

652
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,039
the greater the responsibility,

653
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,480
the greater the risk.

654
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,640
I understand.

655
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:51,319
You need to uphold what you believe
is fair and just.

656
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,640
I have lived more than half of my life.

657
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,839
I need to tell you the truth.

658
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,880
Regardless of
whether you are a prosecutor or not,

659
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,440
you should be pragmatic.

660
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,960
For Wan Xuemin's case

661
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
you're working on,

662
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,960
we

663
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,599
can still

664
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,319
discuss it.

665
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,279
I understand, Mr. Xiao.

666
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,279
No matter what,

667
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,319
I'm grateful

668
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:22,400
for all that you taught me

669
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,440
when I was your student.

670
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,400
As for being practical,

671
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:30,319
there's nothing wrong with it.

672
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,759
But I've lived for more than 30 years.

673
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,279
I believe

674
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,160
we all need to hold on to something.

675
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,200
Right or wrong,

676
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,240
it's my choice.

677
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,839
This cup of tea

678
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,039
means nothing.

679
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:44,920
Wish you good health.

680
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,119
Go ahead to eat.

681
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm leaving now.

682
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,279
Why leave so soon?

683
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,319
Mr. Xiao is still inside.

684
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,119
Li Daoran.

685
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,000
Do you know a person's appearance
follows their heart?

686
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,240
Do you know what you look like now?

687
00:32:15,828 --> 00:32:17,984
(Yang's Diner)

688
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,480
Prosecutor Zheng.

689
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
You're mysterious.

690
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,480
Why left

691
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,319
without saying a word?

692
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,640
Afraid I'll protest

693
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,200
or Bai Enyu will?

694
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm afraid if I see you,

695
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,480
I won't want to leave.

696
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,440
And you said

697
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,799
about trees and seeds.

698
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,440
Prosecutor Fu probably struggled
carrying that.

699
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,039
He probably didn't know what it meant.

700
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,119
I was reminding him

701
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:46,559
to be more responsible.

702
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,960
Let me interview our former prosecutor.

703
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,839
How does it feel to work in a new field?

704
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,400
You're so petty!

705
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,000
Yes.

706
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,160
After I go to the Women's Federation,

707
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,759
I plan to focus more

708
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,119
on anti-domestic violence

709
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,079
and child protection.

710
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,039
In the future, we will be sister units.

711
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,319
We can tackle issues together.

712
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,039
Okay.

713
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,599
Do you have

714
00:33:13,856 --> 00:33:14,519
any

715
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,440
open positions for Bai Enyu?

716
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,720
Let me think.

717
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,960
Maybe I can ask
the Communist Youth League

718
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,240
or the Social Aid Bureau.

719
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,119
Really considering it?

720
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:26,079
I was joking.

721
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,880
He's still of some use
in juvenile prosecution.

722
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,240
Let's eat and talk.

723
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,160
Eat.

724
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:32,640
Now,

725
00:33:32,864 --> 00:33:33,920
your ambition's changed.

726
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,000
Don't want

727
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,119
to take on complex cases anymore?

728
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,720
No, still the same.

729
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:41,480
You just mentioned
multi-department coordination.

730
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,279
It can establish

731
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,720
a larger protection system, right?

732
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,440
That's even harder.

733
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:47,079
I'm fit for the hardest jobs.

734
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,480
Juvenile prosecution is essentially

735
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,720
one tree

736
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:55,440
shaking another tree,

737
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,599
a cloud

738
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,319
pushing another cloud,

739
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,799
and a soul awakening another soul.

740
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,720
Should I write this down?

741
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,359
Remember it.

742
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,640
I'll memorize it.

743
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,440
Do it now.

744
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,000
Tomorrow.

745
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,568
I'll call you tomorrow and recite it.

746
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
That quote's from an educator.

747
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:15,360
Using one pen to guard another.

748
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,119
For you.

749
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,920
This is for me?

750
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,039
Let's call it a legacy.

751
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,239
I thought it was jewelry or something.

752
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,719
The final dish.

753
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,880
Come, eat.

754
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,320
Thanks for consuming.

755
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,159
Today, I'll give you a 120% discount.

756
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,239
As always.

757
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,800
His daily revenue all comes from me.

758
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,480
Ms. Zheng.

759
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,480
Hello.

760
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,559
How's the food?

761
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,800
Very good. You're really skilled.

762
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,360
Really.

763
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,119
Isn't it?

764
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,599
Well,

765
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,519
I remember when I first met you,

766
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,760
you were just this tall.

767
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,519
And now you've grown...

768
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It took over twenty years

769
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,079
for him to grow this tall.

770
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:57,840
Grew haphazardly.

771
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,400
You can't even see his face.

772
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,320
As tall as a tree.

773
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,199
Stop talking nonsense.

774
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,800
You two have grown
into exactly what I hoped for.

775
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,079
What kind?

776
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,559
Just like this.

777
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:09,760
What about me?

778
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,679
What about me?

779
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,159
You don't look great.

780
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,320
Don't look great?

781
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,559
You criticize me in front of my brother?

782
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,400
I am a great beauty

783
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,679
