2
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,039
I guess you were born

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,439
in autumn.

4
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,600
Children born in autumn
are full of mysteries.

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,719
I dreamed of you last night.

6
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,399
You were walking in front of me.

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,320
Then you turned around.

8
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,799
I couldn't see your face clearly.

9
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,280
You said to me

10
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,239
that you wanted
to take me to your house.

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,400
I just followed you closely,

12
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,159
walking side by side with you.

13
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,560
I wanted to see

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
if you look the same as I imagined.

15
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,159
You have a round face

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,239
and look nice when you smile.

17
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,359
I want to know

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,400
what you like

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,799
or dislike.

20
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,640
It feels like I've known you
for a lifetime.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,239
I really wish you could tell me

22
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,239
what else I could do.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,680
How much longer can she stay here?

24
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,240
She can stay until I retire.

25
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,520
I'm about to retire.

27
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,080
I failed to help you

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,280
catch that person.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,240
To be precise, he was caught,

30
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,879
but we couldn't convict him.

31
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,360
Give it another try.

Don't be nervous.

35
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,360
Jiayi.

36
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
We can start

37
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
if you're ready.

38
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:02,600
I'm ready.

39
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,199
Don't be nervous.

40
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,000
She is

41
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,959
Ma Wenwen.

42
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,839
She is a judicial social worker.

43
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,639
She is also the appropriate adult.

44
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,639
Look, Jiayi.

45
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,319
We know you're at a loss now,

46
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,319
but we all want to help you.

47
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,519
So when we ask you questions later,

48
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,519
can we ask more directly?

49
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,160
But don't worry.

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,800
You must trust that all of us adults

51
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,639
are firmly on your side.

52
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
If you feel bad, we'll stop.

53
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,959
No worries.

54
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,759
Jiayi.

55
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,720
We need you

56
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,879
to really rack your brain.

57
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,000
Is there anyone

58
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,399
who might hurt you?

59
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,439
I can do it myself.

60
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,920
Let me help you.

61
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,079
Xie Zhihua.

62
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,879
Write it down.

63
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,560
I was very scared.

64
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,720
I couldn't move.

65
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,959
But I really felt disgusted.

66
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,560
(He wasn't just passing by.)

67
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,199
(He just stood there.)

68
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
(Motionless.)

69
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,199
I scolded him,

70
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,240
but he didn't take it seriously.

71
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,159
That night,

72
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,320
I came back after dancing.

(Zhihua Hair Salon, Accommodation)

74
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,200
Where were you?

75
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,240
Back so late?

76
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,960
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,120
(I felt exhausted.)

78
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,600
(As soon as I got home,
I fell asleep on the bed.)

79
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,200
(At night,)

80
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
(I was in a daze.)

81
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,919
(I felt someone standing by my bed.)

82
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:39,240
I treated her like my own sister.

83
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,679
So, tell me

84
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,120
how you treated Cui Jiayi
like your own sister.

85
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
All her food,

86
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,480
drinks,

87
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,279
and clothes,

88
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,679
I bought it all.

89
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,200
So you even bought underwear
for Cui Jiayi?

90
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,360
You, a man in your thirties,

91
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,639
went to a lingerie store

92
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,000
to buy underwear
for a thirteen-year-old girl?

93
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,720
What's the matter?

94
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,720
I also did it for her sister.

95
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:14,759
Is there a problem?

96
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,919
You're maliciously speculating.

97
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,600
Malicious speculation?

98
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,840
Xie Zhihua.

99
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,039
Do you think we subpoenaed you

100
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,320
without solid evidence?

101
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,039
(Chats with Xie Zhihua)
You sent these messages, right?

102
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,240
Is the genitalia in this photo yours?

103
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
You actually sent such a photo

104
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
to a thirteen-year-old child.

105
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,440
What's wrong with you?

106
00:10:55,232 --> 00:10:55,960
Tell me.

107
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,600
Was it you

108
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,240
who climbed onto Cui Jiayi's bed?

109
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,480
It wasn't me.

110
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,919
I'm with him

111
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,080
because I want
to settle down in the city.

112
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,000
This way, Jiayi can go

113
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,759
to high school in the city.

114
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,399
I'm uneducated,

115
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,559
not one day in school.

116
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,720
I don't want Jiayi to follow my path.

117
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,039
I feel sorry for Jiayi.

118
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,519
It's all my fault.

119
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:05,320
I harmed her.

120
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,039
Jiayi dances with us

121
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,320
and goes to cheer.

122
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,759
She just doesn't want to go home.

123
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,200
Every day after school,

124
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,399
she stays there alone.

125
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,440
Sometimes, she stays until night.

126
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,039
I asked Jiayi about it.

127
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,000
She wanted to go home
after Xie Zhihua had slept.

128
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,679
She also doesn't want
to burden her sister.

129
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,960
Jiayi loves her sister very much.

130
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,159
Someone at school badmouthed her sister.

131
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,840
So she fought with that person.

132
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,559
Do you think

133
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,279
Jiayi's sister knows these things?

134
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,720
- Likely not.
- Likely not.

135
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,000
Can you do me a favor?

136
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,039
What is it?

137
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,960
Mingli.

138
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,240
You finally came back.

139
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,320
Thank you so much for today.

140
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,840
Like this.

141
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,279
I buy you something delicious.

142
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,240
- Come on.
- No, thanks.

143
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,559
Don't you have something to say?

144
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,960
Mingli.

145
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,679
I don't know if you still remember me.

146
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:48,200
One day,

147
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,080
I brought Jiayi back.

148
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,240
We think

149
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,759
there might be a misunderstanding
between you and Jiayi.

150
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,720
That matter isn't like what you think.

151
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,519
My sister,

152
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,720
she's just fixated

153
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,279
on staying in this city

154
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,679
and using men to get money.

155
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,960
But she never asks

156
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
what I think.

157
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,120
I have a younger brother.

158
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,679
I haven't talked to him

159
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,080
for over ten years.

160
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,240
He dislikes me, too.

161
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,960
We haven't had much contact.

162
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,159
Some time ago,

163
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,519
I had a minor accident.

164
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,159
The place where I stayed caught fire.

165
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,960
He rushed in and saved me.

166
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,679
Otherwise,
I'd have been burned to death.

167
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:10,960
Actually, when he rushed in,

168
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,960
there was a chance
neither of us would come out.

169
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,759
We hadn't reconciled at that time.

170
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm older

171
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,240
than you.

172
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,080
And I've experienced more than you.

173
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,720
I'm not

174
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,120
persuading you.

175
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,120
I just want to tell you

176
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,279
that's what family will do.

177
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,320
But I don't know

178
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
if my sister will do it for me.

179
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:51,519
I really don't know

180
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,200
what kind of person your sister is.

181
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,919
I'm just suggesting you

182
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,600
give your sister a chance.

183
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,360
You're still very young,

184
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,200
and you'll experience more.

185
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
Give yourself a chance too.

186
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,919
Try not to lose your family.

187
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,399
What do you think?

188
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,799
Have you decided?

189
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,120
As you said,

190
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,919
give her a chance to grow.

191
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,519
Look at how cool you are.

192
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,200
Let's go.

193
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,359
Mingli.

194
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,000
I love you.

195
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,872
(Police)

196
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,880
Great.

197
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,319
It's hard to explain,

198
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:52,000
you know?

199
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,440
- Captain Du.
- Captain Du.

200
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,759
Sit.

201
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:56,960
Sorry,

202
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
we just came back

203
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:00,079
from the detention center
in Ruicang City.

204
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,039
So,

205
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,119
what happened?

206
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,079
Here's the thing.

207
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
There are still

208
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,359
some issues with this case.

209
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,839
Ms. Lin.

210
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,519
May I have a word?

211
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,119
Here's the thing.

212
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:29,000
We

213
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,160
have conducted an assessment
with the doctors.

214
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,680
The incident

215
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,519
occurred between the afternoon
to evening of September 9th.

216
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,000
But during this period...

217
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,720
Xie Zhihua

218
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,680
went to Ruicang City

219
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,519
on September 9th

220
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,400
for a perm and dye training?

221
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:45,960
Yes.

222
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,319
Sit and talk.

223
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,160
But he could sneak back, right?

224
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
On September 9th,

225
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,039
Xie Zhihua indeed went to Ruicang City.

226
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,920
But he

227
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,640
was caught soliciting prostitutes.

228
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,359
So he isn't the suspect.

229
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:05,119
How come?

230
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,359
Officer.

231
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,319
What's the matter?

232
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,759
Xie Zhihua, the primary suspect,

233
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,640
indeed has an alibi.

234
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What is ABC?

235
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Isosceles right triangle.

236
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,319
Then what is R?

237
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,039
The angle DFP is 45 degrees.

238
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:21,839
That's right.

239
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,920
Do the rest yourselves.

240
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:38,880
Jiayi.

241
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,160
Jiayi, what's wrong?

242
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,079
I'm here, Jiayi.

243
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:44,279
It's okay.

244
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,279
I'm here.

245
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,480
(Yunhai Criminal Police)
Ms. Lin. Ms. Xia.

246
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,400
Currently, we have a problem

247
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,559
with this case.

248
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,359
We've been

249
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:20,559
looking for a breakthrough.

250
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,759
However...

251
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,680
Understood.

252
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,119
I understand.

253
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,160
The mandatory mechanism

254
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,680
directly connects to your department.

255
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,880
I think

256
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,160
it must have given you

257
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,200
a great workload.

258
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:31,720
Not really.

259
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,680
We're responsible

260
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,839
for protecting minors.

261
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,200
The problem is,

262
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,279
we really don't dare

263
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,799
to press Cui Jiayi too hard.

264
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,839
- She is...
- Could she

265
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,680
possibly have been drugged and raped?

266
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:45,400
How could she forget what happened

267
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,519
to her?

268
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,359
Unless she was in an unconscious state.

269
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,480
It's possible.

270
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,160
So in that case,

271
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,440
we can talk to Cui Jiayi again.

272
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,920
I'll check
if there are any missing details.

273
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,799
Then you review the routes taken

274
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,880
on the day of the incident.

275
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
- Okay.
- See if Cui Jiayi has

276
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,519
any other possible contacts.

277
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,200
Understood.

278
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,519
Wait.

279
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,559
Actually, it's quite cruel to Cui Jiayi

280
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,480
if we ask her directly.

281
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,119
If she was unconscious at the time,

282
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:12,799
she might

283
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,359
remember all of it by asking her.

284
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
This would be a big blow to her,

285
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,960
right?

286
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:19,480
She looks pretty strong on the outside,

287
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,480
but nobody knows

288
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,720
what's she like inside.

289
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,640
We don't know.

290
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,440
I suggest.

291
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,720
I suggest we give Cui Jiayi

292
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
some mental counseling

293
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,440
before we ask her.

294
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:28,519
What do you say?

295
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,119
Good idea, but we're

296
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,240
not professionals

297
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,480
in mental health.

298
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,839
Is there a professional?

299
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:35,759
Leave it to us.

300
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,480
Our office
has cooperative organizations.

301
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,240
Is that so?

302
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,000
Moreover, I suggest

303
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
this kind of inquiry

304
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,720
should be conducted within our office.

305
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,000
We've got a special room

306
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,839
for kids.

307
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:44,839
It's pretty good.

308
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,599
That's great,
so we'll hand similar cases

309
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,200
over to you.

310
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,240
No problem.

311
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,200
I'll jot it down.

312
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,480
There's another question.

313
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,880
What about Xie Zhihua?

314
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,839
Personally, I think

315
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,000
imaginary harassment is harassment.

316
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,920
Zheng, you came back quite early.

317
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,160
Going dancing again?

318
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,920
Sure.

319
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,000
(Ms. Zhang.)

320
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,319
(Actually, hearing what you said,)

321
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,240
(at this very moment, I'm very excited.)

322
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,559
Jia.

323
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,759
The little ginger was sold out.

324
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,079
I bought you fresh ginger.

325
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:22,799
You're back.

326
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,039
You came back quite early.

327
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:26,680
Early?

328
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,599
Editor Jia.

329
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,319
What are you reminiscing about again?

330
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,279
Are you crying?

331
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,160
This program

332
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,720
is so touching.

333
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:41,960
What program?

334
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,240
(Waiting for Your Return)
Waiting for Your Return?

335
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,279
You're thinking of our son?

336
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,799
He will return home next year.

337
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,799
He called and told me to watch it.

338
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,559
This program is

339
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:00,079
about the missing kids

340
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,960
and those parents
who can't find their kids.

341
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:07,640
The program team arranges for them
to meet.

342
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,319
Watching this program

343
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:12,920
makes me sad.

344
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,119
(Cast your gaze
to the left side of the stage.)

345
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,519
(Ms. Zhang, look.)

346
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,640
(Who it is.)

347
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,200
(Xia.)

348
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,200
(Mom.)

349
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,440
(You're my Mom?)

350
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,759
(Where have you been all these years?)

351
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,640
(Mom.)

352
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,279
Look, that girl

353
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,079
got lost when she was very little.

354
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,880
Her family has looked for her
for over ten years.

355
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,960
To find her, her dad traveled

356
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,640
all over the Yuedong Province

357
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,880
on a motorcycle.

358
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:54,880
Sadly, he still didn't

359
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,720
see his daughter before he died.

360
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,240
(Next, we'll leave the stage)

361
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
(to the two of them.)

362
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,119
(At the same time, we want to appeal)

363
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:07,079
(to the audience watching
in front of the TV.)

364
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,319
(If you or your family)

365
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,079
(have someone who's been missing)

366
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,079
(for years, like Ms. Zhang,)

367
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,400
(feel free to call this program,)

368
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:18,119
(Waiting for Your Return.)

369
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,640
(The home is far,)

370
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,759
(but the heart is close.)

371
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,599
(In 2010)
I saw her at the bus station.

372
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,960
She looks pretty.

373
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,480
She didn't know the way,

374
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,359
so I kept following her

375
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,240
to the riverbank.

376
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,759
Which riverbank?

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,720
Wangjiang.

378
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,400
South of Wangjiang.

379
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,880
Be more specific.

380
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,000
J-Just next to Dingjia Village.

381
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:53,435
(Record)

382
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,759
Wait.

383
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,240
Nanwan.

384
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:59,039
Where exactly is it?

385
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,079
Since you've handled so many cases,

386
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,599
what's your opinion?

387
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:10,079
It's unlikely that he misspoke.

388
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,799
Maybe he's done too many bad things
and got confused.

389
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:15,279
Given his expression,

390
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,640
he's definitely hiding something.

391
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,559
We've

392
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,720
known of three cases

393
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,079
he was involved in.

394
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,200
Let's go find Captain Du

395
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,279
to verify if there are

396
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:28,880
any unsolved

397
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,319
rape cases around Dingjia Village.

398
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,960
- Alright.
- Let's go.

399
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:34,519
Li.

400
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,400
Captain Du.

401
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Wangjiang Unidentified Female Body Case,

402
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,960
get its file for me.

403
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,599
Wangjiang Unidentified Female Body Case?

404
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:42,480
This way, please.

405
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,759
Wangjiang City.

406
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:51,839
Here it is.

407
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,079
Okay, thanks.

408
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,480
Here you are.

409
00:26:57,747 --> 00:26:58,279
(File)

410
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,160
The corpse was discovered
about a month ago

411
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,519
by local villagers.

412
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,519
When we arrived,

413
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,880
the body was decomposed.

414
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,240
(Criminal Investigation File)
And the face

415
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,279
was gnawed off by wild dogs.

416
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,920
Did the victim experience rape
before death?

417
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,519
Yes.

418
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,759
Procuratorate said

419
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,599
that

420
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,119
they extracted DNA

421
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,119
from male semen in the victim's vagina.

422
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,200
Was it transferred?

423
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:22,680
This is...

424
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,359
A newcomer, Lin Zhitao,

425
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,480
a recent graduate student.

426
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
Hello, Captain Du, I'm Lin Zhitao.

427
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,160
If only we could.

428
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,960
We currently have no clues.

429
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,519
Then why is it handed over to us?

430
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,799
We have no choice.

431
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,279
That's why

432
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,759
we got your forensic center

433
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,319
(Evidence)
involved.

434
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,319
We've heard

435
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:45,920
of Professor Lu
from the forensic center,

436
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,559
who is an expert in DNA.

437
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:49,240
So, we would like to ask him

438
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,359
to help us
narrow down the investigation range.

439
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:55,880
Ms. Zheng.

440
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,400
I'm not gossiping about Professor Lu.

441
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:01,240
But Professor Lu

442
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:04,119
is quite stubborn.

443
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,720
Zheng.

444
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,000
Captain Du.

445
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,200
Any news?

446
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,680
There's news,

447
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,119
but no results.

448
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,160
Tell me the news.

449
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,079
Are you sure?

450
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,440
This case is driving us crazy.

451
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,759
Of course, I'm sure.

452
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,279
(Examination Result)
Look.

453
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,440
It's the information

454
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,079
on the DNA from the semen

455
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:41,240
inside the victim's vagina.

456
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,400
I'm analyzing

457
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,559
the basic characteristics
of the Y chromosome.

458
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:49,079
According to the latest findings,

459
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,039
the Y chromosome of the male population

460
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,039
presents regional characteristics.

461
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,920
That is to say,

462
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,480
through this sample information,

463
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,160
we can accurately locate

464
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,559
and even pinpoint

465
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:01,799
a specific settlement.

466
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:03,839
That is to say,

467
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:05,319
through the Y chromosome,

468
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,519
we can find the birthplace
of the culprit

469
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,839
and thereby identify the culprit.

470
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:10,200
In theory, it is possible,

471
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,000
but,

472
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,279
in practice, it's quite difficult.

473
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,960
Our country's population mobility
is high.

474
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
Even if we narrow it down

475
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,839
to a specific settlement,

476
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,759
actually capturing the culprit

477
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,319
is another matter.

478
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,759
Science is science.

479
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:26,920
Let's speak briefly.

480
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,680
I just want to know

481
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,160
if we can identify the victim

482
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,400
through this information.

483
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,680
Well,

484
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,279
the scientific research findings show

485
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:37,799
that women do not have Y chromosomes.

486
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,200
They only have X chromosomes.

487
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,720
But even if we get the information

488
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,240
on the X chromosome,

489
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,920
we still can't identify the victim.

490
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:48,599
So,

491
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,200
those are

492
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,720
just words on a page?

493
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,200
It's not like that.

494
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,039
These are scientific conclusions.

495
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,359
For example, one day,

496
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:58,160
we have

497
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,279
a complete DNA database.

498
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,160
We could completely match it

499
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,279
with every person.

500
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,880
Billions of people.

501
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,839
That's...

502
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,119
What's the point

503
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,519
of telling me this now?

504
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,240
What makes you say that?

505
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
This is reality.

506
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,799
This is

507
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,119
what you will focus on

508
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,720
in your work.

509
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,160
Yes.

510
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,039
If we have a suspect,

511
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,119
can it be directly compared

512
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,440
with your samples?

513
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,680
If that's the case,

514
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,039
then the problem becomes simple.

515
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,799
He Guoqiang.

516
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,400
On January 2nd, 2010,

517
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:36,079
where were you?

518
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,319
Where was I on January 2nd?

519
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,559
I forgot.

520
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,200
Really?

521
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,519
Let me remind you.

522
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,640
You mentioned Dingjia Village

523
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,799
during the prosecutor's interrogation.

524
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,039
Do you remember?

525
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:54,799
I don't remember.

526
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,279
You don't remember?

527
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:58,400
Okay.

528
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,480
You might mix up the location,

529
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,640
but you can't forget what you've done.

530
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,839
I'll remind you.

531
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,640
Confess honestly.

532
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,119
Did you

533
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,400
rape a girl in that place?

534
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:13,799
No.

535
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,359
Think clearly before you answer me.

536
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,240
Look carefully.

537
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,000
(Forensic Opinion)
Your DNA

538
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,640
completely matches the sperm found
in the victim.

539
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,960
Still arguing?

540
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:34,400
Speak!

541
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,440
I just wanted to be with her.

542
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,680
Get to the point.

543
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,039
What did you do?

544
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,599
It's easy.

545
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,839
I did what I wanted.

546
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,160
She was unhappy about it.

547
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,200
She even hit me.

548
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:52,599
And then?

549
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,079
I hit her with a stone.

550
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,720
I didn't kill or rape anyone.

551
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,200
Defendant, stay calm.

552
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:03,480
Your Honor.

553
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,519
Prosecutor will present evidence.

554
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,079
This is the autopsy report
of the victim.

555
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,960
(Public Prosecutor)
It proves the extracted semen residue

556
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,920
from the victim's body

557
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,759
matches Defendant's DNA.

558
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,759
That woman was just a hostess.

559
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:20,519
She was soliciting at the station.

560
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,519
Your Honor.

561
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,359
I request that Lu Wenzhao,

562
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,160
a forensic expert

563
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,720
from the forensic center
of Yunhai Procuratorate,

564
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,680
testifies in court.

565
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,079
A piece of evidence

566
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:35,000
leads to multiple interpretations.

567
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,039
But when different pieces of evidence
are combined,

568
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,559
they point to the only truth.

569
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,279
Apart from semen,

570
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,359
we also found a large amount

571
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,960
of the defendant's skin tissue

572
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,799
(Defendant)
in the victim's nail crevices.

573
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,759
This proves

574
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,440
the victim fiercely resisted.

575
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,039
I was too excited when doing the act,

576
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,359
and I hurt her.

577
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,039
So she scratched me.

578
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,200
Your Honor.

579
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,000
Besides the defendant's skin tissue

580
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,960
in the nail crevices

581
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,720
of the victim,

582
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,720
there was also soil mixed in with it.

583
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,440
If the victim's death

584
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,039
was unrelated to the defendant,

585
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,839
then in her nail crevices,

586
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:20,720
there should be skin tissue

587
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,880
with soil on top.

588
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,759
However, through our examination,

589
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:26,200
the two are mixed together,

590
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:28,279
so it proves

591
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,480
that the victim

592
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,359
did fiercely resist in the wild.

593
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,400
I have a question.

594
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,519
If this act of soliciting happened
in the wild,

595
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,160
and during the process,

596
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,480
the victim was excited,

597
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,720
is it possible to get the same result

598
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,839
as you have identified?

599
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,079
It is possible.

600
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,319
Your Honor.

601
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,559
Defendant had explicitly admitted

602
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:00,279
he hit the victim's head with a stone.

603
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,160
If he did not kill the victim,

604
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:04,720
he couldn't specifically state

605
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,440
the location of the fatal injury

606
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,559
and the type of weapon used.

607
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:10,880
Your Honor.

608
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,280
After identification,

609
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,760
the victim's fatal injury was
on the head,

610
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,320
caused by a blunt object
striking the head.

611
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,880
The shape of the wound

612
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,079
and the attached soil

613
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,679
match the scene.

614
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,679
The murder weapon is highly suspected
to be a rock from the scene.

615
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,239
Highly suspected?

616
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,559
That is to say,
the weapon is not confirmed,

617
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:31,800
right?

618
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,960
Your Honor.

619
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,960
There was a heavy rainstorm
at the crime scene that night.

620
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,960
After being washed by the rain,

621
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,119
the weapon is indistinguishable.

622
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,159
So I can only say

623
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,519
the victim indeed died

624
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,880
from being struck
on the head by a blunt object.

625
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,239
But I can't confirm which stone

626
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,000
is the weapon.

627
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,280
If she accidentally fainted,

628
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,159
isn't it also possible

629
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,519
that she banged her head on a stone

630
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,440
and died?

631
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,079
Your Honor.

632
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,519
I would like to remind the court

633
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,079
that the defendant's confession
came first,

634
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,400
and then the police confirmed

635
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,000
the circumstances of the victim's death.

636
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,519
What you mentioned

637
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:15,679
is not possible to happen.

638
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,960
The Criminal Procedure Law

639
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,639
emphasizes evidence and investigation

640
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:21,760
instead of confessions.

641
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,320
No murder weapon,

642
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,079
no victim's statement,

643
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:29,320
and the victim's identity is unclear.

644
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,719
There is no complete chain of evidence,

645
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,159
so the defendant can't be found guilty.

646
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,559
Zheng.

647
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,159
I-I'm a medical expert.

648
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:50,039
I can only state

649
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:51,199
- my findings.
- I understand.

650
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,320
You determine the objective facts,

651
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,239
and I present the facts.

652
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,000
H-However,

653
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,960
I didn't complete the chain of evidence.

654
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,679
I let her down.

655
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,960
Zheng, this is not your fault.

656
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,079
I should have done the simulation test
in advance

657
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,920
to restore the trajectory of the injury
as much as possible

658
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,039
and exclude

659
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,199
interference factors
besides human factors.

660

661
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,719
of the victim's pathology report

662
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:23,840
are also insufficient.

663
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,920
I should have immediately

664
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,199
ruled out all other factors

665
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,719
making the victim unconscious

666
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,880
due to natural

667
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,559
or non-natural environment

668
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,079
during the whole process,

669
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,039
although it's also hard
to directly prove

670
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,639
the victim was attacked and killed

671
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,800

674
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,880
I got emotional.

675
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,719
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,199
You know I've always been rational,

677
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:58,159
but today I'm a little angry.

678

we will definitely prove

686
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,320
He Guoqiang is lying.

689

We're now missing an important link.

or a bad thing for them?
