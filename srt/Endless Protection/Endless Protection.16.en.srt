1
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,160
We have verified it.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,519
At the time of the incident,
Ning Kaitong

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,320
(Ning Kaitong's Identity Information)
is under 14.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,399
Release her first.

5
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:36,799
Ma'am.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,560
Lin Zhitao is still lying
in the hospital.

7
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,119
Then tell me what can be done now.

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,159
Deliberately set fire
and blocked the exit.

9
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:48,640
Isn't this intentional murder?

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,039
If she is released,

11
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,399
what about the justice of the law?

12
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:54,719
Release her.

13
00:02:12,083 --> 00:02:25,284

00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,708
=Episode 16=

15
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,439
Provincial court

16
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,919
pays high attention

17
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,120
to this incident suspected
of retaliation

18
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
of our prosecutor.

19
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,240
It requires our court and the police

20
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,840
to form a joint working group

21
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:43,960
to handle this case.

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,039
It was decided
by the Prosecutor's Committee

23
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,080
that Zheng Yanlai will be responsible
for this case.

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Ms. Zheng,

25
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,360
please explain the situation
you understand

26
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,800
to everyone.

27
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,039
Ning Kaitong's mother

28
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,560
is a defendant in a case handled
by Prosecutor Lin.

29
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,120
Ning Kaitong believes

30
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,960
that Lin Zhitao broke up her family

31
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,639
and has been seeking
a chance to retaliate.

32
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,280
In this case,

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,879
she led Lin Zhitao to the crime scene

34
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,639
and committed the act of arson.

35
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,159
I believe

36
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,879
the arson incident
by Ning Kaitong is egregious

37
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,560
and a direct challenge
to the juvenile prosecution.

38
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,599
Of course, I understand

39
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,719
you feel frustrated about the age

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,240
of criminal responsibility.

41
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,479
But the law is the law.

42
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,840
We can't neglect the law's authority

43
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,800
because our comrade was harmed.

44
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,759
I recommend

45
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,159
shifting the focus
of the joint working group

46
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,000
from investigation

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,639
to follow-up education and support.

48
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,759
Ning Kaitong will receive reprimand,

49
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,960
psychological counseling,
and behavioral correction.

50
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,000
It doesn't mean we will let her go,

51
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,240
nor does it mean
she will easily gain freedom.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
She must regularly report
on her activities,

53
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,560
and participate in community
service activities.

54
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,199
For a long period in the future,

55
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,439
we will all be watching her.

56
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,319
She will be educated,
supervised, and disciplined.

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,919
Below age of criminal responsibility

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,400
doesn't mean being left on her own.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,240
It also does not mean her guardians

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,720
can just muddle through.

61
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,120
They also need to receive admonition.

62
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,920
Although we have held the principle

63
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,439
of education first
for juvenile delinquency,

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,439
I hope you do not forget

65
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,720
the latter half of the sentence.

66
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,120
Punishment is a supplement.

(Yunhai Criminal Police)
Family is a minor's first classroom.

68
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,480
Parents are the first teachers
of minors.

69
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,240
Wait.

70
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,199
Ning Guochang,

71
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,759
you are now being admonished.

72
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
Correct your attitude.

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,759
Go on.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,519
Guardians should earnestly assume

75
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,000
the primary responsibility for
the family education of minors,

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,920
(Letter of Discipline)
and fulfill their legal duties.

77
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,720
Create a good family environment

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,600
for the healthy growth of minors.

79
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,120
Prevent minors
from getting into bad habits,

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,879
to keep them from falling back

81
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,120
into criminal behavior.

82
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,800
Hereby admonished!

83
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,079

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,120
Yes.

00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,079
Sign here.

86
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,600
- Thumbprint here.
- Okay.

87
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,839
Your office is quite shabby.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,879
It is a bit simple,

89
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,720
but we did our best.

90
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,439
Take the counseling.

91
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,120

(Books on Law and Psychology)

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,879
She has done quite a bit of research.

94
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,959
I wonder if she ever thought

95
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,000
she would see this day.

96
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,439

your tomorrow?

(OH Card)

98
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,079
Hello, Kaitong.

99
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,720
The People's Procuratorate of Yunhai
commissioned me

100
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,319
to offer you psychological treatment.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I am Dr. Su Jianyue, the psychologist.

102
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,480
Here,

103
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,839
choose three cards you like.

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,199
Describe each card with one sentence.

105
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,920
Dad takes the child.

106
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,240
Where are they going?

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,360
Going out to play.

108
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,720
Go on.

109
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,959
Well...

110
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,160
Train farewell?

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,319
The two look alike.

112
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,839
It's like saying goodbye to himself.

113
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,480
Psychology often interprets it this way.

114
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,480
They are mother and son?

115
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,519
The mom seems quite worried

116
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,839
the child might get into trouble.

117
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,839
But the child definitely keeps secrets

118
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,879
from his mom.

119
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,600
His hands are behind the back,

120
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,000
as if hiding something.

121
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,279
Lin Zhitao.

122
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,839
You put it?

123
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,519
Are you crazy?

124
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
Amulet.

125
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,519
Are you hurt?

126
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,799
Am I the only one hurt?

127
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,600
Take it away.

128
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:02,759
I'll call the doctor.

129
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,159
I'll call the doctor.

130
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,720
Why do I feel like

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,759
this man is molesting a child?

132
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,919
Although these cards

133
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,519
look simple,

134
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,399
everyone has a different interpretation

135
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,159
about them.

136
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,399
Due to your profession,

137
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,360
and having seen too many criminal cases,

138
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,200
when you see an adult man

139
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,279
alone with a child,

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
your perspective

141
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,919
will be different from others.

142
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,200
No wonder.

143
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,559
Come on, look at this one.

144
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,039
Ning Kaitong thinks

145
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,559
the mother cares about the child.

146
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,240
The child is hiding a secret.

147
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,399
Although she has a deep relationship
with her mother,

148
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,600
there is a barrier.

149
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,360
Or

150
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,759
maybe one of them did something

151
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,360
they can't face the other about.

152
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,879
How can there be a barrier
if the relationship is deep?

153
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,759
Even if she has secrets,

154
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:21,039
it's definitely about those
so-called revenge matters.

155
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,440
Actually, this card

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,080
also has another possibility.

157
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,279
The one with the secret is mom.

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,519
What secret could her mom have?

159
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,080
What if it's a past secret?

160
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:43,620
(Lin Zhiyang)

161
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:45,840
Hello?

162
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,000
Lin Zhitao is awake.

163
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,440
That's great.

164
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,200
We'll be there.

165
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,720
What's wrong?

166
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,559
Lin Zhitao is awake.

167
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
Thank you, see you later.

168
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,080
Bai, stop eating.

169
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,279
If Zhitao wakes up,

170
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,360
she'll think we came empty-handed.

171
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,519
Can't you buy more?

172
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,759
Be quiet.

173
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,600
Don't wake her up.

174
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,919
Then give me one more to eat.

175
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,759
I'm thirsty.

176
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:12,799
Awake.

177
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,720
Zhitao.

178
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,360
You are...

179
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm Cheng Wei.

180
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,360
Lin,

181
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,279
I am your uncle.

182
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
I am your grandaunt.

183
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,919
No sense of humor.

184
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,759
- Annoying.
- Nothing serious.

185
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,480
You scared.

186
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,360
I thought something
was wrong with your brain.

187
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,200
- Raise the bed.
- I'll raise it.

188
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,960
Let me do it.

189
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,600
Zhitao,

190
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,240
don't you

191
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,519
need to shave head for surgery?

192
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,639
Later, I will bring the wig

193
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,200
from the office.

194
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,960
You can wear it.

195
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,840
Why shave my head?

196
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,799
It's minimally invasive.

197
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:49,200
Just a small incision.

198
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,120
How is it? This height?

199
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,519
Just this position.

200
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,440
Slap a bandage on it.

201
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,480
No one will tell.

202
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,120
That's great.

203
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,759
This height?

204
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,600
- Okay.
- Comfortable?

205
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,120
Okay.

206
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,480
What would you like to eat? I'll...

207
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,600
Don't move.

208
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Cheng Wei.

209
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
I have something for you.

210
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,799
- What is it?
- What?

211
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:04,919
Give me the envelope here.

212
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,600
I... I thought about it.

213
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,039
It still needs to be given to you.

214
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,279
This counts as all my wealth.

215
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,159
What are you doing?

216
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:15,200
Don't scare me.

217
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,879
You say it's minimally invasive.

218
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,399
But it's still a surgery.

219
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,159
There's still a chance
it might not go down.

220
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,399
What if I don't come down?

221
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:22,840
This is what's left for you.

222
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,159
No.

223
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,600
I can't take your money.

224
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,440
Where would I have money?

225
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,240
This is my learning experience
over the years.

226
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:33,000
The accumulated materials

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,720
all are in this small USB drive.

228
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,799
For you, take it.

229
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,519
You'd better give her money.

230
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,519
Oh my God.

231
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,080
I've always been loyal to you.

232
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,799
Why are you repaying kindness
with enmity?

233
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,519
I just want to see you improve.

234
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,360
Though you seem noisy and flamboyant,

235
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,440
you're

236
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,720
the most...

237
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,720
What?

238
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,759
The most...

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,559
The most noisy and flashy.

240
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,200
Isn't there a twist?

241
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,720
No, it's just that everything
tagged with "most"

242
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
is fine, right?

243
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,919
The philanthropist,

244
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,720
what am I going to inherit from you?

245
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,840
I'll give you my cactus.

246
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,480
Since both of you have thorns.

247
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,080
As a set, is that okay?

248
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:17,559
I heard you went
to the relevant department

249
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,879
and howled recklessly, right?

250
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,519
Why would I howl?

251
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,159
Aren't you self-aware?

252
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,279
I got it.

253
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,039
You're a prosecutor, after all.

254
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,799
Can you be reliable?

255
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,919
I can.

256
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,000
If you trust me, that's alright.

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm telling you two.

258
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
If I really can't handle this surgery,

259
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,960
juvenile prosecution will depend on you.

260
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,840
- Quick, spit.
- Spit.

261
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,279
Don't spit on me.

262
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:42,960
Well,

263
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,639
about that KTV,

264
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,240
do you know something?

265
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,799
Weren't we

266
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,840
going to Ning Kaitong's uncle's house?

267
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,200
I think there's something wrong
with them.

268
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,720
So, I went back to check.

269
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,200
This KTV used to belong to
Ning Kaitong's father.

270
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,519
Then somehow it

271
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,960
became her uncle's.

272
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,200
But now her mother has also passed away.

273
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,279
Many situations can no longer
be understood.

274
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,159
We have to strive in this direction.

275
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,480
I think so.

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600
Let's each think for ourselves.

277
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,919
Then I will check it myself.

278
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,399
What are you checking randomly for?

279
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,519
Watch your boundaries.

280
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:17,720
Mind your status.

281
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Pay attention to your attire.

282
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,279
I can help to understand
the situation, okay?

283
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,039
Who is this?

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,559
A man.

285
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,519
What are you talking about?

286
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,200
And you?

287
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,600
This is my sister. This is my brother.

288
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,879
Saying this

289
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,080
is that difficult?

290
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:52,240
I go to work every day.

291
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,879
How come you know everything

292
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,320
and I don't know anything?

293
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,480
You just focus on eating.

294
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,440
Hello, I am Cheng Wei.

295
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,120
She has a boyfriend.

296
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,080
No.

297
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,799
I don't.

298
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,360
Well,

299
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,879
what's your zodiac animal?

300
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,080
Don't speak.

301
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,919
He can't speak.

302
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:14,639
He is mute.

303
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,440
He's quite handsome.

304
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,600
Stop here.

305
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,519
Wait a moment, Yang.

306
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,720
No.

307
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,720
Are you a love-struck fool?

308
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,279
What a pity.

309
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,559
He can't speak.

310
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,399
When did it happen?

311
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,559
Can it be cured?

312
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,559
So pitiful.

313
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,080
Why is he so handsome?

314
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,440
Because I'm handsome.

315
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,279
Who is it?

316
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
Here.

317
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,159
Here.

318
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,240
Where's Hu Li?

319
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,799
- Wait.
- Hu Li.

320
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,600
What's wrong?

321
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,279
Where's Hu Li?

322
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,240
Hu Li.

323
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,720
Where's he?

324
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
D-Didn't he follow you?

325
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,279
How would I know?

326
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,279
Did something happen?

327
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:34,639
Hu Li.

328
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,000
- Hu Li.
- Hu Li.

329
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:41,360
Hu Li.

330
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,080
Hu Li.

331
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,840
Hu Li.

332
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,799
Hu Li.

333
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,559
Hu Li.

334
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,080
- Hu Li.
- Hu Li.

335
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,399
Hu Li.

336
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,000
Hu Li.

337
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:58,440
- Hu Li.
- Hu Li.

338
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,799
Hu Li.

339
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,799
- Hu Li.
- Hu Li.

340
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,160
Who allows you to run around?

341
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,480
(Source of Nectar, Place of Nirvana)

342
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,200
Haven't we been apart
for over six months?

343
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,920
No one has ridden in my car
since you left.

344
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,000
Okay, we're here.

345
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,799
Thanks.

346
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:50,640
Thanks for what?

347
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,640
Slow down.

348
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,759
Okay.

349
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,319
Bai.

350
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,240
Captain Bai.

351
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,079
Thanks.

352
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,279
(Cherish Youth)

353
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:36,359
Can you solve it?

354
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,720
Elementary school problem,
can't you solve it?

355
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,599
It's too difficult. I can't do it.

356
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:42,960
Calculate it. It must be solved.

357
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,039
Hurry up. Write it in vertical format.

358
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,599
The answer is 4,204,800

359
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,599
minutes.

360
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,319
This is your eight-year sentence.

361
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,119
Think about

362
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,960
how you'll spend
these over 4 million minutes?

363
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,880
Bai,

364
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,359
what brings you here?

365
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,160
Did you hear that?

366
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
This is what I want to say to you.

367
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
Alright, come back and see them
when you have time.

368
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,480
They are...

369
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,279
I'm here, right?

370
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,720
They are all reformed very well.

371
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,599
Is that so?

372
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,119
You deserve some credit?

373
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,599
Taking over your position.

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,599
Captain Bai.

375
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,599
Captain Bai!

376
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,480
- Captain Bai.
- Captain Bai?

377
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,160
Get one in.

378
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,720
I'll be guarding you, Captain Bai.

379
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,400
It didn't go in.

380
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,240
- Try again.
- Try again.

381
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,720
Try another one.

382
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,920
- Alright.
- Fail again.

383
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,319
Don't pass it to him.

384
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,079
- Useless.
- Captain Bai, why are you back?

385
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:43,000
Just visiting you.

386
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,960
Captain Bai, you got sent back,
didn't you?

387
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,880
We won't mind you.

388
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,640
So cheeky.

389
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,920
I'll read the report reflections
both of you wrote.

390
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,920
Alright. Go do some activities.

391
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,720
Go play.

392
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,440
- Okay.
- Okay.

393
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
Be careful.

394
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,720
Why does he look so down?

395
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,359
Who hit him?

396
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,000
The new kid,

397
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,359
who's here for unlawful detention.

398
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,319
Unlawful detention?

399
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,559
Is it a kid named Tian Jun?

400
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,599
How did you know?

401
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:20,000
I met him while handling a case.

402
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,039
Where is he now?

403
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,119
In the confinement room.

404
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:23,960
Obviously.

405
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,799
Alright.

406
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,279
What's up with you? Tell me.

407
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,279
So dragging.

408
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,160
If not, I'm leaving.

409
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:32,720
Well,

410
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:35,160
are you still dating that girl

411
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,440
from the women's prison?

412
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,720
What do you mean?

413
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
I'm not competing with you.

414
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,359
Why so nervous?

415
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,160
Business.

416
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,640
You couldn't take her away.

417
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,559
We'll marry next year.

418
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,599
Congratulations!

419
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:47,119
Um,

420
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,240
please take me there.

421
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
I need to see a prisoner.

422
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,039
Go ahead.

423
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,359
You know the way.

424
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,279
Why are you asking me?

425
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,079
We're from the same place.

426
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,039
Having connections makes things easier.

427
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,319
With solid connections,
I get the inside scoop.

428
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,240
Come on! Again!

429
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,359
A bottle of Coke!

430
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,880
I'll give you a kick.

431
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,960
Pass to me.

432
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,160
Here, Captain Bai!

433
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,960
Pass to him?

434
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,519
He misses.

435
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,079
Three-pointer!

436
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:11,920
I believe in you.

437
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,200
Nice one, Captain Bai!

438
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,599
You're improving.

439
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,759
Have fun.

440
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,000
Xinwu,

441
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,799
is this what you told me about,

442
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,720
one of Yunhai Seven Heroes in Guangdong,

443
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,839
Bai Enyu?

444
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,880
I don't deserve it.

445
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,200
Xinwu often tells me

446
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
that, in the women's prison, you're

447
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:35,319
the most...

448
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,279
The cutest instructor.

449
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,519
He can say good things about me?

450
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:41,759
I say it every day.

451
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,559
Am I cute?

452
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,920
You're not just cute.

453
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,319
You're pretty too.

454
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,599
Yes.

455
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,839
The most handsome guy.

456
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:49,640
Well,

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,720
I...

458
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,480
Today, I want to learn about someone.

459
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,200
(Letter of Introduction)
She is an inmate here,

460
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,000
named Sun Yajuan.

461
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,480
She passed away last month.

462
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,344
Yes.

463
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,599
Bai, please don't stand on
ceremony with me.

464
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,039
Given this one,

465
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,920
and your relationship with Xinwu,

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,079
I'll share all I know.

467
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:09,799
That's great.

468
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,119
I want to know

469
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,960
when her daughter

470
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,839
last visited?

471
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,200
It was probably two weeks
before Sun Yajuan passed away.

472
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,519
I was on duty that day.

473
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,039
Was there anything special with them?

474
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,000
I just remember

475
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,160
they two started crying as they talked.

476
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,799
They cried very sadly.

477
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,000
That was the last time they met.

478
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,920
Later, Sun Yajuan was gone.

479
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,960
Can you find

480
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,400
recordings and videos from that day?

481
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,448
Okay.

482
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:39,880
Tong,

483
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,279
today,

484
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,960
I called you over

485
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,160
because there's something
I want to tell you.

486
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,720
It's time to tell you
about your background.

487
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,000
Tong,

488
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,480
actually,

489
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,759
before you came to us,

490
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,440
your dad and I

491
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,160
had a child.

492
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,160
He can be considered your brother.

493
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,720
When he was one year old,

494
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,559
he had a high fever

495
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
and passed away.

496
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,640
At that time,

497
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:26,359
I really wanted to go with him too.

498
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,880
During that time,

499
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,920
my health was not good.

500
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,400
Your dad

501
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,079
was with me every day
going to the hospital.

502
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,440
One day,

503
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,519
in the hospital,

504
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,599
we met a couple.

505
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,759
Their child

506
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,599
had congenital heart disease.

507
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,160
They also love their own child.

508
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,440
However,

509
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:03,160
they couldn't afford the surgery fee
for the congenital heart disease.

510
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,119
So they left you at the hospital.

511
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:07,000
You must understand this.

512
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,119
You can't blame them for this.

513
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,400
Mom, why are you telling me this today?

514
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:21,519
At that time,

515
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,519
I saw you for the first time.

516
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,519
You were so adorable,

517
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,240
with a little rosy face.

518
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,039
The first time you saw me,

519
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,720
you smiled at me without any defenses.

520
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,880
At that moment, I knew

521
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,519
you were a gift from heaven to us.

522
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:45,960
Tong,

523
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,440
your presence into our lives

524
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:53,160
is already the best arrangement.

525
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,559
We are really happy to have you.

526
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,480
I just hope you live well.

527
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,240
L-Live well.

528
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:15,119
Don't do anything for me.

529
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,359
Live well.

530
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,160
Be obedient.

531
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Thank you.

532
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,400
Mom.

533
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,079
Tong.

534
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,160
Live well, Tong.

535
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,920
Have you confirmed their relation?

536
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,720
Yes.

537
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,559
Ning Jiachang has blood type A.

538
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:46,720
Sun Yajuan has blood type O.

539
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,200
While Ning Kaitong has blood type AB.

540
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,240
(Personal Information File)
This is genetically impossible.

541
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,279
I confirmed it with Ning Guochang.

542
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,880
Ning Kaitong is indeed adopted.

543
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,880
However,
the exact birth date is unknown.

544
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,759
I found the hospital admission record

545
00:25:58,759 --> 00:25:59,880
she was hospitalized.

546
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,160
The age on it

547
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,160
(Yunhai Second People's Hospital Test Report)
doesn't match her current age.

548
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,240
Is there a possibility

549
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,240
that her actual age

550
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,480
is older than we know?

551
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,592
(Reply on Can "Bone Age Appraisal"
Be Used as Evidence for Criminal Liability Age)

552
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,880
I think Ning Kaitong should have

553
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,759
a bone age assessment.

554
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:28,864
(Laboratory 1)

555
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,160
What's the result, Director Lu?

556
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:45,504
(Bone Age Evaluation Report)

557
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:04,039
Ning Kaitong,

558
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,799
you have reached 14.

559
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,559
I see.

560
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,119
I satisfy

561
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,960
that age standard.

562
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,880
I admit to everything I've done.

563
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,640
You can quickly proceed with process

564
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,039
and send me to jail.

565
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,599
So I can see where my mom is living.

566
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,799
You've reached the age of fourteen.

567
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,920
It means you should take responsibility

568
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,079
for what you do.

569
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,400
But before this,

570
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,799
you need to know the truth.

(Explanation on Listening to Evidence
from Sun Yajuan's Dash Cam)

574

His illness

575
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,359
costs seven to eight thousand
just on medication every month.

for him.

579
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,640
When he was in pain,

580
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,000
his whole body convulsed.

581
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:28,400
He even ground his teeth to pieces.

582
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,519
It's been three years.

583
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,200
He endured pain that ordinary people
couldn't bear.

584
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,160
He lived without any dignity.

585
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,000
He didn't want to live anymore.

586
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,480
Let me die.

587
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,920
I beg you.

588
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,640
Help me.

589
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,559
Let me die.

590
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,480
Let me die.

591
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,000
At that time,

592
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,200
he

593
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,400
didn't have the strength to
drive himself to the lakeside anymore.

594

The day after Ning Jiachang's death,

595
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,240
you were caught on your way to apply
for insurance compensation,

596
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,920
right?

597
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:03,119
Yes.

598
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,799
We looked at the tuition fee notice
for Ning Kaitong's study abroad.

599
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:09,960
Deadline for payment

600
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,039
is three days
after Ning Jiachang's death.

601
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,759
No.

602
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,160
It's not...

603
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,599
It's not like that, I...

604
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,200
He hasn't been cremated.

605
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,880
And there's no funeral yet.

606
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,960
You're rushing to apply
for insurance compensation.

607
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,319
Do you want to listen again
the recording

608
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,240
in car's dash cam
to the day of the incident?

609
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,359
Can you help me?

610
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,079
Only you can help yourself.

611
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,960
As long as you confess truthfully,

612
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,599
it is possible to receive
a lenient treatment.

613
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,359
We just

614
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,720
want to use that insurance money

615
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,920
to leave something for the children.

616
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,200
You still have a KTV, right?

617
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,519
His uncle said it couldn't be sold.

618
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,440
No one took it over.

(Transcript)

620
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,480
Prosecutor,

621
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:25,039
may I ask you for a favor?

622
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,720
As long as it's legal,

623
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,559
it can be considered.

624
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,000
About this matter,

625
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,720
could you not tell Tong?

626
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,359
She is still young.

627
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,319
She can't live with a guilty conscience.

628
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
Please.

629
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,720
It's impossible.

630
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,039
My mom is very kind.

631
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,039
She wouldn't do such a thing.

632
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,440
I don't believe it.

633
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,880
You're all lying to me.

634
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,920
You're all lying to me.
She wouldn't do it.

635
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,559
I don't believe it.

636
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,480
I don't believe it.

637
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,920
Do you not believe,
or do you not dare to believe?

638
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,359
You thought you were the victim.

639
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,000
You retaliated against Lin Zhitao.

640
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,000
But you took advantage of a poor mother

641
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,559
and almost made her die.

642
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,960
To get back at your uncle,

643
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,480
you framed an innocent waiter.

644
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,119
All this was for your hatred.

645
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,440
You harmed so many people,

646
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
but they never harmed you.

647
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,359
Prosecutor Lin specifically

648
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,359
secured a closed trial for your mother.

649
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,160
This was to fulfill the promise
made to your mother,

650
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,480
to let you live under the sun.

651
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
The suggested six years

652
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,319
is already lenient.

653
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,279
She hopes your mom can reform well

654
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,039
and strive for early release

655
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:03,240
to witness your growth.

656
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,759
Do you know why the Criminal Law sets

657
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:16,400
a criminal responsibility age?

658
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,799
Because children at your age

659
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,440
are unable to distinguish
or control themselves.

660
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,240
I believe that
when you grow up some day,

661
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,200
and think back on today's events,

662
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,480
you'll understand.

663
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:42,319
I heard your mother's
final instructions to you.

664
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,720
She hopes you live well.

665
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,359
This is her greatest wish.

666
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,400
It's all because of me.

667
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,559
It's all because of me.

668
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:11,280
(I just hope you live well.)

669
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,000
L-Live well.

670
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,599

(Detention Rooms)

675
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,760
Prosecutor, please read out
the prosecution's opinion.

676
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,079
Under the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China's article 232,

677
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,880
intentional homicide

678
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,960
shall be sentenced to death,
life imprisonment,

679
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,800
or a fixed-term imprisonment
of over ten years.

680
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,599
Given that when the defendant
committed the crime,

681
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,360
she had reached the age of fourteen,

682
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,039
but were not yet eighteen,

683
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,000
the punishment should be
mitigated or reduced.

684
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:28,719
The defendant intentionally
killed the victim,

685
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,400
but failed due to reasons
beyond her will,

686
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:34,000
which constitutes an attempted crime.

687
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,760
Punishment may be mitigated,
reduced or exempted.

688
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,599
Chief Judge,

689
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,320
the victim, Lin Zhitao,

690
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,719
provided the People's Court
with a letter of understanding.

691
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,800
Please allow me to read it in court.

692
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:46,840
Yes.

693
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,719
The defendant's motive here

694
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,239
originated from a case a year ago.

695
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,800
At that time, as a Prosecutor,

696
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,840
representing
the People's Procuratorate of Yunhai,

697
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,599
I attended court
to support the prosecution

698
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,480
and provided
a sentencing recommendation.

699
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,719
Afterward,

700
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,119
I didn't follow up

701
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,320
the defendant's confusion
and uncertainty.

702
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,800
To some extent,

703
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,280
I failed to offer her a helping hand

704
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,719
when she most needed it.

705
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,599
Therefore,

706
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,719
she was unable to overcome
her adolescent confusion,

707
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,840
which ultimately led to this case.

708
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,159
Admittedly,

709
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,599
this case has caused me personal harm,

710
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,199
but I also understand
the minor defendant's

711
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:30,280
pain and anxiety at the time.

712
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,199
I sincerely apologize to her for this.

713
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,920
I personally agree
to forgive the defendant.

714
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,599
I request the people's court

715
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:41,079
to give Ning Kaitong a chance
to reform herself,

716
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,880
and reduce her criminal penalty.

717
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,159
I went back and thought about it.

718
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,440
I decided to issue a letter
of understanding to Ning Kaitong.

719
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,719
Why?

720
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,000
I think

721
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,960
I bear some responsibility

722
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,880
for this kid
inching closer to the brink.

723
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,920
At that time, I was only thinking about
punishing that criminal.

724
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,480
I didn't pay much attention to her.

725
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,719
I didn't think about her at all.

726
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
In her world,

727
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,519
she must feel I destroyed her family.

728
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:17,960
This is understandable.

729
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:20,719
Now, I am just

730
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,599
a little regretful.

731
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,800
If I had come to
juvenile prosecution earlier,

732
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,079
I could've realized it.

733
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,079
Please stay.

734
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,320
All rise.

735
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,519
The charges by the prosecution agency
are found valid.

736
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,320
Under the Criminal Law
of the People's Republic of China's

737
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,440
article 232,

738
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,519
the judgment is as follows.

739
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,599
Defendant, Ning Kaitong,

740
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,079
is guilty of intentional homicide.

741
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,480
Since she's a minor

742
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,559
between 14 and 18,

743
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,800
and it's her first
and occasional offense,

744
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,599
with an attempted crime,

745
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:54,599
(Assistant Judge, Clerk)
confession and remorse,

746
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,119
and the victim's forgiveness,

747
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,920
she's sentenced to five years
of imprisonment.

748
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,079
Judgment pronounced.

749
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,239
Court education follows.

750
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,719
All sit down.

751
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,639
Ning Kaitong,

752
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,960
I know you don't want
to be treated like a child.

753
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,199
You want, in your own way,

754
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,199
as an independent and mature individual,

755
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,159
to face, understand,

756
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,800
and to explore this world.

757
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,920
You have a tenacity in you,

758
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,400
which is pulling you towards maturity.

759
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,039
I know a child very similar to you.

760
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:38,639
She is Lin Zhitao.

761
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,199
She seems hard and cold outside,

762
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,039
but inside,
she's super soft and genuine.

763
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,239
This spirit in you
is very much like hers.

764
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,599
But you chose

765
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,400
to take a wrong path.

766
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,519
I know what you have done

767
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:57,159
is all due to your love for your parents

768
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,119
and for the family.

769
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,719
You chose

770
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,719
to hurt Lin Zhitao.

771
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,119
You chose to lash out

772
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,719
at everyone.

773
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,320
It's all because you wanted
to prove your love.

774
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,079
But as a mother,

775
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,360
I want to tell you,

776
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,280
love has no right or wrong.

777
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,719
But the way of loving

778
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,639
can be right or wrong.

779
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,400
Understanding the right way to love

780
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
is a sign of a person's maturity.

781
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,760
Everyone makes mistakes,

782
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,239
but your mistakes

783
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:33,519
have made more people suffer

784
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,400
and pay the price.

785
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:36,599
Five years

786
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,039
is not short in your life.

787
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,119
But for your future,

788
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,760
it's not very long either.

789
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,000
I hope that after five years,

790
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,599
you can walk on a path

791
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,800
that Lin Zhitao and I
both look forward to seeing.

792
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,074
(Yunhai Intermediate People's Court)

793
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,440
Ms. Zheng, I feel so heavy-hearted.

794
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,119
Well,

795
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,159
after hearing her story,

796
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,199
I actually feel quite sympathetic.

797
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,360
But as soon as I think of her

798
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:24,840
hurting Zhitao,

799
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,559
I hate her.

800
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,320
But...

801
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,000
Yes, I finally understand

802
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,360
what you went through
with that case of the three kids.

803
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,199
All the cases involving children

804
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,079
end up

805
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,760
in helplessness.

806
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,920
Even if you win the trial,
you can't be happy.

807
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:40,920
Yes.

808
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,392
Let's go.

809
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:48,384
(Yunhai Intermediate People's Court)

810
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,960
(Surgical Ward)
Zhitao finally pulled through.

811
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,480
Luckily, I prayed day and night.

812
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,159
Was it

813
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,599
because you prayed?

814
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,079
It was because the doctors
had excellent skills.

815
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,920
I know. But it's fine
if I get even a tenth of the credit.

816
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:03,480
It's all thanks to you, right?

817
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,159
Not really.

818
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:09,280
Isn't this Li Daoran?

819
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:10,880
Come on, hold this.

820
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,719
I'll deal with him.

821
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,760
No.

822
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:13,880
Listen to me.

823
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,719
What's their relationship?

824
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,719
Zhitao and Li Daoran?

825
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,079
You usually gossip so much.

826
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,199
But you don't know such big gossip?

827
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,920
He is really her ex-boyfriend?

828
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,039
I started to suspect before.

829
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:37,880
But then I thought,

830
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,119
what if he isn't?

831
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,039
Right? Wouldn't that be
spreading rumors about the boss?

832
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,440
Come on, elaborate.

833
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,800
Here's how it went.

834
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,239
Zhitao and Li Daoran,

835
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,000
during their postgraduate studies,

836
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,440
made it together to the finals
of the Nanzheng University's

837
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,920
debate competition.

838
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,719
It can be

839
00:42:57,719 --> 00:42:59,000
a meeting of strong opponents.

840
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,199
As soon as their eyes met,

841
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,480
didn't something spark?

842
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:03,920
What happened next?

843
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,320
Anyway, their story

844
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,199
is quite complicated.

845
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,320
I know

846
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:08,880
it was quite good.

847
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,719
Later, didn't Zhitao join our institute?

848
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,199
He went to District Procuratorate.

849
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:13,800
Just like that

850
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,760
Tapo's Yuan Jiaxin.

851
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,840
- They...
- Yes.

852
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,039
I know the Tapo duo.

853
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,480
- Yes.
- I know that. Skip it.

854
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,360
Tell the key point.

855
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:21,639
What key point?

856
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,159
How did they break up?

857
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:24,920
Go ask Zhitao.

858
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,400
I can't say much about
the leader's privacy.

859
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,908
(Honey)

860
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,239
Hey, Honey.

861
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,119
I know some big gossip.

862
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,079
Bai Enyu,

863
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,639
I'm about to give birth. My water broke.

864
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,119
Hurry over here.

865
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,239
What?

866
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:44,519
What's wrong?

867
00:43:44,519 --> 00:43:45,519
What's wrong, Bai?

868
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,920
This chicken soup is made
by stewing the whole chicken.

869
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,920
My mom said,

870
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,400
there is only one nourishing piece
of meat on a chicken.

871
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:52,960
It needs to be stewed as a whole.

872
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,480
Only then is it nourishing enough.

873
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,519
You can head back now.

874
00:43:58,519 --> 00:43:59,440
I'm fine here.

875
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:01,920
When I landed,

876
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,320
I didn't know what was up with you.

877
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,639
Seeing you like this,

878
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,000
I feel a bit relieved.

879
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:06,880
But,

880
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,760
I'm telling you,

881
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,920
becoming a prosecutor

882
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,639
and ending up in the ICU is not common.

883
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:11,239
Someone

884
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:12,760
might think you joined crime police.

885
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,079
I'm in a regular ward,

886
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,039
not the ICU.

887
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,440
Did you not transfer from the ICU?

888
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,000
Li Daoran,

889
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
if you want to fly here
to argue with me,

890
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,599
forget it.

891
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,360
I know what I'm doing, okay?

892
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,159
If you really know what you're doing,

893
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:26,280
you should take this opportunity

894
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:27,880
to leave the procuratorate

895
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,840
and become a lawyer.

896
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,800
Here you go again.

897
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,199
If you come to our firm,

898
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,719
Mr. Xiao and I

899
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,719
will welcome you with open arms.

900
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,280
Don't you like complex
and serious cases?

901
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,239
After you come,

902
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:41,840
you can handle the criminal cases.

903
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,159
I'm efficiency-focused.

904
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,360
I'll handle civil cases.

905
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,239
This way,

906
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,719
with our teamwork as a perfect couple,

907
00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:51,320
we'll be invincible.

908
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,440
Don't call us the perfect couple.

909
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,599
You scare me.

910
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:55,760
It's spine-chilling.

911
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,440
People can't live just
on ideals forever,

912
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,199
right?

913
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,039
This orange didn't get this big easily.

914
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:05,119
Just put it down.

915
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,159
You know it's not easy
to grow an orange big.

916
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:08,800
It's even harder for people to grow up.

917
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,480
Besides,

918
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:12,280
procuratorate

919
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:14,880
can run just fine without you.

920
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:18,880
I think that guy
is actually quite caring.

921
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,760
Leave it to him,

922
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,039
you can rest assured.

923
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,039
So many roads,

924
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,880
why did you choose such
a tiring one to walk?

925
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,400
The path you chose is quite tiring.

926
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,519
Put down the orange, go.

927
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,480
I won't see you off.

928
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,960
Well,

929
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,360
there's something
I really want to tell you.

930
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:40,000
You haven't attended

931
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,159
the debate team's gathering
for a few years.

932
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,039
I know you have

933
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:45,719
some prejudice against me,

934
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,400
but the classmates haven't
done anything wrong.

935
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:50,920
About the gathering,

936
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,199
consider it.

937
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:53,880
We'll see.

938
00:45:55,827 --> 00:45:58,279
(Three Months Later)

939
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,239
Good kid.

940
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,920
Okay, I know.

941
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,800
But now I have to go

942
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,159
file this dossier.

943
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,519
Then mail the documents.

944
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,960
I know you're eager.

945
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,920
I've been urging them.

946
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,599
At the office,

947
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:32,880
it's just Bai and me.

948
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,159
We are just human, right?

949
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,719
Let's tackle things one by one, okay?

950
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:41,000
Did you take it?

951
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,159
I should have had you bring glasses.

952
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:45,960
Alright.

953
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,559
Listen to the doctor's advice.

954
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,800
I'm so normal now.

955
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,480
Who can see something's wrong with me?

956
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,159
I don't get what they're
observing about me.

957
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:55,360
Is this the book?

958
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,239
Yes.

959
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,119
It's about children.

960
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,079
It's about adolescents.

961
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,400
The doctor said,

962
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,599
you should rest well,

963
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:07,719
and don't overthink.

964
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,480
Aren't I aiding and abetting?

965
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,719
Quick, drink the soup.

966
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,039
