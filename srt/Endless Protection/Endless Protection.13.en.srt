1
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:23,359
Do it.

2
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,519
Let them see how awesome we are.

3
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,320
Just do it.

4
00:01:50,996 --> 00:02:04,197
=Endless Protection=

5
00:02:05,016 --> 00:02:07,621
=Episode 13=

6
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,120
Qiang,

7
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,080
didn't we agree

8
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,520
to stay on different sides?

9
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,960
We mind our own business.

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,599
Why do you always come to our side?

11
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,599
Did your build this road?

12
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,560
Is your name written on the tires?

13
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,439
Don't be shameless.

14
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,159
We've given up half the turf to you.

15
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,080
Buddies!

16
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,719
Do you want me to thank you?

17
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,439
What do you mean?

18
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,159
Cut the crap.

19
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,159
- Hit him.
- What's he up to?

20
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,544
So no more room for talking?

21
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,479
We don't fear you.

22
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,479
You can try us.

23
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,919
- Come on.
- Try it!

24
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,680
Come on.

25
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,240
They're having a fight.

26
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,400
Stop the fuss!

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,360
- What are you doing?
- What's this?

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,680
Stop it. What's this?

29
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,439
Come on.

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,599
What are you doing at midnight?

31
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,560
And the lousy cigarette.

32
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
What are you doing here?

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,240
Trying to get the police here?

34
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,960
Wen, these outsiders...

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,280
Who are you calling outsiders?

36
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,080
- Stop it.
- Cowards with no parents.

37
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,840
Say it again.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,759
Stop it.

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,280
Stop.

40
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,759
- Stop.
- Bring it on!

41
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,319
Come on.

42
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop. What's this about?

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,599
Say it again.

44
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,080
It's not a big deal.

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,879
We agreed to draw a line

46
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,800
and each take a side. Isn't it good?

47
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,360
Stop the fuss.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,960
There is surveillance there.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What are you doing?

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why are you here?

51
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
Don't get physical. I'm your granduncle.

52
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,919
Yes, we must fight.

53
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,479
Stop it.

54
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,639
Don't run if you dare.

55
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:39,439
Stop it.

56
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,479
Alright.

57
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,240
You're a grown man. What are you doing

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
with all the fuss?

59
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,879
If you have guts, compete. Okay?

60
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,919
Just race.

61
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
The winner gets the turf.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,199
Agree?

63
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,000
No need to race,
given their lousy bikes.

64
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not shameful to chicken out.

65
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,280
Hurry home

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,479
to your mom.

67
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,960
Let's race. I'm not afraid of you!

68
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,759
I haven't finished talking.

69
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,840
I haven't finished.

70
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,560
We'll join the race too.

71
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,039
Zhitao.

72
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,360
Hurry up and go home.

73
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,840
It's a deal then.

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,639
If we win the race today,

75
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
let's pretend this never happened.

76
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,639
We share the field.

77
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,959
No one can mention this again.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,959
Okay?

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,399
Whether you can win is another matter.

80
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,240
Can you ride a bike?

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, can you?

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
I never said I would race.

83
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,040
He can ride.

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,000
You?

85
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,120
It has to be me.

86
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,120
Are you sure about this?

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,800
There's no honor

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
even if I beat these little punks.

89
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,959
Did you think you'd really race?

90
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,759
Just drive out and be safe.

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,879
Did she agree?

92
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,240
I made a mistake. If...

93
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,680
Don't worry, Zhitao and I

94
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,240
have arranged everything in the van.

95
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,120
- What?
- Nothing.

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,800
It's nothing.

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,319
Here you are.

98
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,079
What are you doing?

99
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,800
Put it on.

100
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,480
I mean, what are you doing?

101
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
- Let's go.
- Stop the fuss.

102
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,040
We are racing.

103
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,959
If you sit here,

104
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,839
it becomes a motorcycle taxi.

105
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,959
Hurry up.

106
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,360
What are you doing here? Go home.

107
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,560
If you win, I'll go home.

108
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,040
Listen.

109
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,560
Race him.

110
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,959
I'll handle it, alright?

111
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,160
Let's make a deal.

112
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,920
If you lose, just go home quietly, okay?

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,600
Okay.

114
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,439
Alright, let's go.

115
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,240
With you on my bike,

116
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,199
it's a miracle if I win.

117
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
Hurry up.

118
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,639
Listen carefully.

119
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,800
Ride to West Mountain

120
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
and take the roundabout.

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,639
(Dangerous. Don't imitate.)
Who gets back first wins.

122
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,752
Ready?

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,759
Go.

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,759
Go! Hurry up!

125
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,639
Why aren't you moving?

126
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,839
I'll give them five minutes.

127
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,160
He can't beat me anyway.

128
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,160
50, Bai Enyu, 50.

129
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm racing.

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,519
The speed limit is 50.

131
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,560
Okay.

132
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,160
You're at 51.

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,240
I'm watching.

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,000
With you here,

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,879
I can't even see their taillights.

136
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,600
Got your license on you?

137
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,240
Yes. Of course.

138
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,680
There are traffic cops

139
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,519
ahead of us.

140
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,519
- What?
- Traffic cops at the next intersection.

141
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,800
How do you know that?

142
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:14,920
Stand properly.

143
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,600
Hands out.

144
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,240
Are you two the leaders?

145
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
I could tell you two planned it.

146
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,759
- Stop.
- You know what you did?

147
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,920
(Police)
You violated traffic laws.

148
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,399
It's very dangerous.

149
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:27,840
Don't move.

150
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:30,639
Driver's license.

151
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,439
Look at you two.

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,639
No licenses.

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,680
Speeding.

154
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,736
- License.
- Running red lights.

155
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:41,519
No helmets.

156
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,360
Listen up.

157
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,959
We have to impound your bikes.

158
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,639
Also...

159
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:48,360
(Driver's License: Bai Enyu)

160
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,879
Later,

161
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,800
you and your men...

162
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,639
I'm impressed.

163
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,399
Need to go with me.

164
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,560
- Blow to the tube.
- Testing started. Please blow.

165
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,279
No alcohol detected.
Thank you for your cooperation.

166
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,639
I am compliant and legal.

167
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,856
(Road construction. Slow down)

168
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,839
(Traffic Safety Education Base)
Officer,

169
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,160
actually, these kids just love to ride.

170
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,680
It's just their speed is a bit fast.

171
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,559
They're skilled.

172
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,240
Stop talking.

173
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,960
Is racing not a big deal?

174
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,440
What are you pretending to be?

175
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,279
You shut up.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,480
(Lin Zhitao, Yunhai Procuratorate)
Officer, we are...

177
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,639
Are you experiencing life

178
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,639
or on an incognito visit?

179
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:47,960
May I say something?

180
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,519
(Civilized traffic and safe travel)
Watch the video carefully.

181
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,840
Okay, go ahead.

182
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,039
The truth is,

183
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,039
the race was out of necessity.

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,279
There's such a necessity?

185
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,000
The truth is,

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,519
when we arrived,

187
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,039
they were already having a dispute

188
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,759
over an issue.

189
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,039
They were about to fight.

190
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,288
We could only take this resort.

191
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,240
So you decided to watch them race?

192
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,159
You are...

193
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,480
From the procuratorate.

194
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,799
We're at fault.

196
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,320
But it was the best way we thought of

197
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,279
at that moment.

198
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Officer, these kids are not even of age.

199
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,080
See if you can make an exception.

200
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,039
Alright, I got it.

201
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,000
You feared they'd be reckless

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
and get hurt.

203
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,240
So you brought them to us

204
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,360
to give us trouble, right?

205
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:29,879
No.

206
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,480
We didn't mean to cause you trouble.

207
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,279
But think about it.

208
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,519
If these kids started fighting,

209
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,159
they wouldn't be there.

210
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,559
Some might be in the hospital.

211
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,279
In the end, they haven't caused
too much impact, right?

212
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,000
Give them a chance.

213
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,759
We'll educate them.

214
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,000
We'll talk to them.

215
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,919
No exception.

216
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,799
Absolutely.

217
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,200
Later,

218
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,080
have their parents take them home.

219
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,519
Education is necessary.

220
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,200
Certainly.

221
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
We'll impound their unlicensed bikes.

222
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,840
Impound them if you must.

223
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,440
Thank you.

224
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,639
Jiang,

225
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,039
inform these kids' parents

226
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,120
to take them home.

227
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,559
Officer,

228
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,200
if you can really find my parents,

229
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,480
I'll come every day from now on.

230
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,840
Shut up. Did I let you speak?

231
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:09,840
What?

232
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,399
You're doing well today,

233
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,799
not like your usual style at all.

234
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,480
I got smeared by the black.

235
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,440
My surname means white, not black.

236
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,080
- Mr. Yan.
- Mr. Yan.

237
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,960
Sit down.

238
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,879
Watch carefully.

239
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,080
Officer,

240
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,039
I came here after taking the call.

241
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,200
From Yan Jie Motors?

242
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,200
Yes.

243
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,559
I modified all their bikes.

244
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,159
You served for snatch theft.

245
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,559
You haven't repented since release?

246
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,000
Do you know

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,440
that private modifying is illegal?

248
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,840
Where is Bai Zuhao?

250
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,320
Oh, no.

251
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:22,600
Hello, Zuhao.

252
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:24,440
No trouble from you lately, huh?

253
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:26,077
Yes.

254
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:27,960
I have something to tell you.

255
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,240
Your mom and I are late

256
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,279
in construction period.

257
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
This year, we...

258
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,639
You won't come back?

259
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,760
We will.

260
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,399
After the New Year.

261
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,039
In March or April.

262
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,360
Suit yourselves.

263
00:11:50,323 --> 00:11:53,136
(Yan Jie Motors)

264
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,559
About the race last night,

265
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,960
were you at the scene?

266
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,759
Was there

267
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,759
a race last night?

268
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,240
I don't know.

269
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,440
I didn't go.

270
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,320
You didn't?

271
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,159
No.

272
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,480
Mr. Yan,

273
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,879
would you fix my bike

274
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,080
for me?

275
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,480
Didn't you not go last night?

276
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I indeed didn't go.

277
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,759
I really didn't go.

278
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:44,120
Their parents
have forbidden them from riding.

279
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
You behave yourself too.

280
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,720
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

281
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,000
I absolutely will, Mr. Yan.

282
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,240
You didn't go?

283
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,279
I didn't.

284
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,519
Fix it?

285
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,320
Fix it, my foot.

286
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Well,

287
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,120
Heizi and the others...

288
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,080
How are they?

289
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,919
They are fine.

290
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Their bikes are taken.

291
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,200
What is Bai Enyu to you?

292
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Your family's relative?

293
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:22,600
Mr. Yan,

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,320
do you know him?

295
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,480
I met him in childhood.

296
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
What is he doing now?

297
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,159
Him?

298
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:29,799
A prosecutor.

299
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,320
It's like

300
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,879
he has nothing else to do daily.

301
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,799
All he knows is to catch me.

302
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,279
Mr. Yan,

303
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,360
actually, I don't have
any other requests.

304
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,960
Just make my bike

305
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,960
a bit faster.

306
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,879
Just a bit, I beg you.

307
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:43,679
Alright.

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,919
I can make it faster.

309
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,759
Really?

310
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
So fast that it seizes when you

311
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,879
hit the gas and breaks.

312
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,519
Mr. Yan,

313
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,320
just adjust it for me, please.

314
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
You want it fast?

315
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,600
Go fly a plane.

316
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,039
Listen to my advice.

317
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,799
Go back and study.

318
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:15,080
Grandnephew?

319
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,320
How did he find this place?

320
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,360
Mr. Yan,

321
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm going to hide.

322
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,440
Don't tell him I'm here.

323
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,279
I'll go up first.

324
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,552
(Yan Jie Motors)

325
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,000
Avoiding me for years,

326
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
so this is what you've been doing.

327
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,519
All these years,

328
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,799
I've been fixing motorbikes here.

329
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,080
Have you been fixing them

330
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,919
or just modifying them for those kids?

331
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
Am I breaking the law?

332
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,360
If I'm breaking the law,

333
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,159
hurry and arrest me, prosecutor.

334
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,919
Don't you know
whether you're breaking the law?

335
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:11,879
What do you need exactly?

336
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,720
Zuhao and Heizi are only in their teens.

337
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,320
Don't ruin them.

338
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,320
If I don't modify those bikes,

339
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,120
someone else will.

340
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,080
Why can't I earn the money?

341
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,320
Don't you know how old they are?

342
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,320
They are reckless.

343
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
What if something occurs?

344
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,679
Can you bear the responsibility?

345
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,960
Reckless?

346
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,519
So you know that too.

347
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,279
Junyan,

348
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,440
you can't get back
if you're stray for too long.

349
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,759
We're old.

350
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,679
We can't keep doing foolish things.

351
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,759
If Junjie were here,

352
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,200
he wouldn't let you do this either.

353
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:57,080
Don't mention my brother to me.

354
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,120
You're making dirty money
off these kids.

355
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
Can you live with that?

356
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,519
What if those kids end up
like we did back then?

357
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,000
What about the rest of their lives?

358
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,720
Stuck with the bikes forever?

359
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,960

- Okay.
- We'll pack and wait for you.

- Hurry up.
- Alright.

- Go! Pack up!
- Dali.

- Take this up.
- Let's go.

Wait.

375
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,160

Thank you, Big Brother.

378

For you two.

379
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:13,839
Thank you.

00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,880
Here, for you two.

382
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,039
Thank you.

383
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,720
Why did it take Junyan so long?

384
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,599
I don't know.

385
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,720
Jie.

386
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,359
Do you believe

387
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,240
that in less than two years,

388
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,480
we'll be

389
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,680
(Young Chen Junjie)
the best guys on this street.

390
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:32,880
You are right!

391
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,440
Right?

392
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:35,839
Yes.

393
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,200
Yan.

394
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,400
Big Brother.

395
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,440
- Why are you so late?
- What's wrong?

396
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,279
What's wrong?

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,920
The money was robbed.

398
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,559
Are you alright?

399
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,359
Don't cry.

400
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,519
Who did it?

401
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,960
Cheng and a few others.

402
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,839
Let's go.

403
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,599
Bai Enyu, don't be impulsive.

404
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,519
Think it over.

405
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,519
They've crossed the line.

406
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,440
What's there to think?

407
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,200
Junjie, he's

408
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,359
your brother. Won't you act?

409
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:03,359
No.

410
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,319
I didn't mean it.

411
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,319
Then what do you mean?

412
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,279
Are you scared?

413
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,559
No.

414
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,759
Even Jia is not afraid.

415
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,680
Let's go fight them!

416
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,480
Grab the weapons.

417
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,559
Let's go and fight.

418
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:17,720
Let's go.

419
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:19,440
Jie,

420
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,799
it's for your brother.

421
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,968
(Celebrate the Grand Opening
of Fuchun Restaurant)

422
00:18:42,227 --> 00:18:44,704
(Haitian Video Hall)

423
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,559
Give my buddy's money back.

424
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,119
- Sit down.
- Freeze!

425
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:50,720
What's this?

426
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Don't move.

427
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,680
What?

428
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,920
Back to give me more money?

429
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:00,920
If you don't repay it,

430
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,880
no one is leaving today.

431
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,880
Yes.

432
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:06,599
Return the money.

433
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,119
Return it?

434
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,200
Return, my foot!

435
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:19,960
Get more villagers here.

436
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,519
Guang, go.

437
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:35,519
Dali!

438
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,319
Bai Enyu!

439
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:54,920
Bai Enyu!

440
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,240
Bai Enyu!

441
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,152
Take this.

442
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,160
Take this.

443
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,279
Bai Enyu!

444
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,359
Bai Enyu!

445
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:27,799
Big Brother,

446
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:28,799
what should we do?

447
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,160
What else can we do?

448
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,839
Run!

449
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,319
Move!

450
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Brother.

451
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,599
Junjie...

452
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,160
Hit me.

453
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,599
Kill me.

454
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,720
Scram!

455
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,359
Don't do something you'll regret.

456
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,279
We arrived half an hour early.

457
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:00,440
Did you speed?

458
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,440
No.

459
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,119
No wonder Bai said

460
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:04,519
you only trust the GPS, not roads.

461
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,920
I take this road many times a year.

462
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,359
I took the shortcut.

463
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,839
This place is so far from the downtown.

464
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,480
How did you plan this management area?

465
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,880
There's no planning.

466
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
We don't have enough manpower.

467
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
Whichever kid I run into

468
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,680
becomes my responsibility.

469
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:20,519
So it's purely fate.

470
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,960
In the future,

471
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,519
you can use big data, right?

472
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,640
I-It's both efficient and scientific.

473
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,759
No wonder you're a leader.

474
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,279
You speak with foresight.

475
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:29,920
Is it sarcasm?

476
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,160
No.

477
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,200
I heard Bai stayed up

478
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
all last night
at the traffic management bureau.

479
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,160
He was there all night.

480
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,279
Most of the kids are left-behind kids.

481
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,200
Their parents wouldn't arrive soon.

482
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,000
Their parents do all kinds of jobs,

483
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,720
like security

484
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,880
or breakfast stalls owners.

485
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,119
They lack time for their kids.

486
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,279
Those kids

487
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,599
are very like left-behind kids.

488
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,720
Bai's great-grandma is here.

489
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:50,960
Great-grandma.

490
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:51,799
Great-grandma.

491
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,640
Great-grandma.

492
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,880
Prosecutor Lin.

493
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:56,799
Yes, it's me.

494
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,000
Cheng?

495
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,680
Yes.

496
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,319
Ma Wenwen.

497
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,359
She's a teacher.

498
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:03,119
Slowly, Great-grandma.

499
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm better than you guys.

500
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,519
Yes.

501
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,279
I need to practice.

502
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,039
Alright, we're almost there.

503
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:14,839
Come in.

504
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:27,040
(Yunhai Seven Heroes)

505
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:27,872
Wait.

506
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,319
Who wrote "Yunhai Seven Heroes"?

507
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,440
(Yunhai Seven Heroes)
Enyu drew these

508
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:41,119
when he was young.

509
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,039
Bai drew these?

510
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,680
I mean Mr. Bai.

511
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,480
At first, he drew himself

512
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,920
and a few kids from the village.

513
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,039
Since they were young,

514
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,000
they hang out together.

515
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,680
Later,

516
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,400
one kid died,

517
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,240
so they dispersed.

518
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:13,160
This is Zuhao's room.

519
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,119
Look.

520
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,599
Great-grandma, let me.

521
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:20,200
Don't move.

522
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,200
Zuhao's parents

523
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,160
are working in Africa

524
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,119
as dispatch workers.

525
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,279
They really had no choice

526
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,880
but to leave him in my care.

527
00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:35,519
How long have they not been back?

528
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,160
It's been three years.

529
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,279
Young people always want to go out.

530
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,319
Only the old and the young
are left behind.

531
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,119
This kid really likes motorcycles.

532
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,720
He is crazy about them.

533
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,872
Take a look.

534
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:56,640
Right.

535
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,359
Sit down.

536
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,519
You sit.

537
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,240
You sit.

538
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,119
Please sit.

539
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,119
Great-grandma,

540
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,480
you mentioned

541
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,319
that a kid died.

542
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,799
What happened then?

543
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:31,648
(Yunhai Seven Heroes)

544
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,960
Feeling cold?

545
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll make you a bowl of tangyuan

546
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:42,720
to warm your stomach.

547
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:47,920
Great-grandma,

548
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,119
I killed Jie.

549
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,559
I was the one who suggested going.

550
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,359
I'm the one who should die.

551
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,720
Nonsense.

552
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,680
The one who killed Jie

553
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,119
was that bad person who stabbed him.

554
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,160
Not you.

555
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,000
You are also at fault

556
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,559
for being too impulsive

557
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,880
and reckless.

558
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,839
But torturing yourself
by not eating or drinking like this

559
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,279
won't bring Jie back.

560
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,039
You made a mistake.

561
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,440
Remember it deeply

562
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:41,680
and change.

563
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,640
Don't make the same mistake again.

564
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,079
Enyu,

565
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:51,759
look.

566
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,920
At these houses

567
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,240
are home to you.

568
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:58,640
The people living inside

569
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,960
are all your family.

570
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:03,640
In front of family,

571
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,039
don't force yourself to be strong.

572
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,839
Alright?

573
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,720
In the days to come,

574
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,720
there is still a long way to go.

575
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,119
You have to

576
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,759
live well for Jie.

577
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,240
Later on,

578
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,000
Enyu seemed like a different person.

579
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,920
He went back to school
and got into college.

580
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,279
He even secretly majored
in something called sports medicine.

581
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,960
It was actually just massage
and therapy.

582
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,039
He wanted to come back and open a clinic

583
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:49,279
to take care of us old folks.

584
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
What a fool.

585
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,440
I gave him a good scolding

586
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,559
and drove him away.

587
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,000
Actually, I know

588
00:28:58,759 --> 00:28:59,880
he has ambitions

589
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,480
and capability.

590
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,279
He shouldn't be stuck with us like this.

591
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,359
You see,

592
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,640
he got
into the Juvenile Correctional Facility

593
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:14,160
and entered the Procuratorate.

594
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,880
That proves he is capable.

595
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,279
I

596
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,200
haven't done much in this life.

597
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,720
I just hope the kids

598
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,000
can live with dignity

599
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,960
and have love in their hearts.

600
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,359
Back then, Enyu could do it.

601
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,519
I believe Zuhao

602
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:36,920
can also do it.

603
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,480
Help me

604
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,160
and bring Zuhao back home.

605
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:44,680
Tell him

606
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,079
that no matter what happens,

607
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,759
I will always be at home

608
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,440
waiting for him to come back.

609
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,039
Okay.

610
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,000
You're back.

611
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:17,759
What's wrong?

612
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,319
Where's the grocery you bought?

613
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,640
Let me put this down.

614
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,440
Alright?

615
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,880
What are you doing?

616
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,960
What's wrong?

617
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,039
I want a hug.

618
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,839
Did something happen to you?

619
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,440
- No.
- Let me see.

620
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:39,880
Did you fight?

621
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
N-No.

622
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,559
Who hit you?

623
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,079
Let's go.

624
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,079
Where are you going?

625
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:45,759
Where am I going?

626
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,119
To hit them back, of course.

627
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,920
You are pregnant now.

628
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,759
Hitting back?

629
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:51,079
Don't scare our baby.

630
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,680
Then why did you fight?

631
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,160
Give me a hug.

632
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,559
Wait.

633
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,279
Are you going to say it or not?

634
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,000
Give me a hug.

635
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,720
Baby,

636
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,400
your dad is keeping a secret

637
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,759
from us.

638
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,880
He won't say anything

639
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
even if he got beaten.

640
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,680
I couldn't even ask him.

641
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,200
I ran into Chen Junyan.

642
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,880
What are you doing?

643
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:33,920
Bai Zuhao,

644
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:35,880
did you set a trap yesterday?

645
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,680
It has nothing to do with me.

646
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,319
Nothing, huh?

647
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,920
Then why did they talk to you?

648
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,880
I don't know them.

649
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,359
You don't know them, huh?

650
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,200
Cut the crap.

651
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,279
Compensate my bike.

652
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,720
I have no money.

653
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,599
They set you up.

654
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,319
Right?

655
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,000
If they set you up, go to them.

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,319
Bai Zuhao!

657
00:31:58,119 --> 00:31:59,000
We're villagers.

658
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,400
I don't want to mess with you.

659
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,960
Do you know those two

660
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,160
made my dad come get me

661
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,480
from out of town
in the middle of the night?

662
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,359
Do you know how badly he beat me?

663
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:12,759
Rui,

664
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,920
get the keys.

665
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,839
Let go.

666
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:16,920
Let go...

667
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:17,960
Let go...

668
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,720
Bai Zuhao,

669
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,839
don't blame me.

670
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,480
You know I need

671
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,759
the bike during the New Year.

672
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,000
Let go.

673
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,559
Wait!

674
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,119
Don't touch my bike.

675
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,759
I'll get you money.

676
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:37,920
I never expected

677
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,160
that Bai is actually

678
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,960
a delinquent who found his way back.

679
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,400
No wonder when he was

680
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,240
in that outfit,

681
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,200
I thought he looked like a gangster.

682
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,039
Now I see.

683
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
- Take it.
- In this society,

684
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,440
if there were more people
like his great-grandma,

685
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,319
we wouldn't need to run around all day

686
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,039
to conduct surveys in the streets.

687
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,119
Right?

688
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,120
Yes, Bai Enyu is quite lucky.

689
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,599
Not every delinquent

690
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,440
can meet someone like his great-grandma.

691
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:01,920
Fair point.

692
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Are we almost there?

693
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,400
Just ahead.

694
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,519
Here we are. This is the place.

695
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,119
I'll knock on the door.

696
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,440
Is Heizi at home?

697
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,559
Who is it?

698
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,319
It's me.

699
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,519
Why is it you again?

700
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,759
What are you all up to?

701
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,119
You've kept coming back.

702
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:25,799
We just want
to know the situation better.

703
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,200
There is nothing for you to know.

704
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,920
Can you stop causing trouble, ma'am?

705
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,759
With your one call,

706
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:30,519
I had to

707
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,880
take the train back at midnight.

708
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,240
I have to make a living.

709
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,720
Heizi isn't attending class.

710
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,240
Do you know?

711
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,880
I know.

712
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,319
And you've done nothing?

713
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,720
You're his guardian. You have duty.

714
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,480
I can do nothing.

715
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,240
What do you mean?

716
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,039
You can step in.

717
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,759
I beg your pardon?

718
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,640
He is your son.

719
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,880
He's already 17.

720
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,720
Ask my mom.

721
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,799
When I was his age,

722
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,000
I was about to be his dad.

723
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,079
He can either

724
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:50,720
go to school or drop out
to start working.

725
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,119
What are you talking about?

726
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:52,839
Then why did you

727
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,119
give birth to him at first?

728
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,319
Go ask his mom.

729
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:57,119
- Calm down.
- Why the yelling?

730
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,680
Don't blame him.

731
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,119
Heizi's mom ran away.

732
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,960
And I'm a burden.

733
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,720
No.

734
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,799
No, it's fine.

735
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,119
It's fine.

736
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:11,520
(Wen, I'm scared.)

737
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,039
This medicine hurts more than his hit.

738
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,280
Now you remember?

739
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,039
It's too late.

740
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,559
You were so impulsive when fighting.

741
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,800
I'm all bruised, Honey.

742
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,719
I was the one getting beaten, okay?

743
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,159
Why do I find it so hard to believe?

744
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:25,960
He would not

745
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,159
take action on his own.

746
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,360
I'm angry, alright?

747
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,440
I'm jealous.

748
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,639
Since childhood,
you've favored the two of them.

749
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,559
How have I favored the two of them?

750
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,519
Did a dog eat the pork chop
in my lunchbox?

751
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,079
What is this?

752
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,440
I ate it.

753
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,719
I forgot.

754
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,039
Calm down.

755
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:45,719
Calm down.

756
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,360
I was wrong.

757
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,159
Give me a hug.

758
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,239
Bai,

759
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:56,440
well,

760
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:58,519
after Junyan

761
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,000
got out of prison,

762
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,559
he didn't contact us.

763
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,519
As for the others,

764
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,679
we haven't met them

765
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,039
in all these years.

766
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,360
I wonder how they're doing.

767
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,280
Don't be like this.

768
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,239
Honey.

769
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:21,000
Will they be miserable?

770
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,239
Don't cry, Honey.

771
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,239
He's still living the same way now.

772
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,840
H-He modifies bikes
for Zuhao and others.

773
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,719
He's messing up.

774
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,000
He's living just like that.

775
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,719
Stop. No.

776
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,280
He's doing quite well.

777
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,440
Honey, don't cry.

778
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,480
He's doing quite well.

779
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,360
He's doing quite well.

780
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,280
No more crying.

781
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,840
No more crying.

782
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,360
He's doing well.

783
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,400
Hello?

784
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
Quickly find Bai Zuhao.
Something's happening.

785
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,119
Have you refueled?

786
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,119
(We are in the back alley of Tianjie.)
The tank is full. Don't worry.

787
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:27,584
(Delete Message)

788
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,599
Who are you texting?

789
00:36:34,707 --> 00:36:36,224
(We are in the back alley of Tianjie.
Come help.)

790
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,639
No one.

791
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,320
I was calling some buddies over to help.

792
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,519
No need.

793
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:46,760
More people, more issues.

794
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,599
Turn off the phone.

795
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:52,264
(Turn Off)

796
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,599
The number you dialed is powered off.

797
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
Sorry, the...

798
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,960
I'll ride later.

799
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,000
You sit in the back.

800
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,559
Just move fast.

801
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,639
Leave the rest to me.

802
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:15,719
Okay.

803
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,199
Heizi,

804
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,719
what if we get caught?

805
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,519
Can you hope for a better outcome?

806
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,199
Where is Bai Zuhao?

807
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,480
Tell me, where is Bai Zuhao?

808
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,719
I saw him there during the day.

809
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,599
He's gone.

810
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,800
You're modifying bikes again.

811
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,960
Did you teach them to ride and rob?

812
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,360
Yes.

813
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,079
We're all bad.

814
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,599
You're the only good person, alright?

815
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,199
Where is Bai Zuhao?

816
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:16,079
Bai Enyu!

817
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,039
Hit.

818
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,039
Go on.

819
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,400
Don't stop. Hit.

820
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,400
Honey.

821
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:27,920
Are you enjoying this?

822
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,639
Let me see how good you are.

823
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,400
