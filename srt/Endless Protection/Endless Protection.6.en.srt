1
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,640
Chen Huiwen.

2
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,599
Why?

3
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,640
Why stand there?

4
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,560
Let's talk downstairs.

5
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,879
Stay back.

6
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,599
Tell me.

7
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,519
Is there no other way?

8
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,359
Don't stand there, anyway.

9
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,439
You haven't decided.

10
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,920
Then why are you standing there?

11
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:31,200
You called me

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,920
to talk in person, didn't you?

13
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,280
You asked me to come.

14
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,879
I know what you're thinking.

15
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,879
Take your time. Tell me everything.

16
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,400
I have plenty of time.

17
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,079
Let's talk, okay?

18
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,040
Stop.

19
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,480
Stay back.

20
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,040
You know, when I stand here,

21
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,519
I'm scared.

22
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,439
I don't dare to look down.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,480
My legs feel weak.

24
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,560
Tell me.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,879
How scared

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,120
my son must have been, standing here.

27
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,599
I stood right there

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
after the court trial,

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
and I was also scared.

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,719
I get it. I totally get it.

31
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,840
I told myself that I must

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,479
make them pay with their lives.

33
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,560
I haven't achieved it.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,360
That's true.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,960
But listen. It's not worth it.

36
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,560
If you jump from here,

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,719
you'll have nothing left.

38
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,439
Chen Huiwen.

39
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,520
Chen Huiwen, don't be a fool.

40
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,240
I swear on my life to you.

41
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,120
If those kids do the same thing

42
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,560
once they turn 18,

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
I'll show you what I can do.

44
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,639
You are lying.

45
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,800
You are lying.

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,879
You can't jump.

47
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,280
We need to keep an eye on them, right?

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,000
You need to

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
keep an eye on me, right?

50
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,080
You can't do that if you jump.

51
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,560
Keep an eye on you?

52
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,599
How?

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Why is it eight years?

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,360
Why is it eight years?

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,520
Tell me!

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,599
A life for a life.

57
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,759
Shouldn't the murderers be executed?

58
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,879
Because

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,199
they are still kids.

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,319
Wasn't my son a kid?

61
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,240
So shouldn't we...

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,719
Wasn't my son a kid?

63
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,800
How scared he must have been.

64
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,560
How scared he must have been here.

65
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,719
Do you know?

66
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:49,240
Yes, I do.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,879
You do? No, you don't.

68
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:32,196
=Endless Protection=

69
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,620
=Episode 6=

70
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,120
Hello.

71
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,319
Yunhai emergency

72
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:40,959
call center.

73
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:41,720
Hello.

74
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,399
Hello.

75
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:44,879
Hello, can you hear me?

76
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,199
Yes, please speak.

77
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,879
Someone is jumping off the building.

78
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,120
Hurry up.

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,144
Are you okay?

80
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,480
You okay?

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Bring the stretchers!

82
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,199
They're fine. Here.

83
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,279
Can you hear me?

84
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,120
Give me a hand.

85
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,120
Come on.

86
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,439
Give me your hand.

87
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,000
This way.

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,040
Stretchers.

89
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,608
Come on.

90
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,240
I'm okay.

91
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,160
Take it slow.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,839
It's okay.

93
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:30,759
I'm a bit dizzy.

94
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,120
Come on, be careful.

95
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm fine, doctor.

96
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:39,936
Be careful.

97
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,199
Check again for injured people.

98
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:44,839
Okay.

99
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,560
Chen Huiwen.

100
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,560
Done. No injuries.

101
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:53,920
Let's go.

102
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,920
Come back next week.

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, thank you.

104
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,319
Hello, Captain Du.

105
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,720
I need a favor.

106
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,279
I think Chen Huiwen

107
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,199
is manipulated by someone.

108
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:27,879
Come in.

109
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,120
Tong.

110
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,480
Your Honor.

111
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,279
Sorry, I'm late.

112
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,752
(Defendant)

113
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,159
You okay?

114
00:08:59,159 --> 00:08:59,879
I'm fine.

115
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,240
Let's begin the trial.

116
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,039
This case was investigated
by the Yunhai Public Security Bureau.

117
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,519
Defendant Pan Xiong
is suspected of theft,

118
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,919
intentional injury,

119
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,360
and child trafficking.

120
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,240
(Defendant)
Defendant Zhou Aijuan is suspected of theft.

121
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,919
The case is tried at
the People's Procuratorate of Yunhai.

122
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,720
(Judge)
The trial concludes

123
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,000
that defendant Pan Xiong

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,399
continuously organized

125
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,279
(Defendant)
and utilized 18 children

126
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
to carry out theft activities
from February 2009

127
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,639
to October 2014.

128
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,600
His actions constituted theft.

129
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,720
The total amount is over 920,000 yuan,

130
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
far exceeding
the sentencing standard for theft

131
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,519
of a particularly large amount.

132
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:43,039
Meanwhile, while organizing the minors
to commit theft,

133
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,320
Pan Xiong traded children

134
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:48,320
who could not or did not wish to steal

135
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,000
for illegal gains

136
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,039
and to cover up and clean up

137
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,159
after the theft.

138
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,759
Pan Xiong exploited
the innocence of minors,

139
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,600
(Zhen, Shu, Xing)
(disguised theft as a game,)

140
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,279
(Lu Ming, Xiaoxiami, Xiaomei)
(and coaxed minors into stealing.)

141
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,440
(Those who didn't comply)

142
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,360
(were hit with sticks,)

143
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,919
(jabbed with needles,)

144
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:09,320
(burned with cigarette butts
and boiling water,)

145
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,360
(confined in iron cages,)

146
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,039
(and forced to comply.)

147
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,919
This resulted in
second-degree minor injuries

148
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,240
to the minor Zhen Zhen.

149
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,759
Defendant Pan Xiong

150
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,840
shall be sentenced to life imprisonment

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,960
and confiscation
of all personal property.

152
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,120
Defendant Zhou Aijuan

153
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,799
helped Pan Xiong organize the theft
of a particularly large amount

154
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,879
by coercing minors.

155
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,120
Her actions constituted theft.

156
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,720
She shall be sentenced
to five years of imprisonment

157
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,799
and a fine of 80,000 yuan.

158
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,639
The minors involved
in this case did commit theft.

159
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,320
But they were manipulated by the adults.

160
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
Their seniors failed to

161
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,360
shoulder the responsibility

162
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:47,799
and drove them
into the world of outlaws.

163
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,840
This is the most intolerable threat
to our society.

164
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,120
We believe

165
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:53,480
that the individuals

166
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,960
who organized minors to commit theft

167
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,320
shall be punished

168
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,279
so that the children can
muster the courage to walk in the sun.

169
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,360
(Auntie, I'm sorry to you and Wenxuan.)

170
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:18,480
(Auntie, I'm sorry to you and Wenxuan.)

171
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,879
(Auntie, I'm sorry to you and Wenxuan.)

172
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,600
Let me help you.

173
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,480
Thank you.

174
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,799
Okay. Be careful.

175
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,440
Okay.

176
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,159
Mom.

177
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,279
Look at them.

178
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,600
They actually caught something.

179
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,879
They're so idle.

180
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:09,984
I'll go to the SPP
for a meeting tomorrow.

181
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,600
Should I prepare something?

182
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,440
No need.

183
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,919
You'll have a newcomer tomorrow.

184
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,039
Show him around.

185
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:21,440
Alright.

186
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,399
Aren't you curious who it is?

187
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,840
Anyone will do.

188
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,159
I prefer to rely on myself.

189
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,879
You're not alone now.

190
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,320
You're leading a team.

191
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,039
Be strict with your assistant.

192
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,519
I'll let the newcomer settle in first.

193
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,919
That rascal Chen Xinwu.

194
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,919
I thought we were close.

195
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,159
He didn't even bother to see me off.

196
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:57,879
Bai.

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,559
We hope you can behave out there.

198
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,639
Get lost.

199
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:04,519
"Behave"?

200
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,600
I'll leave those kids to you.

201
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,519
I left the notes on the table.

202
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,039
You got this?

203
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,759
Don't worry.

204
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,720
What you've taught me is enough.

205
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,240
Once you're gone,

206
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll be the new boss here.

207
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,159
Act like one.

208
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,240
It's so late.

209
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,600
Where is the Chief?

210
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,320
He must be

211
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,519
reluctant to see me leave.

212
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,399
I bet he doesn't want to cry.

213
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,159
- Chief.
- Chief.

214
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,416
What were you saying?

215
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:33,960
Nothing.

216
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:34,840
Nothing.

217
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,240
Why not say it to my face?

218
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,080
That shows how close we are.

219
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,039
Speak.

220
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,759
Thank you

221
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,840
for cleaning up after me
all these years.

222
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,399
Chief, during my ten years here,

223
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,440
I've always had a question.

224
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,080
You're up to no good, huh?

225
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,879
No, no.

226
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,200
I'm serious.

227
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,840
I believe everyone
has the same question.

228
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,639
Right?

229
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:06,879
Go ahead.

230
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,279
Your height...

231
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,399
I was specially recruited.

232
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,039
No, Chief.

233
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,240
We don't have that question.

234
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,759
Be serious.

235
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,352
Yes, sir.

236
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,320
Alright.

237
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,159
Enough.

238
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,639
I don't have

239
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,919
anything gift for you.

240
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,279
Remember my advice.

241
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:23,879
Yes, sir.

242
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,320
First,

243
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:29,320
talk nicely.

244
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:30,519
Understood.

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,520
Second,

246
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,960
take things slow.

247
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,039
Third...

248
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,960
See, I told you we're close.

249
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,519
We have secrets.

250
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,600
We won't listen.

251
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,840
If you can't do the first two,

252
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,159
just don't say you know me.

253
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,639
Thank you, Chief.

254
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,039
Thank you, Xinwu.

255
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,080
Thank you, guys.

256
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,840
Thank you, Chief.

257
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,600
I'm off.

258
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,000
Keep your heroic spirit.

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,600

267

Why am I getting even closer
to the water closet?

289
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,759
You can't sit on the rice, can you?

290
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,039
You can't sit on the shelf.

291
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,759
Why is there rice in our office?

292
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:20,799
Tell the rice to leave.

293
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,400
The rice came first.

294
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,640
We came later.

295
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,480
Stay calm, Zhitao.

296
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,160
Besides, it's only for now.

297
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,839
Can you give me your air purifier?

298
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,799
Air purifier?

299
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,599
The air refresher.

300
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:37,240
You can't smell it anyway.

301
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,960

302
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,599
Yeah.

303

who's coming, right?

No, I don't.

307
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,039
I heard that Prosecutor Zheng

308
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,200
selected this person

309
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,720
from the provincial judicial system.

310
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,519

What about it?

314
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,480
I wonder if he's handsome

384
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,279
It's luxurious.

385
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,200
You could say it's lavish.

386
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:02,000
It is an important department. Isn't it?

387
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,160
Yes, it is.

388
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,839
Important pilot department.

389
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,359
Why a pilot department?

390
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:09,119
Because it will be important.

391
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,599
With just three people?

392
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,519
No, two people.

393
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,640
Zhitao and you.

394
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,960
I'm just a clerk

395
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,839
who assists you guys.

396
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,200
I must talk to Prosecutor Zheng.

397
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,160
This is way too far-fetched.

398
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
She's not here.

399
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
She's out of town.

400
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:28,440
Besides, why would you

401
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,640
speak to her now?

402
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:31,960
She picked you out of thousands.

403
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:33,559
Are you going to

404
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,319
question her judgment?

405
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,039
It's highly inappropriate.

406
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,200
Besides,

407
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,839
there are good aspects

408
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,559
about our office.

409
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,200
Right?

410
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,599
Cheng.

411
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,839
Ms. Li.

412
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,559
You've worked hard.

413
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,039
Handsome young man.

414
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,279
Yeah.

415
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:03,599
You see?

416
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,319
This is the good aspect?

417
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,119
Tell me.

418
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,400
Where is the good aspect?

419
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,720
Why can't I see it?

420
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,799
There are good aspects.

421
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,319
Look.

422
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,079
Printing is so easy

423
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:16,599
here.

424
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,279
Also, if you need pens or notebooks,

425
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,920
you can get them right here.

426
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,839
It's also very convenient
to use the water closet.

427
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:38,368
(People's Procuratorate of Yunhai)

428
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,480
Files of the past two months.

429
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,279
Zhitao said that she wanted you

430
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,960
to read them as soon as possible.

431
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:48,960
The case of the organized theft
has been concluded.

432
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,200
There was an accessory in this case.

433
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,000
That was Lu Guangfu,
Lu Sheng and Lu Ming's father.

434
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,759
Lu Guangfu

435
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,319
has admitted

436
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,319
to renting his children
to the criminal gang.

437
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,400
He's sentenced to one year in prison.

438
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:05,599
He seriously violated

439
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,359
the lawful rights
and interests of the ward.

440
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:10,480
Even after he is released,

441
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,839
his younger son Lu Ming

442
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,359
will still be underage.

443
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,799
It will be detrimental

444
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,799
to the child

445
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,920
if he continues to live with Lu Guangfu.

446
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,599
Therefore, we plan to suggest

447
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,839
the Civil Affairs Department
file a lawsuit

448
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,480
to revoke Lu Guangfu's guardianship.

449
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,720
This is very meaningful

450
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:35,960
and quite pioneering.

451
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,960
It's worth encouraging that Lin

452
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,119
brought it up.

453
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,559
What do you think?

454
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,079
I'll go first.

455
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,559
I am personally against this practice.

456
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:55,759
The reason is simple.

457
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,599
I can't find

458
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,200
any legal basis for the procuratorate

459
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,160
to take the lead.

460
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,920
Prosecutor Lin,

461
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,039
your proposal references
the General Rules of Civil Law.

462
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,920
I suggest that

463
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,759
the Civil Affairs Department
file a lawsuit

464
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,240
and that the procuratorate support it.

465
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,559
Article 18 of the Civil Law stipulates

466
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,079
that the guardians who fail
to fulfill their duties

467
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,839
or infringe upon the lawful rights
and interests of the ward

468
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:22,039
shall bear legal liabilities.

469
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,519
Upon the application
of relevant personnel or units,

470
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,112
the People's Court can revoke

471
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,880
the guardian's qualification.

472
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,880
When was Article 18

473
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,799
written into
the General Rules of Civil Law?

474
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:35,480
In 1986.

475
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,160
It's been 28 years.

476
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,240
Has there ever been

477
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,160
a precedent for revoking guardianship?

478
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,759
No.

479
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,720
The law has never

480
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,279
been practiced since 1986.

481
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,640
You want to use it now.

482
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,160
Do you know the impact it may have
on the national judicial system?

483
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,200
No, I don't.

484
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,720
There is the law and the need.

485
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,359
I don't know why we should
stick to judicial conventions

486
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,400
and whether anyone has done this.

487
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,480
Lu Guangfu's wife, Zhu Chongyan,

488
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,640
has a mental illness

489
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,839
and can't serve as a guardian.

490
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,160
Who is going to take care

491
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,400
of this child?

492
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,160
The Civil Affairs Department.

493
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,960
You're assigning them tasks?

494
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,240
What if our proposal

495
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,240
put the Civil Affairs Department

496
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,160
in a difficult position?

497
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,079
Animals!

498
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,400
Outrageous.

499
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,440
Not you.

500
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,880
The bad guys.

501
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:01,984
Where are you going?

502
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,240
Home.

503
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,279
Give me the report.

504
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,279
What report?

505
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,079
Those were novels?

506
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,039
Can I write it tomorrow?

507
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,240
Finish your job today.

508
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,359
I'll write at home.

509
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,960
No, there are confidentiality rules.

510
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,079
Working overtime on my first day?

511
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,160
You're a civil servant.

512
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,319
Work overtime if necessary.

513
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,440
I'll write half today.

514
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,640
Finish it here.

515
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,000
Zhitao, see you tomorrow.

516
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:29,240
Stop.

517
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,079
Why can she leave?

518
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:36,240
Because I'm on a contractual basis.

519
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,759
See you tomorrow.

520
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,079
Stop wasting time.

521
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,559
Did you use my computer?

522
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,319
Why would I?

523
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:16,559
I haven't even figured out

524
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,519
how to use mine.

525
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,920
Who are you yelling at?

526
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,359
You yelled at me first.

527
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:39,799
Rinse your mouth.

528
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,000
I thought

529
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,319
you'd spend more time with me
after the transfer.

530
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:45,880
I thought so too.

531
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,240
She examines that report word by word.

532
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:50,160
Win the battle but lose the war.

533
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:51,880
Not even

534
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,504
my primary school teacher was so strict.

535
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,960
You can't blame her.

536
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
Even your love letters
were full of typos.

537
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,559
Who are you siding with?

538
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:01,960
Even if there were typos,

539
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,440
my letters were filled with love.

540
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:04,880
I'm definitely on your side.

541
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,799
You got this.

542
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,720
You'll turn the tide.

543
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,799
Chief Prosecutor Zheng

544
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,720
told me to utilize my experience.

545
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,160
H-How am I going to do that?

546
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,279
Do you think

547
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:17,599
Lin Zhitao wants me gone?

548
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,480
In that case,

549
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,480
I will resign

550
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
and help you out.

551
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,799
I'll be my own boss.

552
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,039
Please don't.

553
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,440
Our mortgage isn't fully paid off yet.

554
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,079
I can't pay you.

555
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,079
Besides, the job at the procuratorate

556
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,440
is quite good.

557
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
At least, I can reach you at any time.

558
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,480
And you can come home every day.

559
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,799
I'm more than happy.

560
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,519
And those files

561
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,160
I've been reading

562
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,440
almost drove me mad.

563
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,559
The couple divorced.

564
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,119
Nobody took care of the child.

565
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:51,279
They nearly starved the child to death.

566
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,079
Infuriating, huh?

567
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,759
Everything is so shocking.

568
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
What a mess.

569
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:00,440
Don't let our child hear this.

570
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,599
You're right.

571
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,400
I'll be on standby 24-7

572
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,880
to protect you and the child.

573
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,119
Protect us.

574
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,519
Of course.

575
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,440
Of course.

576
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,799
I'll protect you.

577
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,520
(Prosecution for the public good,
Law enforcement for the people)

578
00:31:15,795 --> 00:31:18,752
(Bai Enyu, Lin Zhitao)

579
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:19,799
(Li Qinxun)
Chief Prosecutor.

580
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,359
Hello.

581
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:24,920
Have a seat.

582
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,759
Have a seat.

583
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,079
Please introduce them.

584
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,720
Okay.

585
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,519
These two are staff

586
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,359
responsible for juvenile aid
from the civil affairs bureau.

587
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,920
This is Professor Xiao Bingli,
the renowned jurist,

588
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,440
and the Vice Dean of the Law School

589
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,720
from the Southern University
of Political Science and Law.

590
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,240
(Xiao Bingli)
This is his apprentice,

591
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,880
Attorney Li Daoran.

592
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,200
Hello, sir.

593
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,400
(Li Qinxun)
Let's get started.

594
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,920
Okay.

595
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,519
You will host

596
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,720
today's seminar.

597
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,608
Is this appropriate?

598
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,632
Of course.

599
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,079
You invited everyone here.

600
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,319
I'm just a listener.

601
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:07,720
Alright.

602
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:10,359
So.

603
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,920
Today's meeting is about

604
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,599
whether to revoke
Lu Guangfu's guardianship

605
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,400
after his release.

606
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,400
We invited you here

607
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,079
mainly because

608
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,640
there has not yet

609
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,119
been a precedent in the country.

610
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,400
Lu Sheng and Lu Ming
won't be with Lu Guangfu anymore?

611
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:28,519
Isn't that good?

612
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:29,480
What's there to discuss?

613
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,400
Stop talking.

614
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,799
Just listen.

615
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:35,319
Prosecutor Lin and I

616
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,480
are both students of Mr. Xiao.

617
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,519
They are both my star pupils.

618
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm honored and flattered

619
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,559
to be invited to this seminar

620
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,559
and I'm glad to see my mentor.

621
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,759
I will be the first

622
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,039
to speak as a junior.

623
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:57,119
Let me offer my humble opinion

624
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,559
and share

625
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:00,599
the perspectives

626
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,720
of us legal practitioners.

627
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
(Li Qinxun)
Here's my major concern.

628
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,319
The Civil Affairs Department

629
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,319
may be the primary entity
in this lawsuit.

630
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,119
However,

631
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,119
it is initiated by the procuratorate.

632
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,400
To push it forward,

633
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,720
as the legal supervisory body
of the state,

634
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,000
will it appear

635
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,880
to the public

636
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,519
that public authority
is too overpowering

637
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,240
in this legal practice?

638
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,160
Shall we ignore the issue
because we fear questioning?

639
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,279
We are not ignoring it.

640
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
Prosecutor Lin,

641
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,200
have you heard this saying?

642
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,720
"The wind, rain,"

643
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,640
"and storm may enter,"

644
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,160
"but the king cannot."

645
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
It means

646
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,200
the law protects
the private property of citizens.

647
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:42,400
But children are never the property

648
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,480
of their parents.

649
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,960
We are now discussing
the practical difficulties.

650
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:50,839
After all,

651
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,319
we haven't found

652
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,480
a suitable guardian.

653
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,119
These two children

654
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,440
shall be handed over
to the Civil Affairs Department.

655
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,440
We have only one concern.

656
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:03,200
Once this matter gets out,

657
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,039
will it remind those

658
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,200
irresponsible parents

659
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,319
to leave their kids

660
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,559
to the state?

661
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,440
I think

662
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,239
our funding is very limited.

663
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,880
Revoking guardianship

664
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,440
requires evaluation.

665
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,519
The harm to the kids

666
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,440
will be severe enough to constitute

667
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,360
criminal cases.

668
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,280
Would anyone commit a crime

669
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,000
just to leave their kids to the state?

670
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,952
As long as there are other constraints,

671
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,232
we are happy to cooperate.

672
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,360
Okay.

673
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,199
The procuratorate, in essence,

674
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,039
is a state institution
representing public power.

675
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:35,880
When

676
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,559
a state institution interferes with
family ties between parents

677
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:40,760
and children,

678
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,760
it will surely cause panic
and uncertainty

679
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,159
among the public.

680
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,079
"Your children are not yours."

681
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,039
For now,

682
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,639
this concept is quite

683
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,639
challenging to the public.

684
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,400
It increases

685
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,400
invisible social risks.

686
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,239
Mr. Xiao.

687
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,000
There are prerequisites
for this procedure.

688
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,159
In this case,

689
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:05,599
Lu Guangfu is an alcoholic
and commits domestic violence.

690
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,079
He sequentially rented out

691
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:09,159
his two children to criminal gangs.

692
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,119
Please tell me.

693
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,440
Why would normal families be concerned

694
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,920
when we revoke a father like him

695
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,280
of his guardianship?

696
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,400
Is there a problem?

697
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,079
What we are discussing now

698
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,039
are broad legal principles
and social issues,

699
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,599
not just an individual case.

700
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,519
Legal principles exist

701
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,320
exactly to ensure

702
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,320
the greatest happiness
of the greatest mass.

703
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,440
Should we sacrifice a child's future

704
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,280
for intangible legal principles?

705
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,440
Do you have a child?

706
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,639
No.

707
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,039
Have you conducted research?

708
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,119
Yes, I have.

709
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,079
How many parents do you know

710
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,559
and you dare to openly challenge

711
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,840
the established legal provisions?

712
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,280
I think you'd better go back

713
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,599
and read over

714
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,920
those textbooks again

715
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:58,360
before coming back to discuss with me

716
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,239
whether the law should serve individuals

717
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,800
or society as a whole.

718
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,159
What is society composed of?

719
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,360
Society?

720
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,599
Legal researchers

721
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,360
like us

722
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,920
should focus on the societal impact

723
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:13,280
rather than the problems
of an individual.

724
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,960
Without thorough research,
experimentation,

725
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,519
and summarization,

726
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,199
I believe

727
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,360
that any conclusion would have flaws.

728
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,559
We must objectively and thoroughly

729
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,119
understand the issues

730
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,280
before we utilize social forces

731
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,360
to conduct research,

732
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,320
invite experts and scholars

733
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,760
to discussions,

734
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,800
and write papers for a comprehensive...

735
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,760
By that time,

736
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,840
that child would have been in prison.

737
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
I was just wondering.

738
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,400
Didn't you major in massage?

739
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,760
I'm working on that
at the juvenile prosecution.

740
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,880
Prosecutor Zheng recommended him.

741
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:51,840
I approved.

742
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:53,880
Sir.

743
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
May I speak?

744
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,800
Go ahead.

745
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,719
Professor Xiao, right?

746
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:01,400
I think you are very smart.

747
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,360
You know what I mean?

748
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,480
You seem to have said everything,

749
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,159
but you haven't said anything at all.

750
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,039
Let's be practical.

751
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,920
There was a difficult child

752
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,559
at the Juvenile Correctional Facility.

753
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,840
The instructor told him,

754
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,760
"Be optimistic.

755
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,280
Live your life positively."

756
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,159
He said, "Even my dad
doesn't care about me."

757
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:21,960
"He only loves his sons
born to his mistresses."

758
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,280
"How can I be selfless,"

759
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,320
"law-abiding,"

760
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,039
"and optimistic about life?"

761
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:27,159
The instructor said,

762
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,760
"Stop complaining."

763
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,440
"Face your problems and solve them."

764
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,360
He said

765
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,000
that problems can be solved,

766
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,400
but the challenge of his life

767
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,159
lies in his family background.

768
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,480
The parents

769
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,400
can choose whether to have children.

770
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:44,119
But children don't have the right
to choose their parents.

771
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:45,800
When they are born,

772
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,880
no one tells them

773
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,519
whether their parents are qualified.

774
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,480
You said it was an individual issue,

775
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,039
not a societal one.

776
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,400
But I'm telling you,

777
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,519
those kids in the facility

778
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,360
are generally facing the same problem.

779
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,639
The kids you mentioned

780
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,440
have already committed crimes.

781
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,159
So they're not kids anymore?

782
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:10,199
Tell you what.

783
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:11,599
Without irresponsible parents,

784
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,360
those children might not commit crimes.

785
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,239
Sit down, Bai Enyu.

786
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
You said Prosecutor Lin
didn't study this issue.

787
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Did you?

788
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,760
Do you know this child?

789
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,039
Have you cared about him?

790
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,159
How big is his family?

791
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,119
What his alcoholic father
and his looney mother

792
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,360
are getting by?

793
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,400
Do you know?

794
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,400
Do you know how many adults

795
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,119
are not qualified to be parents?

796
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:31,400
Now I understand

797
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,280
why she made me

798
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,920
read those case files.

799
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,880
Abuse, abandonment, rape.

800
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Are you saying

801
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,239
those kids

802
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:41,079
should stay with those human filth

803
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:42,280
and we have no say in it?

804
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,840
We are discussing legal principles.

805
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:45,960
What are you doing?

806
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,280
Telling stories? Stirring emotions?

807
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,000
Generalizing from a partial standpoint?

808
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,559
What are the names of these kids?

809
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,840
Now you remember to read the files?

810
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,519
From the moment you entered,

811
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,840
you've never mentioned

812
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,239
the names of these kids.

813
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,800
The law is majestic.

814
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,480
But tell me.

815
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,920
For whom does it exist?

816
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,480
You didn't answer my question.

817
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,480
You keep talking about the majority

818
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,599
and society.

819
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,639
Tell me.

820
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,119
What is society composed of?

821
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,960
Individuals.

822
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,280
It's composed of individuals.

823
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,079
Each of us was once a child.

824
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:24,719
Right?

825
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,320
Can we possibly

826
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,719
save Lu Ming this time?

827
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,800
Can we help him once?

828
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:30,039
I hope we can

829
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,280
give him a chance.

830
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,000
Where is your rationality?

831
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,599
Don't claim to be my student
from now on.

832
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,639
I am not your student, am I?

833
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,760
You...

834
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,599
Prosecutor Fu.

835
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,800
I didn't ask to come today.

836
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:44,639
You invited me here.

837
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,320
What's that attitude?

838
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,519
Mr. Xiao, don't be upset.

839
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,960
Bai Enyu, get out.

840
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,760
He won't.

841
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,719
He said nothing wrong.

842
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,360
Why should I leave? We are colleagues.

843
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,360
Unreasonable.

844
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,480
Oh, come on.

845
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,360
Show some respect.

846
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,639
Want to argue, huh?

847
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:58,000
Bring the wind and storm.

848
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,320
Let the king into the hut.

849
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,039
Excuse me.

850
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,920
That was a legal proverb.

851
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
I know legal idioms.

852
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,280
But you don't know the law.

853
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,000
Sorry, I am late.

854
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,599
Madam.

855
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:11,480
The plane just landed

856
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,039
and I heard that

857
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,239
you were holding

858
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:15,480
an important seminar.

859
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,280
Professor Xiao was lecturing us.

860
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,360
Is it about

861
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,280
revoking Lu Guangfu's guardianship?

862
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,159
That's right.

863
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:22,719
It was a heated discussion.

864
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,199
The meeting at the SPP

865
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,159
also addressed this issue.

866
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,480
The SPP

867
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,320
attaches great importance

868
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,519
to the protection of minors.

869
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,960
I brought a copy

870
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,440
of the opinions
recently released by the SPP

871
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,880
and relevant departments.

872
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,239
- Here.
- Okay.

873
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,400
These are the opinions
on the law-based handling

874
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,519
of guardians' infringement

875
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,800
on the rights and interests of minors.

876
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,599
It's very simple.

877
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,079
Guardianship is a right.
But more importantly, it is a duty.

878
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,800
Those who don't fulfill their duties

879
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,440
can't enjoy the right.

880
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,400
Theoretically,

881
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,079
the children should apply for it.

882
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,559
But they are too young

883
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,840
to make such requests.

884
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So we have to make requests

885
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,199
and speak for them.

886
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:07,760
This file

887
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,480
happens to grant the procuratorate

888
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,000
such authority.

889
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:12,639
I agree with Lin.

890
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,320
Article 18 of the Civil Law

891
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,280
addressing
the revocation of guardianship

892
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,760
has been dormant for almost 30 years.

893
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,559
It's time to awaken it.

894
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,680
(Supreme People's Court,
Supreme People's Procuratorate)

895
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,264
(Public Security Bureau,
Ministry of Civil Affairs)

896
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:40,079
Let me speak to him alone.

897
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,119
It's a man-to-man talk.

898
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,119
You got this?

899
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,039
Yeah.

900
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,079
How is your mom doing?

901
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:00,880
Is she better?

902
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:02,559
Yeah.

903
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,719
That guy used to cut off her medication.

904
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,800
Now I'm making sure

905
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,960
that she takes her medicine.

906
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
This is for Lu Ming.

907
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,599
Keep it for him.

908
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,400
I also bought some eggs.

909
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,920
Cook a few for your mom

910
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,480
and Lu Ming every day.

911
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,119
Thank you, sir.

912
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,840
Tiring, huh?

913
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,159
It's okay.

914
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,599
Instructor Bai.

915
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:32,920
Why are you so serious today?

916
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:34,480
Is there something?

917
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,119
Yeah, I'd like to

918
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,760
discuss something with you.

919
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,920
No need, Instructor Bai.

920
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,480
I'll do whatever you say.

921
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,480
I'm no longer

922
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,519
working at the facility.

923
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,639
Why?

924
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,159
I joined the procuratorate.

925
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,719
The procuratorate?

926
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:02,000
So you're colleagues

927
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,199
with Prosecutor Lin.

928
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,119
You're awesome.

929
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:09,960
Listen.

930
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:14,559
He's sentenced to one year

931
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,079
and he'll definitely come back.

932
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:19,880
So we were thinking

933
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,480
of transferring Lu Ming's guardianship

934
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:22,760
to the civil affairs bureau

935
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,440
and sending him
to a welfare center for now.

936
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:31,079
That...

937
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,920
That means

938
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,159
we have to part again, although we just

939
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:37,719
got reunited.

940
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:45,920
Lu Sheng.

941
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,920
You can't take care

942
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:55,159
of so many people at the moment.

943
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,599
You will definitely reunite.

944
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,172
♪Drifting with the wind♪

945
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:21,492

948
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,480
Who kicked you?

949
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,559
He kicked me.

950
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:28,239
Feel it. Right here.

951
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,960
Just now.

952
