1
00:00:34,388 --> 00:00:39,360
(Fishing boat mooring point)

2
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,960
Lin Zhiyang, wait for me.

3
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,840
Don't run so fast.

4
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:51,679
You can't catch up with me.

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,719
Kids, stop it.

6
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:59,008
(Year 1994)

7
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,640
Take a look.

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,039
Big fish today.

9
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,200
Take a look.

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,079
Madam, I'll take this one.

11
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:07,879
The mackerel?

12
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:12,959
Is it pretty?

13
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,760
Yeah.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,232
- Here.
- Thank you, Zhitao.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
It's so pretty.

16
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,159
How heavy is it?

17
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,719
Two jin and eight liang.

18
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,319
The two of you.

19
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:40,480
Unload the goods.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,879
Hurry up.

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm telling you to hurry up.

22
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,680
You can't even buy a drink?

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,519
Why did you get the wrong drink?

24
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,599
Hide. Hurry up.

25
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,079
Why did you get the wrong drink?

26
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,239
Get lost.

27
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,560
Mom!

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,319
Go away!

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,322
(Deep condolences
May her noble soul rest in peace)

30
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,960
She's an official now.
Why would she come?

31
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,759
It's all because of what her dad did.

32
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,520
Uncle, Auntie.

33
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,360
Look who came to her mom's funeral.

34
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,360
Do you still consider yourself a Lin?

35
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
All these years...

36
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,719
Enough, forget it.

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,639
Change into mourning clothes.

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,919
Stay in mourning.

39
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,719
I have work to do. I'm leaving.

40
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:07,960
How can you...

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,919
What's with her?

42
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,080
Then why did you come back?

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
What is she doing?

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Are you really that busy?

45
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,960
Dad, stop it.

46
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,719
Dad, stop.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,919
Dad, stop it.

48
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,280
A pig is smarter than you.

49
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,599
Dad, stop.

50
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,639
You're protecting her?

51
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,159
- I'm providing for you.
- Stop!

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,439
Stop it.

53
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,840
You're protecting her?

54
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,279
You've grown so tall.

55
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,560
Keep it.

56
00:05:48,180 --> 00:06:01,216
=Endless Protection=

57
00:06:01,952 --> 00:06:04,805
=Episode 3=

58
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,439
Come with me. We need to talk.

59
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,104
Okay.

60
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,759
Bad news.

61
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,399
Take a look.

62
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:17,759
(This is a real-name report...)

63
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,319
This video is everywhere

64
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,240
on Weibo, BBS, and Tieba.

65
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,279
(Lin Zhitao bent the law
to shield criminals.)

66
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,120
What does she want?

67
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,839
Lin.

68
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,279
The inspectors are here.

69
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:30,279
Prosecutor Lin.

70
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,240
The victim's family

71
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,120
of "4.24 homicide"

72
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,639
has submitted a request

73
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,600
to investigate your conduct.

74
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,480
Please cooperate.

75
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:43,439
Okay.

76
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,839
In the prosecutorial work,

77
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,360
did Prosecutor Lin Zhitao

78
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,279
violate procedural regulations

79
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,279
by privately meeting with
the defendant's family or lawyer?

80
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:53,680
No, she didn't.

81
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,040
Prosecutor Lin prioritizes
procedural justice.

82
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,399
Officer Liu.

83
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,959
While handling the evidence,

84
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,639
did Prosecutor Lin Zhitao

85
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,720
show any bias
in the organization and adoption

86
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,680
of evidence?

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,839
Prosecutor Lin

88
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,439
confirmed all the evidence with us

89
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:08,319
multiple times

90
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,240
and righteously applied

91
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,680
for supplementary investigation,

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,120
strictly following the regulations.

93
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,639
Did she show different attitudes

94
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,680
towards the defendant's family

95
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,959
and the victim's family?

96
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,360
Did she make any improper promises?

97
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,399
She upholds justice

98
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,399
and is serious about her work.

99
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,319
She works overtime every day,

100
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
staying up all night.

101
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
The records show that

102
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,600
Prosecutor Lin applied for

103
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,279
an investigation into the backgrounds

104
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,120
and economic conditions
of the three suspects.

105
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,240
What's wrong?

106
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,160
She needs to know the suspects' motives.

107
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:40,279
This is common.

108
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,279
When we work on cases...

109
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,199
Next question.

110
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,240
Do you know

111
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
the relationship between

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,439
Prosecutor Lin Zhitao
and the defense attorney?

113
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,439
Prosecutor Lin's

114
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,160
relationship with the defense attorney

115
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,240
doesn't call for recusal.

116
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Please address the issue

117
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
of accepting money
from the defense attorney.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,519
I didn't take it.

119
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:05,560
(Who are you?)

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,439
Back then,

121
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:08,600
my buddies and I were ready to go home.

122
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,120
A young buddy came over, crying.

123
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,879
He said he was robbed.

124
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,920
I asked, "Who robbed you?"

125
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:15,199
At first, he wouldn't say.

126
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,600
I got mad at him.

127
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,439
Then he said

128
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,279
that he was robbed
by a few thugs bigger than us.

129
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,759
And they beat him up.

130
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,079
I got so angry when I heard that.

131
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,759
They messed with my buddy?

132
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Can I tolerate that?

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,560
I gave the order

134
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,120
and all my buddies stood up.

135
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,800
They ran away?

136
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,919
Shut up.

137
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,200
Then what?

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,360
D-Did you win the fight?

139
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,440
"Win the fight"?

140
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,360
We scared them silly when we appeared.

141
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,919
Someone as big as you

142
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,480
even peed his pants.

143
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,399
He just gave us the money back.

144
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,840
Instructor Bai, are you bluffing?

145
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,159
Yunhai Seven Heroes.

146
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,519
Haven't you heard?

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,759
I'm the Boss.

148
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:53,759
No, I haven't.

149
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,840
Yunhai Seven Heroes,
chivalrous and courageous.

150
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Dominating Nanwan
with unmatched credibility.

151
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,679
Roaming Tapo and unifying Chanquan.

152
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,320
Yunhai

153
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,440
is my turf.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,720
I haven't heard of that.

155
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,720
And this name is so lame.

156
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,200
You little rascals
wouldn't know my name.

157
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,159
Can we join your gang once we're out?

158
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,200
My "gang"?

159
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,879
Even I have quit that life

160
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,919
as the gang leader.

161
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,679
Are you serious?

162
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Clean the wards tomorrow.

163
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,720
A real boss

164
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,559
will only tell you to follow the law.

165
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,679
Those who incite you to commit crimes

166
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:33,799
are actually big fools.

167
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,080
Got it?

168
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,039
Got it.

169
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:39,919
It's about time.

170
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,039
Attention!

171
00:09:46,016 --> 00:09:46,639
Take them away.

172
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,080
Turn right.

173
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,360
First squad, march forward.

174
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:52,879
Second squad, go.

175
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:55,679
Bro.

176
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,440
Can you tell a new story next time?

177
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,320
I've heard this story
no less than 50 times.

178
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,679
This is the easiest story

179
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:01,960
to memorize.

180
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,600
Those rascals grew up

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,919
differently from us.

182
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,960
We were watching Black Cat Detective,

183
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,320
which taught us to do good.

184
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,600
They grew up watching
Young and Dangerous,

185
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,039
learning about brotherhood.

186
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,360
If you don't win their respect,

187
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,679
why would they listen

188
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,720
to your lectures?

189
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,399
So this trick is foolproof?

190
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,120
It didn't work with Huang Jiawang.

191
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,120
Your noodles were wasted?

192
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,799
Just as you predicted.

193
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,080
We need to ignore him

194
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,279
a bit longer.

195
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,159
If he's a good kid in nature,

196
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,519
we can help him.

197
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,159
If he's bad,

198
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,720
we have to intimidate him

199
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,799
and make him behave.

200
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,759
You're busy role-playing
as a gang leader and a teacher.

201
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,519
Don't get confused one day.

202
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Haven't you reached Lu Sheng's parents?

203
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,480
His dad wouldn't come.

204
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,840
So who's coming?

205
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,080
Village committee

206
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,279
said they would bring a fellow villager.

207
00:10:53,683 --> 00:10:56,013
(Sincerely repent)

208
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,799
Why are you in a daze?

209
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,279
Reluctant to leave this dump?

210
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:05,240
No.

211
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,399
Put these on.

212
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,039
Put them on.

213
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,320
Are you going out like this?

214
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:15,639
Hurry up.

215
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,240
Thank you, sir.

216
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,200
There are no shops nearby.

217
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,519
I don't know if they fit.

218
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,039
Instructor Bai.

219
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,960
Didn't my parents come?

220
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,679
Maybe they're busy.

221
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,879
Get out first.

222
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,519
Wait.

223
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,360
What's this mess?
Plotting a prison break?

224
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,519
They left me their phone numbers.

225
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,440
Instructor Bai.

226
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,080
Be quiet.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Forget all of it.

228
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,919
Never come back.

229
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
Remember what you promised me.

230
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,720
Never come back.

231
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:39,440
Promise.

232
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,919
Thank you.

233
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,600
Take care of yourself.

234
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,879
Behave.

235
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,600
Let me know

236
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
if there is anything.

237
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,360
Don't look back.

238
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:55,879
It's bad luck.

239
00:13:59,968 --> 00:14:00,600
Go ahead.

240
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,159
Officers.

241
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:25,840
You are...

242
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,639
I am his uncle.

243
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,279
You know him?

244
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,000
I've watched him grow up.

245
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,799
I'm his uncle.

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,584
Uncle Xiong.

247
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,919
(Mental Health Guidance Center)
Help him blend in.

248
00:14:43,328 --> 00:14:44,039
Let's go.

249
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,799
Come on.

250
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,159
You want to retire here?

251
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,039
Get lost.

252
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,960
We'll leave you to work.

253
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,200
Don't look back.

254
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,600
Little brat.

255
00:15:06,932 --> 00:15:08,764
(Yuedong Juvenile Correctional Facility)

256
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,759
Your instructor is quite strict, huh?

257
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,240
I got you a new phone.

258
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,120
How are my mom and Ming?

259
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,159
Forgot about your dad?

260
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,720
Let's go home.

261
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:29,639
Which home?

262
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,320
Which home do you have in mind?

263
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,279
Ms. Chen.

264
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,840
After receiving the report,

265
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,960
we conducted a thorough investigation.

266
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,279
Prosecutor Lin Zhitao

267
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,200
did nothing wrong
in the judicial process.

268
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,519
The sentencing is based on the law.

269
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,399
If you have any doubts about it,

270
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,600
please tell us.

271
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,799
We will explain in detail.

272
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,960
Regarding your complaint
about her work ethics,

273
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,159
we obtained surveillance footage.

274
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,440
The defense attorney
did offer her a gift.

275
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,360
However, Prosecutor Lin
did not accept it.

276
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,879
Ms. Chen,

277
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,759
intentional homicide

278
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,600
does not always
lead to the death penalty

279
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,240
as most people imagine.

280
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,120
We also take into account

281
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,480
the criminal responsibility
borne by the offender.

282
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,759
I am the Deputy Chief Prosecutor.

283
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,879
We take your concerns very seriously.

284
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
And I understand how you feel right now.

285
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,720
So I hope you can

286
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,879
communicate with us.

287
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,039
We also hope the public

288
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,159
can learn more about our work.

289
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:47,440
Really?

290
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,279
Then tell me.

291
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,399
Why are those children
considered children?

292
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,600
Why is it that my child
was not considered a child?

293
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,039
Why should I give them a chance?

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Did they ever give my child a chance?

295
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,759
Did they ever give Wenxuan a chance?

296
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,960
Ms. Chen, I am also a mother.

297
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,200
I understand

298
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,039
your feelings.

299
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,400
No, you don't.

300
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,480
But this case was highly controversial

301
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,960
in the first place.

302
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,240
Without Prosecutor Lin's
relentless efforts,

303
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,319
those three defendants

304
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,119
could have been acquitted.

305
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,799
So please believe in us.

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
Believe in you?

307
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,640
What do you want me to believe?

308
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,200
What else do you want me to believe?

309
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,519
At the beginning, you said

310
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,000
you'd bring them to justice.

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,359
I believed you.

312
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:41,400
In court,

313
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,240
you said it was intentional homicide.

314
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,440
And I believed in you again.

315
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,799
But what happened?

316
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:48,759
What did I get in the end?

317
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:51,880
For how many years were they sentenced?

318
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,359
What do you want me to believe?

319
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,440
- Ms. Chen.
- What can I believe in?

320
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,960
Regarding your request, we...

321
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,119
My request?

322
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,559
My request

323
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,920
is to sentence them to death.

324
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,160
A life for a life. That's only fair.

325
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,640
Don't they deserve to die?

326
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,480
Ms. Chen.

327
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,799
This case was delivered
to the city procuratorate

328
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,920
because of its complexity.

329
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,880
Meanwhile, we wanted

330
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,759
to ease your pain as much as possible.

331
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,640
So,

332
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:21,759
this is where it ends, huh?

333
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,039
There's nothing you can do, huh?

334
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,160
In that case,

335
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,920
fine.

336
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,480
Let them out.

337
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,039
Let them out.

338
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,559
I'll kill them.

339
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,279
Chen Huiwen.

340
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,480
Could you please

341
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,279
calm down?

342
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,160
Okay?

343
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,519
How dare you talk to me?

344
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:48,960
Lin Zhitao.

345
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:51,559
It's all because of you.

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,680
- Right now...
- I can't take revenge now!

347
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,279
I know how you feel.

348
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:56,839
Lin Zhitao.

349
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:57,519
But it's not...

350
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,119
You are the murderer!

351
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,440
Ms. Chen.

352
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,519
You want me to "calm down"?

353
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,200
Chen Huiwen.

354
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,200
Listen up.

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,039
We've been tolerating you

356
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,160
not because we did wrong.

357
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,680
We did nothing wrong.

358
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,799
No matter what you say or do,

359
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,119
the law is the law.

360
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,519
It will not change.

361
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,200
Understand?

362
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,359
Do you understand?

363
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:18,799
Lin Zhitao.

364
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,400
You are the murderer.

365
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,680
Karma will get you.

366
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,079
Chen Huiwen.

367
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,039
You speak from your standpoint.

368
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,799
Just you wait.

369
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,400
Just you wait.

370
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,376
Ms. Chen.

371
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,440
Ms. Chen.

372
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:55,359
Ms. Chen.

373
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,799
I'm fine.

374
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,640
(We suggest the following sentencing)

375
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,559
(for the defendants.)

376
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,200
(The defendant Huang Jiawang)

377
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,599
(shall have eight years
of fixed-term imprisonment.)

378
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,680
Why not the death penalty?

379
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,759
You promised me.

380
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:41,640
You promised to help me.

381
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,880
What does your conscience say?

382
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,640
Can you say you did your best?

383
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,200
You are the murderer.

384
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,599
- You...
- You are the murderer.

385
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,119
(Get lost.)

386
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,519
Mom.

387
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,359
- Get lost.
- Dad, stop.

388
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,880
(Jump, and I'll let you go.)

389
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
(Jump.)

390
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,440
Mom.

391
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:43,480
(Award)

392
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,039
Mom.

393
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,559
Mom?

394
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,359
Where is Ming?

395
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:58,960
Ming.

396
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,519
Ming?

397
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,400
Ming?

398
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:04,759
Where is Ming?

399
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,119
I'm talking to you.

400
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,440
Where is Lu Ming?

401
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:09,319
Where is Lu Ming?

402
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:10,559
Speak.

403
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,119
He went to learn

404
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,688
from Xiong.

405
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:15,400
You...

406
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,640
Your hands.

407
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,359
Don't flinch.

408
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,920
What if you get caught?

409
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,680
Sheng.

410
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:33,839
Go to sleep.

411
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,279
You're back.

412
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,799
Good to see you.

413
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Welcome home.

414
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,200
Why didn't you tell me
your mom passed away?

415
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,799
I could have gone with you.

416
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,960
No need. It's fine.

417
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,519
How is it fine?

418
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,680
Look at you.

419
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:03,960
You're so pale.

420
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:05,559
Rest for some days.

421
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,240
No need. I'm not tired.

422
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:10,200
I see some grey hair.

423
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,839
They've been there.

424
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm thinking.

425
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,160
I don't know if what I did

426
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,319
truly helped those three kids.

427
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,680
If it really did help them,

428
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,960
I find it hard to accept.

429
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,839
I don't even know who I'm protecting.

430
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,240
What I'm going to tell you

431
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,519
might be even harder to accept.

432
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:39,079
The Supreme People's Procuratorate

433
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,599
is setting up a separate department

434
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,799
for juvenile delinquency

435
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,519
and its prosecutorial work in two years.

436
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,160
So, the procuratorate has decided

437
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,200
to establish

438
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,960
a pilot department
for juvenile prosecutorial work.

439
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,440
I want to recommend you for the position

440
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,599
of the director.

441
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,319
You guys are mean.

442
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,160
Setting up a department to punish me?

443
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Is it worth it?

444
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,839
Lin Zhitao.

445
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:17,240
Don't take yourself so seriously.

446
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,319
You're clearly trying to drive me away.

447
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,359
It's a punishment.

448
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,160
Right?

449
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,799
I'm responsible
for Zhang Wenxuan's case.

450
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,759
I didn't expect

451
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:27,519
that bringing this case

452
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,400
to the city procuratorate resulted in

453
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,720
unrealistic expectations.

454
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,799
But you did

455
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,240
a perfect job as the prosecutor.

456
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,799
From trial to sentencing,
it was flawless.

457
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,640
Don't sweet-talk me.

458
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,599
I'm not stupid.

459
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,720
You're setting up this department

460
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,039
right at this moment.

461
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,240
Inspectors came and investigated me.

462
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,960
People out there

463
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,319
are pointing fingers at me.

464
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,799
You're putting me to take the blame.

465
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,400
Am I right?

466
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,640
- We...
- I'm the scapegoat, no?

467
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
"The scapegoat"?

468
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,359
Come closer.

469
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,480
She's driving me away.

470
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,440
Tell everyone...

471
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,359
Are you done?

472
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,680
How could you say something like that?

473
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,279
I won't go.

474
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,200
You have no choice.

475
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,559
You're the "scapegoat"?

476
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,119
Is it your first day as a prosecutor?

477
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,000
Or do you think

478
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,759
that I can't tell right from wrong?

479
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,119
Haven't I dealt with

480
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,880
difficult family members of the victims?

481
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,160
If I just drive our colleagues away,

482
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,279
do you think I can do my job

483
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:15,240
to this very day?

484
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,440
Then why do you have to

485
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,759
transfer me at this moment?

486
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,480
I told you.

487
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,960
It was just decided.

488
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,119
Let me talk to you

489
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,359
calmly and seriously.

490
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,920
As a prosecutor for major cases,

491
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,079
I think I'm doing a good job.

492
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:38,640
I haven't let a felony criminal

493
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,599
get away with a penalty, right?

494
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,119
I didn't even blink

495
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,680
when I supervised the death penalty

496
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,279
and saw those inmates twitching.

497
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:48,640
I believe

498
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
that I'm doing what I do best.

499
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,759
I can do it well.

500
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,240
I will do even better in the future.

501
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,200
You have always believed in me.

502
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,839
So why are you transferring me?

503
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:00,680
Do you think I can manage kids?

504
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,279
You know best

505
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,640
if I can manage kids.

506
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,720
I can't manage them.

507
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,640
It's difficult even to talk to them.

508
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,519
I don't think I would misjudge.

509
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,480
You have to get over this trauma.

510
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,920
Or you will never become

511
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,640
a competent prosecutor.

512
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,640
There is no trauma.

513
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,480
Just tell me.

514
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,640
Are you seeking

515
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,640
my opinion,

516
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,519
or is it decided?

517
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:25,920
- It's decided.
- Okay.

518
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,960
- Where are you going?
- What's there to say?

519
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,400
You're really leaving?

520
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,319
A top-ten prosecutor in Yuedong,

521
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,240
who's in charge of major crimes

522
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,680
is going to look after kids.

523
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,440
What a pity.

524
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,359
Pity, huh?

525
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,880
I also think it's a pity.

526
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,200
So who is willing

527
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,599
to come with me?

528
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,720
Zhitao, we'll pass.

529
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:06,759
Where is it?

530
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,279
I don't know.

531
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,079
Is it here?

532
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,519
Yeah.

533
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,799
Isn't this the logistics?

534
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,400
Yeah.

535
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,359
They'll start fixing
the new office next week.

536
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,200
So you'll have to stay here for now.

537
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:24,960
Here are the keys.

538
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,079
Zhitao.

539
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:35,640
Oh my God.

540
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,784
This...

541
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,319
T-This is an office?

542
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,240
This is an exile.

543
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,440
Cheng Wei.

544
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,640
(Fortune)
Do you smell something?

545
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,640
Not really.

546
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,960
It's probably coming from the bathroom.

547
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,640
What do they want?

548
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,400
Cheng Wei.

549
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,519
Can you handle this job

550
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,200
alone?

551
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,680
Come on, Zhitao.

552
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,240
I came here because of you.

553
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,279
Cheng Wei.

554
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,319
Here's a task for you.

555
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,880
Assign me some tasks.

556
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,680
Anything will do.

557
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,359
You want me to assign you tasks?

558
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:34,680
Why don't we go to
the Juvenile Correctional Facility

559
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,079
to see how the three of them are doing?

560
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,279
Do a follow-up.

561
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:39,559
Okay.

562
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,200
What should we

563
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,279
ask them...

564
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,000
You decide.

565
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,599
Me?

566
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,839
We can ask Huang Jiawang
to draw a picture.

567
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,720
- Great.
- I think...

568
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,680
Zhitao, stop having those oranges.

569
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,000
Someone will find out.

570
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,640
How much can I eat?

571
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,640
♪Come home often♪

572
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,920
♪Even if just to
help your wife wash dishes♪

573
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,680
♪The husband doesn't♪

574
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,240
Bai.

575
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,119
Well...

576
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
Are you in charge of Huang Jiawang?

577
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,400
The prosecutors are coming soon.

578
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,119
Greet them.

579
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,240
Wait.

580
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,920
Let Xinwu do it.

581
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,279
What's wrong?

582
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,400
I can't give you orders?

583
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,599
You got me wrong.

584
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,559
It's because I promised my wife

585
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,759
to go home for dinner.

586
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,039
If I don't go home,

587
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,039
she will kill me.

588
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,079
Meet them. It's not up to you.

589
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,640
Fine, I'll go.

590
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,599
Is it done?

591
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:47,559
Yeah.

592
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:48,519
He's here.

593
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,680
You were the judge

594
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,200
who pleaded for us in court.

595
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,960
I'm Prosecutor Lin.

596
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,519
Sit down.

597
00:30:06,432 --> 00:30:07,079
Let's begin.

598
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:11,519
Mother prosecutor.

599
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,519
I'm not your mother.

600
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,519
Does Prosecutor Lin look that old?

601
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:15,880
Sorry about that.

602
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:17,480
Sister prosecutor.

603
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,279
I'm not your mother, nor your sister.

604
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,599
Call me Prosecutor Lin.

605
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,599
That's not important.

606
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,920
What's important is that you saved me.

607
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,119
If you hadn't pleaded for me in court,

608
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,200
I would be finished.

609
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
I'd have been sentenced to years.

610
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,160
My dad wanted to thank you in person.

611
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,160
(Someone was protesting downstairs.)

612
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,599
The victim's family

613
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,279
threw paint all over

614
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,359
a prosecutor.

615
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,599
W-What's this?

616
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:50,799
Draw.

617
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,759
Draw what?

618
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,279
Draw yourself as you imagine.

619
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,839
Can I see myself in the mirror?

620
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:57,920
Don't you know

621
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,359
what you look like?

622
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,160
What do I get for drawing that?

623
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,640
Are you bargaining with me?

624
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,680
Start drawing.

625
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,920
Be serious.

626
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,839
How do you feel in the facility?

627
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,359
It's great to be here.

628
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,079
I've met many friends.

629
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,880
The food is good,
and so is the accommodation.

630
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,759
Have you recognized your mistakes?

631
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,200
Yes, I have.

632
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,839
I recognize my mistakes.

633
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,839
I've been reflecting on myself.

634
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:40,400
I'm sorry for Zhang Wenxuan's mother.

635
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,440
Come on, look at me.

636
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:42,920
Look at me.

637
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,319
I'm sorry for Zhang Wenxuan's mother.

638
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,240
I hope for lenient sentencing.

639
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,640
I wanna keep his mom company.

640
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,160
She must be lonely.

641
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:56,440
Right?

642
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,240
"Right"?

643
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,759
Are you asking me?

644
00:32:03,264 --> 00:32:03,960
She...

645
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,480
Why weren't you in the class?

646
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,000
Because I was in confinement.

647
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,079
Why?

648
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,079
We were learning lion dance.

649
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,079
I was t-too dumb to learn things.

650
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,440
I couldn't learn it.

651
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,559
The instructor punished me.

652
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,519
Speak properly.

653
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,680
I wasn't asking you.

654
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:25,920
He was lying.

655
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,000
I-I... Yeah.

656
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,519
I was wrong. I lied.

657
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,400
But indeed, I'm way too dumb.

658
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,839
I just couldn't learn it.

659
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,680
One more word,

660
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
and I will send you back to confinement.

661
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,559
One more word,

662
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,200
and I will go to your chief.

663
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,000
I am asking him, not you.

664
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,240
Fine, I'll shut up.

665
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,319
Talk with your son.

666
00:32:49,024 --> 00:32:49,720
You...

667
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,480
Are you done?

668
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,680
Yeah.

669
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,519
Why did you draw a Chinese rose?

670
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,119
What?

671
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,039
This is a rose.

672
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,519
Why did I draw a flower?

673
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,559
Because I am a flower of the motherland.

674
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,319
Why did I draw a rose?

675
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,240
Because just like me,

676
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,200
roses have thorns.

677
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,920
I want to pull out all my thorns

678
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,559
to be liked by more people.

679
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,119
Cheng Wei, turn it off.

680
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,640
- Okay.
- Why? Keep recording.

681
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,039
Can you look straight?

682
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:27,160
Yeah, yeah.

683
00:33:27,584 --> 00:33:30,160
Didn't your parents teach you
to look at who you are talking to?

684
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,079
Yeah.

685
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,759
But didn't you bring this to film me?

686
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:34,319
No.

687
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,440
So I was mistaken.

688
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,160
But honestly,

689
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,480
I sincerely believe

690
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,119
that I've made a mistake.

691
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,680
I-I've been reformed.

692
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,240
I think

693
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,039
I've been reformed.

694
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,519
I've been studying hard.

695
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,200
I don't fight or brawl.

696
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,279
I don't bully others.

697
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,440
I just want to get out sooner

698
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,839
to accompany Zhang Wenxuan's mom.

699
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,799
I could even wash her feet.

700
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:56,799
Isn't it sad for her to be alone?

701
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,039
I just want a lenient sentencing.

702
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,200
I want to get out earlier.

703
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,720
She has aged and lost her son.

704
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:02,720
Alright, time's up.

705
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,359
Come with me.

706
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:08,719
(Chief's Office)

707
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,639
Yeah, you're right.

708
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,039
We will keep disciplining him

709
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,559
and make him recognize his problems.

710
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Are you eavesdropping so openly?

711
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,159
Do I even need to?

712
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,519
- Wait.
- Chief.

713
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,400
He's been eavesdropping.

714
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:25,920
You kept me there

715
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,800
to bring Huang Jiawang over

716
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,679
and watch him paint?

717
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,039
Isn't it too much formalism?

718
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,239
Thank you, Chief.

719
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,159
We have to go.

720
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,039
See you, Chief.

721
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,639
Bai.

722
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,280
I know. I'll talk nicely.

723
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,079
Wait.

724
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,693
(Chief's Office)

725
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,239
Why did you come, seriously?

726
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,079
It's a follow-up

727
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,719
to see how they're doing.

728
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,280
Just by painting roses?

729
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,079
That's a psychological test.

730
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh my, you're clueless.

731
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,199
You're really going all out with it.

732
00:34:58,599 --> 00:34:59,880
You gave lenient sentences

733
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,840
and ignored the victim's family.

734
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,280
You record a video,

735
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
and claim the child has reformed.

736
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:06,159
And you get an award.

737
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,000
Captain Bai.

738
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,800
Please don't make

739
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,000
blind accusations, okay?

740
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:11,719
We are here to do our job.

741
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:12,800
Got a problem?

742
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,639
Yes, I have a problem.

743
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,320
You hindered my work.

744
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,079
How did we hinder your work?

745
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,360
I just crushed
Huang Jiawang's arrogance.

746
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,559
And you brought it back.

747
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,440
Is it our fault?

748
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
You've got quite a temper.

749
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,480
That kid just loves to act.

750
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,880
He craves attention.

751
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,119
We can only ignore him
to discipline him.

752
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,039
And you guys

753
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,559
welcomed him to put on a show.

754
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:32,679
Fine, we won't next time.

755
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,440
Next time?

756
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,239
Spare me, please.

757
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,079
Are you going to

758
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,320
keep backstabbing me?

759
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,800
Didn't I make it clear?

760
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,440
File a complaint if you want.

761
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm familiar with it.

762
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,559
Bai Enyu.

763
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,760
I will file a complaint.

764
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,320
Why can't I

765
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,599
do what you did to me?

766
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,559
Bai Enyu.

767
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,679
What were you saying?

768
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,079
What did she tell you?

769
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,920
Do you have to

770
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,360
fight with everyone you see?

771
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,719
She started it.

772
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,039
She wanted me

773
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,480
to recognize my problems?

774
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:58,280
So, you had to fight back, huh?

775
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,079
She was talking about Huang Jiawang.

776
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,119
She said he hadn't

777
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,360
realized the severity of his crime.

778
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,400
I kept you there

779
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,559
to establish
a friendly relationship with them.

780
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,320
So aggressive.

781
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,199
And you want a job transfer?

782
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,519
Prosecutor Lin.

783
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,559
(Party Branch Office)
That was a misunderstanding.

784
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,119
Zhitao, should we keep this video?

785
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:43,880
Delete it.

786
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,736
(Do you wish to delete this video?)

787
00:36:48,736 --> 00:36:49,408
(Deleting)

788
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,519
So what's next?

789
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,079
Nothing.

790
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,480
I'm taking you home.

791
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,039
Working like this is quite demotivating.

(Legal Education Handbook)

793
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:31,360
Hello.

794
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,079
Hello, sir, ma'am.

795
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,320
I am from

796
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,760
Linwan Mobile Prosecution Station.

797
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,000
Here's our handbook.

798
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,119
Hello.

799
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:39,599
This is our legal education manual.

800
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,519
Take a look.

801
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,960
Here, take a look.

802
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:43,599
This is our legal education handbook.

803
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,840
Will you read it?

804
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,400
- This is our legal education handbook.
- Take it away.

805
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,400
Take it for the kids.

806
00:37:49,747 --> 00:37:51,936
(Get rid of bad habits.
Establish civility)

807
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,199
Take a handbook for a pack of noodles.

808
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,400
Come on, give me one.

809
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,119
There you go.

810
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,719
Take care.

811
00:37:57,972 --> 00:38:01,408
(Study hard. Make progress)

812
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,599
Kid.

813
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:22,280
W-What happened to you?

814
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,519
Is everything written here true?

815
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
Yeah, it's true.

816
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,199
Then I want to sue my dad.

817
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,599
I assume you've heard

818
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,639
the result of the investigation
on Prosecutor Lin.

819
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,360
Prosecutor Lin made no mistakes

820
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,239
regarding the sentencing
and her work ethic.

821
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,840
However, that doesn't mean

822
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,440
there is no negative impact.

823
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,360
We should deeply reflect on ourselves.

824
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,079
Have we been

825
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,280
too blunt and direct while explaining

826
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,528
to the victims' families?

827
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,559
Have we demonstrated empathy
during our work?

828
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,920
Our staff reported

829
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,920
the situation to me.

830
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,920
We put Prosecutor Lin

831
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,880
to meet the victim's mother.

832
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,239
The original intent

833
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,639
was to provide humane care

834
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:13,639
and comfort.

835
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,280
But it had the opposite effect.

836
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,440
It had a negative impact.

837
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,159
Yes, speaking of which,

838
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,760
have you seen the video?

839
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,079
Have you noticed

840
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,519
that the public opinion

841
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:27,960
is almost overwhelmingly against us?

842
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
As the Deputy Chief Prosecutor,

843
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:33,079
I can tell you that

844
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,639
this is the most challenging moment

845
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,920
since I've been in the profession.

846
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,159
We must reflect on this.

847
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,400
Why do we hear so much criticism?

848
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,679
Did we adhere to the guidelines

849
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,119
of prosecution and law enforcement
for the people?

850
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,599
I affirm Prosecutor Lin's
professional ability.

851
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,199
But to cultivate excellent prosecutors,
we must emphasize

852
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,400
comprehensive abilities as well as

853
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,920
professional abilities.

854
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,079
Otherwise,

855
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,079
how can we lead our prosecutors to work?

856
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,639
As leaders,

857
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,400
how should we win public support?

858
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,159
So, Prosecutor Fu,

859
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,360
how should we handle this?

860
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,440
I don't have a specific idea.

861
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:17,119
Everyone can speak freely.

862
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,320
I mean, we are all senior prosecutors.

863
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,679
Based on your experience,

864
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,480
what would you have done

865
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:25,679
regarding Chen Huiwen?

866
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,480
At least, I would have
explained with a gentle attitude

867
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,679
and showed empathy

868
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,440
for the victim's family.

869
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,159
These are the basics.

870
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,760
Then what?

871
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:39,320
Chen Huiwen said

872
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,639
she'd take extreme actions
unless those kids

873
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,280
were sentenced to death.

874
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:47,639
If it were up to you,

875
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:48,559
what would you do?

876
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,599
Change the sentencing?

877
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,639
She almost killed someone in court.

878
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,239
We didn't call the police

879
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,239
out of sympathy.

880
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,440
She threw paint on Lin Zhitao in public.

881
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:00,320
Didn't Lin Zhitao tolerate it?

882
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,440
The public opinion says we were wrong.

883
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,519
Should we criticize our colleagues

884
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,880
without investigation and review?

885
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,440
The procuratorate
is a supervisory body of the law.

886
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,039
Maintaining justice

887
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:12,320
is our duty and mission.

888
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,880
Moreover, it's our safeguard.

889
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,119
When faced with biased public opinion,

890
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:17,760
should we compromise

891
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,639
and be coerced?

892
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,440
It calls for further consideration.

893
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,039
We don't intend to do anything to Lin.

894
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,079
She's having a hard time.

895
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:27,800
But

896
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,559
I have great concerns

897
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,000
about putting her in charge

898
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,599
of the Juvenile Prosecution Office.

899
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,400
This was the first

900
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,039
juvenile case she handled, right?

901
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,639
It caused quite a stir.

902
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,760
Will it happen

903
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,960
once again in the future?

904
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,159
And you know what she is like.

905
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,559
I'm not the only one

906
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,679
who has doubts.

907
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,559
Yeah.

908
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,079
I'll be honest, too.

909
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,880
It's not just that we have doubts.

910
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,599
She's not particularly excited
about this, either.

911
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,239
Lin Zhitao used to handle

912
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,400
major cases in Division II.

913
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,639
She's used to being decisive.

914
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,519
Juvenile prosecution

915
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,400
may not be the job for her.

916
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,639
The office will

917
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,800
deal with juvenile criminal cases

918
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:16,760
as well as crimes against minors.

919
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,199
Those may suit her.

920
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,320
It might be better
to find someone who has kids.

921
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,000
That'd be even better.

922
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,119
So, are you saying that

923
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,519
we have to be murderers

924
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:26,800
to handle murder cases?

925
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,880
Be serious.

926
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,639
What is the key

927
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,679
to juvenile prosecution,

928
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,440
huh?

929
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,159
We must know the juveniles.

930
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:38,719
Of course.

931
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,400
Prosecutor Zheng

932
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,639
is in charge of the establishment

933
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,880
of this office.

934
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,880
We didn't intend to say so much.

935
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:47,880
We were just...

936
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,440
I very much agree with
what Prosecutor Fu just said.

937
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,000
A new task must be handed

938
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,840
to the best-fitting candidate.

939
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:56,800
However, I believe

940
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,639
what matters more
for a pilot group leader

941
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,679
is the determination
to uphold principles

942
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,440
and the courage to overcome obstacles.

943
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,679
I know everyone here

944
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,199
is highly professional

945
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:10,199
and experienced.

946
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,920
But even if we have empathy,

947
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:16,920
it's difficult to completely share
others' feelings.

948
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,440
Please believe me.

949
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,360
Among us,

950
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,000
Prosecutor Lin knows

951
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,280
the bewilderment

952
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,119
and helplessness of traumatized kids

953
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:29,280
and their yearning for justice
more than anyone else.

954
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,800
I guarantee with my 30 years
of experience as a prosecutor.

955
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:36,239
I believe that Lin Zhitao

956
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,880
can bear this heavy burden.

957
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,880
Ms. Zhao, that will do.

958
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,800
It's already time.

959
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,440
Go home and cook for your granddaughter.

960
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,360
I'm almost done.

961
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,079
You're paying me for this.

962
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,360
I must clean up your place properly.

963
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,320
I was telling my granddaughter,

964
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:04,920
"I'm going to clean up
the prosecutor's place.

965
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,719
She's busy catching bad guys.

966
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:08,960
I have to

967
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,239
clean up her place well."

968
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,000
My granddaughter said,

969
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:14,599
"She catches bad guys.

970
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,079
You're helping her

971
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:17,920
by cleaning up her place."

972
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,960
Just leave the rest over there.

973
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,159
I can do it myself.

974
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:26,360
Hurry back, Ms. Zhao.

975
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:29,079
You rarely have a break.

976
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,079
It's exhausting to catch bad guys.

977
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,360
Have a good rest.

978
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,079
Have fun.

979
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,760
I'll be done soon.

980
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:03,648
(Practice the law
with virtues and righteousness)

981
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,280
- Morning, Zhitao.
- Morning.

982
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,159
Why can't they cover it up here?

983
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:21,440
The bathroom smell is coming in.

984
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,719
Bring an air purifier here tomorrow.

985
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,880
- Okay.
- That one...

986
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:27,440
- The cylinder one.
- Okay.

987
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,920
You still have an appetite?

988
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,800
Rhinitis. Can't smell a thing.

989
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,679
Stop playing Spider Solitaire.
I have some tasks for you.

990
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:48,360
Sort out the files of all juvenile cases

991
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:50,519
from the last ten years

992
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,880
in our city

993
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:53,960
into a case archive,

994
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,320
classified by case type.

995
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,728
List the unresolved cases separately.

996
00:45:57,728 --> 00:45:58,639
That's the first task.

997
00:45:59,159 --> 00:45:59,719
Secondly.

998
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,239
You're lost?

999
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,639
Not at all.

1000
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,360
Wait. Okay.

1001
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:08,320
List the unsolved cases.

1002
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:08,920
Okay.

1003
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:10,239
Classify by case type.

1004
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:10,800
Okay.

1005
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,079
Secondly.

1006
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:12,920
Okay.

1007
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,840
Sort out the distribution
of juvenile cases in the city

1008
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:17,800
by age,

1009
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:19,719
gender,

1010
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,079
region,

1011
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,079
and case type.

1012
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:25,000
- Make a list.
- Alright.

1013
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:25,840
Thirdly.

1014
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,760
Look into legal education
campaigns in schools.

1015
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:29,472
Okay.

1016
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:31,239
List the key issues

1017
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:33,000
and the most popular content

1018
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,760
for the public.

1019
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,199
And make a tag to stick it

1020
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:37,280
at the door

1021
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:38,840
to show what this room is for.

1022
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:40,639
Okay.

1023
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,239
Complete these tasks by Wednesday.

1024
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,039
By Wednesday?

1025
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,079
We are the only two people here.

1026
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:49,824
I'll ask Prosecutor Zheng
for more hands.

1027
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,039
Can you?

1028
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,559
Cheng Wei.

1029
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:58,000
Let's do something huge, okay?

1030
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,400
Let's do it!
