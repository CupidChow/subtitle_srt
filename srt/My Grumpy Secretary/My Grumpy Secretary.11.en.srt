1
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:19,282
(My Star is waiting at a salon in Cheongdam-dong.)

2
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:23,651
- Don't I need to get off here?
- Oh, she's here.

3
00:00:23,652 --> 00:00:26,782
(The diligent My Star arrives before the secretaries.)

4
00:00:27,882 --> 00:00:30,152
Would it be okay to show my face in this state?

5
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:31,217
(My Star, Choi Hwa Jeong)

6
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:33,322
What's the concept of your outfit today?

7
00:00:33,462 --> 00:00:34,492
Today?

8
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:39,201
Well, it's the epitome...

9
00:00:39,202 --> 00:00:40,461
of the city look.

10
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:41,731
(The epitome of the city look)

11
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:42,831
Hwa Jeong.

12
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:45,101
You're so cute.

13
00:00:45,102 --> 00:00:46,542
The epitome of the city look.

14
00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:48,812
- Aren't you cold?
- I'm not cold.

15
00:00:49,212 --> 00:00:50,872
Is it because it's cashmere?

16
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:52,912
It's expensive.

17
00:00:53,342 --> 00:00:55,311
(At 10:24am, the man who's as soft as cashmere, Kwang Kyu, arrives.)

18
00:00:55,312 --> 00:00:56,652
- Hello.
- You look bright.

19
00:00:56,852 --> 00:00:58,282
- Hello.
- Welcome.

20
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,881
My Star has arrived and is waiting for you.

21
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:01,982
- Really?
- Yes.

22
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:05,362
(He hurries up to meet My Star.)

23
00:01:05,962 --> 00:01:08,061
(Rummaging)

24
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:09,362
You apply red lip balm.

25
00:01:09,432 --> 00:01:12,601
(It's time to doll up before meeting My Star.)

26
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:13,732
Well,

27
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:15,972
I want to look healthy...

28
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,732
on TV.

29
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:19,441
(After getting some vigor, )

30
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:21,902
(Kwang Kyu comes to get My Star.)

31
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:23,771
- Hello.
- Hi.

32
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,311
Hello, My Star.

33
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:27,012
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, baby.

34
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,551
My baby, it has been a while.

35
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:30,882
Long time no see.

36
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:33,752
Oh, my. It has been a while.

37
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:37,391
(Seo Jin and Kwang Kyu starred in "Wonderful Days...")

38
00:01:37,392 --> 00:01:40,522
(with My Star.)

39
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:44,861
(They met through a drama and remained friends for 10 years.)

40
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:47,561
- Oh, my. It has been a while.
- It has been a while.

41
00:01:47,562 --> 00:01:48,772
Have you been well?

42
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:51,171
- You can speak to me casually.
- Seriously.

43
00:01:51,172 --> 00:01:52,742
Seriously, baby.

44
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:53,972
By the way...

45
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:55,241
Shall we go upstairs first since it's cold?

46
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:56,788
- I can't believe we're doing this.
- He'll arrive soon.

47
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,171
Really? Your jacket...

48
00:01:58,172 --> 00:01:59,582
(My Star isn't wearing a jacket.)

49
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:01,881
It's okay. I have a coat.

50
00:02:01,882 --> 00:02:02,981
Do you have a coat?

51
00:02:02,982 --> 00:02:04,581
- I'll wear it later...
- Really?

52
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,781
- since we'll go upstairs soon.
- Still.

53
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:08,382
- It's okay.
- You'll catch a cold.

54
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:09,821
After all, you're old.

55
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:11,422
Ms. Choi.

56
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:13,522
You know,

57
00:02:13,792 --> 00:02:15,391
he's the type to get hate...

58
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:17,261
- even when he does something nice.
- Why?

59
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,002
Hey, why did you say that I was old?

60
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:21,001
He just needed to say,

61
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:22,431
"I want to keep your warm."

62
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:24,272
But he said, "After all, you're old."

63
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:26,072
- Seriously.
- Ms. Choi.

64
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:27,672
- Baby.
- Ms. Choi,

65
00:02:28,502 --> 00:02:29,572
you're 42 years old.

66
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:32,142
No, I'm 65 years old.

67
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,582
You look like you're in your 40s.

68
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,681
(10:28am, Seo Jin comes to work without being late.)

69
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:39,751
Hey.

70
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:40,922
Hello.

71
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:42,722
Hey.

72
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:47,462
(Today, his dimples are especially deep.)

73
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:52,262
(My Star, Mi Sook, asked Seo Jin about his ideal type.)

74
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:53,431
My ideal type is...

75
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:55,101
(My ideal type is...)

76
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:56,231
Choi Hwa Jeong.

77
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:58,802
(Chuckling)

78
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:02,812
(Hwa Jeong has been his ideal type for many years.)

79
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,511
("Lee Seo Jin Says, 'Choi Hwa Jeong Is My Ideal Type'")

80
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:07,181
When we starred in "Wonderful Days," Ms. Youn Yuh Jung said,

81
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,412
"You guys should date."

82
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:13,382
(My Star knows that she's Seo Jin's ideal type.)

83
00:03:14,182 --> 00:03:18,752
(His ideal type makes him smile with his dimples.)

84
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:20,792
It has been so long.

85
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,791
It has been so long. I missed you.

86
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:24,161
How did you become so skinny?

87
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,861
- I didn't become skinny.
- Your face became so small.

88
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,662
It's because of this hat.

89
00:03:28,462 --> 00:03:29,731
- I didn't become skinny.
- Your face became...

90
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:31,571
(Standing)

91
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:32,702
Hey.

92
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,702
Right now...

93
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,012
It's cold, so let's take over the duties.

94
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:38,342
- Hello.
- The manager.

95
00:03:38,882 --> 00:03:40,241
I'm Hwa Jeong's manager, Hong Seo In.

96
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,312
- I prepared today's schedule.
- Okay.

97
00:03:42,812 --> 00:03:46,752
(What's My Star's schedule for today?)

98
00:03:47,082 --> 00:03:49,421
- Today, she has a radio show.
- A radio show.

99
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:50,662
She'll appear on it as a guest,

100
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:52,461
so please monitor it well.

101
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,521
Do you have a recording today?

102
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:56,162
- Yes. For a radio show.
- I see.

103
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:59,861
The most important thing for Hwa Jeong is...

104
00:03:59,862 --> 00:04:01,831
the food concept of the day.

105
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:03,432
(The food concept of the day)

106
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:05,072
- Restaurant?
- Food concept.

107
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,472
The food concept of the day.

108
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:08,402
- What's that?
- Let me explain.

109
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:11,411
When we write poems, we say that we have poetic concepts.

110
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,542
- Poetic concepts.
- Yes. Food concept is like that.

111
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:14,881
(When I eat hot dumpling soup, )

112
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:16,582
(I add some vinegar.)

113
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:19,481
(When she looks at food, )

114
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:23,692
(she gets inspirations for the optimal taste.)

115
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:26,591
(My Star is a foodie.)

116
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:27,692
(Oh, my)

117
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:31,232
Depending on the weather, humidity, temperature,

118
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:34,702
and wind directions of the day,

119
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:36,701
I get ideas for what I want to eat.

120
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:39,472
I think it's very meaningful. Seriously.

121
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:43,411
(Fried food suddenly came to mind.)

122
00:04:43,412 --> 00:04:46,642
(Today, I'll eat tteokbokki and fried squid!)

123
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:50,081
(When she gets a food concept, )

124
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,451
(her 101 class on food begins.)

125
00:04:53,452 --> 00:04:55,252
(The green onion rice is tasty.)

126
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:57,298
(Is there anything you don't find tasty?)

127
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,362
I'm happy when a food concept comes to mind.

128
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:03,531
You shouldn't make light of it.

129
00:05:03,532 --> 00:05:05,161
(Today, they need to assist My Star with her food concepts.)

130
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:08,262
For example... Was it Episode One?

131
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:11,731
In case of something like the Cheongdam Sundaeguk accident,

132
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:12,901
I won't hold still.

133
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,202
- Really?
- Seriously. I was so taken aback.

134
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:17,511
You ordered food, but it wasn't coming.

135
00:05:17,512 --> 00:05:20,481
When you called, you realized that the restaurant was...

136
00:05:20,482 --> 00:05:21,681
- in a different area.
- Seongsu-dong.

137
00:05:21,682 --> 00:05:24,582
- Yes, it was in Seongsu-dong.
- Yes.

138
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:26,881
It'd make me so angry.

139
00:05:26,882 --> 00:05:29,021
My heart beat fast because I felt so victimized.

140
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:30,622
I felt so victimized.

141
00:05:30,952 --> 00:05:33,421
I'd become fire. I hate it so much.

142
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,321
- Fire?
- Yes. It was ridiculous.

143
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:36,692
You'd become angry.

144
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:39,262
It'd make me so angry.

145
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:42,161
It wasn't just about going without food.

146
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:45,372
It was such a foolish mistake. She was waiting.

147
00:05:45,532 --> 00:05:46,942
We went right away.

148
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:48,641
- That's right.
- Please don't be angry.

149
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:49,671
Back then...

150
00:05:49,672 --> 00:05:51,511
Why are you becoming absorbed in those emotions?

151
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:54,411
- Don't do that.
- My breath came out short.

152
00:05:54,412 --> 00:05:56,882
- So, that mustn't happen today.
- On our way...

153
00:05:57,112 --> 00:05:59,721
My blood pressure rose.

154
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:00,821
(It'll be cutthroat to assist her in terms of food.)

155
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,051
You watched the show.

156
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,652
- And this is...
- A furnace?

157
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:06,861
- No, it isn't a furnace.
- I'm sure it's food.

158
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:09,291
(Lunchbox)

159
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:10,791
- It's a lunchbox.
- What?

160
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:11,931
It's a lunchbox.

161
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:12,961
- A lunchbox?
- Yes.

162
00:06:12,962 --> 00:06:15,632
It's important to Hwa Jeong.

163
00:06:15,832 --> 00:06:17,502
Please take good care of it.

164
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:20,302
I thought it was a cosmetic bag.

165
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:23,471
I didn't know that it was a lunchbox.

166
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:25,272
Why does she carry such a heavy lunchbox?

167
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:29,912
(My Star arrives at her salon.)

168
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,281
Let's check it now.

169
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,922
(They check the mysterious lunchbox while My Star gets dolled up.)

170
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:40,122
- She even carries Tabasco.
- I see.

171
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,492
Isn't it a hot sauce?

172
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:43,662
You're right.

173
00:06:44,492 --> 00:06:45,492
(She carries small portions in a storage bag.)

174
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:46,502
This is...

175
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:47,942
This one looks the nicest.

176
00:06:48,402 --> 00:06:50,001
These look like the pills I had this morning.

177
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,801
(Whole peppercorns, olive oil, )

178
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:52,802
(boiled eggs, )

179
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:53,841
(enzyme, )

180
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:55,001
(spoon)

181
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:56,072
What's this?

182
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:58,612
- It's yogurt.
- I guess you can blend them.

183
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:01,282
Yogurt, nuts, and so on.

184
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:03,982
- Soymilk.
- Tomato juice.

185
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:05,782
She always carries it.

186
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:07,252
She's serious about eating.

187
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:09,492
She's a food fighter.

188
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:11,192
A food fighter?

189
00:07:12,052 --> 00:07:14,361
I've never seen her lose in a food fight.

190
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:15,961
(I've never seen her lose in a food fight.)

191
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,862
The hat suits you well.

192
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:20,862
- Try it on.
- Me?

193
00:07:21,202 --> 00:07:24,372
How pretty! Oh, my. It went in so easily.

194
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:26,841
- Isn't it really warm?
- It looks good.

195
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,002
(Laughter fills the makeup room.)

196
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:34,442
Hwa Jeong takes good care of herself.

197
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,751
She always does.

198
00:07:35,752 --> 00:07:37,311
(They marvel at My Star's unchanging beauty.)

199
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:39,072
She looks the same as she did ten years ago.

200
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:40,752
Only we grew old.

201
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:43,052
Don't group us together.

202
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:46,491
- Don't bring me into this.
- Hey.

203
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:48,322
You and I aren't in the same group.

204
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,638
- Let's go our separate ways.
- Our separate ways?

205
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:52,302
- Okay?
- Are we going our separate ways?

206
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:54,101
Hey.

207
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:55,102
(Staring)

208
00:07:56,502 --> 00:07:57,572
Special note.

209
00:07:58,632 --> 00:07:59,941
(Special note: Beware of a scandal since she is Seo Jin's ideal type.)

210
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,372
This is ridiculous.

211
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:02,812
This is...

212
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:06,682
I've talked about it for ten years, but nothing has happened.

213
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:09,122
What makes her your ideal type?

214
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:12,282
Her personality and looks.

215
00:08:14,122 --> 00:08:15,482
Would you be willing to marry her?

216
00:08:18,252 --> 00:08:19,892
Had it been 20 years ago...

217
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:25,192
Back then, I was 35 years old...

218
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:28,431
- and Hwa Jeong was 45 years old.
- She was 45 years old.

219
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:29,502
It wouldn't have been bad.

220
00:08:31,502 --> 00:08:32,702
- The age of 45.
- But...

221
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,141
when we 1st met, I was 45 years old...

222
00:08:35,142 --> 00:08:36,372
and she was 55 years old.

223
00:08:38,012 --> 00:08:40,181
I see. That's right.

224
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:43,052
I would've needed to give her 60th birthday party soon.

225
00:08:44,152 --> 00:08:45,551
Then my 60th birthday party and her 70th birthday party...

226
00:08:45,552 --> 00:08:46,552
would've coincided.

227
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:48,521
- Right?
- You're right.

228
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:49,522
It'd be like that.

229
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:50,852
It'd be too much.

230
00:08:51,622 --> 00:08:54,022
But... Well...

231
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:56,491
Had we been 25 and 35 years old respectively,

232
00:08:56,492 --> 00:08:58,972
we would've lived together for ten years and gotten a divorce.

233
00:08:59,462 --> 00:09:00,502
Why?

234
00:09:00,732 --> 00:09:02,501
Then...

235
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:03,701
(The master of short relationships makes a scandalous comment.)

236
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,972
we would've lived together passionately for ten years...

237
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:07,502
and gone our separate ways.

238
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:10,072
My goodness.

239
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:13,311
(My Star looks uncomfortable.)

240
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:15,812
I need to call over the secretaries.

241
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,782
I need to call over the secretaries.

242
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,252
Excuse me.

243
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:23,722
(Getting up)

244
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:28,122
(He's the fastest when it comes to My Ideal Type.)

245
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:29,491
- Hello.
- Did you call for me?

246
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:30,531
There's my secretary.

247
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,062
Please bring me my phone.

248
00:09:33,162 --> 00:09:34,561
- Your phone?
- It's in my bag in the van.

249
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:36,071
- I'm sorry.
- Okay. Please hold on.

250
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:38,571
(My Star has requested him to bring her phone.)

251
00:09:38,572 --> 00:09:40,502
I usually carry my phone with me,

252
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:42,402
but I forgot.

253
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:49,581
(He carries her bag in a natural way.)

254
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:51,222
I don't think I entered this way earlier.

255
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:57,852
(After pressing the button, Seo Jin takes a breather.)

256
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:01,062
(Relaxing for a short time)

257
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:06,401
(The elevator takes long to arrive.)

258
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:08,802
(Isn't it here yet?)

259
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:17,642
If it takes so long to bring a phone...

260
00:10:18,142 --> 00:10:19,382
- Isn't it...
- Uncomfortable?

261
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:20,912
Isn't it a bit uncomfortable?

262
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:22,581
Right?

263
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:25,412
It's just a simple task of fetching my phone from downstairs, right?

264
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:27,481
I need to check something quickly.

265
00:10:27,482 --> 00:10:29,002
(My Star complains in an elegant way.)

266
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:31,692
(After a long while, he gets on the elevator.)

267
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,432
(Slow)

268
00:10:40,302 --> 00:10:42,772
It took you so long to bring me my phone.

269
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:45,632
I'm not complaining mindlessly.

270
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,502
You just needed to go downstairs.

271
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:50,772
I took the elevator to go down and come back up.

272
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:52,172
- Really?
- Yes.

273
00:10:52,272 --> 00:10:54,142
(Suspicious)

274
00:10:54,982 --> 00:10:56,082
Take it.

275
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:58,482
Leave.

276
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:01,322
It took you so long.

277
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:02,481
Are you still going through menopause?

278
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:04,352
(Joking)

279
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,691
- I'm past menopause.
- Aren't you past it?

280
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,962
It took you so long to bring me my phone.

281
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:11,831
- My manager...
- I took the elevator.

282
00:11:11,832 --> 00:11:12,902
- Really?
- Yes.

283
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:15,002
Baby!

284
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,171
- Yes?
- Baby!

285
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:19,231
Yes?

286
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:21,201
Discipline him.

287
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:22,271
- Come on.
- Me?

288
00:11:22,272 --> 00:11:24,411
- That's right.
- He's very strong.

289
00:11:24,412 --> 00:11:25,412
Also,

290
00:11:25,413 --> 00:11:27,541
I sent Seo Jin on an errand just now.

291
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,711
Baby, you can rest today.

292
00:11:29,712 --> 00:11:30,752
My goodness.

293
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,951
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

294
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:36,091
- Thank you.
- Don't get pushed around.

295
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,468
(Is My Star's favorite baby Kwang Kyu?)

296
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:38,821
I'll help with your circulation.

297
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:39,822
(Sucking up)

298
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,491
All right. Wait outside.

299
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,591
- Shall I wait outside?
- Yes.

300
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:44,492
Wait outside.

301
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:48,031
You have amazing hair.

302
00:11:48,032 --> 00:11:49,032
(The best compliment)

303
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:50,071
It's incredible.

304
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:52,302
(My Star and Kwang Kyu's secret deal)

305
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:57,271
(He can't hide his smile.)

306
00:11:57,272 --> 00:11:58,312
My goodness.

307
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:00,412
She's on my side.

308
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,552
"Today, will I have..."

309
00:12:05,752 --> 00:12:06,922
"the easiest shoot?"

310
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,622
I had that thought.

311
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:12,391
"Hello, I'm Choi Hwa Jeong."

312
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:16,232
(The ceremony of joy)

313
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:17,961
(Oh)

314
00:12:17,962 --> 00:12:19,191
(Baby tonight)

315
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:20,702
(Baby tonight)

316
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,501
(He can't stop humming.)

317
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:24,702
All done, right?

318
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:26,641
Well done.

319
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,202
(My Star is ready for work.)

320
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,842
I got done very quickly, right?

321
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:33,041
Where are my secretaries?

322
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,242
My goodness.

323
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:38,652
(Getting up)

324
00:12:38,712 --> 00:12:40,981
- Where is Seo Jin?
- Where is he?

325
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:42,221
What's wrong with him?

326
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:44,552
Do I need to wait for my secretary?

327
00:12:45,952 --> 00:12:46,961
I'm worried.

328
00:12:46,962 --> 00:12:48,691
(A scolding alert)

329
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:49,931
Sit down, please.

330
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:51,908
- Sit down, please. Yes.
- Do you want me to sit down?

331
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:54,631
Why am I sitting down? We need to hurry up and go.

332
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:56,671
You don't have work until 2pm.

333
00:12:56,672 --> 00:12:57,971
- Right.
- Yes.

334
00:12:57,972 --> 00:12:59,971
- What time is it now?
- Why did we begin so early?

335
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:00,972
(Current time: 11:37am They have time until work.)

336
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:03,711
Before we go to Mokdong,

337
00:13:03,712 --> 00:13:05,941
we need to buy something.

338
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,541
- What do we need to buy?
- What?

339
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:08,842
Do you have something to buy?

340
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:11,682
- It's my first radio in a while.
- Okay.

341
00:13:11,782 --> 00:13:13,952
So I'm thinking about buying flowers or...

342
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,622
- But flowers...
- Flowers?

343
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:18,251
- Flowers are a bad idea.
- I shouldn't get flowers, right?

344
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:19,621
- Food is better.
- Of course.

345
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,361
When I record a radio show,

346
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:23,462
snacks are better.

347
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,631
Flowers become trash after a day.

348
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:26,702
Exactly.

349
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:32,572
Was that why you brought flowers when you came to my place?

350
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:36,642
- When he came to my place, - What?

351
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,171
- he brought flowers.
- Really?

352
00:13:38,172 --> 00:13:39,682
- Have you been to her place?
- Yes.

353
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:43,752
I go to her place often.

354
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:45,182
That's right.

355
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:50,122
(Seo Jin has been to My Ideal Type's place.)

356
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,491
(But I'm the one she calls "Baby.")

357
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:53,992
Why didn't you invite me?

358
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:57,831
(What's this love triangle?)

359
00:13:57,832 --> 00:14:01,201
You were busy after releasing a trot album.

360
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:02,662
- Really?
- Yes.

361
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:04,572
Don't lie.

362
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:06,601
Don't lie.

363
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:08,601
(My Star's white lie)

364
00:14:08,602 --> 00:14:11,072
You don't invite me to your radio show.

365
00:14:11,342 --> 00:14:13,281
- You don't invite me to your place.
- That isn't true.

366
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:15,882
I think you turned down the radio show invitation.

367
00:14:16,182 --> 00:14:17,752
- Gosh.
- No?

368
00:14:17,852 --> 00:14:21,222
- I did turn it down.
- You did turn it down.

369
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:23,921
When I see it up close,

370
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:25,951
Baby's skin is firm.

371
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,392
- His skin is nice.
- Yes.

372
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,991
- Oh, my. May I touch it?
- Of course.

373
00:14:29,992 --> 00:14:33,562
- His skin is like a baby's.
- Yes.

374
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:37,202
- His skin is like a baby's.
- Yes.

375
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,271
You must take good care of yourself.

376
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:41,571
- My mom has...
- He was born with it.

377
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,018
- good skin.
- You were born with it.

378
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,871
Ms. Choi, you have a baby's skin too.

379
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:47,242
May I touch it?

380
00:14:47,682 --> 00:14:50,212
(Affectionate)

381
00:14:51,112 --> 00:14:53,151
No.

382
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:54,672
Don't touch her with your dirty hands.

383
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,892
- What? Is he your girlfriend?
- No.

384
00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:00,162
I go to her place often.

385
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:03,462
I go to her place often.

386
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:05,232
(Coy)

387
00:15:05,292 --> 00:15:06,462
I go to her place often.

388
00:15:08,332 --> 00:15:10,212
I'm surprised that there hasn't been a scandal.

389
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:12,371
It says here that you shouldn't talk about it.

390
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:14,301
- "Beware of a scandal."
- I see.

391
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:15,441
(Special note: Beware of a scandal since she is Seo Jin's ideal type.)

392
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:17,071
- Did you mention many times...
- "Beware of a scandal."

393
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:19,341
that he was your ideal type?

394
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:20,481
- Me?
- Yes.

395
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,941
I mentioned it many times.

396
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:23,512
- Did you mention it?
- Yes.

397
00:15:23,612 --> 00:15:25,581
- I said she was my ideal type.
- I think...

398
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,721
there's a reason why Seo Jin does it.

399
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:29,951
If he mentions me,

400
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:32,091
there's no danger of a scandal.

401
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:34,092
In a sense, it's aggravating.

402
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,661
- It's aggravating.
- It isn't like that.

403
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:37,231
If he mentions...

404
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:40,401
someone his age or someone he can end up with,

405
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:43,231
it'll lead to a scandal. So he's playing safe.

406
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:46,442
Women his age might get sensitive about it.

407
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:47,741
You're a girl too.

408
00:15:47,742 --> 00:15:51,972
(You're a girl too.)

409
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,041
(A heart attack)

410
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,781
A comment like that...

411
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:57,351
should make my heart flutter,

412
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:58,752
but I just want to punch him.

413
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:02,282
Right? When a man...

414
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:05,122
suddenly speaks to you casually,

415
00:16:05,622 --> 00:16:06,791
it should be heart-fluttering.

416
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,392
He makes me want to punch him.

417
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:11,231
I didn't know that there was such a small age gap...

418
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,461
between the two of us.

419
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:14,531
- Really?
- Yes.

420
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:15,831
Did you think I was ancient?

421
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:18,201
You were already a big star when I was young.

422
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:21,101
You used to be my ideal type.

423
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:23,442
That came out of nowhere.

424
00:16:23,512 --> 00:16:26,712
(Baby flirts for the 2nd time.)

425
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:29,541
- Are you trying to be a part of it?
- That was sudden.

426
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:30,951
I said so even back then.

427
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:32,611
The tone of her voice...

428
00:16:32,612 --> 00:16:34,882
would make any man melt.

429
00:16:35,222 --> 00:16:37,992
It's very funny. Do you know why I call him "Baby?"

430
00:16:38,592 --> 00:16:40,592
Some junior actors...

431
00:16:40,762 --> 00:16:42,522
treat me like a big sister...

432
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,931
even though we're only one year apart.

433
00:16:45,932 --> 00:16:49,401
Then I treat them as a junior.

434
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:51,871
But he called me, "Ms. Choi."

435
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:54,002
He did all the aggravating things.

436
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,172
He called me, "Ms. Choi."

437
00:16:56,742 --> 00:16:58,211
I was so startled.

438
00:16:58,212 --> 00:17:01,481
I was like, "Okay. How should I call you?"

439
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,181
He asked me to call him "Baby."

440
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,081
That's right. I did that. Baby.

441
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:07,481
- He asked me to call him "Baby."
- I think I remember.

442
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:10,422
When Kwang Kyu uses his sense of humor,

443
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:13,991
you need to suppress your anger.

444
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,962
You need to suppress your anger.

445
00:17:17,492 --> 00:17:19,661
I said, "I'll call you, 'Baby.'" That was how the nickname stuck.

446
00:17:19,662 --> 00:17:21,561
- That was how I became "Baby."
- Yes.

447
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,931
He asked me to call him "Baby." It was ridiculous.

448
00:17:23,932 --> 00:17:25,832
That was how he became "Baby."

449
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:28,972
Baby.

450
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:31,972
I had more hair than Kwang Kyu when I was 100 days old.

451
00:17:32,912 --> 00:17:34,442
That's why he's "Baby."

452
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:37,511
He's like Benjamin Button.

453
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:39,058
(Kwangjamin's time is flowing even today.)

454
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:41,422
Take off your cap and put this on. It's warm.

455
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:42,621
Okay.

456
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:44,692
I'll do as My Star commands.

457
00:17:45,092 --> 00:17:47,092
This hat is warm.

458
00:17:48,922 --> 00:17:49,962
It's pretty.

459
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:54,332
(Her favorite baby flirts with her.)

460
00:17:55,762 --> 00:17:58,602
(It seems like his flirting method has worked.)

461
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,341
Let's go, baby.

462
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:04,071
- It looks pretty on you.
- All right.

463
00:18:04,072 --> 00:18:05,241
- Let's go.
- Where do you want to eat?

464
00:18:05,242 --> 00:18:06,742
Let's decide before we hit the road.

465
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,512
Why is there so much fur?

466
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:10,551
(He nitpicks for no reason.)

467
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:12,151
- Why did so much fur fall?
- Here.

468
00:18:12,152 --> 00:18:13,152
All right.

469
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:14,552
Here.

470
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:18,151
(Kwang Kyu looks good in fur.)

471
00:18:18,152 --> 00:18:19,922
Doesn't he seem like Gorbachev?

472
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:25,432
(Laughing)

473
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:28,301
I can do anything to make My Star laugh.

474
00:18:28,302 --> 00:18:31,031
- This is fun.
- All right.

475
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:32,401
Shall we go to Mokdong?

476
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,401
Here's what I think. Now,

477
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,271
- we need to go to Mokdong.
- Mokdong.

478
00:18:36,272 --> 00:18:37,841
Like Seo Jin said,

479
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:39,942
I shouldn't buy flowers for the recording.

480
00:18:40,112 --> 00:18:43,011
I want to buy snacks.

481
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:46,011
There's a place where we can buy snacks and eat.

482
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:48,882
Give Kwang Kyu the address in advance.

483
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:50,722
You have my number, right?

484
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:53,721
Do I have your number? I don't think I do.

485
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:56,062
- You have it.
- I'll look it up.

486
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:57,361
- I'll look it up.
- Okay.

487
00:18:57,362 --> 00:18:59,361
- We talked on the phone once.
- Really?

488
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:01,561
Did we text? We contacted each other once.

489
00:19:01,562 --> 00:19:03,402
- Perhaps you deleted it.
- Did you delete it?

490
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:05,772
What? Did you delete it?

491
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,472
She doesn't have it.

492
00:19:07,672 --> 00:19:09,101
There's no result.

493
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:11,812
- For goodness' sake.
- I'll look up "Baby."

494
00:19:12,272 --> 00:19:16,512
(Happy versus Sad)

495
00:19:17,152 --> 00:19:18,512
Really?

496
00:19:18,582 --> 00:19:20,051
I have it under "Old Baby."

497
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:21,751
(She gets a call from Kwang Kyu.)

498
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:23,752
- Old Baby.
- Old Baby.

499
00:19:24,292 --> 00:19:26,621
How would anyone know that it's Kwang Kyu's number?

500
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:28,521
- Is it under "Old Baby?"
- Yes.

501
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:30,492
You're a baby who's old.

502
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,931
I have many people I call "Baby."

503
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:34,861
- I saved it under "Queen."
- That's why...

504
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,401
I saved it under "Old Baby."

505
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:37,971
Practically.

506
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:39,902
- she didn't save your number.
- Right.

507
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:41,841
- How would anyone find it?
- Look at this heart.

508
00:19:41,842 --> 00:19:44,511
- How touching.
- I added a heart.

509
00:19:44,512 --> 00:19:45,941
- You have my number.
- Let's go.

510
00:19:45,942 --> 00:19:46,981
Let's go.

511
00:19:46,982 --> 00:19:49,011
I think I'll have a lot of fun today.

512
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:51,281
(2pm, Recording "Kim Yeong Cheol's Power FM" at Mokdong SBS)

513
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:53,722
(11:30am, purchasing snacks for the staff and eating a meal)

514
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:57,392
I need to go home early and watch it today.

515
00:19:57,722 --> 00:19:59,151
- Today?
- My Grumpy Secretary.

516
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:00,861
- Don't they appear on the show?
- ALLDAY PROJECT.

517
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:02,521
Yes. I love them.

518
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,791
- Really?
- I love them.

519
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,961
I need to watch the episode. Maybe I won't be able to watch it.

520
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,231
I'll be able to watch it if I'm lucky.

521
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:09,601
- It airs at 11pm, so you can do it.
- Yes.

522
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:10,902
- Right?
- Yes.

523
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:15,902
Baby, keep your eyes on the road.

524
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:18,171
Why are you adjusting the rearview mirror?

525
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:21,081
Why are you acting like a driver who's having an affair...

526
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,141
with the madame?

527
00:20:23,142 --> 00:20:24,451
Why are you stealing glances...

528
00:20:24,452 --> 00:20:26,281
with the rearview mirror?

529
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:27,351
My goodness.

530
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,522
It has been a while,

531
00:20:29,822 --> 00:20:31,021
so I want to look at you.

532
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,268
- You have a pretty face.
- Turn around during the red light.

533
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,992
When he's driving,

534
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:37,762
he can't do anything else.

535
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:39,591
That's why he steals glances...

536
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:40,931
- when the car comes to a stop.
- Right.

537
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:44,002
But he adjusted the rearview mirror to see me...

538
00:20:44,072 --> 00:20:45,772
- in a wicked way.
- In a wicked way?

539
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:48,842
That's the purpose of the rearview mirror.

540
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:50,941
It allows me to see what's in the back...

541
00:20:50,942 --> 00:20:52,611
and prevents an accident.

542
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:53,782
(Wicked baby)

543
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,411
- I made you uncomfortable.
- Adjust it as you see fit.

544
00:20:55,412 --> 00:20:57,351
- I made you uncomfortable.
- No.

545
00:20:57,352 --> 00:21:00,851
- Honey, adjust it as you see fit.
- But...

546
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:02,281
- Seriously.
- "Honey?"

547
00:21:02,282 --> 00:21:04,222
- Baby.
- Okay.

548
00:21:04,292 --> 00:21:07,422
- Your niece...
- Many use "Honey..."

549
00:21:07,462 --> 00:21:09,491
when they don't know...

550
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:10,891
what to call people...

551
00:21:10,892 --> 00:21:12,531
- who are somewhat close.
- They use "Honey."

552
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:13,931
- Don't point it out.
- It's nothing...

553
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:17,002
to get excited about.

554
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:20,102
- I got a bit excited.
- For goodness' sake.

555
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:24,512
(Honey, didn't you know that it was love?)

556
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,482
Think before you speak. Don't say anything.

557
00:21:28,382 --> 00:21:30,582
Is this the place? What's the name of the restaurant?

558
00:21:31,182 --> 00:21:32,282
It's called...

559
00:21:33,152 --> 00:21:35,282
It's a tteokbokki place...

560
00:21:35,782 --> 00:21:37,692
I absolutely love.

561
00:21:37,952 --> 00:21:39,722
- Tteokbokki?
- Yes.

562
00:21:40,522 --> 00:21:43,292
Their fried food is a work of art.

563
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:45,092
So I'll buy some fried food.

564
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:48,201
- This is the place?
- Is this the place?

565
00:21:48,202 --> 00:21:51,332
Yes. Their instant tteokbokki is tasty.

566
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,541
Their fried food is very tasty.

567
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,742
Hurry up and order it.

568
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,841
- Here's water.
- We'd like to order.

569
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:01,212
Okay. What would you like?

570
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:03,511
- Normal spiciness is good, right?
- Yes. Normal spiciness.

571
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:04,881
- That's tasty, right?
- Two servings...

572
00:22:04,882 --> 00:22:06,251
of original tteokbokki in normal spiciness.

573
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,881
- Okay.
- Five fried squids.

574
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:10,451
- Five.
- And one candied sweet potato.

575
00:22:10,452 --> 00:22:11,691
- One candied sweet potato.
- That'll be all for now.

576
00:22:11,692 --> 00:22:12,722
There's more.

577
00:22:13,052 --> 00:22:15,021
- Order food to go.
- To go.

578
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:16,092
What would you like?

579
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:18,962
- Fried squid. Five or six?
- Fried squid. Five or six?

580
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:20,501
- Ten.
- Ten.

581
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:22,378
- There'll be many people.
- We'd like them to go.

582
00:22:22,402 --> 00:22:23,732
Does Yeong Cheol like such food?

583
00:22:23,872 --> 00:22:26,432
Their fried squid is very tasty.

584
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:29,742
(This place has fried squid that's special.)

585
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:33,212
(On a flat surface, the batter is coated in a rectangular shape.)

586
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,882
(Then it goes into the oil.)

587
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:40,282
(It's fried so that becomes thin and crispy.)

588
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,922
(Foodie My Star's favorite flat fried squid is complete.)

589
00:22:44,152 --> 00:22:46,021
Who do you think I am?

590
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:48,761
- I like it because it's special.
- I mean...

591
00:22:48,762 --> 00:22:51,062
Right. You eat food...

592
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,261
women don't usually eat.

593
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:56,102
I guess you've only dated skinny women.

594
00:22:56,202 --> 00:22:58,531
Hey, women love such food.

595
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:00,502
- I like it, but...
- Okay.

596
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:03,202
Most female actors don't eat such food.

597
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,072
You haven't changed at all.

598
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:07,241
Exactly.

599
00:23:07,242 --> 00:23:08,722
- You're a food fighter.
- Let's eat.

600
00:23:10,682 --> 00:23:11,982
Baby, don't you love such food?

601
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:15,782
I love it so much.

602
00:23:16,692 --> 00:23:18,291
Please give us fried food quickly.

603
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:20,921
- Okay.
- You make it fresh, right?

604
00:23:20,922 --> 00:23:21,992
- That's right.
- Okay.

605
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:24,332
You're rather impatient.

606
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:27,802
She's only impatient when it comes to food.

607
00:23:28,702 --> 00:23:31,062
(The place that was carefully picked by the foodie My Star)

608
00:23:31,102 --> 00:23:34,872
(Snack food place)

609
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:39,441
(Candied sweet potato that'll accompany tteokbokki...)

610
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:42,281
(and fried squid taste special at this place.)

611
00:23:42,282 --> 00:23:44,362
What else would we do while we wait for fried squid?

612
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,952
We'll eat so as not to waste time.

613
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,522
We'll do that during the wait.

614
00:23:50,252 --> 00:23:51,851
- Do we dip it in this sauce?
- Pull it to this side.

615
00:23:51,852 --> 00:23:53,351
- Yes, dip it in the soy sauce...
- Right.

616
00:23:53,352 --> 00:23:54,761
- and eat it with some green onion.
- Can you give us small dishes?

617
00:23:54,762 --> 00:23:55,861
Should I pour it in here?

618
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:57,332
- Yes, correct.
- Okay. Thank you.

619
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,768
- Oh, the fried squid...
- Please enjoy.

620
00:23:58,792 --> 00:24:00,701
- I told you, it's unique.
- Hold on. Should we...

621
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:02,501
- That is so big.
- Right.

622
00:24:02,502 --> 00:24:04,031
(Extra-large fried squid)

623
00:24:04,032 --> 00:24:05,802
What do you take me for?

624
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:09,041
You need tongs to eat fried squid here.

625
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,672
- Should we cut it?
- No.

626
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,611
- We don't cut it?
- It's up to you, though.

627
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:13,982
I'll show you how to enjoy it.

628
00:24:14,312 --> 00:24:15,482
Dip it in the sauce.

629
00:24:15,512 --> 00:24:16,541
You can eat it without the sauce.

630
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,422
(She picks it up and dips it in the soy sauce.)

631
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:20,982
I guess it's coated in batter.

632
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,451
(Amazed)

633
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:23,652
It's so good.

634
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:28,721
Have you ever seen fried squid like this?

635
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:29,992
- No, I haven't.
- Right.

636
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:31,731
We can cut it into smaller pieces, right?

637
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:33,092
- Sure. You can do that.
- Okay.

638
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:36,101
Kwang Kyu, you should cut it since you have teeth problems.

639
00:24:36,102 --> 00:24:37,172
Try it.

640
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:38,572
(Seo Jin prefers to cut it.)

641
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:39,932
- Thank you.
- No problem.

642
00:24:40,672 --> 00:24:41,971
- You'll cut it, right?
- Yes.

643
00:24:41,972 --> 00:24:43,002
- Have this.
- What?

644
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:45,432
- We have some here too.
- Did you cut it for me?

645
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:48,912
Lately, it seems that trivial things make your heart flutter.

646
00:24:50,452 --> 00:24:52,552
You must be going through menopause.

647
00:24:54,422 --> 00:24:56,992
(He has a bite of fried squid.)

648
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:00,662
How does it taste? Isn't it good?

649
00:25:00,822 --> 00:25:01,992
- It's unique.
- Yes.

650
00:25:02,662 --> 00:25:04,462
It's a unique type of deep-fried food, right?

651
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:05,861
- It's very unique.
- Indeed.

652
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:07,632
- I've never seen it before.
- Right.

653
00:25:09,502 --> 00:25:10,571
This is...

654
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:12,212
If you think about it, it's just one arm.

655
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:14,642
You're right. It's just one arm.

656
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:18,072
- But something makes it special.
- This part...

657
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,442
This part...

658
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,182
makes the fried squid crunchier and taste like chips.

659
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:24,412
Try dipping it in the soy sauce.

660
00:25:24,552 --> 00:25:26,152
He said to try it with some green onion.

661
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:32,722
(Glancing)

662
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:37,862
Oh, my. Isn't it good?

663
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:43,531
(There's a reason My Star won't stop moving her tongs.)

664
00:25:43,532 --> 00:25:45,852
Why would you do that when I said I didn't want to eat it?

665
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,702
They will be so excited when they see this.

666
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:52,972
Exactly. With this...

667
00:25:54,712 --> 00:25:58,082
It also goes well with the tteokbokki sauce.

668
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:01,321
(Dip a piece of fried squid in the spicy tteokbokki sauce...)

669
00:26:01,322 --> 00:26:05,052
(and put it all in your mouth.)

670
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:08,321
My, it really goes well with the tteokbokki sauce.

671
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:09,622
- It's so good.
- Right?

672
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:12,838
Isn't it nice to have this kind of food after a long time?

673
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,131
It's so delicious.

674
00:26:14,132 --> 00:26:16,401
- It's perfect for the cold weather.
- And you, Seo Jin? Isn't it good?

675
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:17,501
You rarely get to have this kind of food.

676
00:26:17,502 --> 00:26:19,201
Look, we have jjolmyeon noodles.

677
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,682
- We should finish them first.
- Yes.

678
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:23,002
- Baby, try some jjolmyeon noodles.
- Okay.

679
00:26:24,572 --> 00:26:26,772
(Slurping)

680
00:26:27,112 --> 00:26:29,111
- We just followed the GPS.
- Right.

681
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:30,142
(He slurps too.)

682
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:31,852
My, it's so good.

683
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:35,482
(Staring)

684
00:26:36,382 --> 00:26:37,722
She's eating with gusto.

685
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:39,251
She always eats with gusto.

686
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:40,591
Why wouldn't I eat with gusto?

687
00:26:40,592 --> 00:26:42,122
(Why wouldn't I eat with gusto?)

688
00:26:42,762 --> 00:26:44,692
Why wouldn't I eat with gusto? It's good.

689
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,361
Considering how much you eat, you're very thin.

690
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:50,671
That's true.

691
00:26:50,672 --> 00:26:52,131
- My nickname is Yoji.
- That's right.

692
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:54,071
- Do you know what "yoji" means?
- Yes, of course.

693
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:55,101
It means toothpick.

694
00:26:55,102 --> 00:26:56,201
(Yoji Hwa Jeong chooses an old-fashioned word.)

695
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:57,311
Hwa Jeong is indeed very thin...

696
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:59,071
considering how much she eats.

697
00:26:59,072 --> 00:27:00,482
- That's true.
- Indeed.

698
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,241
She used to carry a handbag that was full of...

699
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:04,412
It was like a grocery bag.

700
00:27:05,452 --> 00:27:07,581
- Right.
- It was full of food.

701
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:10,062
She would take out something to eat whenever she felt peckish.

702
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:12,552
I practically had some inflight food in my car.

703
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,162
- Like triangle gimbap...
- That's right.

704
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:17,362
- and egg salad sandwich.
- Seo Jin...

705
00:27:18,062 --> 00:27:19,432
has such a good memory.

706
00:27:20,332 --> 00:27:22,261
I'm impressed. Seo Jin...

707
00:27:22,262 --> 00:27:23,872
was born with a good memory.

708
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:27,802
He's a natural. He would've made a good secretary.

709
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:30,472
Like the secretary of the head of a large company.

710
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,572
While working as a secretary,

711
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:33,941
he would've married the CEO's daughter.

712
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:36,811
(He would've married the CEO's daughter.)

713
00:27:36,812 --> 00:27:38,181
It would've been a marriage of convenience.

714
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:40,622
(I'm jealous.)

715
00:27:46,622 --> 00:27:49,092
It's not so good when it's cut too small.

716
00:27:49,792 --> 00:27:51,191
(Sighing)

717
00:27:51,192 --> 00:27:52,362
He has teeth problems.

718
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:55,761
There's a sad story behind it.

719
00:27:55,762 --> 00:27:57,332
No, my teeth are healthy.

720
00:27:57,732 --> 00:27:59,532
Even though I'm sad

721
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:02,571
- I smile - I smile

722
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:04,411
- Oh, you know this song.
- Of course.

723
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:06,612
She hosted a radio show for 27 years.

724
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:08,412
Is Seo Jin good at singing?

725
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,372
- He's terrible at it.
- He's a good singer.

726
00:28:10,652 --> 00:28:11,851
- Have you heard him singing before?
- Sorry?

727
00:28:11,852 --> 00:28:12,911
Have you heard him singing before?

728
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:14,481
Seo Jin rarely sings.

729
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:15,751
- I don't sing.
- He never sings.

730
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:17,051
I've heard him singing before.

731
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,891
- We went to karaoke together.
- What?

732
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:20,412
- You went to karaoke together?
- Yes.

733
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:23,562
- How did it happen...
- You went to karaoke,

734
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:25,262
- just the two of you?
- Yes.

735
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:28,732
We went to Japan together as well.

736
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:31,032
We went to Japan together too.

737
00:28:31,402 --> 00:28:32,432
- Really?
- Yes.

738
00:28:32,702 --> 00:28:34,942
My goodness. So...

739
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:37,511
You two definitely dated before.

740
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:39,072
Seeing that you went to Japan together.

741
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:40,812
You liked the egg salad sandwich...

742
00:28:40,912 --> 00:28:43,712
- at Seven-Eleven.
- That's right.

743
00:28:44,512 --> 00:28:46,281
Oh, my. You have such a good memory.

744
00:28:46,282 --> 00:28:47,721
(Touched)

745
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:50,521
I can recall things like that only when others tell me.

746
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,122
I don't remember such things.

747
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:54,792
You must remember every word she said.

748
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:57,182
That must be because he has feelings for me.

749
00:28:57,932 --> 00:29:00,131
(It seems to be true that Seo Jin and My Star are close.)

750
00:29:00,132 --> 00:29:02,802
Seo Jin, did you know you would stay single...

751
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:05,632
- until now?
- Well...

752
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:07,742
- I talked to Jee Seok Jin...
- Yes.

753
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:09,718
While making a video for his YouTube channel.

754
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:12,241
- He said I would fall in love soon.
- Yes.

755
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:13,742
I said I didn't think so.

756
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:16,212
Then he said, "Love comes to you like a car accident."

757
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:18,681
I said I could be in a car accident,

758
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:20,482
but I didn't think I would fall in love.

759
00:29:20,622 --> 00:29:22,152
I totally agree with you.

760
00:29:22,982 --> 00:29:25,051
You're more likely to be in a car accident.

761
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:27,091
Right. I actually got into a car accident recently.

762
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:29,291
- Really?
- Yes.

763
00:29:29,292 --> 00:29:30,321
(A real car accident occurred instead of love.)

764
00:29:30,322 --> 00:29:32,132
- You got into a car accident.
- Yes.

765
00:29:34,062 --> 00:29:35,262
By the way...

766
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:36,731
Baby,

767
00:29:36,732 --> 00:29:38,532
do you want to get married?

768
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,201
Of course.

769
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:41,541
Then you should actively look out for a partner.

770
00:29:41,542 --> 00:29:44,011
- I'm not going to get married.
- Really?

771
00:29:44,012 --> 00:29:45,572
Since when did you think that way?

772
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:46,972
Since you were younger?

773
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:49,942
- You had no intention...
- I mean,

774
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:52,811
I've always wanted to date someone.

775
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:54,081
You dated many men, right?

776
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:55,922
Well, that's not important.

777
00:29:55,952 --> 00:29:57,791
But if you meet someone...

778
00:29:57,792 --> 00:29:59,252
and get married at your age,

779
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:01,662
- you'd only take care of him.
- Exactly.

780
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:03,561
- She can meet a younger man.
- You see...

781
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:05,061
Someone healthy like you.

782
00:30:05,062 --> 00:30:06,661
A younger man...

783
00:30:06,662 --> 00:30:08,762
would not date her.

784
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,172
- A younger man...
- That hurts my feelings.

785
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:12,832
- Hey.
- I mean...

786
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:15,102
If I show him my bank account balance...

787
00:30:15,442 --> 00:30:16,701
- Oh, in that case...
- Right. And...

788
00:30:16,702 --> 00:30:18,712
- I'm getting tempted right now.
- I would...

789
00:30:19,342 --> 00:30:21,641
(The rich older woman who treats you to meals)

790
00:30:21,642 --> 00:30:24,011
I would be tempted without checking your balance.

791
00:30:24,012 --> 00:30:26,151
(I would be tempted without checking your balance.)

792
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:27,981
Baby, do you live alone in Incheon?

793
00:30:27,982 --> 00:30:29,281
Or do you live with your mother?

794
00:30:29,282 --> 00:30:30,651
My mother lives in Busan.

795
00:30:30,652 --> 00:30:32,132
- I live alone.
- Oh, you live alone?

796
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:33,322
Visit me sometime.

797
00:30:34,122 --> 00:30:35,642
No one visits him because it's so far.

798
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:40,091
I watched your YouTube videos. Your house seemed lovely and tidy,

799
00:30:40,092 --> 00:30:41,201
and you seemed to be a great cook.

800
00:30:41,202 --> 00:30:43,402
How about you invite us to a housewarming party?

801
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:44,701
Don't say "us."

802
00:30:44,702 --> 00:30:46,302
- I've been to her house before.
- We...

803
00:30:46,632 --> 00:30:48,871
We've never been to her house together.

804
00:30:48,872 --> 00:30:51,341
I'll come over sometime.

805
00:30:51,342 --> 00:30:52,911
Sure. All right.

806
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:54,012
Come.

807
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:55,641
Why not? Come over to my house.

808
00:30:55,642 --> 00:30:57,011
Does she want me to come or not?

809
00:30:57,012 --> 00:30:58,351
What's wrong?

810
00:30:58,352 --> 00:30:59,781
I'll be happy to see you.

811
00:30:59,782 --> 00:31:01,382
Make a YouTube video at her house.

812
00:31:02,082 --> 00:31:03,521
How many times have you been there? Twice?

813
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:05,192
- No, just once. Yes.
- Once?

814
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,121
(Sulky)

815
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:09,562
Her house is quite large.

816
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:11,262
How big is it?

817
00:31:11,692 --> 00:31:12,862
The biggest type.

818
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,601
- You mean, 231m²?
- Yes, 254m² to be exact.

819
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:17,571
Oh, my. The house must be huge.

820
00:31:17,572 --> 00:31:19,072
- And it has glass walls.
- Right.

821
00:31:19,372 --> 00:31:20,842
It has glass walls all around.

822
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,242
(My Star lives in an apartment with greenery.)

823
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,311
(The glass walls with panoramic view and stylish decoration are a bonus.)

824
00:31:27,312 --> 00:31:29,312
Isn't the penthouse in that building really large?

825
00:31:29,382 --> 00:31:32,112
Yes, Jun Ji Hyun lives in the penthouse.

826
00:31:32,212 --> 00:31:35,952
(My Star and Actress Jun Ji Hyun are neighbors.)

827
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:39,292
(My Star enjoys a luxurious single life.)

828
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,122
Are you tempted?

829
00:31:41,862 --> 00:31:43,092
What do you think about me?

830
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:46,962
I like my dear baby.

831
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:49,331
She doesn't sound like she means it.

832
00:31:49,332 --> 00:31:51,101
(The lunch is over with her indifferent comment.)

833
00:31:51,102 --> 00:31:52,131
Thank you for the food.

834
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:54,741
(The snacks for the radio show team are all packed.)

835
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:55,822
I'll take care of the bill.

836
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:58,502
- I'd like to settle up.
- Yes, please come.

837
00:31:58,912 --> 00:32:00,982
Who spends 80 dollars at a snack bar?

838
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,712
- Hey, that's...
- We ordered a lot of food to go.

839
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:05,082
Oh, right. We ordered some to go.

840
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:06,181
- We really enjoyed the food.
- Have a good day.

841
00:32:06,182 --> 00:32:07,451
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

842
00:32:07,452 --> 00:32:08,651
- Have a good day.
- You too.

843
00:32:08,652 --> 00:32:09,721
(The generous My Star is liberal with her money on food.)

844
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:11,492
We'll see Yeong Cheol there.

845
00:32:11,822 --> 00:32:13,852
- He's the host of the radio show.
- That's right.

846
00:32:14,392 --> 00:32:15,912
- Should we go to this place?
- Sorry?

847
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:18,992
- To SBS in Mok-dong.
- Right.

848
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:21,502
- Hwa Jeong, Kwang Kyu said...
- Yes?

849
00:32:21,662 --> 00:32:24,201
That you had been fired from your radio show.

850
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:25,832
Did you get fired or quit?

851
00:32:26,072 --> 00:32:27,341
(He keeps quiet pretending he doesn't know anything.)

852
00:32:27,342 --> 00:32:28,441
I wasn't fired.

853
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,641
Would you have fired me if you were them?

854
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:32,312
I said I didn't think you were fired.

855
00:32:32,972 --> 00:32:34,772
I thought you had quit. But Kwang Kyu said...

856
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:35,942
that you had been fired.

857
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,051
It's not like that.

858
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:39,751
You cried your heart out...

859
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,282
- in the last episode.
- Yes.

860
00:32:41,552 --> 00:32:43,852
That must've made people think...

861
00:32:44,022 --> 00:32:45,591
I read some online comments. Some wondered if you were fired.

862
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:47,492
There were some comments like that.

863
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:48,991
So I asked him if it was true.

864
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:50,091
That's not the case.

865
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:52,392
- I'll tell you what happened.
- Yes, please.

866
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:56,202
I started my YouTube channel on May 5.

867
00:32:56,502 --> 00:32:58,672
I mean, it was May 4.

868
00:32:59,332 --> 00:33:01,412
You got so many subscribers in one and a half years.

869
00:33:01,802 --> 00:33:04,342
I have 760,000 subscribers now.

870
00:33:05,372 --> 00:33:07,341
I thought I should continue...

871
00:33:07,342 --> 00:33:09,482
- to host my radio show.
- I see.

872
00:33:09,682 --> 00:33:12,452
So I was going to keep hosting the show.

873
00:33:13,082 --> 00:33:15,351
Because of the restructuring plan,

874
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:17,492
all the staff members were replaced.

875
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:18,851
So new staff members joined the team.

876
00:33:18,852 --> 00:33:20,451
Since I had been hosting the show for a long time,

877
00:33:20,452 --> 00:33:23,792
I thought it'd be nice if there was a refreshing change.

878
00:33:23,892 --> 00:33:26,491
But the writers I worked with for several decades were gone,

879
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:29,401
and they were replaced with the new writers...

880
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:31,531
which made me contemplate a lot.

881
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:32,771
We had a lot of meetings as well.

882
00:33:32,772 --> 00:33:35,742
I shared my thoughts on how I wanted the show to become.

883
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:38,241
I was so stressed out, and suddenly...

884
00:33:38,242 --> 00:33:40,071
(And suddenly...)

885
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:45,812
I thought I should quit.

886
00:33:46,052 --> 00:33:48,551
I hosted the radio show for 27 years, you know.

887
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:49,582
So I thought...

888
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,922
I should complete 30 years.

889
00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:56,662
Life doesn't go as planned, right?

890
00:33:56,962 --> 00:33:58,032
So I really...

891
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:02,202
So with that thought,

892
00:34:02,302 --> 00:34:04,331
I talked to the staff members...

893
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:05,671
(I talked about how I thought of quitting.)

894
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:08,242
and the CEO of the radio station.

895
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:12,541
And they all willingly decided...

896
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:13,772
to let me go.

897
00:34:15,182 --> 00:34:17,652
- You did the right thing.
- Right. So...

898
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,612
When I recorded the last episode,

899
00:34:20,952 --> 00:34:23,152
I invited all the old staff members I had worked with.

900
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,251
I worked with the old staff members...

901
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:27,291
for the last time.

902
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:29,932
(On the meaningful day, she worked with the people she cared for.)

903
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,961
Every day, at noon, I came to the studio...

904
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:36,861
and listened to the theme music of "Choi Hwa Jeong's Power Time."

905
00:34:36,862 --> 00:34:39,532
And that made me happy like magic.

906
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:43,201
Even in hard, gloomy moments, when I said hi cheerfully,

907
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:45,312
I smiled even before I knew.

908
00:34:46,512 --> 00:34:49,542
Thank you for saying that "Choi Hwa Jeong's Power Time..."

909
00:34:50,042 --> 00:34:53,812
has been your youth and one page of your life.

910
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:56,922
Dear listeners,

911
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:59,591
this will be my last time saying goodbye.

912
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:00,592
(And on June 2, 2024, the last day of "Choi Hwa Jeong's Power Time")

913
00:35:00,593 --> 00:35:03,361
This show began on November 15, 1996...

914
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:06,192
right after SBS Power FM began broadcasting.

915
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:11,302
"Choi Hwa Jeong's Power Time" will end now.

916
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:17,102
Listeners, thank you so much for listening to my radio show.

917
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:18,442
I love you.

918
00:35:25,712 --> 00:35:30,582
(So she bid goodbye, and the story of 10,061 days ended.)

919
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:33,991
Baby, did it answer your question?

920
00:35:33,992 --> 00:35:35,061
Yes, of course.

921
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:36,992
- I...
- Don't spread a weird rumor.

922
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:38,732
Oh, was that what I did?

923
00:35:40,292 --> 00:35:41,332
It's not...

924
00:35:41,902 --> 00:35:44,631
- Oh, hello.
- Hello. We're here...

925
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:45,771
- to record a radio show.
- Yes, I'm aware of that.

926
00:35:45,772 --> 00:35:47,702
Right. It feels like home to me.

927
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:49,472
(1:40pm, SBS radio station at Mok-dong)

928
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:50,812
It always feels like home to me.

929
00:35:52,212 --> 00:35:53,241
We're here.

930
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:56,412
(Today, she'll be a guest to "Kim Yeong Cheol's Power FM.")

931
00:35:57,042 --> 00:35:58,982
(Waiting to escort Hwa Jeong)

932
00:35:59,552 --> 00:36:00,881
We...

933
00:36:00,882 --> 00:36:01,882
(Grunting)

934
00:36:02,122 --> 00:36:03,152
(Holding her arm)

935
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:07,151
(Seo Jin helps her right away.)

936
00:36:07,152 --> 00:36:08,861
- I think I should wear my coat...
- Should I...

937
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,462
- take this?
- Yes. I'll wear my coat.

938
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:13,791
Find her coat.

939
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:16,032
(They take out My Star's coat hastily.)

940
00:36:16,432 --> 00:36:19,232
It's not easy to prepare things quickly, is it?

941
00:36:19,372 --> 00:36:21,071
(He finds her coat quickly and brings it to her.)

942
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:22,702
- Baby.
- Yes, ma'am.

943
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:25,872
You're running for the first time today.

944
00:36:27,372 --> 00:36:28,892
He's running for the first time today.

945
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:31,251
- This is his first time running.
- You always dress nicely.

946
00:36:31,252 --> 00:36:32,252
This is his first time running.

947
00:36:32,253 --> 00:36:33,781
- Oh, my. Still...
- You're wearing a very nice coat.

948
00:36:33,782 --> 00:36:34,782
It's a cashmere coat.

949
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:36,858
- It's a very expensive coat.
- It's a cashmere coat?

950
00:36:36,882 --> 00:36:37,922
Yes.

951
00:36:38,052 --> 00:36:39,052
(Looking here and there)

952
00:36:39,053 --> 00:36:40,592
You're wearing such an amazing coat.

953
00:36:40,622 --> 00:36:42,821
- Really?
- I'm grateful he recognizes it.

954
00:36:42,822 --> 00:36:45,061
Isn't it from PARKLAND?

955
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,342
(Is it the only brand he knows?)

956
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:50,532
(Chuckling)

957
00:36:50,902 --> 00:36:52,201
Right. Take the bags.

958
00:36:52,202 --> 00:36:54,801
- Why didn't you take these?
- Hey.

959
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:56,741
- Give me my handbag.
- Our roles are reversed.

960
00:36:56,742 --> 00:36:58,041
What about that bag?

961
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:59,071
Take it out.

962
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:01,181
- Let's take it just in case.
- Right. Just in case.

963
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:04,042
- Will you eat more food?
- I might. You never know.

964
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:05,212
That's right.

965
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:06,581
(They take her lunch bag too.)

966
00:37:06,582 --> 00:37:09,281
(They enter the SBS building with their hands full.)

967
00:37:09,282 --> 00:37:11,421
We don't need to receive it, do we?

968
00:37:11,422 --> 00:37:12,921
- What do you mean?
- A pass.

969
00:37:12,922 --> 00:37:14,022
Right. We can just go.

970
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:16,192
They'll probably let us go when they see us.

971
00:37:16,592 --> 00:37:18,331
- My, I can't believe this.
- You used to enter without it.

972
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:21,131
- Right. I did back then.
- You're not a radio DJ anymore.

973
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:25,371
(You're not a radio DJ anymore.)

974
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:27,702
- So you're worried...
- I'll be fine. I mean, you guys.

975
00:37:30,202 --> 00:37:32,312
- Oh, you're worried about us?
- Yes.

976
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:34,942
I can enter without a pass.

977
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:37,241
I'm like an honorary DJ, you know.

978
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:39,482
- Hello.
- I see our photos.

979
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:43,421
I should... Oh, my. I should take a photo of it.

980
00:37:43,422 --> 00:37:45,522
(The Grumpy Secretaries can enter as well.)

981
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:46,592
- Please go first.
- Okay.

982
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:48,362
Ladies first.

983
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,292
(Exclaiming)

984
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,932
I haven't been here in a while.

985
00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:58,702
It's been more than a year since the last time I came here.

986
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:04,741
(From the 1st episode on November 15, 1996...)

987
00:38:04,742 --> 00:38:07,212
(to the last episode on June 2, 2024)

988
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:12,082
(She spent time at the radio station every day for 27 years.)

989
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:17,451
- Back then...
- See? My name is right here.

990
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:18,452
Oh, that's right.

991
00:38:18,992 --> 00:38:20,091
She looks much younger in this photo.

992
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,191
(My Star's face takes up a small space in the building.)

993
00:38:22,192 --> 00:38:23,721
Our studio is...

994
00:38:23,722 --> 00:38:25,091
- Where is it?
- Where is it?

995
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:26,591
I see a lot of studios here.

996
00:38:26,592 --> 00:38:28,512
(She walked around here every day for 27 years.)

997
00:38:28,832 --> 00:38:29,832
It feels like home.

998
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,301
(The radio studios feel like home to her.)

999
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:32,572
It always feels like home.

1000
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:37,048
- It feels like home.
- It must be on air right now.

1001
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:39,611
(Even though time has passed, the studios still feel like home.)

1002
00:38:39,612 --> 00:38:40,742
Radio studios...

1003
00:38:42,782 --> 00:38:44,351
- We should wait here.
- Oh, there's a lounge here.

1004
00:38:44,352 --> 00:38:45,382
Yes, it's here.

1005
00:38:45,912 --> 00:38:47,621
We should wait here...

1006
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:49,022
- until they call us.
- Okay.

1007
00:38:49,422 --> 00:38:52,022
- It's inside the building. Indeed.
- It's nice in here.

1008
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:57,762
Do you fix a guest's face in Photoshop?

1009
00:38:58,362 --> 00:38:59,862
- You mean, our show? No.
- Yes.

1010
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:01,772
- I'll fix your face.
- We don't do that.

1011
00:39:03,202 --> 00:39:04,302
I'll do that for you.

1012
00:39:05,032 --> 00:39:07,371
(Kwang Kyu flirts with her whenever he has a chance.)

1013
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:08,742
Stay seated, will you?

1014
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:09,772
(Blowing on his hands)

1015
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:12,602
- I mean, in here...
- That makes his hands look dirty.

1016
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:14,882
- You're scary.
- Right.

1017
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:16,418
It felt like something dirty came out of his mouth...

1018
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:18,911
- when he blew on his hands.
- Hey.

1019
00:39:18,912 --> 00:39:20,882
You brat, how dare you?

1020
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:24,592
Have you finished doing it yet?

1021
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:25,852
Not yet?

1022
00:39:26,152 --> 00:39:27,821
Someone... I think Yeong Cheol is coming.

1023
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:29,382
(They hear a familiar voice from afar.)

1024
00:39:29,862 --> 00:39:31,392
Hasn't Hwa Jeong arrived yet?

1025
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:32,991
- She's here.
- Oh, my.

1026
00:39:32,992 --> 00:39:34,561
- She's here.
- Oh, my. Hello.

1027
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:35,562
(Yeong Cheol, the host of Cheol PM, is here.)

1028
00:39:35,563 --> 00:39:38,332
- Oh, hold on. Hello, Seo Jin.
- Hi.

1029
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,171
- Have you been well?
- Why are you acting like this?

1030
00:39:40,172 --> 00:39:42,201
Stop acting weird in front of the camera.

1031
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:44,542
- I like cameras.
- He acts weird in front of cameras.

1032
00:39:44,642 --> 00:39:47,371
Hello, ma'am. It's so good to see you.

1033
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:48,941
Hello, ma'am.

1034
00:39:48,942 --> 00:39:50,841
It's so good to see you. I should make a deep bow to you.

1035
00:39:50,842 --> 00:39:51,851
- Oh, my.
- Gosh, seriously.

1036
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:52,981
- I should make a deep bow.
- Here he goes again.

1037
00:39:52,982 --> 00:39:54,958
- Oh, my dear Yeong Cheol.
- I should make a deep bow first.

1038
00:39:54,982 --> 00:39:57,382
He exaggerates his gestures and tries hard to be funny.

1039
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:00,692
But I don't find him funny.

1040
00:40:03,522 --> 00:40:04,762
I really like Yeong Cheol.

1041
00:40:05,432 --> 00:40:07,192
He's hilarious when I meet him in real life.

1042
00:40:07,262 --> 00:40:09,332
But whenever there's a camera, he acts that way.

1043
00:40:09,932 --> 00:40:11,092
It makes me feel bad for him.

1044
00:40:11,632 --> 00:40:13,571
"Hello, I'm Lee Seo Jin, the model of White Balloon."

1045
00:40:13,572 --> 00:40:14,748
(He suddenly imitates Seo Jin.)

1046
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:16,932
- It's "Yellow Balloon."
- "What does your father do?"

1047
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:19,342
- Right.
- I imitated both of them.

1048
00:40:19,772 --> 00:40:20,842
He's my secretary.

1049
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:22,782
They're your secretaries.

1050
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:27,188
What has gotten into you? You haven't come to SBS in a while.

1051
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:29,052
You rarely come all the way here.

1052
00:40:29,152 --> 00:40:31,352
- Because it's your show.
- Oh, my.

1053
00:40:31,892 --> 00:40:33,452
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Don't mention it.

1054
00:40:33,552 --> 00:40:36,162
Seo Jin, she's my teacher who taught me how to host a radio show.

1055
00:40:36,762 --> 00:40:38,792
I learned everything about a radio show from her.

1056
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:41,062
Like pretentious gestures...

1057
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,131
(Laughing)

1058
00:40:45,132 --> 00:40:47,178
- What to do in various situations.
- How to deal with situations?

1059
00:40:47,202 --> 00:40:49,842
- How to react?
- That's right.

1060
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:52,242
Also, how to vamp. An unexpected time gap occurs.

1061
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:54,272
She's so good at improvising lines.

1062
00:40:54,612 --> 00:40:55,741
She doesn't like it when that happens.

1063
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:58,781
For example, when the staff asked her to buy time...

1064
00:40:58,782 --> 00:40:59,912
due to a technical issue,

1065
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:01,421
she would be like,

1066
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:02,451
(Imitating Hwa Jeong)

1067
00:41:02,452 --> 00:41:06,022
"Oh, right. It's lunchtime now."

1068
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,892
"I'm craving spicy... For lunch..."

1069
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:12,032
"Do you like jjolmyeon with Cheongyang chili?"

1070
00:41:12,562 --> 00:41:14,642
Including that skill, I learned everything from her.

1071
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:17,001
Sometimes, a radio DJ needs to vamp.

1072
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:19,308
- Like when a phone call...
- She talked about food to vamp.

1073
00:41:19,332 --> 00:41:21,772
- Yes, she talked about food.
- Because she's a food fighter.

1074
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:24,541
How long have you been filming this?

1075
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,542
(How long have you been filming this?)

1076
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:27,072
We? For about four hours.

1077
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:28,411
A piece of advice.

1078
00:41:28,412 --> 00:41:30,882
As for snacks, our star here...

1079
00:41:31,152 --> 00:41:32,252
likes organic food.

1080
00:41:32,882 --> 00:41:35,252
- "Marsh snail?"
- "Organic."

1081
00:41:36,152 --> 00:41:39,022
One of them has a reason for disqualification.

1082
00:41:39,822 --> 00:41:41,521
- What did you say?
- "Organic."

1083
00:41:41,522 --> 00:41:43,222
- What does it mean?
- "Organic."

1084
00:41:43,322 --> 00:41:45,691
O-R-G...

1085
00:41:45,692 --> 00:41:48,131
That's not what he's asking. He doesn't know what it means.

1086
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,832
He doesn't know what "organic" means.

1087
00:41:50,402 --> 00:41:51,531
Or...

1088
00:41:51,532 --> 00:41:52,572
Organic.

1089
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:55,341
- Organic.
- Oh, that? Gosh. Come on.

1090
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:57,171
You should pronounce it "ogahnik," not like "orgaenik."

1091
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:58,172
Gosh, seriously.

1092
00:41:58,372 --> 00:42:00,112
- Yes, that's how we pronounce it.
- Right.

1093
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:02,111
Was it a joke?

1094
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:05,081
No. Koreans pronounce it "ogahnik."

1095
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:07,412
But since Yeong Cheol took classes at an English academy,

1096
00:42:07,752 --> 00:42:09,251
he tried to say it like a native speaker.

1097
00:42:09,252 --> 00:42:10,421
- Like a native speaker?
- That's why he sounded like that.

1098
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:11,821
- He tried to sound like a native.
- "Organic."

1099
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:13,591
- Oh, is that so?
- The way native speakers say it.

1100
00:42:13,592 --> 00:42:15,091
Then why do we pronounce it "ogahnik?"

1101
00:42:15,092 --> 00:42:16,822
Koreans do so.

1102
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,761
(Kwang Kyu isn't good at native pronunciation.)

1103
00:42:19,762 --> 00:42:22,861
One more thing. Did she arrive on time?

1104
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:24,731
- Did she arrive on time?
- I arrived early.

1105
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:26,171
- Really?
- Is she not punctual?

1106
00:42:26,172 --> 00:42:27,401
You have changed?

1107
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:29,171
Exactly. I waited for them earlier.

1108
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:31,371
She was so bold that even before a live broadcast...

1109
00:42:31,372 --> 00:42:34,012
She'd get in the elevator at 11:59am.

1110
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:36,381
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

1111
00:42:36,382 --> 00:42:39,151
She sounded so elegant and funny at the same time.

1112
00:42:39,152 --> 00:42:40,852
"Hey, Yeong Cheol." She never runs.

1113
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:43,472
I said to hurry up. Then she'd say, "Right. Hold the elevator."

1114
00:42:44,082 --> 00:42:45,851
What does she mean I should hold the elevator?

1115
00:42:45,852 --> 00:42:47,322
She was supposed to hurry up.

1116
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:49,861
- She never ran. Not even once.
- Really?

1117
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:51,792
It's my wish to see her jog.

1118
00:42:52,962 --> 00:42:56,331
(My Star is relaxed in any situations.)

1119
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:58,701
- We're all set now. Can we start?
- Yes.

1120
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:01,371
- Okay.
- The director is looking for you.

1121
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:02,401
(They'll head to the studio with the fried squid she bought.)

1122
00:43:02,402 --> 00:43:04,371
- Hwa Jeong bought this.
- I bought some snacks.

1123
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:07,512
It's fried squid that tastes amazing.

1124
00:43:07,712 --> 00:43:10,511
- "Fried squid."
- Yes, really. It's really good.

1125
00:43:10,512 --> 00:43:11,712
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

1126
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:14,882
- Hello.
- Hi.

1127
00:43:15,252 --> 00:43:16,821
- Hello.
- Hello.

1128
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:19,492
(The staff welcome the Radio Queen with a big smile.)

1129
00:43:19,552 --> 00:43:22,421
(Park Hyeong Joo, the director of "Choi Hwa Jeong's Power Time")

1130
00:43:22,422 --> 00:43:23,961
(Kim Jong Seon, the former writer of "Choi Hwa Jeong's Power Time,")

1131
00:43:23,962 --> 00:43:25,461
(the current writer of "Kim Yeong Cheol's Power FM")

1132
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:27,291
- You're on this team? Right.
- Yes.

1133
00:43:27,292 --> 00:43:28,402
- Exactly.
- Hello.

1134
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:30,361
(The recording booth remains the same.)

1135
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:32,031
- We're her managers.
- That's right.

1136
00:43:32,032 --> 00:43:33,032
(The recording booth remains the same.)

1137
00:43:33,033 --> 00:43:34,602
(Guys, Hwa Jeong is here.)

1138
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,911
(How do you feel about coming back here after a long time?)

1139
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:40,872
It's still the source of my energy and inspiration for life.

1140
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:42,941
It was really good to be back at the studio.

1141
00:43:42,942 --> 00:43:44,881
(My Star visits her hometown, and it gives her so much energy.)

1142
00:43:44,882 --> 00:43:45,911
- Don't forget about the snacks.
- Hello.

1143
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:47,921
Oh, right. I bought this for you guys.

1144
00:43:47,922 --> 00:43:49,182
- For you to eat.
- Thank you.

1145
00:43:49,282 --> 00:43:50,981
- This is a very famous...
- Thank you.

1146
00:43:50,982 --> 00:43:52,992
Original fried squid near Ewha Womans University.

1147
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:56,062
- From the tteokbokki place.
- Yes. The tteokbokki place.

1148
00:43:56,162 --> 00:43:59,732
Before going to the radio show, I remembered I really liked...

1149
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,232
people who bring delicious food to the recording.

1150
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:04,871
So I thought I should take some good food.

1151
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:07,272
I really like those fried squids.

1152
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:09,342
Tteokbokki and fried squid.

1153
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:14,412
(She visits her family with heavy hands.)

1154
00:44:14,842 --> 00:44:18,582
(She enters the radio booth for the first time in a while.)

1155
00:44:19,252 --> 00:44:21,081
- It's my first time seeing...
- You can sit here.

1156
00:44:21,082 --> 00:44:22,451
- Come in.
- Sit here.

1157
00:44:22,452 --> 00:44:24,372
- The first time...
- You have to look that way.

1158
00:44:24,482 --> 00:44:26,191
Yes. He worked on "Ten of Bae Sung Jae."

1159
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:28,121
Yes. I see.

1160
00:44:28,122 --> 00:44:29,761
- We haven't met before, right?
- Right.

1161
00:44:29,762 --> 00:44:30,791
She's the grand senior.

1162
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:33,062
She worked at SBS for 30 years.

1163
00:44:33,392 --> 00:44:34,831
- It's his seventh year.
- I joined...

1164
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:36,831
I see.

1165
00:44:36,832 --> 00:44:38,071
(While she greets a radio junior from ages ago, )

1166
00:44:38,072 --> 00:44:40,472
(Grumpy Secretary enters the booth.)

1167
00:44:40,502 --> 00:44:42,472
You came here as a guest today.

1168
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:45,372
(Where should I be?)

1169
00:44:45,772 --> 00:44:47,572
Should we sit in the corner?

1170
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:49,442
- You can be sitting.
- Yes.

1171
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:52,111
Please look into the thing I told you about.

1172
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,312
Okay. We'll sit here only through the beginning.

1173
00:44:54,352 --> 00:44:55,481
Please check on it.

1174
00:44:55,482 --> 00:44:56,482
Okay!

1175
00:44:56,922 --> 00:44:59,292
Hello. I'm White Balloon Lee Seo Jin.

1176
00:44:59,752 --> 00:45:02,622
(Watching the Queen of Radio from the front row)

1177
00:45:03,062 --> 00:45:07,161
(Meanwhile, My Star who is about to have a radio comeback)

1178
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,632
- There's no sound here, - Right. Hold on.

1179
00:45:09,732 --> 00:45:11,161
So I can't tell if it's loud or not.

1180
00:45:11,162 --> 00:45:12,331
- Are you fine with the volume?
- Yes.

1181
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:14,271
- You can adjust it here.
- Okay.

1182
00:45:14,272 --> 00:45:16,071
- Should I reduce it a little?
- It's fine.

1183
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:17,141
- Then I'll leave it like this.
- Yes.

1184
00:45:17,142 --> 00:45:19,171
- Okay.
- You can do it like that.

1185
00:45:19,172 --> 00:45:21,341
You have to introduce the messages in between.

1186
00:45:21,342 --> 00:45:22,881
You should do it quickly in three seconds.

1187
00:45:22,882 --> 00:45:24,882
- This is difficult.
- Hello.

1188
00:45:25,012 --> 00:45:27,452
(She says it's difficult but she's smiling.)

1189
00:45:28,182 --> 00:45:33,522
(Finally, she greets her old friend, mic.)

1190
00:45:34,052 --> 00:45:35,222
Let's just do it.

1191
00:45:35,922 --> 00:45:38,562
Nice. I'm happy you said you were coming.

1192
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:42,061
(My Star silently and calmly finishes her preparations.)

1193
00:45:42,062 --> 00:45:43,831
- Shall we start?
- Yes. Let's start.

1194
00:45:43,832 --> 00:45:44,872
- Okay.
- Yes.

1195
00:45:45,272 --> 00:45:48,072
(Radio recording starts.)

1196
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,301
(Cheol PM)

1197
00:45:51,302 --> 00:45:52,472
(Kim Yeong Cheol's Power FM)

1198
00:45:52,672 --> 00:45:54,742
It's Cheol PM at 7am I love.

1199
00:45:57,682 --> 00:46:00,712
Kim Yeong Cheol's Power FM on Saturday. This is part three.

1200
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:05,352
(Finally, My Star, the radio queen, makes a comeback.)

1201
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:07,091
The great special guest...

1202
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:09,492
of "It's My Pick, Number Seven."

1203
00:46:09,522 --> 00:46:12,431
She's my lifelong teacher and mentor.

1204
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:14,432
My radio teacher and life mentor.

1205
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:17,701
It would be better if she introduced herself.

1206
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:19,072
Could you greet the listeners?

1207
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:21,102
Hello. It's Choi Hwa Jeong.

1208
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:22,901
Her signature greeting.

1209
00:46:22,902 --> 00:46:24,472
Hello. It's Choi Hwa Jeong.

1210
00:46:25,112 --> 00:46:26,542
Her signature greeting.

1211
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:30,541
Those 11 syllables.

1212
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:33,612
(Excitement alert)

1213
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:36,222
(She feels embarrassed from doing again after so long.)

1214
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:37,882
That signature greeting.

1215
00:46:38,622 --> 00:46:40,398
Don't you feel awkward when you say, "I'm Choi Hwa Jeong?"

1216
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,491
I do. I should say "hello" first.

1217
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:44,321
- Yes. "Hello. It's Choi Hwa Jeong."
- Right.

1218
00:46:44,322 --> 00:46:47,331
What brings you to Cheol PM?

1219
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:49,532
I'm recording...

1220
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:52,301
My Grumpy Secretary.

1221
00:46:52,302 --> 00:46:53,771
Are you here to record that?

1222
00:46:53,772 --> 00:46:55,841
Yes. No, actually,

1223
00:46:55,842 --> 00:46:59,142
I was supposed to come to your radio show,

1224
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:01,481
and they came with me.

1225
00:47:01,482 --> 00:47:04,681
Your schedule happened to be like that today.

1226
00:47:04,682 --> 00:47:05,911
(She makes a public shout-out to My Grumpy Secretary.)

1227
00:47:05,912 --> 00:47:08,222
What do you think? Do you get along?

1228
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:11,451
- There are some frustrating points.
- Yes.

1229
00:47:11,452 --> 00:47:14,691
But there also are times when I'm carefully looked after.

1230
00:47:14,692 --> 00:47:16,092
Who are you more comfortable with?

1231
00:47:16,522 --> 00:47:18,061
I'm comfortable with both of them.

1232
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:20,061
One person doesn't seem to listen to you so well.

1233
00:47:20,062 --> 00:47:21,131
I won't say who.

1234
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:23,602
And the other person doesn't seem to understand you.

1235
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,212
And the other person doesn't seem to understand you.

1236
00:47:26,932 --> 00:47:28,241
I didn't say who.

1237
00:47:28,242 --> 00:47:30,301
When I give instructions to one of them,

1238
00:47:30,302 --> 00:47:32,042
he subcontracts it out again.

1239
00:47:32,842 --> 00:47:35,581
(It's a rather unusual subcontracting chain.)

1240
00:47:35,582 --> 00:47:36,681
They...

1241
00:47:36,682 --> 00:47:39,081
They subcontract work to each other.

1242
00:47:39,082 --> 00:47:40,111
To each other.

1243
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:42,452
- That's what they do there.
- Yes.

1244
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:45,251
The two of them are at the studio.

1245
00:47:45,252 --> 00:47:48,622
Why don't Lee Seo Jin and Kim Kwang Kyu join for a bit...

1246
00:47:48,892 --> 00:47:50,621
- and let us hear their voices?
- Let us hear your voices.

1247
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:53,032
- Secretaries.
- Lee Seo Jin.

1248
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:54,592
Hello.

1249
00:47:54,932 --> 00:47:57,002
I'm Lee Seo Jin, Choi Hwa Jeong's manager.

1250
00:47:57,302 --> 00:47:58,932
- Nice to meet you.
- Kwang Kyu as well.

1251
00:47:59,532 --> 00:48:00,632
Hello.

1252
00:48:01,302 --> 00:48:04,871
I'm Kim Kwang Kyu, Choi Hwa Jeong's manager number two.

1253
00:48:04,872 --> 00:48:06,441
What does your dad do for a living?

1254
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:08,412
What does your dad do for a living?

1255
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:10,912
(Good job, Baby.)

1256
00:48:11,382 --> 00:48:12,852
Today's topic is...

1257
00:48:12,912 --> 00:48:16,282
the perfect food combination every Korean loves,

1258
00:48:16,482 --> 00:48:18,491
It's My Pick, Number Seven.

1259
00:48:18,492 --> 00:48:20,491
The perfect food combination every Korean loves,

1260
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:21,721
It's My Pick, Number Seven.

1261
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:23,122
Please give us the first song.

1262
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:28,602
(Yum yum, I'll eat all your memories)

1263
00:48:28,932 --> 00:48:32,572
(The Radio Queen nails the introduction of the first song.)

1264
00:48:33,132 --> 00:48:35,941
(That's Choi Hwa Jeong.)

1265
00:48:35,942 --> 00:48:38,812
- I'll eat all your memories - I'll eat all your memories

1266
00:48:38,842 --> 00:48:41,981
(One man can't adapt to the new radio world.)

1267
00:48:41,982 --> 00:48:44,782
(Two men can't adapt to the new radio world.)

1268
00:48:44,882 --> 00:48:47,912
I'll eat all your smiles

1269
00:48:48,152 --> 00:48:49,422
Isn't she so good?

1270
00:48:49,622 --> 00:48:51,622
- It's Lee Jin Ah's...
- Do you know this song?

1271
00:48:51,992 --> 00:48:53,851
- Yes.
- Of course.

1272
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:55,192
You're a DJ.

1273
00:48:55,392 --> 00:48:57,491
The combination of Choi Hwa Jeong and me.

1274
00:48:57,492 --> 00:49:00,032
What more can I say?

1275
00:49:00,332 --> 00:49:01,631
The first song. Let's read it.

1276
00:49:01,632 --> 00:49:03,661
The first song was "Yum Yum Yum" by Lee Jin Ah.

1277
00:49:03,662 --> 00:49:05,901
Last weekend, I made kimchi...

1278
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:08,032
with my mother and wife with all my energy.

1279
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:10,302
It was really tough when making the kimchi,

1280
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:13,012
but the suyuk...

1281
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:15,382
and oyster bossam we ate after we finished...

1282
00:49:15,642 --> 00:49:17,841
became both the reward for all the work...

1283
00:49:17,842 --> 00:49:19,412
and a real comfort.

1284
00:49:20,152 --> 00:49:22,822
- This is why we make kimchi.
- That's right.

1285
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:25,592
The suyuk, oyster,

1286
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:28,821
rolled with the napa cabbage...

1287
00:49:28,822 --> 00:49:30,361
- that was just salted.
- Right.

1288
00:49:30,362 --> 00:49:31,991
You shouldn't eat it with your hands.

1289
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:34,361
- Open your mouth.
- That's right.

1290
00:49:34,362 --> 00:49:36,901
"Go to your room now. You're in the way."

1291
00:49:36,902 --> 00:49:38,601
- Right.
- That's what they say.

1292
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:39,971
"You're in the way, Yeong Cheol."

1293
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:41,901
- Isn't that right?
- Right. "You're in the way."

1294
00:49:41,902 --> 00:49:44,041
From the way you say it,

1295
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:45,711
it's almost like you made kimchi yesterday.

1296
00:49:45,712 --> 00:49:47,141
I buy kimchi these days.

1297
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:48,281
You do.

1298
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:49,581
When we were young...

1299
00:49:49,582 --> 00:49:52,782
I'm a little claustrophobic...

1300
00:49:52,982 --> 00:49:54,881
inside the radio booth.

1301
00:49:54,882 --> 00:49:55,952
(It's not a food coma.)

1302
00:49:56,182 --> 00:49:57,682
When I go to enclosed spaces,

1303
00:49:57,952 --> 00:49:59,951
like studio recordings,

1304
00:49:59,952 --> 00:50:01,522
I yawn like 100 times.

1305
00:50:02,062 --> 00:50:03,362
One hundred times. I'm serious.

1306
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:08,092
(Yawning)

1307
00:50:09,362 --> 00:50:14,072
(The baby trapped in an enclosed space lets out a yawn of terror.)

1308
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:17,772
The container looks like this.

1309
00:50:18,512 --> 00:50:20,812
I just remembered.

1310
00:50:21,472 --> 00:50:23,242
- Kim Kwang Kyu?
- Yes?

1311
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,911
- Kim Kwang Kyu?
- Yes?

1312
00:50:24,912 --> 00:50:26,812
- I'll give you a quiz.
- Okay.

1313
00:50:27,352 --> 00:50:29,322
What's the fruit that Beethoven likes most?

1314
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,721
Tomato?

1315
00:50:31,722 --> 00:50:34,792
Bananana

1316
00:50:35,322 --> 00:50:38,562
Bananana

1317
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:42,932
(The terror brought on by Kwang Kyu's drowsiness)

1318
00:50:43,202 --> 00:50:45,931
But for the first time...

1319
00:50:45,932 --> 00:50:47,172
I really like Yeong Cheol.

1320
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,402
He gets about three times more passionate when there's a camera.

1321
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:53,412
It drove me crazy. It was so annoying.

1322
00:50:58,512 --> 00:51:03,552
(Passion on another level)

1323
00:51:04,682 --> 00:51:06,851
The perfect food combination every Korean loves,

1324
00:51:06,852 --> 00:51:08,421
It's My Pick, Number Seven.

1325
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:09,722
Next on the chart.

1326
00:51:12,432 --> 00:51:17,702
(His ears perk up at a somehow familiar song.)

1327
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:22,572
This is "Sexy Food" by HAMBUGGY. This is Lee Su Ji, right?

1328
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:25,172
It's Lee Su Ji's song. Did you know that?

1329
00:51:26,112 --> 00:51:27,112
Did you...

1330
00:51:27,572 --> 00:51:29,781
Did Lee Seo Jin know that this was Lee Su Ji's song?

1331
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:31,862
- It's my 1st time hearing it.
- It's your 1st time?

1332
00:51:32,652 --> 00:51:34,211
- It's my 1st time hearing it.
- It's your 1st time?

1333
00:51:34,212 --> 00:51:35,481
(The eyes of someone who's listened to it for the first time)

1334
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:37,028
What's the most recent song you've heard?

1335
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:38,952
(It's your first time hearing it?)

1336
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:40,592
(Wow, sexy food)

1337
00:51:40,892 --> 00:51:42,792
(Sexy food)

1338
00:51:42,922 --> 00:51:45,932
(Have you already forgotten it?)

1339
00:51:46,192 --> 00:51:50,162
(We're 50-year-old newborns. I'm sorry HAMBUGGY.)

1340
00:51:51,162 --> 00:51:53,131
Tteokbokki is always in the list...

1341
00:51:53,132 --> 00:51:54,332
- of sexy foods.
- Tteokbokki.

1342
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:56,542
We had tteokbokki.

1343
00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:59,941
I asked, "Tteok-fri-sun, shall we?" My wife gave me a thumbs-up.

1344
00:51:59,942 --> 00:52:01,541
We enjoyed it so much.

1345
00:52:01,542 --> 00:52:02,782
Tteok-fri-sun.

1346
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:04,842
- Did you have tteokbokki today?
- Yes.

1347
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:06,772
Do you like rice cakes or wheat cakes?

1348
00:52:06,912 --> 00:52:09,181
I like wheat cakes. Wheat cakes are nice too.

1349
00:52:09,182 --> 00:52:11,121
I used to like rice cakes before,

1350
00:52:11,122 --> 00:52:12,451
but I like wheat cakes now.

1351
00:52:12,452 --> 00:52:14,592
- No one would hate tteokbokki.
- Right.

1352
00:52:14,622 --> 00:52:16,562
Gochujang stew with cucumber.

1353
00:52:17,622 --> 00:52:19,331
When it comes to food,

1354
00:52:19,332 --> 00:52:21,361
you shouldn't have prejudices...

1355
00:52:21,362 --> 00:52:22,901
to have a broader view.

1356
00:52:22,902 --> 00:52:25,331
When I make ramyeon, I add milk.

1357
00:52:25,332 --> 00:52:27,092
- It's tasty.
- I heard you don't get puffy.

1358
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:29,118
If you put a little bit of soy sauce on pudding,

1359
00:52:29,142 --> 00:52:30,901
- Yes.
- it's a bit like sea urchin roe.

1360
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,571
Even for pot rice,

1361
00:52:32,572 --> 00:52:34,741
I like tomato juice...

1362
00:52:34,742 --> 00:52:37,841
There's tomato juice made...

1363
00:52:37,842 --> 00:52:39,382
using the NFC method.

1364
00:52:40,082 --> 00:52:43,122
They're both so good.

1365
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:48,861
No. 2814 says, "If it's tasty, it has 0 calories."

1366
00:52:48,862 --> 00:52:50,222
Please say it the original way.

1367
00:52:50,322 --> 00:52:52,332
If it's tasty, it has zero calories.

1368
00:52:52,732 --> 00:52:54,931
"I really like Hwa Jeong's famous sayings."

1369
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:56,601
- That's what she sent.
- Thank you.

1370
00:52:56,602 --> 00:52:58,332
- Let's do it now.
- Okay.

1371
00:52:58,932 --> 00:53:00,901
- You can do this again.
- Okay.

1372
00:53:00,902 --> 00:53:03,341
We've done a radio segment together again...

1373
00:53:03,342 --> 00:53:05,441
after a while.

1374
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:07,372
How does it feel to be here again?

1375
00:53:07,412 --> 00:53:09,181
- It brings back old memories.
- Yes.

1376
00:53:09,182 --> 00:53:12,412
It's been a short while, but it feels like I've come to the past.

1377
00:53:12,612 --> 00:53:13,952
- Really?
- Yes.

1378
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:15,452
Twenty-nine years?

1379
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:16,722
Twenty-seven years.

1380
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:18,852
What do I know?

1381
00:53:20,152 --> 00:53:21,192
- Really.
- Yes.

1382
00:53:22,622 --> 00:53:26,592
(Hoping My Star's bright voice, heard again after so long, )

1383
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:30,462
(will give many people starting a new morning...)

1384
00:53:30,962 --> 00:53:32,501
(the strength to get through the day with a smile)

1385
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:35,971
- I hope you don't think it's real.
- They won't.

1386
00:53:35,972 --> 00:53:37,701
- We...
- It also feels new...

1387
00:53:37,702 --> 00:53:40,511
to be on Kim Yeong Cheol's Power FM...

1388
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:42,412
on a weekend.

1389
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:44,942
A DJ...

1390
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:48,582
has to be good at empathizing.

1391
00:53:48,682 --> 00:53:49,682
Right.

1392
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:53,151
I can't do that because I don't have empathizing skills.

1393
00:53:53,152 --> 00:53:54,522
(I can't do it like My Star.)

1394
00:53:54,552 --> 00:53:55,621
Goodness.

1395
00:53:55,622 --> 00:53:56,961
My sister can have fun.

1396
00:53:56,962 --> 00:53:58,191
(Goodness. My sister can have fun.)

1397
00:53:58,192 --> 00:53:59,432
That's what I thought.

1398
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:02,931
We'll say goodbye and finish.

1399
00:54:02,932 --> 00:54:04,361
I hope you had a good time today.

1400
00:54:04,362 --> 00:54:05,471
I really had fun.

1401
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:08,102
Let's meet again at Cheol PM.

1402
00:54:08,132 --> 00:54:10,471
- Yeong Cheol...
- And Hwa Jeong...

1403
00:54:10,472 --> 00:54:12,942
- will shut up now!
- will shut up now!

1404
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:15,642
Okay.

1405
00:54:15,812 --> 00:54:18,241
- Well done.
- Well done.

1406
00:54:18,242 --> 00:54:20,082
(The Radio Queen's happy homecoming day ends.)

1407
00:54:20,352 --> 00:54:22,121
- Did you book it?
- Pardon?

1408
00:54:22,122 --> 00:54:23,221
Did you book it?

1409
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:24,821
- It takes 20 minutes.
- From here?

1410
00:54:24,822 --> 00:54:27,552
- It's in Mangwon-dong.
- Really?

1411
00:54:28,452 --> 00:54:30,561
(Right!)

1412
00:54:30,562 --> 00:54:31,692
Let's...

1413
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:33,432
do a tarot reading today.

1414
00:54:33,862 --> 00:54:36,031
- Tarot reading?
- Look it up.

1415
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:37,401
I really...

1416
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:40,371
I can't really ask my manager to do this.

1417
00:54:40,372 --> 00:54:42,742
But I can ask my secretary to do it.

1418
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:45,171
Aren't secretaries closer?

1419
00:54:45,172 --> 00:54:46,712
Aren't you closer?

1420
00:54:46,942 --> 00:54:48,341
- We are.
- Right?

1421
00:54:48,342 --> 00:54:50,511
- They also take care...
- Right?

1422
00:54:50,512 --> 00:54:52,082
Of your private life.

1423
00:54:52,382 --> 00:54:54,451
- What do you want to do know?
- I...

1424
00:54:54,452 --> 00:54:56,721
I never imagined...

1425
00:54:56,722 --> 00:54:57,981
my YouTube channel would do so well.

1426
00:54:57,982 --> 00:54:59,092
Me neither.

1427
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:02,021
So...

1428
00:55:02,022 --> 00:55:03,791
- "Me neither?"
- You normally...

1429
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:05,631
Are you saying you didn't think her channel would do well?

1430
00:55:05,632 --> 00:55:07,962
I didn't think it would do so well, to be honest.

1431
00:55:08,232 --> 00:55:10,901
You don't need to be honest in such moments.

1432
00:55:10,902 --> 00:55:12,972
- Is that so?
- Goodness.

1433
00:55:13,232 --> 00:55:14,301
I mean...

1434
00:55:14,302 --> 00:55:15,472
- All right.
- So I...

1435
00:55:16,072 --> 00:55:18,971
I asked if I should start a YouTube channel.

1436
00:55:18,972 --> 00:55:21,072
I flipped the cards with that question in mind.

1437
00:55:21,142 --> 00:55:22,841
I flipped the cards.

1438
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:23,912
(He's curious.)

1439
00:55:24,082 --> 00:55:26,052
I was told it would do really well.

1440
00:55:26,282 --> 00:55:28,151
I was going to get comforted...

1441
00:55:28,152 --> 00:55:30,582
and healed through it.

1442
00:55:31,322 --> 00:55:35,051
There are many warm comments on YouTube.

1443
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:36,591
- Really?
- Like,

1444
00:55:36,592 --> 00:55:38,562
"I really like you, Hwa Jeong."

1445
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:40,662
There are many comments like that.

1446
00:55:40,862 --> 00:55:42,061
I guess that's why that came about.

1447
00:55:42,062 --> 00:55:43,622
The cards said it was going to heal me.

1448
00:55:43,662 --> 00:55:46,871
I didn't know it would do so well,

1449
00:55:46,872 --> 00:55:48,671
but it turned out really well...

1450
00:55:48,672 --> 00:55:50,172
if I think about it now.

1451
00:55:50,302 --> 00:55:53,542
There's no need to check the saju.

1452
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:56,012
I just want to know about my near future.

1453
00:55:56,212 --> 00:55:57,581
It would be nice to get an idea...

1454
00:55:57,582 --> 00:55:59,482
through a tarot reading.

1455
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:02,252
There were many tarot reading places.

1456
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:04,922
- I looked it up earlier.
- There are many places.

1457
00:56:04,952 --> 00:56:06,291
There are many tarot reading places.

1458
00:56:06,292 --> 00:56:08,121
There were many near Hapjeong Station and Hongik University.

1459
00:56:08,122 --> 00:56:10,092
- You mentioned it earlier.
- Hongik University.

1460
00:56:10,422 --> 00:56:12,862
I hope we find a good place.

1461
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:14,491
Are they good?

1462
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:15,902
We'll know when we get there.

1463
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:17,778
- You've not been to the place?
- We haven't.

1464
00:56:17,802 --> 00:56:18,931
It's here.

1465
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:20,631
- Let's go inside.
- Hello.

1466
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:22,572
Hello.

1467
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:25,441
(Looking around)

1468
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:27,112
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1469
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,642
The atmosphere is so mysterious.

1470
00:56:30,042 --> 00:56:31,412
Nice to meet you.

1471
00:56:32,582 --> 00:56:34,581
It's so mysterious.

1472
00:56:34,582 --> 00:56:36,652
(A tarot shop with a mystical vibe)

1473
00:56:36,752 --> 00:56:40,251
It looks like a serious place.

1474
00:56:40,252 --> 00:56:41,421
(What will the tarot cards reveal about My Star's future?)

1475
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:43,421
- There's an energy.
- Thank you.

1476
00:56:43,422 --> 00:56:44,561
You found the right place.

1477
00:56:44,562 --> 00:56:46,832
- Nice to meet you. Hello.
- Hello.

1478
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:48,662
You should also get your future read, Baby.

1479
00:56:49,062 --> 00:56:50,962
Do you usually get tarot readings?

1480
00:56:51,002 --> 00:56:52,631
- I often do.
- I see.

1481
00:56:52,632 --> 00:56:54,001
I was happy because...

1482
00:56:54,002 --> 00:56:55,802
- they really turned out to be true.
- Right.

1483
00:56:55,842 --> 00:56:57,441
But my secretary...

1484
00:56:57,442 --> 00:56:58,541
- is skeptical.
- Does he not like it?

1485
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,612
- He doesn't.
- I've never had a tarot reading.

1486
00:57:00,812 --> 00:57:01,971
But...

1487
00:57:01,972 --> 00:57:03,981
I don't think you'd ever do it again...

1488
00:57:03,982 --> 00:57:06,451
- when the readings are bad today.
- But...

1489
00:57:06,452 --> 00:57:07,881
That's possible as well.

1490
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,752
It would be nice if you enjoyed it casually.

1491
00:57:10,022 --> 00:57:11,381
How are you doing today?

1492
00:57:11,382 --> 00:57:14,422
On a scale of 1 to 10, what's your satisfaction in life?

1493
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:17,522
I don't have any regrets.

1494
00:57:17,622 --> 00:57:18,731
It's just nice.

1495
00:57:18,732 --> 00:57:20,591
It's...

1496
00:57:20,592 --> 00:57:22,831
It's not nice because everything is working out well.

1497
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:25,901
- I think it's a pretty good life.
- Right.

1498
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:27,271
Right.

1499
00:57:27,272 --> 00:57:29,371
What would you rate it out of ten?

1500
00:57:29,372 --> 00:57:31,171
- Around eight.
- Eight.

1501
00:57:31,172 --> 00:57:33,912
How do you think you can add the remaining two points?

1502
00:57:34,342 --> 00:57:36,141
I don't necessarily want to add them.

1503
00:57:36,142 --> 00:57:37,311
For example,

1504
00:57:37,312 --> 00:57:39,781
if I can fill them,

1505
00:57:39,782 --> 00:57:41,512
it would be with marriage...

1506
00:57:41,612 --> 00:57:43,282
or family. But...

1507
00:57:44,052 --> 00:57:47,351
- I have no regrets about that.
- You don't. Then,

1508
00:57:47,352 --> 00:57:49,261
if you had to choose one in life,

1509
00:57:49,262 --> 00:57:52,161
would it be money, fame, or your dreams?

1510
00:57:52,162 --> 00:57:53,361
This is a very difficult question.

1511
00:57:53,362 --> 00:57:55,092
- Money, fame, and dreams?
- Money, fame...

1512
00:57:55,362 --> 00:57:56,801
(Thinking)

1513
00:57:56,802 --> 00:57:58,562
Money is something that just follows.

1514
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:00,332
It's a bit...

1515
00:58:00,572 --> 00:58:01,801
Be honest.

1516
00:58:01,802 --> 00:58:02,871
Say it's money.

1517
00:58:02,872 --> 00:58:04,241
No.

1518
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:05,441
- Listen.
- That may not be her answer.

1519
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:06,712
There are some people...

1520
00:58:07,412 --> 00:58:10,481
- who always have men.
- Right.

1521
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:13,552
I've never really been without money in my life.

1522
00:58:13,712 --> 00:58:16,351
But I'm not someone who's obsessed...

1523
00:58:16,352 --> 00:58:17,751
- You're not.
- with money.

1524
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:19,751
It just follows me.

1525
00:58:19,752 --> 00:58:21,351
I'd choose fame...

1526
00:58:21,352 --> 00:58:23,422
- over money.
- Fame?

1527
00:58:23,662 --> 00:58:26,191
I want to be a nice person.

1528
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:27,531
- Fame?
- Yes.

1529
00:58:27,532 --> 00:58:29,662
If you have a question,

1530
00:58:29,762 --> 00:58:32,271
I can help you with that.

1531
00:58:32,272 --> 00:58:35,671
I can also check how your life is now...

1532
00:58:35,672 --> 00:58:36,941
or if you're living a good life.

1533
00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:38,671
- Right.
- You can check that.

1534
00:58:38,672 --> 00:58:41,312
It would be nice if you asked casually.

1535
00:58:41,942 --> 00:58:43,481
I'm curious...

1536
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:47,182
if my YouTube channel will do well next year.

1537
00:58:47,452 --> 00:58:49,151
I'm also holding...

1538
00:58:49,152 --> 00:58:50,822
- some losing things.
- I see.

1539
00:58:50,922 --> 00:58:52,852
I'm also holding some losing things.

1540
00:58:53,092 --> 00:58:54,792
- Financially?
- Yes.

1541
00:58:56,422 --> 00:58:59,091
(My Star just chose fame over money.)

1542
00:58:59,092 --> 00:59:01,192
- Some losing things.
- I see.

1543
00:59:01,232 --> 00:59:02,901
- Financially?
- Yes.

1544
00:59:02,902 --> 00:59:04,501
- In terms of investment?
- Yes.

1545
00:59:04,502 --> 00:59:05,871
I'm curious if it will do well.

1546
00:59:05,872 --> 00:59:07,531
- Let's see.
- Okay.

1547
00:59:07,532 --> 00:59:10,142
Give me ten cards with the hand you don't use often.

1548
00:59:10,742 --> 00:59:14,272
(How will My Star do in 2026?)

1549
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,542
Why am I getting nervous over something like this?

1550
00:59:19,652 --> 00:59:21,582
I always...

1551
00:59:21,912 --> 00:59:23,722
- This is also mine.
- Okay.

1552
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,551
And...

1553
00:59:25,552 --> 00:59:27,521
I'm also holding some losing things.

1554
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,042
(I'm also holding some losing things.)

1555
00:59:29,462 --> 00:59:30,722
- That's enough.
- Yes.

1556
00:59:31,422 --> 00:59:34,492
(I'm curious if it will do well.)

1557
00:59:35,432 --> 00:59:36,961
(She chose the cards of her destiny.)

1558
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:39,631
What will your future be?

1559
00:59:39,632 --> 00:59:41,802
(She's nervous.)

1560
00:59:42,072 --> 00:59:44,702
What will your future be?

1561
00:59:45,102 --> 00:59:46,111
First of all,

1562
00:59:46,112 --> 00:59:48,981
in terms of your life,

1563
00:59:48,982 --> 00:59:51,581
next year is going to be your lucky year.

1564
00:59:51,582 --> 00:59:53,151
(2026 is going to be your lucky year.)

1565
00:59:53,152 --> 00:59:54,911
- Really?
- So...

1566
00:59:54,912 --> 00:59:56,821
I still have another lucky year.

1567
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:58,551
(I still have another lucky year.)

1568
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:01,721
Your luck already started in October, 2025.

1569
01:00:01,722 --> 01:00:03,062
That's right.

1570
01:00:03,122 --> 01:00:04,392
This is crazy.

1571
01:00:04,662 --> 01:00:06,962
I'd recommend making a plan accordingly.

1572
01:00:07,662 --> 01:00:09,502
When I look at the cards,

1573
01:00:09,532 --> 01:00:13,502
this is the card out of the 78 cards used for congratulating.

1574
01:00:13,872 --> 01:00:16,942
This is the card out of the 78 cards used for congratulating.

1575
01:00:17,342 --> 01:00:20,341
I think your great luck has something to do with this.

1576
01:00:20,342 --> 01:00:21,542
- Hold on.
- Yes.

1577
01:00:21,612 --> 01:00:23,641
Secretary. When such a good thing is happening,

1578
01:00:23,642 --> 01:00:25,612
- you should smile.
- Okay.

1579
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:27,481
I feel very uncomfortable.

1580
01:00:27,482 --> 01:00:28,688
(He quickly releases his dimples.)

1581
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:29,781
It's a very good card.

1582
01:00:29,782 --> 01:00:30,982
- Really?
- Right.

1583
01:00:31,722 --> 01:00:33,552
I was very embarrassed. At such moments,

1584
01:00:33,652 --> 01:00:35,421
he should be like this.

1585
01:00:35,422 --> 01:00:36,691
"That's right."

1586
01:00:36,692 --> 01:00:38,561
He should do that.

1587
01:00:38,562 --> 01:00:39,908
(My Star wants him to give reactions.)

1588
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:41,592
I feel very uncomfortable.

1589
01:00:41,992 --> 01:00:43,701
It's a very good card.

1590
01:00:43,702 --> 01:00:44,962
- Really?
- Right.

1591
01:00:45,362 --> 01:00:46,702
Congratulations.

1592
01:00:47,402 --> 01:00:49,442
- You should do that.
- Yes.

1593
01:00:50,972 --> 01:00:53,212
- When you look at the cards, - Congratulations.

1594
01:00:53,612 --> 01:00:57,511
- there's only content for women.
- Yes.

1595
01:00:57,512 --> 01:00:59,011
(Finally, it's Choi Hwa Jeong's fridge)

1596
01:00:59,012 --> 01:01:01,281
(Most of the content focuses on a soft, emotional vibe.)

1597
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,081
It says you should add...

1598
01:01:03,082 --> 01:01:06,151
some energy or impact.

1599
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:07,452
What do you think?

1600
01:01:07,722 --> 01:01:09,492
That part is lacking.

1601
01:01:10,592 --> 01:01:12,661
It says it's too feminine.

1602
01:01:12,662 --> 01:01:13,791
Are you saying a man should appear on the channel?

1603
01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:15,191
Right.

1604
01:01:15,192 --> 01:01:16,701
You can add men...

1605
01:01:16,702 --> 01:01:19,501
or a new young person.

1606
01:01:19,502 --> 01:01:21,202
- You need some energy.
- Energy.

1607
01:01:21,232 --> 01:01:22,302
Also,

1608
01:01:22,402 --> 01:01:25,372
- I'll tell you about December.
- Yes.

1609
01:01:26,242 --> 01:01:29,211
(It's a card with many coins.)

1610
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:31,488
This is a card that signifies wealth for three generations.

1611
01:01:31,512 --> 01:01:33,712
(A card that signifies wealth for 3 generations)

1612
01:01:33,912 --> 01:01:35,611
Do you have something coming in December?

1613
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:37,482
I'm into crypto.

1614
01:01:38,422 --> 01:01:39,491
(He's suddenly very interested.)

1615
01:01:39,492 --> 01:01:41,121
- Maybe that would do well.
- I guess it's going to do well.

1616
01:01:41,122 --> 01:01:42,321
How is it now?

1617
01:01:42,322 --> 01:01:43,791
Are things going well?

1618
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:46,131
No. It dropped, and it's recovering.

1619
01:01:46,132 --> 01:01:47,132
Good.

1620
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,231
I think you'll do well...

1621
01:01:49,232 --> 01:01:51,361
in December.

1622
01:01:51,362 --> 01:01:53,432
But next May,

1623
01:01:53,632 --> 01:01:55,101
I think you should be a bit careful with crypto.

1624
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:56,402
It's a bit dangerous in May.

1625
01:01:56,742 --> 01:01:58,302
It's a bit dangerous in May.

1626
01:01:58,742 --> 01:02:00,041
You should sort it out before then.

1627
01:02:00,042 --> 01:02:01,471
From March to May.

1628
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:02,711
- I should take profits.
- You should sell them.

1629
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:04,141
Right. Also,

1630
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:05,912
toward the second half of the year,

1631
01:02:06,012 --> 01:02:08,551
I recommend earning a lot of money in August.

1632
01:02:08,552 --> 01:02:11,851
There will also be some money-making chances in October.

1633
01:02:11,852 --> 01:02:14,021
I guess there's crypto as well. Then,

1634
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,351
- Crypto.
- in September...

1635
01:02:15,352 --> 01:02:17,721
There's also a bit of love luck...

1636
01:02:17,722 --> 01:02:19,461
in December.

1637
01:02:19,462 --> 01:02:20,531
So,

1638
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,431
you'll meet many people next year,

1639
01:02:22,432 --> 01:02:24,261
and there might be a bit of love luck there.

1640
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:25,462
So, while you're at it...

1641
01:02:25,972 --> 01:02:27,571
(He's interested.)

1642
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:28,901
No way.

1643
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:29,902
So I think...

1644
01:02:29,903 --> 01:02:32,772
you should also pay attention to romance.

1645
01:02:33,142 --> 01:02:34,371
No way.

1646
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:35,742
That's what it says.

1647
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:38,311
The timing...

1648
01:02:38,312 --> 01:02:40,482
- is tight for getting married.
- Yes.

1649
01:02:41,112 --> 01:02:42,381
- Yes.
- You never know.

1650
01:02:42,382 --> 01:02:44,622
- You never know.
- Yes. Fate...

1651
01:02:44,782 --> 01:02:46,621
Just talking about it makes me excited.

1652
01:02:46,622 --> 01:02:48,198
(Just talking about it makes me excited.)

1653
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,662
Quite.

1654
01:02:49,862 --> 01:02:52,292
I think she was quite good.

1655
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:54,161
I'm happy...

1656
01:02:54,162 --> 01:02:57,632
because I'll have my best luck next year.

1657
01:02:58,132 --> 01:03:00,231
I thought, maybe...

1658
01:03:00,232 --> 01:03:02,302
I'll have more good things coming.

1659
01:03:02,772 --> 01:03:05,302
Is there anything else you'd like to know?

1660
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:07,341
Would you like me to do a love reading?

1661
01:03:07,342 --> 01:03:08,371
Love luck?

1662
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:09,741
- Have it read.
- Okay. Let's see it.

1663
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:11,011
You had a love reading somewhere,

1664
01:03:11,012 --> 01:03:12,412
- and it was very bad.
- No.

1665
01:03:12,982 --> 01:03:15,281
I was told I'll find my love after ten years.

1666
01:03:15,282 --> 01:03:16,321
- Really?
- Yes.

1667
01:03:16,322 --> 01:03:18,621
- Let's have it properly read.
- Check it out.

1668
01:03:18,622 --> 01:03:19,751
First,

1669
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:22,291
the cards give the same advice and message.

1670
01:03:22,292 --> 01:03:24,391
But they have different ways of saying it.

1671
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:27,061
This deck says the cold facts.

1672
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:28,991
This deck says it nicely,

1673
01:03:28,992 --> 01:03:30,631
and this is somewhere in between.

1674
01:03:30,632 --> 01:03:31,902
Which deck should I use?

1675
01:03:32,932 --> 01:03:34,072
I guess...

1676
01:03:34,302 --> 01:03:36,841
(Thinking)

1677
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:37,842
(Glancing)

1678
01:03:37,843 --> 01:03:39,641
Why are you checking us?

1679
01:03:39,642 --> 01:03:40,642
Which would be better?

1680
01:03:40,643 --> 01:03:42,011
- What you'd be comfortable with.
- You...

1681
01:03:42,012 --> 01:03:43,982
don't like cold advises.

1682
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,281
- That's accurate.
- Yes.

1683
01:03:46,282 --> 01:03:47,411
- Really?
- He doesn't like cold advice.

1684
01:03:47,412 --> 01:03:48,811
- Pick the one that says it nicely.
- That says it nicely?

1685
01:03:48,812 --> 01:03:50,121
But you won't understand then.

1686
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:51,122
Right.

1687
01:03:52,052 --> 01:03:53,421
- Let's hear the fact.
- The fact?

1688
01:03:53,422 --> 01:03:54,921
- We don't have time.
- Cold advice?

1689
01:03:54,922 --> 01:03:56,321
- The cold, harsh truth?
- Yes.

1690
01:03:56,322 --> 01:03:57,391
- Okay then.
- Yes.

1691
01:03:57,392 --> 01:03:58,991
- We're all good.
- It's what My Star wants.

1692
01:03:58,992 --> 01:04:01,112
- Yes. If it works, say it works.
- Please be honest.

1693
01:04:01,192 --> 01:04:02,761
- No need to give him false hope.
- Exactly.

1694
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,331
Right. It's all or nothing.

1695
01:04:04,332 --> 01:04:05,831
Do you want me to see...

1696
01:04:05,832 --> 01:04:08,031
what women find attractive about him first?

1697
01:04:08,032 --> 01:04:09,671
Yes. That sounds good.

1698
01:04:09,672 --> 01:04:10,942
How women see me?

1699
01:04:11,042 --> 01:04:12,972
- Right.
- So this is how it feels.

1700
01:04:13,072 --> 01:04:14,841
No. Let's hear the truth.

1701
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:16,141
- The truth.
- Are you going to say the truth?

1702
01:04:16,142 --> 01:04:17,741
- How many cards should I pick?
- Please give me five.

1703
01:04:17,742 --> 01:04:19,651
- Use your left hand.
- If her reading is accurate,

1704
01:04:19,652 --> 01:04:20,711
she's the real deal.

1705
01:04:20,712 --> 01:04:22,251
(He's carefully picking the cards.)

1706
01:04:22,252 --> 01:04:24,022
You're picking the cards evenly.

1707
01:04:25,382 --> 01:04:26,452
- Well done.
- Yes.

1708
01:04:27,492 --> 01:04:29,521
(He's nervous for no reason.)

1709
01:04:29,522 --> 01:04:32,691
First off, let's look at first impressions.

1710
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:35,762
This card is the Fool.

1711
01:04:36,702 --> 01:04:40,331
It suggests that women sense your wit...

1712
01:04:40,332 --> 01:04:42,131
and warmth.

1713
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:45,342
You come across as a star.

1714
01:04:47,072 --> 01:04:48,641
- They think you're cool.
- I see.

1715
01:04:48,642 --> 01:04:50,211
- Thank you.
- This card suggests...

1716
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:52,112
you're unexpectedly smart.

1717
01:04:52,612 --> 01:04:53,681
So...

1718
01:04:53,682 --> 01:04:55,252
I think he should pick again.

1719
01:04:55,512 --> 01:04:56,792
It's different from what I know.

1720
01:04:57,682 --> 01:04:59,691
- Or women might actually think...
- Okay.

1721
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:01,352
You're very charismatic.

1722
01:05:02,492 --> 01:05:03,492
(Twitching)

1723
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:06,062
Is there any romance in your life?

1724
01:05:07,232 --> 01:05:08,232
He likes things like that.

1725
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:10,101
(My older bestie)

1726
01:05:10,102 --> 01:05:11,262
He likes it.

1727
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:13,771
- I like romance.
- A man who can buy a flower.

1728
01:05:13,772 --> 01:05:15,172
- Of course.
- He likes it.

1729
01:05:15,272 --> 01:05:16,771
That's why women...

1730
01:05:16,772 --> 01:05:18,501
may mistake him...

1731
01:05:18,502 --> 01:05:20,172
for being romantic at first.

1732
01:05:22,212 --> 01:05:24,041
They like you because they're mistaken?

1733
01:05:24,042 --> 01:05:26,552
They're mistaken? I knew it.

1734
01:05:27,252 --> 01:05:30,022
- It's a misunderstanding.
- It's been good so far, though.

1735
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:31,122
But there's more, right?

1736
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:32,651
Good. Here's what women find appealing about you...

1737
01:05:32,652 --> 01:05:33,828
- once they know you better.
- Once they know him better.

1738
01:05:33,852 --> 01:05:36,922
You're quite trustworthy.

1739
01:05:38,092 --> 01:05:39,931
They think they can trust you.

1740
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:42,231
They think you're mature and prudent.

1741
01:05:42,232 --> 01:05:43,301
But the problem is...

1742
01:05:43,302 --> 01:05:46,031
(What's the problem?)

1743
01:05:46,032 --> 01:05:49,271
When you're feeling good, you treat people nicely,

1744
01:05:49,272 --> 01:05:51,541
but when you're in a bad mood, You become cold...

1745
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:53,242
and distant.

1746
01:05:53,572 --> 01:05:54,612
He gets sulky.

1747
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:56,081
They think he's sensitive.

1748
01:05:56,082 --> 01:05:57,141
That's not true.

1749
01:05:57,142 --> 01:05:58,241
No. She's right.

1750
01:05:58,242 --> 01:05:59,551
- He gets cold.
- Right?

1751
01:05:59,552 --> 01:06:00,552
He has that side.

1752
01:06:00,952 --> 01:06:03,052
- So suddenly...
- I learned from you.

1753
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:04,252
And...

1754
01:06:04,253 --> 01:06:05,881
(He can't refute.)

1755
01:06:05,882 --> 01:06:07,921
Women are generally attracted to you,

1756
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,162
so there's no problem.

1757
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:11,821
But they feel the "preview" is good,

1758
01:06:11,822 --> 01:06:13,361
while "the actual movie" is underwhelming.

1759
01:06:13,362 --> 01:06:14,661
This is what you need to work on.

1760
01:06:14,662 --> 01:06:16,531
Yes. You're a likable person.

1761
01:06:16,532 --> 01:06:18,561
So everyone likes him at first,

1762
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:20,701
- Yes. They like him, but...
- but soon after,

1763
01:06:20,702 --> 01:06:22,701
they say, "What's wrong with you?"

1764
01:06:22,702 --> 01:06:24,042
And they reject him.

1765
01:06:24,572 --> 01:06:25,602
They dismiss him.

1766
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:27,142
They don't dismiss me.

1767
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:29,941
He often approaches women...

1768
01:06:29,942 --> 01:06:31,242
in an awkward way.

1769
01:06:31,342 --> 01:06:33,481
- Right. But he's a likable person.
- Yes.

1770
01:06:33,482 --> 01:06:34,811
They like him a lot at first.

1771
01:06:34,812 --> 01:06:38,452
- Yes.
- First of all, in March,

1772
01:06:38,552 --> 01:06:40,651
you might meet a woman who has money.

1773
01:06:40,652 --> 01:06:42,368
Possibly someone who runs her own business.

1774
01:06:42,392 --> 01:06:43,421
She must be older than me then.

1775
01:06:43,422 --> 01:06:45,821
- No, I don't think so.
- Is it Hwa Jeong?

1776
01:06:45,822 --> 01:06:47,392
(Is it me?)

1777
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:48,962
Well...

1778
01:06:49,192 --> 01:06:50,561
But the thing is...

1779
01:06:50,562 --> 01:06:52,931
- he must work hard...
- He must work hard.

1780
01:06:52,932 --> 01:06:54,031
- You're absolutely right.
- even if he has luck on his side.

1781
01:06:54,032 --> 01:06:55,302
That's right.

1782
01:06:55,572 --> 01:06:56,842
Why are you mad?

1783
01:06:57,242 --> 01:06:58,442
Don't get mad in front of her.

1784
01:07:00,272 --> 01:07:01,412
Good. Then...

1785
01:07:01,742 --> 01:07:04,341
please tell us honestly. Will he get married?

1786
01:07:04,342 --> 01:07:05,381
- Will he get married?
- Yes.

1787
01:07:05,382 --> 01:07:06,781
(My Star wants to know if Seo Jin will get married.)

1788
01:07:06,782 --> 01:07:08,752
I'm curious.

1789
01:07:09,622 --> 01:07:11,181
- I'll...
- Let's see.

1790
01:07:11,182 --> 01:07:12,721
- Give me five cards.
- Marriage.

1791
01:07:12,722 --> 01:07:14,482
Let's see what they say about your marriage.

1792
01:07:14,792 --> 01:07:16,891
- Seo Jin's hands are shaking.
- Oh, dear.

1793
01:07:16,892 --> 01:07:18,792
- His hands are shaking.
- My gosh.

1794
01:07:18,922 --> 01:07:21,362
You're picking too carefully.

1795
01:07:22,732 --> 01:07:23,831
Oh, my gosh.

1796
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,661
(He doesn't believe in shamanism, )

1797
01:07:25,662 --> 01:07:27,501
(but he hopes the reading turns out well.)

1798
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:30,841
Now, let's see how women think about Seo Jin...

1799
01:07:30,842 --> 01:07:32,911
these days.

1800
01:07:32,912 --> 01:07:33,941
- It's money again.
- Yes.

1801
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:36,882
- It's all about money.
- Gosh. I'm jealous.

1802
01:07:36,982 --> 01:07:39,182
- If you look at this...
- You can buy love with money.

1803
01:07:40,012 --> 01:07:41,182
"How much do you want?"

1804
01:07:42,152 --> 01:07:43,321
Let's see.

1805
01:07:43,322 --> 01:07:46,392
It seems you're very kind to women. What do you think?

1806
01:07:47,352 --> 01:07:48,352
I'm kind at first.

1807
01:07:49,662 --> 01:07:52,221
- He's very kind.
- Yes.

1808
01:07:52,222 --> 01:07:54,561
The card suggests...

1809
01:07:54,562 --> 01:07:57,131
that you have strong preferences in women.

1810
01:07:57,132 --> 01:07:59,101
- That's right.
- It's accurate.

1811
01:07:59,102 --> 01:08:00,771
- Right.
- So...

1812
01:08:00,772 --> 01:08:03,171
if someone isn't your type, you're not interested,

1813
01:08:03,172 --> 01:08:05,001
- I won't give her a second glance.
- even if others say she's great.

1814
01:08:05,002 --> 01:08:07,511
It says you're quite humorous.

1815
01:08:07,512 --> 01:08:09,112
But here's the thing.

1816
01:08:11,782 --> 01:08:13,581
Let's say you had a great time with someone today.

1817
01:08:13,582 --> 01:08:15,752
Then you suddenly think it's not working out.

1818
01:08:15,852 --> 01:08:18,782
And you break things off abruptly.

1819
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:23,461
- This is the Death.
- "Death?"

1820
01:08:23,462 --> 01:08:25,321
- This is the Death.
- "Death?"

1821
01:08:25,322 --> 01:08:26,932
- "Death."
- It seems like it.

1822
01:08:27,032 --> 01:08:29,931
He values manners and boundaries.

1823
01:08:29,932 --> 01:08:32,931
For example, during a six-hour date,

1824
01:08:32,932 --> 01:08:34,571
things go smoothly for the 1st 3 or 4 hours.

1825
01:08:34,572 --> 01:08:35,948
He's kind and playful, as this card suggests.

1826
01:08:35,972 --> 01:08:38,441
But once boundaries are crossed,

1827
01:08:38,442 --> 01:08:41,011
he gets mad right away.

1828
01:08:41,012 --> 01:08:44,811
(The kind, humorous Seo Jin shows a side that aligns with the Death.)

1829
01:08:44,812 --> 01:08:45,841
I think she's right.

1830
01:08:45,842 --> 01:08:46,881
(He agrees immediately.)

1831
01:08:46,882 --> 01:08:48,012
He's getting into it.

1832
01:08:48,652 --> 01:08:50,282
- Well...
- I don't say anything,

1833
01:08:50,922 --> 01:08:53,242
but if someone crosses the line, I end things immediately.

1834
01:08:53,522 --> 01:08:56,322
Otherwise, I'm very nice to them.

1835
01:08:57,762 --> 01:08:59,891
- So... Right.
- I think you'll be nice.

1836
01:08:59,892 --> 01:09:01,091
If you look at this,

1837
01:09:01,092 --> 01:09:04,431
it says you were the King,

1838
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:07,501
which means you were seeing someone you could choose to marry.

1839
01:09:07,502 --> 01:09:08,532
Do you agree?

1840
01:09:09,332 --> 01:09:10,741
- I guess it's true.
- You should be honest...

1841
01:09:10,742 --> 01:09:12,141
so she can tell you more.

1842
01:09:12,142 --> 01:09:13,142
Yes.

1843
01:09:14,572 --> 01:09:17,182
- I'm always seeing someone.
- He's always seeing someone.

1844
01:09:17,412 --> 01:09:19,781
- He could choose to marry.
- Yes.

1845
01:09:19,782 --> 01:09:21,451
In 2026,

1846
01:09:21,452 --> 01:09:24,081
- you also have...
- I'm jealous.

1847
01:09:24,082 --> 01:09:26,691
The card suggests...

1848
01:09:26,692 --> 01:09:28,891
that you're a free spirit.

1849
01:09:28,892 --> 01:09:30,521
Marriage isn't a must for you,

1850
01:09:30,522 --> 01:09:32,221
but you still believe...

1851
01:09:32,222 --> 01:09:35,131
it's something...

1852
01:09:35,132 --> 01:09:36,231
worth doing.

1853
01:09:36,232 --> 01:09:37,262
- But...
- You're right.

1854
01:09:37,932 --> 01:09:39,101
(His trust in shamanism is growing.)

1855
01:09:39,102 --> 01:09:40,872
But right now...

1856
01:09:41,172 --> 01:09:44,772
It's not that I don't want to get married until I die.

1857
01:09:45,202 --> 01:09:47,172
No. I was always open.

1858
01:09:47,742 --> 01:09:50,412
I was always open, but it's not that I want to do it right now.

1859
01:09:51,042 --> 01:09:52,522
I want to get married when I want to.

1860
01:09:53,582 --> 01:09:54,982
I'll do it when I feel like it.

1861
01:09:56,722 --> 01:09:58,751
But right now,

1862
01:09:58,752 --> 01:10:00,291
money is his top priority.

1863
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:02,422
- So...
- Capitalism.

1864
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:05,062
(A capitalist seal who prioritizes work and money over marriage)

1865
01:10:05,063 --> 01:10:07,561
So it seems you want to focus on work first...

1866
01:10:07,562 --> 01:10:09,391
and get married later.

1867
01:10:09,392 --> 01:10:10,592
That's what the cards suggest.

1868
01:10:11,532 --> 01:10:13,302
Lastly,

1869
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:15,731
- There's more?
- please tell us...

1870
01:10:15,732 --> 01:10:16,978
if having Hwa Jeong as a guest...

1871
01:10:17,002 --> 01:10:18,472
helps the show.

1872
01:10:19,042 --> 01:10:20,342
Hey, that's...

1873
01:10:21,142 --> 01:10:22,442
- Please tell us.
- What?

1874
01:10:23,882 --> 01:10:24,941
If it makes you uncomfortable,

1875
01:10:24,942 --> 01:10:26,411
- I won't ask her.
- No. Let's see.

1876
01:10:26,412 --> 01:10:27,911
- Let's see the result.
- Let's see.

1877
01:10:27,912 --> 01:10:29,051
Give me five cards. Let me see.

1878
01:10:29,052 --> 01:10:31,482
- Let's see.
- One last time.

1879
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,892
I hope I was helpful.

1880
01:10:34,992 --> 01:10:36,051
(The hardcore believers are peeking.)

1881
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:37,122
That card is...

1882
01:10:37,322 --> 01:10:39,561
- It looks positive.
- It helps with the ratings.

1883
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:40,732
There's an 80 percent chance.

1884
01:10:41,692 --> 01:10:43,601
But if you look at this...

1885
01:10:43,602 --> 01:10:44,801
(She's relieved for now.)

1886
01:10:44,802 --> 01:10:47,571
According to this card, you take on...

1887
01:10:47,572 --> 01:10:49,272
a maternal role.

1888
01:10:49,572 --> 01:10:52,041
When these two bicker,

1889
01:10:52,042 --> 01:10:53,471
you bring balance...

1890
01:10:53,472 --> 01:10:55,811
and calm things down,

1891
01:10:55,812 --> 01:10:57,981
boosting the show's average ratings,

1892
01:10:57,982 --> 01:11:00,911
which indicates there will be future opportunities.

1893
01:11:00,912 --> 01:11:02,281
I guess ratings will rise significantly.

1894
01:11:02,282 --> 01:11:03,352
Yes.

1895
01:11:03,552 --> 01:11:05,721
(We need our viewers' support.)

1896
01:11:05,722 --> 01:11:07,791
- So...
- There's a baby.

1897
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:09,421
- A baby?
- Yes.

1898
01:11:09,422 --> 01:11:10,422
(A baby?)

1899
01:11:10,423 --> 01:11:11,521
(I'm counting on you for the ratings, Mama.)

1900
01:11:11,522 --> 01:11:12,621
I got it.

1901
01:11:12,622 --> 01:11:14,361
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

1902
01:11:14,362 --> 01:11:15,932
Thank you.

1903
01:11:16,232 --> 01:11:18,701
I discovered this place through Si Kyung.

1904
01:11:18,702 --> 01:11:20,332
I often come here.

1905
01:11:21,402 --> 01:11:23,171
(They go to My Star's favorite restaurant.)

1906
01:11:23,172 --> 01:11:26,442
(A restaurant recommended by Sung Si Kyung)

1907
01:11:26,872 --> 01:11:29,742
- Hi. It's been a long time.
- Oh, my gosh.

1908
01:11:29,842 --> 01:11:32,381
- I couldn't forget how good it is.
- Thank you.

1909
01:11:32,382 --> 01:11:33,551
(She became friends with the owner because she came here often.)

1910
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:35,052
Okay. Come on in, baby.

1911
01:11:39,892 --> 01:11:40,921
(She reads the menu aloud as soon as she comes in.)

1912
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,962
"Spicy jjamppong."

1913
01:11:43,522 --> 01:11:44,592
"Green onion rice."

1914
01:11:44,662 --> 01:11:46,222
It's really good.

1915
01:11:46,892 --> 01:11:48,432
This is your photo.

1916
01:11:49,362 --> 01:11:51,001
(It proves she's a regular here.)

1917
01:11:51,002 --> 01:11:54,101
Jjamppong, jjajang rice,

1918
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:57,102
spicy jjamppong, jjajangmyeon,

1919
01:11:57,372 --> 01:12:00,671
sweet and sour pork, and...

1920
01:12:00,672 --> 01:12:02,172
Green onion rice is also good.

1921
01:12:02,372 --> 01:12:03,612
We could have green onion rice.

1922
01:12:04,182 --> 01:12:06,951
(You weren't reading the menu aloud?)

1923
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:08,151
Would you like to have spicy jjamppong?

1924
01:12:08,152 --> 01:12:10,851
No. I'll have big dumplings.

1925
01:12:10,852 --> 01:12:12,122
- Big dumplings?
- Yes.

1926
01:12:12,582 --> 01:12:14,851
That's a side dish. You should order a main.

1927
01:12:14,852 --> 01:12:16,461
I'll have a main dish later.

1928
01:12:16,462 --> 01:12:17,962
(He likes to have a side dish first.)

1929
01:12:18,062 --> 01:12:19,121
- Then...
- A side dish to have with alcohol.

1930
01:12:19,122 --> 01:12:20,991
Then we'll have 2 jjajangmyeons, 1 spicy jjamppong,

1931
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:22,861
1 sweet and sour pork, and 1 big dumpling.

1932
01:12:22,862 --> 01:12:24,062
Okay.

1933
01:12:25,362 --> 01:12:28,902
(A dinner carefully chosen by My Star)

1934
01:12:29,702 --> 01:12:32,702
(Spicy jjamppong that stimulates the taste buds)

1935
01:12:33,672 --> 01:12:34,941
(It satisfies the nose and ears...)

1936
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:37,642
(with its savory crunch.)

1937
01:12:38,442 --> 01:12:40,451
(A perfect, )

1938
01:12:40,452 --> 01:12:42,481
(sensory-stimulating dinner)

1939
01:12:42,482 --> 01:12:44,322
- Today...
- Thank you.

1940
01:12:45,052 --> 01:12:46,651
Doesn't it look amazing?

1941
01:12:46,652 --> 01:12:48,621
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1942
01:12:48,622 --> 01:12:49,622
(Glancing)

1943
01:12:49,623 --> 01:12:51,191
- Give me some jjajangmyeon too.
- Sure.

1944
01:12:51,192 --> 01:12:52,561
- Let's share.
- Let me have a bite.

1945
01:12:52,562 --> 01:12:53,962
- Sure.
- Okay.

1946
01:12:54,962 --> 01:12:56,031
(They share the jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.)

1947
01:12:56,032 --> 01:12:58,962
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1948
01:13:00,772 --> 01:13:05,202
(He carefully cuts the food for My Star.)

1949
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:08,342
Hold on.

1950
01:13:08,472 --> 01:13:10,141
Don't cut it into small pieces.

1951
01:13:10,142 --> 01:13:11,741
- It'll lose all the juice.
- Okay.

1952
01:13:11,742 --> 01:13:13,251
It doesn't taste good if it's cut into small pieces.

1953
01:13:13,252 --> 01:13:14,351
- This big?
- Yes.

1954
01:13:14,352 --> 01:13:15,781
- I cut it in half. Got it.
- That's good. Okay.

1955
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:16,851
Try this.

1956
01:13:16,852 --> 01:13:18,152
He has poor teeth.

1957
01:13:18,222 --> 01:13:20,122
Hey, stop talking about it.

1958
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:22,791
I won't be able to get married.

1959
01:13:22,792 --> 01:13:25,091
- No one asked.
- That's what you care?

1960
01:13:25,092 --> 01:13:26,391
Thank you for the food.

1961
01:13:26,392 --> 01:13:28,762
- You did a great job.
- I'll enjoy the food.

1962
01:13:29,462 --> 01:13:30,802
It's...

1963
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:32,561
Just have a bite. Try it.

1964
01:13:32,562 --> 01:13:33,778
(She starts with jjajangmyeon.)

1965
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:35,771
Or Hwa Jeong will get upset.

1966
01:13:35,772 --> 01:13:36,772
It's good.

1967
01:13:38,502 --> 01:13:43,112
(Following My Star, the foodie, he tries the jjajangmyeon first.)

1968
01:13:46,142 --> 01:13:47,182
(Impressed)

1969
01:13:48,052 --> 01:13:49,112
How good is it?

1970
01:13:49,652 --> 01:13:50,752
Is it quite good?

1971
01:13:52,622 --> 01:13:54,251
It tastes like the classic, old-fashioned jjajangmyeon.

1972
01:13:54,252 --> 01:13:57,091
- Yes.
- It's rare these days.

1973
01:13:57,092 --> 01:13:58,291
- Right?
- Yes.

1974
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:00,532
(Old-fashioned jjajangmyeon with a light, subtle flavor)

1975
01:14:00,762 --> 01:14:01,831
Try this.

1976
01:14:01,832 --> 01:14:04,032
(She tries spicy jjamppong after eating jjangmyeon.)

1977
01:14:05,762 --> 01:14:07,032
This is good.

1978
01:14:08,672 --> 01:14:09,772
It's delicious.

1979
01:14:11,172 --> 01:14:12,872
It has a smoky flavor.

1980
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:19,951
(My Star doesn't waste a single bite.)

1981
01:14:19,952 --> 01:14:22,081
She's underrated as a foodie.

1982
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:24,622
(My Star doesn't waste a single bite.)

1983
01:14:26,622 --> 01:14:28,022
This is good.

1984
01:14:30,422 --> 01:14:32,392
It's delicious.

1985
01:14:34,132 --> 01:14:35,662
Is there any food you don't like?

1986
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:38,962
(Feeling exposed)

1987
01:14:39,032 --> 01:14:41,201
If you're going to eat anyway, you should enjoy it.

1988
01:14:41,202 --> 01:14:43,502
- Right.
- So you don't regret it.

1989
01:14:43,542 --> 01:14:45,771
Isn't it the worst when you eat bad food...

1990
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:47,071
and only get full?

1991
01:14:47,072 --> 01:14:48,992
You can't eat anything else because you're full.

1992
01:14:49,372 --> 01:14:52,052
That's why you should carefully choose what you eat for every meal.

1993
01:14:53,112 --> 01:14:54,151
I'm serious.

1994
01:14:54,152 --> 01:14:56,211
(The Grumpy Secretaries are scolded for being careless about food.)

1995
01:14:56,212 --> 01:14:58,252
A woman once...

1996
01:14:59,182 --> 01:15:00,922
caught a cold.

1997
01:15:01,022 --> 01:15:02,822
Her boyfriend...

1998
01:15:03,022 --> 01:15:05,561
wanted to impress her...

1999
01:15:05,562 --> 01:15:08,132
by bringing her seolleongtang from Yeongdong Seolleongtang.

2000
01:15:08,262 --> 01:15:11,702
But the moment she saw it,

2001
01:15:11,962 --> 01:15:13,532
she broke up with him.

2002
01:15:13,872 --> 01:15:15,532
- Do you know why?
- Why?

2003
01:15:16,842 --> 01:15:19,302
He didn't bring kkakdugi.

2004
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:23,142
You can't eat seolleongtang without kkakdugi.

2005
01:15:23,212 --> 01:15:24,212
He should've brought...

2006
01:15:24,213 --> 01:15:25,541
- at least some fresh kimchi.
- I can't eat without it.

2007
01:15:25,542 --> 01:15:27,011
Right? Me neither.

2008
01:15:27,012 --> 01:15:28,812
- How about you?
- Me neither. How about you?

2009
01:15:29,152 --> 01:15:31,312
- You can't, can you?
- Let's just say I won't eat it.

2010
01:15:32,422 --> 01:15:34,391
It's like eating ramyeon without the powder.

2011
01:15:34,392 --> 01:15:36,491
Right. This is the worst mistake.

2012
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:39,361
"Can't you just eat it without kkakdugi?"

2013
01:15:39,362 --> 01:15:40,461
"Can't you eat it without it?"

2014
01:15:40,462 --> 01:15:42,692
Yes. It's so frustrating.

2015
01:15:43,032 --> 01:15:45,801
When you eat French fries,

2016
01:15:45,802 --> 01:15:47,702
you need ketchup, right?

2017
01:15:47,872 --> 01:15:49,702
- Yes, you need ketchup.
- Right?

2018
01:15:50,202 --> 01:15:52,042
React again.

2019
01:15:53,272 --> 01:15:55,341
Hey, when you eat French fries,

2020
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,342
you need ketchup, right?

2021
01:15:57,882 --> 01:16:01,252
But fast-food restaurants season their fries with salt.

2022
01:16:01,282 --> 01:16:05,851
But still, you need to dip it in ketchup.

2023
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:09,352
I give it a twist as well.

2024
01:16:09,622 --> 01:16:11,821
I add a few drops of Tabasco.

2025
01:16:11,822 --> 01:16:13,332
It elevates the flavor.

2026
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:15,032
You should try it.

2027
01:16:15,292 --> 01:16:17,062
So you carry the sauce around with you?

2028
01:16:17,162 --> 01:16:18,501
Yes.

2029
01:16:18,502 --> 01:16:20,431
- Tabasco and olive oil?
- Yes.

2030
01:16:20,432 --> 01:16:22,832
- Oh, right. Do you want to try it?
- Try what?

2031
01:16:23,442 --> 01:16:24,642
Tabasco?

2032
01:16:24,802 --> 01:16:26,572
No. Pepper.

2033
01:16:26,842 --> 01:16:28,371
- Peppercone?
- It's really good...

2034
01:16:28,372 --> 01:16:30,482
with pepper. I have peppercone.

2035
01:16:31,142 --> 01:16:33,812
This is what I carry around with me.

2036
01:16:34,282 --> 01:16:36,181
- Yogurt and this.
- Did you finish it?

2037
01:16:36,182 --> 01:16:37,482
Yes. This is...

2038
01:16:38,522 --> 01:16:40,721
(Empty)

2039
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:43,292
- Did you eat the egg too?
- Yes, I did.

2040
01:16:43,462 --> 01:16:45,861
- You ate a lot.
- I ate it in the car.

2041
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:47,691
I always start my meal...

2042
01:16:47,692 --> 01:16:49,392
with an egg.

2043
01:16:49,592 --> 01:16:52,162
And this is salt.

2044
01:16:52,262 --> 01:16:54,602
She eats an astonishing amount.

2045
01:16:55,872 --> 01:16:56,941
(My Star has a big stomach.)

2046
01:16:56,942 --> 01:16:58,242
- I told you.
- This.

2047
01:16:58,372 --> 01:17:00,571
This is pepper.

2048
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:01,971
- Pepper.
- It's my favorite.

2049
01:17:01,972 --> 01:17:03,742
- I like peppercone.
- Where do you put it?

2050
01:17:04,312 --> 01:17:06,211
Let's try it with this.

2051
01:17:06,212 --> 01:17:08,082
- Sweet and sour pork?
- Yes.

2052
01:17:08,512 --> 01:17:10,651
- With peppercone?
- Do you not have a grinder?

2053
01:17:10,652 --> 01:17:12,751
Try chewing one. It's not meant to be ground.

2054
01:17:12,752 --> 01:17:14,621
- It's for munching.
- Is that so?

2055
01:17:14,622 --> 01:17:16,522
It tastes amazing.

2056
01:17:16,722 --> 01:17:18,622
It's not meant to be ground. Try it.

2057
01:17:18,862 --> 01:17:21,262
- Try chewing one. Yes.
- You want me to put it in my mouth?

2058
01:17:21,332 --> 01:17:23,902
- You could chew it with the food.
- Is that so?

2059
01:17:24,402 --> 01:17:26,001
I tried it because she told me to.

2060
01:17:26,002 --> 01:17:28,671
But who chews a whole peppercone like that?

2061
01:17:28,672 --> 01:17:30,142
It's not a pill.

2062
01:17:31,702 --> 01:17:33,072
Right? It's not a pill.

2063
01:17:33,542 --> 01:17:34,772
It's a health booster.

2064
01:17:36,812 --> 01:17:38,581
Pepper is really good for your body.

2065
01:17:38,582 --> 01:17:40,312
People actually went to war over pepper.

2066
01:17:41,252 --> 01:17:42,352
War over pepper?

2067
01:17:44,082 --> 01:17:46,422
There was a global war over pepper.

2068
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:48,592
Didn't you just fight someone over pepper?

2069
01:17:49,722 --> 01:17:50,962
No.

2070
01:17:51,122 --> 01:17:52,661
There was the Pepper War.

2071
01:17:52,662 --> 01:17:54,032
You don't know?

2072
01:17:54,192 --> 01:17:56,432
It's a very famous war.

2073
01:17:56,932 --> 01:17:59,602
She could get into a fight over pepper.

2074
01:18:00,702 --> 01:18:02,302
We don't really think about it.

2075
01:18:02,602 --> 01:18:04,882
"Why would you fight over pepper?" This is what we think.

2076
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,112
But she understands why they fought.

2077
01:18:07,842 --> 01:18:09,641
It's not meant to be ground. Try it.

2078
01:18:09,642 --> 01:18:11,142
- Should I chew it?
- Yes. Chew it.

2079
01:18:13,382 --> 01:18:14,412
It's sweet.

2080
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:16,921
When you chew it, it releases a fruity aroma.

2081
01:18:16,922 --> 01:18:18,722
- It's sweet.
- It's almost like fruit juice.

2082
01:18:18,922 --> 01:18:20,251
It's good as it is.

2083
01:18:20,252 --> 01:18:21,751
Right? It tastes really good.

2084
01:18:21,752 --> 01:18:24,761
- You could eat it with fruit...
- Let me cut this.

2085
01:18:24,762 --> 01:18:26,662
Or add it to yogurt.

2086
01:18:27,262 --> 01:18:28,291
It's really good.

2087
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:29,691
(Even Kwang Kyu, with a kid's palate, likes it.)

2088
01:18:29,692 --> 01:18:30,802
Try one.

2089
01:18:32,502 --> 01:18:35,702
(The food that stimulates My Star's taste buds)

2090
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:38,301
- It's...
- It popped.

2091
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:40,842
(It popped!)

2092
01:18:41,772 --> 01:18:42,841
(Chewing a peppercone)

2093
01:18:42,842 --> 01:18:44,042
It's good. Isn't it nice?

2094
01:18:44,582 --> 01:18:46,712
I didn't know pepper had a rich flavor like that.

2095
01:18:47,212 --> 01:18:51,382
It tasted like regular pepper on the outside,

2096
01:18:51,622 --> 01:18:55,352
but like candy on the inside.

2097
01:18:55,992 --> 01:18:59,422
It was sweet and bitter.

2098
01:19:00,932 --> 01:19:02,962
Seo Jin, have you ever had a one-sided crush?

2099
01:19:04,978 --> 01:19:06,677
I'm sure I have. I don't know.

2100
01:19:06,678 --> 01:19:10,018
What kind of arrogant attitude is that?

2101
01:19:12,188 --> 01:19:15,657
The tarot reader was right.

2102
01:19:15,658 --> 01:19:19,928
I don't want to do anything that isn't worth it.

2103
01:19:20,058 --> 01:19:21,928
I don't want to have a one-sided crush.

2104
01:19:22,558 --> 01:19:24,298
So that's how you are?

2105
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:27,998
You really like someone, but if they show no signs,

2106
01:19:28,298 --> 01:19:29,937
- you decide it's not worth it...
- Well...

2107
01:19:29,938 --> 01:19:31,407
- and quit?
- I give up...

2108
01:19:31,408 --> 01:19:33,877
before a crush even has a chance to develop.

2109
01:19:33,878 --> 01:19:35,837
- Right. That's why...
- I only go for it...

2110
01:19:35,838 --> 01:19:36,877
when I have a chance.

2111
01:19:36,878 --> 01:19:39,948
Yes. That's why he's cold.

2112
01:19:40,718 --> 01:19:42,847
Most people give love their all,

2113
01:19:42,848 --> 01:19:44,418
even if it's painful.

2114
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,288
He's the biggest coward in a way.

2115
01:19:47,488 --> 01:19:48,958
- I'm realistic.
- Yes.

2116
01:19:49,088 --> 01:19:51,387
Well, you could say you're realistic,

2117
01:19:51,388 --> 01:19:53,158
- but you're a coward.
- So...

2118
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,827
I only take action when I see a chance of success.

2119
01:19:55,828 --> 01:19:57,767
But when you have a one-sided crush,

2120
01:19:57,768 --> 01:20:00,638
you want to express it no matter what.

2121
01:20:00,738 --> 01:20:03,738
Even if it's embarrassing, you should let them know at least once.

2122
01:20:03,838 --> 01:20:05,568
You don't even do that?

2123
01:20:06,338 --> 01:20:07,338
I would do that.

2124
01:20:07,339 --> 01:20:09,307
- Right. But...
- But...

2125
01:20:09,308 --> 01:20:12,278
I'd express my feelings in a different way.

2126
01:20:12,478 --> 01:20:13,548
Like how?

2127
01:20:13,818 --> 01:20:14,917
I tend to be very direct.

2128
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:16,218
- Right?
- Yes.

2129
01:20:16,748 --> 01:20:18,017
As if you scold them?

2130
01:20:18,018 --> 01:20:19,917
I'd be very direct.

2131
01:20:19,918 --> 01:20:21,634
If things don't work out, there's nothing I can do about it.

2132
01:20:21,658 --> 01:20:24,158
I turn away quickly.

2133
01:20:24,358 --> 01:20:27,458
Right. But you can't control love.

2134
01:20:27,628 --> 01:20:29,558
I think true love happens...

2135
01:20:29,928 --> 01:20:32,868
when someone can't mess around like a player.

2136
01:20:35,168 --> 01:20:37,807
Before you turn 40,

2137
01:20:37,808 --> 01:20:40,907
you can experience that kind of youthful love.

2138
01:20:40,908 --> 01:20:44,208
But as you get older, it becomes harder to feel that way.

2139
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:45,648
- You're right.
- Yes.

2140
01:20:45,978 --> 01:20:49,147
Seo Jin thinks he's a player.

2141
01:20:49,148 --> 01:20:51,887
Why would I think that way? I've never thought I was a player.

2142
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:54,857
Right. I've also never thought he was a player.

2143
01:20:54,858 --> 01:20:56,387
It's just you.

2144
01:20:56,388 --> 01:20:57,887
He's a player.

2145
01:20:57,888 --> 01:20:59,058
But...

2146
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:01,098
You think you're a player...

2147
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:03,668
until you meet someone who is a bigger player.

2148
01:21:03,898 --> 01:21:05,767
- That's true.
- There's always someone...

2149
01:21:05,768 --> 01:21:07,567
- who outplays you.
- True.

2150
01:21:07,568 --> 01:21:08,737
That's why people say you'll eventually meet someone...

2151
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:10,097
- who plays you back.
- Yes.

2152
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,667
I thought I was in control,

2153
01:21:12,668 --> 01:21:14,807
- but it turns out they got me.
- Right.

2154
01:21:14,808 --> 01:21:16,308
It happens a lot.

2155
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:18,708
(Teary-eyed)

2156
01:21:19,478 --> 01:21:22,547
(It's relatable for some reason.)

2157
01:21:22,548 --> 01:21:24,847
How about you, baby? Have you ever had a one-sided crush?

2158
01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:27,658
- Many times.
- You have?

2159
01:21:27,918 --> 01:21:31,557
You were so lucky to find someone to crush on.

2160
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:33,858
I always had a one-sided crush.

2161
01:21:33,998 --> 01:21:36,858
Come on. That's impossible.

2162
01:21:36,928 --> 01:21:40,698
- His standards are quite high.
- Okay.

2163
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:42,997
He's quite picky, so he mostly ends up having one-sided crushes.

2164
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,307
But baby,

2165
01:21:45,308 --> 01:21:48,037
something like saju...

2166
01:21:48,038 --> 01:21:49,207
- shows your luck.
- Yes.

2167
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:52,048
What do they say? Does it say you'll get married?

2168
01:21:52,448 --> 01:21:53,688
Like the tarot reading earlier?

2169
01:21:54,718 --> 01:21:57,147
I heard I have everything.

2170
01:21:57,148 --> 01:21:58,648
- Okay.
- Everything is good.

2171
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:00,387
- But...
- There's no woman?

2172
01:22:00,388 --> 01:22:01,388
- Yes.
- So you don't have wood?

2173
01:22:01,388 --> 01:22:02,388
In your case, wood represents women.

2174
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:03,617
Wood represents women.

2175
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:04,957
(According to his saju, he's not fated to get married?)

2176
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:06,758
This is what I heard a long time ago.

2177
01:22:07,998 --> 01:22:11,027
For most people, when they open the front gate,

2178
01:22:11,028 --> 01:22:12,898
their husband is there.

2179
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:15,738
For me, I'd have to go through the front gate,

2180
01:22:15,938 --> 01:22:18,867
open the front door, walk into the living room,

2181
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:21,308
and then the bedroom to find him.

2182
01:22:23,678 --> 01:22:24,978
It means you don't have one.

2183
01:22:25,078 --> 01:22:26,977
Right. It means it's hard for me to get married.

2184
01:22:26,978 --> 01:22:29,078
- It means it's hard.
- It means it's hard.

2185
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:32,847
"Why would he want to get married?" This is what I got.

2186
01:22:32,848 --> 01:22:35,188
I see. Yes.

2187
01:22:35,488 --> 01:22:37,257
If I felt lonely,

2188
01:22:37,258 --> 01:22:38,757
- I'd think about marriage.
- Right.

2189
01:22:38,758 --> 01:22:39,987
But I don't feel lonely.

2190
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:41,597
You don't feel any loneliness.

2191
01:22:41,598 --> 01:22:43,658
Right. I'm the type who enjoys being lonely.

2192
01:22:44,428 --> 01:22:45,467
I can relate.

2193
01:22:45,468 --> 01:22:48,397
I've never once thought, "Not being able to marry..."

2194
01:22:48,398 --> 01:22:49,867
"is driving me nuts."

2195
01:22:49,868 --> 01:22:51,208
- Hwa Jeong.
- Yes?

2196
01:22:51,268 --> 01:22:52,767
Didn't you have a deep relationship...

2197
01:22:52,768 --> 01:22:54,278
- when you were younger?
- Of course.

2198
01:22:54,338 --> 01:22:56,107
Back then, you must've thought of marriage.

2199
01:22:56,108 --> 01:22:57,177
Yes, I did back then.

2200
01:22:57,178 --> 01:22:58,208
It was...

2201
01:22:58,408 --> 01:23:00,278
when I was around 29 or 30,

2202
01:23:00,448 --> 01:23:01,548
my most...

2203
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:02,817
beautiful prime,

2204
01:23:02,818 --> 01:23:04,948
which I hadn't realized.

2205
01:23:05,118 --> 01:23:06,918
During that period,

2206
01:23:07,018 --> 01:23:09,487
people labeled you as a loser if you didn't get married,

2207
01:23:09,488 --> 01:23:11,127
- even in interviews.
- Yes.

2208
01:23:11,128 --> 01:23:12,227
At that time,

2209
01:23:12,228 --> 01:23:13,627
I felt anxious.

2210
01:23:13,628 --> 01:23:15,598
It was when I was 27 or 28.

2211
01:23:15,958 --> 01:23:17,597
But I'm mad at myself...

2212
01:23:17,598 --> 01:23:19,128
for spending...

2213
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:20,668
my beautiful time like that.

2214
01:23:21,468 --> 01:23:22,738
Here's what I think.

2215
01:23:22,768 --> 01:23:23,908
There are people...

2216
01:23:24,408 --> 01:23:26,108
who get married twice and such.

2217
01:23:27,938 --> 01:23:29,237
But marriage isn't what's important.

2218
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:30,548
It's love.

2219
01:23:31,748 --> 01:23:32,977
Even if we didn't get married,

2220
01:23:32,978 --> 01:23:34,017
we've been in plenty of loving relationships.

2221
01:23:34,018 --> 01:23:35,047
Exactly.

2222
01:23:35,048 --> 01:23:36,048
(Even if we didn't get married, )

2223
01:23:36,049 --> 01:23:37,094
(we've been in plenty of loving relationships.)

2224
01:23:37,118 --> 01:23:39,087
- Love is essential.
- Yes.

2225
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:40,318
(Love is essential.)

2226
01:23:40,858 --> 01:23:47,857
(I love)

2227
01:23:47,858 --> 01:23:54,798
(I love myself)

2228
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:57,537
(Satisfied)

2229
01:23:57,538 --> 01:23:59,568
As I mentioned earlier,

2230
01:23:59,838 --> 01:24:01,677
being in your 40s and 50s is nice.

2231
01:24:01,678 --> 01:24:03,438
You must have loved before your 40s.

2232
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:04,608
That's true.

2233
01:24:05,148 --> 01:24:06,278
Rumor has it that...

2234
01:24:07,218 --> 01:24:08,647
if you add up...

2235
01:24:08,648 --> 01:24:11,017
all the congratulatory money you gifted,

2236
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:13,548
you could buy a house.

2237
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:14,917
- The congratulatory money I gifted?
- Yes.

2238
01:24:14,918 --> 01:24:15,918
Probably.

2239
01:24:15,919 --> 01:24:17,034
- Is the total that much?
- Yes.

2240
01:24:17,058 --> 01:24:18,458
Say that someone...

2241
01:24:18,628 --> 01:24:20,958
gifted me 300 dollars.

2242
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:23,127
Then I'm someone who would gift 500 dollars.

2243
01:24:23,128 --> 01:24:24,574
(Then I'm someone who would gift 500 dollars.)

2244
01:24:24,598 --> 01:24:26,797
I don't mind gifting money,

2245
01:24:26,798 --> 01:24:28,768
- Yes?
- but I don't accept any.

2246
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,238
- Of course, since we didn't...
- Like,

2247
01:24:31,738 --> 01:24:32,837
even if someone passes away,

2248
01:24:32,838 --> 01:24:33,978
I don't accept money.

2249
01:24:34,138 --> 01:24:35,138
- Really?
- Yes.

2250
01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:36,608
- You didn't?
- I didn't.

2251
01:24:36,738 --> 01:24:38,748
- Is that so?
- I pay when I have to.

2252
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:40,748
Think about the people who accept the money.

2253
01:24:40,918 --> 01:24:43,178
Those who accept it should accept it.

2254
01:24:43,318 --> 01:24:45,217
I don't accept it simply because I don't want to.

2255
01:24:45,218 --> 01:24:46,388
I...

2256
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:47,858
want the money.

2257
01:24:48,488 --> 01:24:49,818
- I...
- I'll pay.

2258
01:24:49,858 --> 01:24:51,258
- As for me...
- Don't worry.

2259
01:24:51,658 --> 01:24:53,027
You must want to get married,

2260
01:24:53,028 --> 01:24:54,227
since you started off with "as for me."

2261
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:56,458
You think a lot every day in bed, don't you?

2262
01:24:56,928 --> 01:25:00,428
I have a dream

2263
01:25:00,938 --> 01:25:02,237
I'm someone...

2264
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:05,008
who wishes to do everything that everyone else does.

2265
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,838
I've already asked Jae Seok...

2266
01:25:09,038 --> 01:25:10,908
- to be the MC.
- I see.

2267
01:25:11,748 --> 01:25:13,478
As for the song, Joong Wan.

2268
01:25:13,948 --> 01:25:15,218
- Yuk Joong Wan.
- I see.

2269
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:16,977
I've already settled the basics.

2270
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,118
I'll do that for me.

2271
01:25:18,418 --> 01:25:19,448
What?

2272
01:25:19,818 --> 01:25:21,488
Commentary for clearing the occasion.

2273
01:25:21,558 --> 01:25:22,558
Nice.

2274
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:24,658
Commentary for cleaning?

2275
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:28,757
(It's suddenly a cleaning service.)

2276
01:25:28,758 --> 01:25:30,257
"Those in the back,"

2277
01:25:30,258 --> 01:25:32,444
- "please come to the front row."
- "Please turn off your phone."

2278
01:25:32,468 --> 01:25:33,528
In between?

2279
01:25:33,898 --> 01:25:35,368
I'd be grateful.

2280
01:25:36,738 --> 01:25:41,338
(Will Kwang Kyu be able to get married next year?)

2281
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:42,967
(What is Choi Hwa Jeong to you?)

2282
01:25:42,968 --> 01:25:44,078
I've told you all the time.

2283
01:25:44,278 --> 01:25:46,008
Had we met when we were young,

2284
01:25:46,378 --> 01:25:47,778
we could've ended up dating.

2285
01:25:49,808 --> 01:25:51,978
- What a bummer.
- But we met too late.

2286
01:25:52,418 --> 01:25:54,148
It's a love that can't come true.

2287
01:25:55,018 --> 01:25:58,188
A never-changing, girl-like person.

2288
01:25:58,558 --> 01:26:00,058
Starting from her skin tone...

2289
01:26:00,218 --> 01:26:01,428
to her looks.

2290
01:26:02,788 --> 01:26:04,097
And also what she eats.

2291
01:26:04,098 --> 01:26:05,297
(Also what she eats.)

2292
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:06,857
She really digs in.

2293
01:26:06,858 --> 01:26:08,298
(She really digs in.)

2294
01:26:08,498 --> 01:26:09,567
Little did I know...

2295
01:26:09,568 --> 01:26:11,438
she was such a gourmand.

2296
01:26:12,098 --> 01:26:13,537
Didn't she have about four meals today?

2297
01:26:13,538 --> 01:26:14,667
Normally, she eats six.

2298
01:26:14,668 --> 01:26:16,108
(Normally, she eats six meals.)

2299
01:26:16,368 --> 01:26:17,538
That's why she's slim now.

2300
01:26:17,678 --> 01:26:19,238
She's become quite thin.

2301
01:26:19,608 --> 01:26:21,177
Hwa Jeong is eating less now,

2302
01:26:21,178 --> 01:26:22,178
down to four meals.

2303
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:24,648
How satisfied are you with the food concept caretaking?

2304
01:26:25,178 --> 01:26:26,478
About 70 percent.

2305
01:26:26,878 --> 01:26:28,017
- It's quite high.
- Above all,

2306
01:26:28,018 --> 01:26:29,917
they drove me to all the places.

2307
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,317
(Above all, they drove me to all the places.)

2308
01:26:31,318 --> 01:26:33,158
I was able to get to all the places.

2309
01:26:33,658 --> 01:26:35,658
They're really good at being secretaries.

2310
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:37,928
You know after opening the automatic door?

2311
01:26:38,098 --> 01:26:40,897
The first to press the switch inside again...

2312
01:26:40,898 --> 01:26:42,498
was Seo Jin.

2313
01:26:42,798 --> 01:26:44,344
So that the door would close automatically.

2314
01:26:44,368 --> 01:26:46,298
That's second nature to him.

2315
01:26:47,638 --> 01:26:49,067
Baby's best scene...

2316
01:26:49,068 --> 01:26:50,707
was when it was cold earlier.

2317
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:51,837
It was freezing cold,

2318
01:26:51,838 --> 01:26:54,107
but he took off his jacket for me.

2319
01:26:54,108 --> 01:26:55,777
- It's okay.
- You'll catch a cold.

2320
01:26:55,778 --> 01:26:57,077
You're old now.

2321
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,778
Here, madam.

2322
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:01,217
It was cold, so I felt bad for him.

2323
01:27:01,218 --> 01:27:04,488
(The Grumpy Secretaries warmed up My Star's day.)

2324
01:27:05,518 --> 01:27:08,558
(A day that filled both the stomach and the heart)

2325
01:27:08,758 --> 01:27:10,078
How many meals did you eat today?

2326
01:27:10,688 --> 01:27:13,057
The only proper meal I had today was one.

2327
01:27:13,058 --> 01:27:14,778
(The only proper meal I had today was one.)

2328
01:27:14,868 --> 01:27:16,367
The rest were in-flight meals,

2329
01:27:16,368 --> 01:27:18,038
snacks,

2330
01:27:18,298 --> 01:27:19,298
and such.

2331
01:27:19,368 --> 01:27:21,237
It was like a taste test to see...

2332
01:27:21,238 --> 01:27:23,337
- which ones to take home.
- Like a sample.

2333
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:25,784
Yes, what else is there to do when the fritters are being fried?

2334
01:27:25,808 --> 01:27:27,848
- We ate so as not to waste time...
- Is that so?

2335
01:27:27,908 --> 01:27:29,248
While waiting.

2336
01:27:30,408 --> 01:27:31,448
It's like you're pregnant.

2337
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:38,317
(An unfamiliar car is waiting before the Grumpy Secretaries.)

2338
01:27:38,318 --> 01:27:39,518
- Hi.
- Hi.

2339
01:27:39,558 --> 01:27:41,327
- Hi.
- Hi.

2340
01:27:41,328 --> 01:27:43,888
(Han Ji Min, the next My Star)

2341
01:27:44,028 --> 01:27:45,857
- Thank you for coming.
- Nice to meet you.

2342
01:27:45,858 --> 01:27:46,997
(Appearing with a bright smile)

2343
01:27:46,998 --> 01:27:48,828
- Is it okay to video you?
- Yes.

2344
01:27:48,868 --> 01:27:50,067
Let's have an interview...

2345
01:27:50,068 --> 01:27:51,467
- near that building.
- Sure.

2346
01:27:51,468 --> 01:27:53,267
- How about we walk over there?
- Okay.

2347
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:54,484
(Arrived first for the interview)

2348
01:27:54,508 --> 01:27:57,267
- Ever since the show started, - Yes?

2349
01:27:57,268 --> 01:27:58,908
We received many comments.

2350
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:01,647
- Here are some screenshots of them.
- Really?

2351
01:28:01,648 --> 01:28:03,408
(Passing on the comments)

2352
01:28:03,908 --> 01:28:05,448
"Lee Seo Jin isn't working much."

2353
01:28:05,548 --> 01:28:07,618
"If only Han Ji Min would come and discipline him."

2354
01:28:07,718 --> 01:28:10,487
"It'd be funny if Han Ji Min bullied Lee Seo Jin full-on."

2355
01:28:10,488 --> 01:28:12,258
(A complete turnaround)

2356
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,787
"Lee Seo Jin bullied Han Ji Min so much."

2357
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:14,888
"Let's have a return game."

2358
01:28:15,158 --> 01:28:16,358
But...

2359
01:28:16,388 --> 01:28:19,128
How do all the people know how much he bullies me?

2360
01:28:19,228 --> 01:28:20,497
The shows...

2361
01:28:20,498 --> 01:28:21,997
only revealed the tip of the iceberg.

2362
01:28:21,998 --> 01:28:23,668
How did everyone catch that?

2363
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:26,538
You could say we were in an ill-fated relationship...

2364
01:28:26,998 --> 01:28:28,237
in our previous life.

2365
01:28:28,238 --> 01:28:30,737
(Ill-fated relationship in our previous life)

2366
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:33,337
It was the production presentation for "Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

2367
01:28:33,338 --> 01:28:34,877
He called me "hobbit" before all the reporters.

2368
01:28:34,878 --> 01:28:36,177
(He called me "hobbit.")

2369
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:38,118
It's not like he's huge or anything,

2370
01:28:38,178 --> 01:28:41,088
but he called me a hobbit. One of the hobbits.

2371
01:28:41,118 --> 01:28:44,757
When I passed by the hall in MBC,

2372
01:28:44,758 --> 01:28:46,317
he made me trip out of nowhere...

2373
01:28:46,318 --> 01:28:47,488
when I was wearing a hanbok.

2374
01:28:47,828 --> 01:28:49,158
He dragged me around.

2375
01:28:49,458 --> 01:28:50,758
Regardless of the others' eyes.

2376
01:28:51,298 --> 01:28:53,157
But why isn't anyone criticizing him?

2377
01:28:53,158 --> 01:28:54,374
(Why isn't anyone criticizing him?)

2378
01:28:54,398 --> 01:28:55,528
That's what amazes me.

2379
01:28:55,628 --> 01:28:58,167
He only thinks about himself, does whatever he wants,

2380
01:28:58,168 --> 01:29:00,768
earns money without doing anything,

2381
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:02,038
and more.

2382
01:29:02,138 --> 01:29:03,267
Had I met him when I was older,

2383
01:29:03,268 --> 01:29:04,938
more of an adult,

2384
01:29:05,078 --> 01:29:07,078
I wouldn't have let him have his way.

2385
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:08,478
That's why today...

2386
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,547
you don't have to treat him like you normally treat...

2387
01:29:11,548 --> 01:29:13,377
- your manager.
- Okay.

2388
01:29:13,378 --> 01:29:14,487
Be severe.

2389
01:29:14,488 --> 01:29:15,817
(Treat him severely.)

2390
01:29:15,818 --> 01:29:17,217
It won't be easy...

2391
01:29:17,218 --> 01:29:19,657
to get revenge in one day for all the past years.

2392
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:20,787
Is it too short?

2393
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:22,627
In a drama, I threw away coffee if it wasn't...

2394
01:29:22,628 --> 01:29:23,828
at the perfect temperature.

2395
01:29:24,598 --> 01:29:25,897
The qualifications of a skilled secretary.

2396
01:29:25,898 --> 01:29:27,828
Don't criticize me...

2397
01:29:28,028 --> 01:29:29,568
for doing my job properly.

2398
01:29:30,938 --> 01:29:32,838
An interview before the actual shoot?

2399
01:29:33,138 --> 01:29:34,138
Where is she?

2400
01:29:35,138 --> 01:29:36,437
- Why are you late?
- What are you doing?

2401
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:39,677
(Why are you late?)

2402
01:29:39,678 --> 01:29:41,547
- Late, my foot.
- I said not to be late yesterday.

2403
01:29:41,548 --> 01:29:45,348
(Han Ji Min's Revenge Day coming soon.)
