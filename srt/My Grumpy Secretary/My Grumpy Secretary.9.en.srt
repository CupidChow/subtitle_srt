1
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:12,733
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,973
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

3
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:21,613
(The leaves have fallen, and it is now between fall and winter.)

4
00:00:22,943 --> 00:00:28,423
(With the cold wind these days, it feels a bit sentimental.)

5
00:00:29,353 --> 00:00:31,153
We should be in some place like a park.

6
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:32,823
You know, like fall in New York.

7
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:34,963
As it is fall,

8
00:00:35,263 --> 00:00:37,993
I thought of doing something...

9
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:39,433
that captures the fall spirit.

10
00:00:39,493 --> 00:00:42,433
(My Star, Lee Mi Sook)

11
00:00:43,063 --> 00:00:46,273
(Meanwhile, the secretaries came to work hand-in-hand.)

12
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,843
Have you met her before?

13
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:52,573
Recently, I met her at an awards ceremony and said hello.

14
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:55,083
I don't think she'll remember. There were so many people.

15
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:58,653
I checked your filmography,

16
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,113
and you acted in "Phoenix" together.

17
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:01,353
No, I didn't.

18
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,793
- Her "Phoenix" is a different one.
- Is it?

19
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:05,353
- It's different one?
- Yes.

20
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:07,263
I saw "Phoenix" in the list.

21
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:09,363
- That isn't you?
- No, it's not.

22
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:11,933
I only saw her once long time ago at a premiere.

23
00:01:12,893 --> 00:01:15,233
The one she was in was the original "Phoenix."

24
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:16,873
- Right.
- You know the original work.

25
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,433
- Choi In Ho's novel, "Phoenix." - Right.

26
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:20,073
- Is that the original work?
- Yes.

27
00:01:20,073 --> 00:01:21,473
(How do the Grumpy Secretary remember My Star Lee Mi Sook?)

28
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:25,143
(As a legendary femme fatale?)

29
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:29,013
(As the nation's 1st love of the 1980s?)

30
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:33,953
(Who is My Star for Seo Jin?)

31
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,553
It's Lee Mi Sook. It's just Lee Mi Sook.

32
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:38,593
She's just Lee Mi Sook that I remember in my childhood.

33
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:40,823
I think there is something like that.

34
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:43,863
(Movie, "Whale Hunting," 1984)

35
00:01:43,863 --> 00:01:45,993
I keep on saying, she is Bae Chang Ho's muse.

36
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,663
All of Bae Chang Ho's movies has Lee Mi Sook in it.

37
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,833
When I was in school...

38
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,303
When I was a student, she was a top star.

39
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:57,143
(And her prime time as hot as summer arrived soon.)

40
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,513
My favourite work was...

41
00:02:00,113 --> 00:02:01,483
"Wanderer in Winter."

42
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:03,613
I can't forget "Wanderer in Winter."

43
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:05,613
And another one that made an impression was...

44
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:07,223
"Mulberry."

45
00:02:08,283 --> 00:02:09,923
("Mulberry," a controversial work that shook the hearts and minds...)

46
00:02:09,923 --> 00:02:10,953
(of young Kwang Kyu and the times.)

47
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:13,193
No actress in the country had...

48
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:14,893
a nose like hers.

49
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:19,663
So really she had that fantasy of an actress.

50
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,563
I'm a real fan and I'm having the butterflies.

51
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,633
I do have fantasies.

52
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:27,973
It was a fantasy of my young days.

53
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,243
She is such a pretty celebrity.

54
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:34,513
(Holding a bouquet of fluttering dimples)

55
00:02:34,783 --> 00:02:36,083
(Arrived at the place where My Star awaits.)

56
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:37,113
What place is this?

57
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:39,253
- I think she's working out.
- I see.

58
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:41,683
(This is a fitness center.)

59
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:47,493
(My Star is working out hard right now.)

60
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:48,663
She's working out.

61
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,393
She must be doing pilates.

62
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:51,793
No, it's personal training.

63
00:02:51,993 --> 00:02:53,333
- Personal training.
- I see.

64
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:56,303
(They can't approach closer worried they might interrupt her.)

65
00:02:56,303 --> 00:02:57,303
Why is it like this?

66
00:02:58,233 --> 00:03:02,173
(The Grumpy Secretaries are standing afar and sneak peaking their idol.)

67
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:07,643
(Lee Mi Sook, the fantasy they liked, is in front of them.)

68
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:10,883
(She still doesn't know Grumpy Secretary is there.)

69
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:13,583
They have arrived and are waiting.

70
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,223
Really? They are here?

71
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:18,023
- Let me see.
- Hello.

72
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:19,623
Hello.

73
00:03:19,823 --> 00:03:22,023
- Please continue with your workout.
- Please.

74
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:24,263
How are you?

75
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:26,563
(The idol comes over and gives a warm hug to Grumpy Secretary.)

76
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:28,003
What are you saying?

77
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:29,703
(The idol comes over and gives a warm hug to Grumpy Secretary.)

78
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:31,633
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

79
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:32,903
(Naturally, the hands come together.)

80
00:03:33,273 --> 00:03:36,243
- They said we're doing this today.
- Yes.

81
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:39,113
You're spending a day with me regardless.

82
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:40,783
- Yes.
- So...

83
00:03:41,313 --> 00:03:44,453
I need to interview you to see if you are qualified.

84
00:03:44,913 --> 00:03:46,913
(Suddenly)

85
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:49,283
(An interview?)

86
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:50,793
(An unexpected controversy on qualification)

87
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:53,863
Think about it. Aren't you two having it too easy?

88
00:03:54,463 --> 00:03:55,563
Isn't it too easy?

89
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:57,163
(My Star has her own firm standard.)

90
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:59,093
So I'm going to interview you.

91
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:01,333
I have a standard...

92
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,433
(A cut-off crisis after 9 episodes)

93
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:05,303
- for a manager of my own.
- Yes.

94
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:08,543
So I'm going to check a couple of them in an interview. Is that fine?

95
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:09,573
- Yes.
- Well...

96
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:10,543
if you are uncomfortable with it, you don't have to do it.

97
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:12,243
You can stop with the shooting if you're uncomfortable.

98
00:04:12,243 --> 00:04:13,313
We can stop.

99
00:04:13,613 --> 00:04:14,983
- It's okay.
- What do you think about it?

100
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,413
We're worried we might not be qualified.

101
00:04:17,513 --> 00:04:18,853
- Of course you won't be.
- Right.

102
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:20,523
I'll adjust a few for you.

103
00:04:20,523 --> 00:04:21,883
- I'll adjust a few...
- Yes.

104
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,823
and we'll see.

105
00:04:23,823 --> 00:04:25,023
Anyway, everything's good.

106
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:28,093
- Well, let's go to the room first.
- Okay.

107
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:30,533
Take a seat. First off...

108
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:32,563
(The interview room that will decide the fate of Grumpy Secretary.)

109
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:33,803
(Swiping)

110
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,033
Shall I get you a cup of water?

111
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,273
- No, I have a drink here.
- Okay.

112
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,433
I wrote down a few questions.

113
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:40,743
- You wrote them down?
- Of course.

114
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:44,873
(Questions packed in like a love letter.)

115
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:48,413
(My Star is serious about the interview.)

116
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,683
I had many questions I wanted to ask personally.

117
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:52,683
Yes.

118
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,883
(Nervous)

119
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:58,423
First, I'll be asking such questions.

120
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:01,323
(Heart thumping.)

121
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:03,793
Lee Seo Jin is not that old.

122
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:06,993
What zodiac sign are you?

123
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:08,803
What zodiac sign are you?

124
00:05:10,973 --> 00:05:13,843
I was born in the year of the dog.

125
00:05:14,003 --> 00:05:15,143
- Year of the dog?
- Yes.

126
00:05:16,203 --> 00:05:17,313
Year of the dog.

127
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:19,743
We're compatible.

128
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,383
(We're compatible.)

129
00:05:23,243 --> 00:05:24,783
I'm checking for compatibility.

130
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,053
I don't check MBTIs and such.

131
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:27,583
(Job interview that checks for compatibility of zodiac signs?)

132
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,753
- What blood type are you?
- It's A.

133
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:31,493
I'm A as well.

134
00:05:32,393 --> 00:05:33,523
That's perfect.

135
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:35,023
(That's perfect.)

136
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:39,633
My blood type is B.

137
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:41,733
- You are?
- Of course.

138
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,903
Blood types B and A go well together.

139
00:05:45,273 --> 00:05:48,603
(This is somewhat a fresh job interview.)

140
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:49,903
What kind of food do you like?

141
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:52,013
I thought about all this yesterday.

142
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:54,583
- I like Korean and Chinese food.
- Okay.

143
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,113
I make a good soybean paste stew.

144
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:58,013
Right. I like it.

145
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:02,223
(The Star is appealing her qualification to the manager.)

146
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,723
Kwang Kyu likes kimchi stew.

147
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:05,293
Then what's your hobby?

148
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:06,353
You own your place, right?

149
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:07,863
What are you going to do about your dimples?

150
00:06:09,263 --> 00:06:11,263
The dimples are getting deeper as I get older.

151
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:12,763
I know, that's a shame.

152
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:15,103
- Those dimples...
- As I'm losing fat in the face...

153
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,303
Then would you be careless...

154
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:20,403
when you meet such a senior actor for the first time?

155
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:21,873
That's not the right thing to do.

156
00:06:21,873 --> 00:06:24,443
But she had a lot of questions she wanted to ask.

157
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:27,013
(Endless questions are asked)

158
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,213
Who's your ideal type?

159
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:31,213
- Lee Mi Sook.
- Is it?

160
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:32,483
(Lee Mi Sook)

161
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:35,853
(Ideal answer)

162
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,223
Don't say that here. Say that elsewhere.

163
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:40,563
My ideal type from a young age is Lee Mi Sook.

164
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:42,663
You know, "Wanderer in Winter."

165
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:43,893
Rather than things like "Mulberry."

166
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:45,663
Do you know who was in "Wanderer in Winter?"

167
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:46,693
Of course I do.

168
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,533
- Who are they?
- Kang Seok Woo.

169
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,963
- Yes?
- Lee Mi Sook.

170
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:51,733
- Lee Hae Young.
- Good.

171
00:06:53,133 --> 00:06:54,403
You are old.

172
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:55,743
I am.

173
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,073
You're like an older sister to be honest.

174
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:01,343
- Really?
- Of course.

175
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:02,913
You didn't even ask my age.

176
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:04,953
- "Wanderer in Winter" is...
- I didn't even ask his age.

177
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,253
"Wanderer in Winter" is something everyone knows...

178
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:09,883
- Yes, I know the movie.
- You saw it when you were young.

179
00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:11,453
If you remember that much,

180
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:12,593
- are you around my age?
- I remember it all too, though.

181
00:07:12,593 --> 00:07:15,563
The image of Lee Mi Sook from that time...

182
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:17,593
and her image now is completely different.

183
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:20,393
- Really?
- You are a real fan.

184
00:07:20,393 --> 00:07:21,933
In "Wanderer in Winter,"

185
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:25,473
- she looked really innocent.
- Really?

186
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,943
And from all the celebrities,

187
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:29,803
she is the most beautiful.

188
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:31,843
And from a young age, Lee Mi Sook was my ideal type.

189
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:33,513
How much wealth do you have?

190
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,683
I don't have much.

191
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:36,713
- You don't?
- No.

192
00:07:36,713 --> 00:07:38,283
- You don't own a house?
- I do have a house.

193
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:39,783
- If you have a house, that's good.
- I own my house.

194
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,623
- You said you like kimchi stew?
- Yes.

195
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:43,683
- I'll try to learn how to cook it.
- Right.

196
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:45,623
- I'll try.
- Kimchi Stew.

197
00:07:45,623 --> 00:07:47,463
- Your ideal type is me, right?
- Yes.

198
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:50,933
(Let's make this work Grumpy Secretary)

199
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,963
When I'm done with workout today,

200
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:56,533
I have a personal schedule.

201
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:59,773
(Today is My Star's personal schedule day.)

202
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:02,403
I have a drama that I'm shooting these days.

203
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:03,743
Is that with Kang Seok Woo?

204
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:04,843
- Yes.
- Are you in the middle of shooting?

205
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:06,073
I am shooting it now.

206
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:10,083
An MBC drama, "In Your Brilliant Season," on Fridays, and Saturdays.

207
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:11,653
My role is a fashion designer.

208
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:14,153
(Her role is the first generation fashion designer in Korea.)

209
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,453
So, I...

210
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:19,153
I need to visit a vintage store...

211
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,293
to find some outfits for the role.

212
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,223
- Clothes.
- Vintage clothes, right.

213
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:25,033
(She wants to find outfits that fits her role as a fashion designer.)

214
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:26,363
- Then what kind of...
- Do I need to go to Europe?

215
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,633
(Europe all of a sudden?)

216
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,333
- Shall we go to Europe?
- No...

217
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,873
There are some antique shops in Itaewon.

218
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:32,933
Really? Have you been?

219
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,943
- I always pass by it.
- I've never been to places like it.

220
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:36,603
It's called antique street.

221
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,843
It can't be vintages from Nagwon Arcade, can it?

222
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:40,213
Isn't that a rice cake place?

223
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:41,583
- Rice cake store.
- Well...

224
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:44,483
There are vintage stores...

225
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,683
They have vintage clothing there?

226
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:48,123
I've never heard of that before.

227
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:49,353
Can you take responsibility for your words?

228
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:50,753
No, I can't.

229
00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:53,993
I've never been there. I just heard about it.

230
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:55,793
We could visit there,

231
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:58,463
and when do we eat lunch?

232
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,833
It's twelve.

233
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,033
What would you like to eat?

234
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,733
Today, I feel like...

235
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,733
- going to a park...
- A park?

236
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,303
like the fall in New York.

237
00:09:07,573 --> 00:09:09,143
- A park?
- Like the fall in New York.

238
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:13,373
(The weather outside currently)

239
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,553
Don't you feel like eating on the ground...

240
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:18,813
covered with leaves?

241
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:23,953
(The ground situation currently)

242
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:27,253
The ground is a bit undesirable.

243
00:09:27,723 --> 00:09:29,123
Benches are okay.

244
00:09:29,123 --> 00:09:30,563
But isn't the ground a bit too much?

245
00:09:30,563 --> 00:09:32,193
- Now is not...
- But...

246
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:35,003
letting the fall leave like this... Don't you have the fall blues?

247
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:37,233
Isn't fall really great?

248
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:43,173
As it is fall, you know something that could capture the fall spirit.

249
00:09:43,303 --> 00:09:45,073
You know, if you like the park in the streets,

250
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:46,613
and you have a drink while eating,

251
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:47,813
you end up being there.

252
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:51,153
We are managers, so we need to drive.

253
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,353
- I'll call a driver for you.
- Right.

254
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:58,453
- That's great for us then.
- We could...

255
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,593
do something spontaneously.

256
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:02,463
I think it'll be great for us to experience deviating for a bit.

257
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:03,723
- It's great.
- Don't you think so?

258
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:06,993
(Little did he know that he will regret saying that.)

259
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,133
(The sky is so beautiful.)

260
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:10,663
(When the sun sets later...)

261
00:10:10,663 --> 00:10:13,133
(I think I'm going to cry a little.)

262
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,043
(Spacing out)

263
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:16,573
(Did you see the sky?)

264
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,743
(The eyes lost the gaze trying to find sensibility.)

265
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:20,883
(There's a leaf.)

266
00:10:21,313 --> 00:10:25,453
(A very emotional My Star's fall outing)

267
00:10:25,683 --> 00:10:28,453
(Shaking her fall sensibility is...)

268
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,223
(the construction view.)

269
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:32,293
(Guys, let's take a picture.)

270
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:33,823
(Trembling)

271
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,993
(You know emotion may be more difficult than passion.)

272
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:38,563
(You talked behind my back, didn't you?)

273
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:39,563
(You badmouthed about me, didn't you?)

274
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:43,103
(In the end, she even rejected shooting.)

275
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,973
(Change)

276
00:10:45,433 --> 00:10:48,243
(What will be the outcome of this emotional caretaking?)

277
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,473
Don't you want to eat on the ground...

278
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:51,773
in a park somewhere?

279
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,113
(Now, lunch at a New York-like park)

280
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:55,143
Which shoes did you wear?

281
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,713
(Which shoes did you wear?)

282
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,353
Did someone leave with my shoes?

283
00:10:58,413 --> 00:11:00,113
Which one is it? Are they dress shoes or sneakers?

284
00:11:00,113 --> 00:11:01,923
- No, they are sneakers.
- Sneakers?

285
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:02,953
They are here.

286
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:08,493
(My Stars feelings seem to change often.)

287
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:11,463
What is this?

288
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:12,733
It's a manager's bag.

289
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,363
What is in it?

290
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:15,603
Can I get you some water?

291
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:18,803
What?

292
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:21,243
- Can I...
- You have a can in there?

293
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,843
(Fiddling with water)

294
00:11:23,843 --> 00:11:25,243
Can I get you some water?

295
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,313
(Can I get you some water?)

296
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:29,813
- It's not "Can I..." - Then what is it?

297
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:33,013
It should be "Do you want..."

298
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:34,883
- Do you want water?
- Now you remember?

299
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:39,493
Gosh. It's really fall.

300
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,623
(Glancing)

301
00:11:43,593 --> 00:11:47,433
(Current street situation)

302
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,333
It feels like winter today.

303
00:11:49,963 --> 00:11:51,373
It's so cold today.

304
00:11:51,373 --> 00:11:52,473
(Laughing)

305
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:54,303
- It's fall.
- You shouldn't go to the park.

306
00:11:54,303 --> 00:11:56,303
- No.
- Yes?

307
00:11:56,303 --> 00:11:57,303
It's so cold today.

308
00:11:57,303 --> 00:11:58,713
- Why?
- It's winter.

309
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:01,213
You should think about the time when we were cold and hungry.

310
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:03,243
You don't have to bring those memories back.

311
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:04,353
No.

312
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,813
But you never had a time when you were cold and hungry.

313
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:09,323
- I did.
- You had a main role in your debut.

314
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:10,723
You've been doing this for a long time.

315
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:13,153
(Taking the lint off My Star who became embarrassed)

316
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:15,023
You should do things like that. Okay?

317
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:17,393
Should I put on some lint on purpose?

318
00:12:17,463 --> 00:12:19,163
People don't like it when I do it.

319
00:12:19,163 --> 00:12:21,233
No, they won't.

320
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,863
"You little..." How's this?

321
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:25,273
Do you want to die?

322
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,903
Did you search for a park?

323
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:31,243
I did find one.

324
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,913
(Entering the address for the park)

325
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:35,043
There is this where you can plug your phone in.

326
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:38,083
- Can we go?
- Turn right.

327
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:41,323
We'll leave.

328
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:43,223
You already left, what do you mean you're leaving now?

329
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:45,123
Your actions and words don't match.

330
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:50,193
(My Star likes consistency between words and actions.)

331
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,293
Gosh, it's so narrow.

332
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,303
This is scary.

333
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:56,503
(That's so close.)

334
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,633
- You have to turn. Turn.
- No, wait.

335
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,543
You can turn. No, the other side.

336
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:02,573
(Observing carefully)

337
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:05,013
- I live in Gwangju.
- Yes.

338
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:07,943
Since I spend so much time in the car,

339
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:12,353
the first thing I ask of my manager are...

340
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:14,153
keeping time...

341
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,323
and whether they could drive gently.

342
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:20,123
Since I spend a lot of time in the car...

343
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:21,593
If the drive is bumpy,

344
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,963
you become nauseated.

345
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:27,263
(Overcoming the enormous burden, they got out safely.)

346
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,963
- If you could pass this, - Turn.

347
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:31,003
it's a free pass.

348
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:33,573
(Proud)

349
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:37,743
- Isn't the weather so nice?
- Yes.

350
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,543
- It's cold.
- Let's go to the park.

351
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:41,483
(Let's go to the park.)

352
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:45,213
There isn't a park like the one in Manhattan.

353
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:46,253
Shall we go to Yeouido?

354
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,083
Mala soup is...

355
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,323
Mala soup?

356
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:51,893
- in the intersection of Customs...
- You have hearing problems.

357
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:53,453
- Manhattan.
- Manhattan?

358
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:56,193
- Where did Mala soup come from?
- I thought she said Mala soup.

359
00:13:56,193 --> 00:13:57,863
- I thought Mala soup...
- What do you mean Mala soup?

360
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:58,963
I thought she wanted to eat Mala soup.

361
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,963
(Fall Kwang Kyu's appetite is overflowing today as well.)

362
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,433
I'm sorry.

363
00:14:02,263 --> 00:14:03,803
I was going to mention a restaurant I knew.

364
00:14:03,863 --> 00:14:06,073
- That was too much.
- When you said...

365
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:07,873
- "Autumn in New York" earlier...
- Yes?

366
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:12,513
This one time before, my girlfriend at the time saw the movie...

367
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:15,183
and wanted to go to New York so much that we left for it right away.

368
00:14:15,683 --> 00:14:16,883
We went to Manhattan in fall.

369
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:19,413
- To go to Central Park.
- Right.

370
00:14:19,413 --> 00:14:20,413
(To go to Central Park)

371
00:14:20,413 --> 00:14:21,783
- I didn't understand that well.
- Yes?

372
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:24,523
She liked it so much.

373
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:27,253
- Right.
- Having gone to Central Park...

374
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:29,363
and walking and all.

375
00:14:30,863 --> 00:14:33,833
(Seo Jin has a memory in Central Park.)

376
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,563
- Women like that.
- Yes.

377
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:37,133
They do like it.

378
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:40,173
Don't men usually say they like fall?

379
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:43,103
Men do.

380
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:46,013
I like summer.

381
00:14:46,573 --> 00:14:48,083
- Really?
- Yes.

382
00:14:48,783 --> 00:14:50,183
I like spring.

383
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:51,953
That's amazing.

384
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:54,523
When fall arrives,

385
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,023
I don't like that the winter coming so soon.

386
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:59,693
I don't like being cold.

387
00:14:59,693 --> 00:15:03,563
(I see.)

388
00:15:03,563 --> 00:15:05,863
I really like fall.

389
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:07,363
I don't like that I get a year older...

390
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:09,163
when fall comes.

391
00:15:09,163 --> 00:15:11,203
Really? That's how you think?

392
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,933
Fall...

393
00:15:13,403 --> 00:15:17,743
I get especially sentimental in fall.

394
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:19,973
You know, when cold wind blows,

395
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:24,453
and it passes your sides like a sharp knife.

396
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,083
All sudden. Have you never felt that?

397
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:29,683
- If you are driving, - Yes?

398
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:34,393
between 5 and 6pm, when the sun is setting.

399
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:36,363
That's great. The view is...

400
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:38,693
No, it's not about the view.

401
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:41,503
- I mean, such feelings...
- That feeling...

402
00:15:41,903 --> 00:15:45,173
Those who like summers don't feel this.

403
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:46,303
(Emotional Mi Sook finds rational Seo Jin frustrating.)

404
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,043
I thought we'll hit it off.

405
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:50,503
I make you feel it today.

406
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:52,743
How cold fall is.

407
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:56,883
From how I see it, she's sentimental in all the seasons.

408
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:58,983
People like her become sentimental...

409
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:00,913
when it's spring, summer,

410
00:16:00,913 --> 00:16:03,153
fall, and winter. Everything.

411
00:16:03,623 --> 00:16:05,223
She won't be sentimental just in fall.

412
00:16:06,193 --> 00:16:08,923
(Glancing)

413
00:16:08,923 --> 00:16:11,593
All that over there are leaves in the garbage bag.

414
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:12,763
Of course.

415
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,733
(She found a bag full of leaves.)

416
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:15,933
Shall we take one with us?

417
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:19,103
They are clean, aren't they?

418
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,903
There are some leaves over there. Would you like to step on them?

419
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:24,373
Shall I open the door for you?

420
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:28,283
Or we don't take the leaves out of the bag...

421
00:16:28,283 --> 00:16:30,013
and just put my foot in the bag.

422
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:32,553
Those leaves are clean.

423
00:16:33,313 --> 00:16:35,923
Isn't there a song that sings about leaves?

424
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,123
There is.

425
00:16:37,383 --> 00:16:39,193
- I'll sing it for you.
- Sing it.

426
00:16:39,593 --> 00:16:42,993
(In the fall where the leaves fall)

427
00:16:43,223 --> 00:16:46,833
(At the blue seaside)

428
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:49,533
(You who held my shaking hand)

429
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:50,703
I know that one.

430
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:52,803
You should sing one too.

431
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,303
Does "Paulownia Leaf" count?

432
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:58,613
- "Paulownia Leaf." Start.
- Does that count as well?

433
00:16:59,373 --> 00:17:00,943
- How do you sing it?
- One two Paulownia Leaves

434
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:01,943
(Plays right away)

435
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:03,313
- How...
- Choi Heon.

436
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,583
- Mr. Choi Heon.
- One two Paulownia Leaves

437
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:07,513
(One two Paulownia Leaves)

438
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:09,583
(Absorbed)

439
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,053
Leaves.

440
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:13,193
There are? You guys are now...

441
00:17:13,193 --> 00:17:14,493
so into leaves.

442
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:16,223
Yes, leaves worked.

443
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,393
Do you want to go to karaoke?

444
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:21,603
(Unpredictable My Star's mood)

445
00:17:25,573 --> 00:17:29,543
(My Star who was looking for leaves, suddenly became quiet.)

446
00:17:31,143 --> 00:17:32,773
Gosh, the sky is so pretty.

447
00:17:34,373 --> 00:17:36,183
(Is it the sky this time?)

448
00:17:36,183 --> 00:17:37,283
Did you see the sky?

449
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,113
- Yes, I'm looking at it.
- You aren't, are you?

450
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,253
(The eyes are busy.)

451
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,683
- You aren't, are you?
- I'm looking at it.

452
00:17:43,853 --> 00:17:46,253
But the wind must be really strong. The clouds are moving fast.

453
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:47,963
Exactly. The sky is so clean.

454
00:17:47,963 --> 00:17:50,993
I think I'm going to cry when the sun sets.

455
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:52,093
I think I'm going to tear up.

456
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:54,863
(Laughing)

457
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:56,633
(Laughing)

458
00:17:56,633 --> 00:17:57,803
Right.

459
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:00,903
I really hate sunsets and all.

460
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,043
(Rational Seo Jin is slowly getting tired of emotional caretaking.)

461
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:05,743
- Isn't the weather so nice?
- Yes, it is.

462
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:08,843
Let's get hamburgers. How is that?

463
00:18:10,013 --> 00:18:11,883
But there isn't a park that we could go to.

464
00:18:12,013 --> 00:18:14,383
- There is.
- What about Dosan Park?

465
00:18:14,523 --> 00:18:15,583
Why aren't there any parks?

466
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:17,423
- There isn't one?
- There's Dosan Park.

467
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,193
No, Dosan Park is too far.

468
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:20,923
- It's far?
- Search for one in Nonhyeon-dong.

469
00:18:20,923 --> 00:18:21,923
(It's right in the middle of Nonhyeon-dong here.)

470
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:23,693
Is there one that's the closest?

471
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:25,433
- Nonhyeon Mognyeon Park.
- Is there one?

472
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:27,363
- There is Nonhyeon Mognyeon Park.
- How far is it?

473
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:29,333
It's 200m away. It's a 4-minute walk.

474
00:18:29,433 --> 00:18:30,633
Let's walk.

475
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:31,973
(He turned on the map.)

476
00:18:31,973 --> 00:18:33,473
You know how to use such a thing.

477
00:18:33,473 --> 00:18:35,403
- Of course.
- I can't follow...

478
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:38,443
the route when I turn it on. I go to another route.

479
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:41,583
And when you go abroad, everyone turns it on...

480
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,643
- and walk around using it.
- Of course.

481
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:46,653
When I went to New York, I found my way around with it.

482
00:18:46,653 --> 00:18:48,423
- You've been to New York?
- Yes.

483
00:18:48,423 --> 00:18:50,153
I've been there once ten years ago.

484
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,623
Central Park was...

485
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,723
really cold in November.

486
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:56,623
And there are so many people in Central Park.

487
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:58,893
(They are warming up emotions talking about Central Park.)

488
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,733
(New York's Central Park, a haven within the city)

489
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,873
(New York Central Park full of fall vibes.)

490
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:10,003
(I'm a New Yorker today.)

491
00:19:11,173 --> 00:19:13,073
We are going in the right direction, right?

492
00:19:13,613 --> 00:19:15,013
- What is?
- Where is the park?

493
00:19:15,013 --> 00:19:16,643
Would a park appear in the neighbourhood?

494
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:19,313
- You are impatient.
- Would there be a park here?

495
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:21,723
It says so here.

496
00:19:21,723 --> 00:19:23,423
(He hit the point.)

497
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,793
What kind of manager...

498
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,893
treats the actor this way?

499
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,723
What do you mean?

500
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:30,323
You said I was My Star.

501
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,033
My Star, it's written here.

502
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,033
You're treating her badly, today.

503
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,433
He is, isn't he? He is treating me badly, right?

504
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,503
No, I'm not.

505
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,333
(Under construction)

506
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:43,073
So a park is here?

507
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:45,943
(Closing the eyes tightly)

508
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,273
It's here.

509
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:48,743
- Is that correct?
- It is.

510
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:49,943
We are going in the right direction.

511
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:52,383
- Can there be a park here?
- Exactly.

512
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:53,953
We're not going someone's garden, are we?

513
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:55,623
- Garden.
- Of course not.

514
00:19:55,853 --> 00:19:56,953
There it is. There.

515
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:58,423
- I think it's that tree over there.
- Over there?

516
00:19:58,423 --> 00:19:59,953
- That tree. It's a small one.
- Yes.

517
00:19:59,953 --> 00:20:01,563
I think it's a small park.

518
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:02,963
(Finally, the park is visible.)

519
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:04,963
- Then order it, quickly.
- Order what?

520
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:06,433
- Food.
- Food?

521
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,533
Let's eat pizza.

522
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:08,803
Shall we order jajangmyeon?

523
00:20:09,263 --> 00:20:10,603
Jajangmyeon is really good.

524
00:20:10,603 --> 00:20:12,503
Jajangmyeon in the park, will...

525
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,533
I wanted to try it. Would that be okay?

526
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,743
- Chicken?
- Wouldn't it be too cold...

527
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,573
to eat jajangmyeon today?

528
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:18,713
- It would be frozen.
- Yes?

529
00:20:18,713 --> 00:20:20,313
- Jajangmyeon would be frozen.
- Yes, let's not eat it.

530
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:22,213
There's an oven-baked pizza place here as well.

531
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:24,113
That looks good as well.

532
00:20:24,113 --> 00:20:25,283
(She gets easily swayed.)

533
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:27,353
I think we're almost there.

534
00:20:27,613 --> 00:20:29,023
- Is this it?
- Yes.

535
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,023
(Laughing)

536
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,093
This is just a playground.

537
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,363
This is a children's playground.

538
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:37,523
It's just a playground.

539
00:20:37,523 --> 00:20:38,693
(Is this a park?)

540
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:39,763
Wait...

541
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:42,103
What I thought was.... Fall...

542
00:20:42,103 --> 00:20:43,633
This is just a playground.

543
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:49,643
(She was looking for a park where she could enjoy fall.)

544
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:51,373
This is it?

545
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:52,513
(Emotional detachment)

546
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:54,783
It is a park.

547
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,153
- We should've gone to Dosan Park.
- Exactly.

548
00:20:58,353 --> 00:20:59,683
This was the closest one.

549
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,083
But this is a park?

550
00:21:01,453 --> 00:21:03,323
- It is one.
- I didn't...

551
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:05,123
There's a daycare center.

552
00:21:05,123 --> 00:21:07,023
So this a place in front of a daycare center...

553
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:09,223
where children can play as well.

554
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:10,393
(It's a park that is far from emotions.)

555
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:11,563
Oh, gosh.

556
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,763
(His lips are dry.)

557
00:21:15,003 --> 00:21:18,473
- Shall we leave?
- I wanted to feel the fall vibe.

558
00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:19,673
There are fall leaves though.

559
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,003
(The only thing that's greeting them...)

560
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:23,503
(are fall leaves hanging on a thin branch.)

561
00:21:23,643 --> 00:21:24,843
That place? The playground?

562
00:21:25,013 --> 00:21:26,413
It was very much like Kwang Kyu.

563
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,473
(It was very much like Kwang Kyu.)

564
00:21:27,473 --> 00:21:28,643
It was like Kwang Kyu.

565
00:21:29,183 --> 00:21:31,483
I asked, "is there a park like this in Nonhyeon-dong?"

566
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,683
And he said, there was.

567
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,423
But what do you know? It was in front of a daycare center.

568
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,493
This is...

569
00:21:38,693 --> 00:21:41,863
This was the closest park according to the map.

570
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:43,723
You wanted a park so I found one.

571
00:21:43,963 --> 00:21:45,763
You would feel a child-like emotion.

572
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:48,563
Get on.

573
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:51,333
(Shifting gears toward child-like emotions while she is here.)

574
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:53,973
(My Star requested for a child-like care.)

575
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:55,343
Kwang Kyu, are you okay with your haemorrhoids?

576
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,043
Kwang Kyu, are you okay with your haemorrhoids?

577
00:21:57,043 --> 00:21:58,173
I'm okay.

578
00:21:59,813 --> 00:22:03,013
(If My Star wants it, why would haemorrhoids matter?)

579
00:22:03,813 --> 00:22:06,153
Didn't we sing some song when riding this as a kid?

580
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:08,013
(They are on the see-saw for now.)

581
00:22:08,723 --> 00:22:11,023
(Looking away)

582
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:14,423
It was about a toad or something.

583
00:22:14,423 --> 00:22:15,823
This is a park?

584
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:17,093
(She asks again.)

585
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:20,433
I wanted to feel fall vibes.

586
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,133
(Reading her mood)

587
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,303
Then let's ride the slide there.

588
00:22:23,303 --> 00:22:24,363
It's not bad.

589
00:22:24,933 --> 00:22:26,073
Come here.

590
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:29,743
(My Star is riding everything when she says she doesn't like it.)

591
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:31,813
Let's play Chunhyang. Come, quick.

592
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:34,173
(Chunhyang?)

593
00:22:34,173 --> 00:22:35,343
Come, quick.

594
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,883
This is fun. Order the food.

595
00:22:38,013 --> 00:22:39,613
- Do we really order the food here?
- Yes.

596
00:22:39,913 --> 00:22:41,183
Will you be okay here?

597
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:44,553
(Will you be okay here?)

598
00:22:44,793 --> 00:22:46,123
Order food?

599
00:22:47,993 --> 00:22:49,393
We'll order it here and eat over there.

600
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,593
- Here?
- Yes.

601
00:22:50,593 --> 00:22:51,963
(Yes, why?)

602
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,593
- Can we eat here?
- Where are you going to eat here?

603
00:22:55,663 --> 00:22:57,603
- Let's eat under the fall sunlight.
- Okay.

604
00:22:57,763 --> 00:22:59,033
Then...

605
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:01,173
Let's play Chunhyang. Let's go.

606
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:04,473
Young Master.

607
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:05,813
(Young Master)

608
00:23:06,073 --> 00:23:07,443
Young Master.

609
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:08,843
(Young Master)

610
00:23:08,843 --> 00:23:11,513
(His mouth opens wide carelessly.)

611
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:16,023
(Chunhyang is having fun along with the fall breeze.)

612
00:23:16,323 --> 00:23:17,623
This place is nice.

613
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:20,023
- Are you here alone?
- Young Master.

614
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:21,223
Are you here alone?

615
00:23:21,223 --> 00:23:22,693
(- Young Master. - Are you here alone?)

616
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,333
(She's enjoying the careless humour.)

617
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,033
This is really fun.

618
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,233
(Bang Ja Kwang Kyu's playground flirting)

619
00:23:31,133 --> 00:23:33,633
Mi Sook, I think it'll be better if we eat at the pizza place.

620
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:34,843
- Is it?
- Yes.

621
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:36,603
- I don't know.
- You could come out here again.

622
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:37,703
- No, I don't want to.
- Excuse me?

623
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:38,843
I'm going to stay here.

624
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:40,343
- No, I don't want to.
- Excuse me?

625
00:23:40,343 --> 00:23:41,513
I'm going to stay here.

626
00:23:41,913 --> 00:23:44,283
I'll go and order the food.

627
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:46,383
- And you could come later.
- Really?

628
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:49,023
This is really fun.

629
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:50,883
Right.

630
00:23:51,323 --> 00:23:53,923
I think it's going to be better if you eat at the pizza place.

631
00:23:53,923 --> 00:23:54,993
The oven-baked pizza?

632
00:23:54,993 --> 00:23:56,423
- Oven-baked pizza is good, right?
- Yes.

633
00:23:56,823 --> 00:23:59,433
It seems like our mouths will freeze, doesn't it?

634
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,163
It's cold.

635
00:24:01,633 --> 00:24:02,833
My mouth is frozen.

636
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,833
(They agreed to go to the pizza place since it's cold.)

637
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:04,833
If you are not satisfied,

638
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:05,973
you could ride the slide one more time.

639
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:07,273
- If you are not satisfied.
- Shall I?

640
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:08,743
Come here.

641
00:24:08,743 --> 00:24:10,273
(Playground's big 3 charged them full of child-like emotions.)

642
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:12,443
- Look. We go back to our childhood.
- Yes.

643
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,213
You could slide down by sitting down.

644
00:24:15,383 --> 00:24:16,513
Oh, gosh.

645
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:17,983
Oh, gosh. You.

646
00:24:17,983 --> 00:24:19,513
- You.
- Your head.

647
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:21,453
- You.
- Your head.

648
00:24:21,453 --> 00:24:22,983
- Your head.
- You.

649
00:24:23,523 --> 00:24:24,953
You should have tilted your head back.

650
00:24:24,953 --> 00:24:26,393
- You had yours tilted forward.
- Really?

651
00:24:29,563 --> 00:24:31,193
You cleaned the dust coming down.

652
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,563
Come down. You should ride it once.

653
00:24:34,033 --> 00:24:36,433
If My Star tells me to, I should ride it.

654
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,703
Of course. Let's turn back to our childhood.

655
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:39,833
(Welcome to the children's world.)

656
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:41,643
This is...

657
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:43,043
(Screaming)

658
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:45,513
(Screaming)

659
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:48,683
(Ouch)

660
00:24:49,783 --> 00:24:50,943
(Laughing)

661
00:24:50,943 --> 00:24:52,853
This is how you ride it.

662
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:55,823
Let's go. Let's leave him here.

663
00:24:57,223 --> 00:24:58,253
We can go now.

664
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:01,093
Oh, My Star.

665
00:25:01,893 --> 00:25:03,093
This is fun.

666
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:04,123
This is really fun.

667
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:05,363
But this is a park?

668
00:25:05,593 --> 00:25:07,533
It's just a children's playground.

669
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:10,103
I should be satisfied.

670
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,573
I give up easily.

671
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,243
It was fun in a long time.

672
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:17,503
When I was younger, we didn't have slides.

673
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,613
- Then...
- It was my first time.

674
00:25:19,613 --> 00:25:21,013
(It was the first time to ride a slide.)

675
00:25:21,013 --> 00:25:22,783
I felt like being a baby for the first time today.

676
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:24,183
- "Felt like being a baby?" - Yes.

677
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,813
Make me look like a baby.

678
00:25:25,813 --> 00:25:27,953
Make me look smaller.

679
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:30,023
(Child-like energy charged)

680
00:25:30,623 --> 00:25:31,693
(Going to a pizza place instead of eating outside)

681
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,023
- This place looks good.
- It looks good.

682
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,223
They have Gorgonzola pizza.

683
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:39,993
(The advance party goes in before My Star urges them.)

684
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:42,803
- Hello.
- Hello.

685
00:25:43,303 --> 00:25:44,333
(Meanwhile, Kwang Kyu...)

686
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,373
Hey.

687
00:25:45,373 --> 00:25:47,373
(Walking slowly)

688
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:48,803
Come quickly.

689
00:25:51,073 --> 00:25:52,643
(She's waiting still but looks like she's in a hurry somehow.)

690
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:53,773
Come quickly?

691
00:25:54,313 --> 00:25:55,483
Wait...

692
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,243
(Walking slowly)

693
00:25:58,483 --> 00:26:00,753
Quickly, you should ask if we can order.

694
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:03,123
Go and ask if we can order pizza.

695
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:04,223
Why?

696
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:05,553
(My Star is an impatient person.)

697
00:26:05,553 --> 00:26:06,653
Can we order pizza?

698
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:08,623
Mi Sook, why don't you come inside?

699
00:26:08,793 --> 00:26:10,393
- Can we eat?
- Yes.

700
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:11,493
- Hello.
- Hello.

701
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:12,763
- It's so warm.
- Hello.

702
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,093
- Hello.
- It's so warm.

703
00:26:14,093 --> 00:26:15,203
It's really cold.

704
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:16,703
I was going to eat outside.

705
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:18,703
It was a bit cold to do that.

706
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,203
Let's order pizza first.

707
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,943
Why don't you sit down and order?

708
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:24,303
You're really impatient.

709
00:26:24,473 --> 00:26:25,673
Are you hungry?

710
00:26:26,373 --> 00:26:27,813
No, order first.

711
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:29,243
What pizza do you want to order?

712
00:26:29,243 --> 00:26:30,943
- Just order everything.
- Wait.

713
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:32,083
- So we could all share.
- Wait.

714
00:26:32,083 --> 00:26:33,283
I...

715
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:35,323
Fine.

716
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:37,323
Why did you ask? Why ask?

717
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,753
This is really funny.

718
00:26:40,153 --> 00:26:41,293
Ask for what they can prepare quickly.

719
00:26:41,293 --> 00:26:42,563
Since when were you so impatient?

720
00:26:42,563 --> 00:26:43,593
I was always like this.

721
00:26:43,593 --> 00:26:44,623
- That's why I stutter.
- Right.

722
00:26:44,623 --> 00:26:46,093
(I was always like this. That's why I stutter.)

723
00:26:46,093 --> 00:26:47,863
Ask them to bake the pizzas quick.

724
00:26:47,863 --> 00:26:49,433
(Ask them to bake the pizzas quick.)

725
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,603
We'd like one Gorgonzola pizza...

726
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:52,733
- and one pepperoni pizza.
- Yes.

727
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:55,443
(Making a quick payment)

728
00:26:55,443 --> 00:26:56,473
Would you like the receipt?

729
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,043
I'm hungry.

730
00:27:00,213 --> 00:27:02,783
(Seo Jin is back from ordering.)

731
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:05,153
How long will it take? The pizzas.

732
00:27:05,153 --> 00:27:09,653
(How long will it take?)

733
00:27:10,223 --> 00:27:11,283
She was like an impatient sergeant...

734
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:12,553
who was in her final days.

735
00:27:12,753 --> 00:27:14,523
(She was like an impatient sergeant who was in her final days.)

736
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:16,323
I think people like her...

737
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:18,593
would be good if they are in a stand-by group.

738
00:27:21,733 --> 00:27:24,203
- It'll take about 20 minutes.
- Really?

739
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:25,373
Let's study then.

740
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:26,733
- Excuse me?
- Then let's study the script.

741
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,403
- Then let's study the script.
- Now?

742
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,473
Take a look at the English.

743
00:27:31,473 --> 00:27:33,213
(My Star can't even wait 20 minutes for the pizza still.)

744
00:27:35,143 --> 00:27:36,843
(The drama she's shooting)

745
00:27:36,843 --> 00:27:38,553
(The script for "In Your Brilliant Season")

746
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:43,323
It's English.

747
00:27:44,923 --> 00:27:48,253
(The script is filled with English lines.)

748
00:27:49,323 --> 00:27:50,923
- You don't have to give it to me.
- Why?

749
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:53,563
- No, take a look.
- You should look.

750
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:55,163
The role I have is...

751
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:58,933
the first generation Korean fashion...

752
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,373
- Designer.
- Designer.

753
00:28:01,373 --> 00:28:02,803
- Someone like Gee Choon Hee.
- Yes.

754
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:04,743
Yes, someone like her.

755
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,873
- So, this is a meeting scene.
- Right. A meeting.

756
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:09,013
Yes.

757
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:10,313
You do the director's role.

758
00:28:10,443 --> 00:28:11,583
- Director?
- Yes.

759
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,013
- Where's the director?
- It's there.

760
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,353
- It's the English lines.
- English?

761
00:28:14,353 --> 00:28:16,823
Seo Jin's in charge of English.

762
00:28:16,823 --> 00:28:18,753
Seo Jin needs to do Nana.

763
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:20,093
I need to listen to it.

764
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:21,353
Why don't the two of you read the lines?

765
00:28:21,353 --> 00:28:22,393
English.

766
00:28:23,123 --> 00:28:26,033
(Reading the mood)

767
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:27,533
Why do you keep on turning your head?

768
00:28:28,393 --> 00:28:29,663
I really...

769
00:28:30,363 --> 00:28:31,633
I really...

770
00:28:32,033 --> 00:28:33,473
I can't see.

771
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,243
"I really..."

772
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:43,783
"liked your dancheong idea."

773
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,953
"Dancheong idea."

774
00:28:46,483 --> 00:28:47,783
What's dancheong, by the way?

775
00:28:47,783 --> 00:28:48,853
Dancheong.

776
00:28:48,983 --> 00:28:51,453
- You can see it in hanok.
- Do we see this in hanok?

777
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:53,423
- It's something about the colouring.
- I see. Dancheong.

778
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:56,323
I think my character wants to use that technique on clothing.

779
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:59,933
"Cold you tell me a bit more?"

780
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:00,963
Is that how you say it, "Cold?"

781
00:29:01,793 --> 00:29:03,533
- Is that how you say it?
- Oh, it's "could."

782
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:07,203
"Could you tell me a bit more?"

783
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,343
(Laughing)

784
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:12,213
- It's Nana's line. Try it, Seo Jin.
- Nana.

785
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:16,983
"Of course. Director Song will go over it for you."

786
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:19,683
"Of course. Director Song will..."

787
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:20,753
- "go over it for you." - "Go over it..."

788
00:29:20,983 --> 00:29:22,723
- "Go over it for you?" - Yes.

789
00:29:23,483 --> 00:29:26,953
"Of course. Director Song will go over it for you."

790
00:29:27,123 --> 00:29:29,693
Mi Sook. I think you can just say, "Of course. Director Song..."

791
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,763
"will do it for you." I think you can keep it short.

792
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:34,833
- "Director Song..." - Not, "go over it for you."

793
00:29:34,863 --> 00:29:37,333
- Right. "Director Song..." - Just say, "Director Song..."

794
00:29:37,603 --> 00:29:38,833
"will do it for you."

795
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,803
- "Will do it for you?" - "Do it for you."

796
00:29:40,803 --> 00:29:43,073
- "Will do you for you?" - "Do it for you."

797
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,713
- I see. "Will do it for you." - "For you." Yes.

798
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,043
"Director Song will do it for you."

799
00:29:48,043 --> 00:29:49,043
- Yes, that's better.
- You can just...

800
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:50,313
- keep it simple.
- That's better.

801
00:29:50,313 --> 00:29:51,543
It's hard to say the original line.

802
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:52,983
- I can do that.
- You can say that instead.

803
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:54,783
I'll tell them I'll change the line.

804
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:57,223
What's next? Try the next paragraph.

805
00:29:57,653 --> 00:30:00,753
"Dancheong is a traditional Korean decorative colouring technique..."

806
00:30:00,893 --> 00:30:03,493
"commonly found in palaces and temples."

807
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:05,933
In my opinion, you can pull out "decorative."

808
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:07,433
Get rid of "decorative."

809
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:09,603
- It's hard to pronounce that word.
- Pull it out. Yes.

810
00:30:09,603 --> 00:30:11,233
- You don't have to say that word.
- Okay.

811
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:13,773
"Dancheong is a traditional Korean colouring technique."

812
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:15,673
- After that, pause for a second.
- Okay.

813
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:17,773
- "Commonly found in..." - "Commonly found in..."

814
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:20,513
- "palaces and temples." - "palaces and temples."

815
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:22,613
Hey, that's what you were supposed to do.

816
00:30:22,843 --> 00:30:24,743
Hey, that's what you were supposed to do.

817
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:28,783
- Gosh. Dancheong...
- The next line goes like this.

818
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:31,323
"It involves painting wooden architecture..."

819
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:33,093
"with vivid, symbolic patterns."

820
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:35,293
- You can get rid of "painting." - That too?

821
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,363
Just say, "It involves wooden architecture..."

822
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:39,863
"with vivid and symbolic patterns." Just keep it like that.

823
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:43,963
"Dancheong is a traditional Korean colouring technique..."

824
00:30:44,403 --> 00:30:46,403
"commonly found in places..."

825
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,103
- "Palaces." - It's "palaces," not "places."

826
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:50,873
"Palaces and temples."

827
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:53,343
Once you get used to these lines, you'll be fine.

828
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:54,473
I need to talk naturally...

829
00:30:54,473 --> 00:30:56,213
- like we talk in meetings.
- Right.

830
00:30:56,243 --> 00:30:58,143
It's just that you haven't practised yet.

831
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:01,313
"It involves..." Gosh, that's a hard one for me.

832
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:02,983
"It involves..."

833
00:31:03,423 --> 00:31:04,553
"Involves."

834
00:31:04,553 --> 00:31:06,793
- "Involves." - Yes.

835
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:08,323
- "It involves." - "Involves."

836
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:10,563
- "It involves." Is that it?
- "It involves."

837
00:31:10,563 --> 00:31:13,033
(Practising nonstop)

838
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,633
Where does the accent go?

839
00:31:14,633 --> 00:31:16,903
- "Involves." - It stresses the second syllable?

840
00:31:16,903 --> 00:31:18,203
(It involves...)

841
00:31:18,203 --> 00:31:19,203
- "It..." - Where does the accent go?

842
00:31:19,203 --> 00:31:21,373
- When we learned it in school...
- "It involves."

843
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:23,043
Seo Jin doesn't know about that.

844
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,003
- We learned that in school, right?
- I know.

845
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:26,873
- There were accent rules.
- Yes.

846
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:27,943
- I got smacked a lot for that.
- He just learned...

847
00:31:27,943 --> 00:31:30,013
- English with native speakers.
- Yes.

848
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:32,253
He doesn't know how difficult it was for us. You try it.

849
00:31:32,253 --> 00:31:33,753
- You try it.
- "Involves."

850
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:36,283
That sounded cool. Was that good?

851
00:31:36,283 --> 00:31:37,653
- Yes.
- Well, you can say it like that.

852
00:31:37,653 --> 00:31:38,893
"It involves."

853
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:42,093
(Tenacious)

854
00:31:42,523 --> 00:31:43,593
(When did you find Seo Jin annoying today?)

855
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:46,093
(Glancing back)

856
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,493
When he read the English lines super fast.

857
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:51,733
Mi Sook's pace was...

858
00:31:51,933 --> 00:31:54,973
"I'm Tom. You're Jane." She read it at this pace.

859
00:31:55,303 --> 00:31:57,943
But his pace was this. "I'm Tom. You're Jane."

860
00:31:59,013 --> 00:32:02,413
When he read it fast, he was so annoying.

861
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:07,153
(Your pizza is here.)

862
00:32:07,153 --> 00:32:09,653
"Dancheong is a traditional..."

863
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:10,823
- "Korean..." - Thank you.

864
00:32:10,823 --> 00:32:12,323
(He ordered pizza that would be ready quickly.)

865
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:13,493
Gosh, the pizzeria...

866
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:15,023
Right.

867
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,693
It must be so difficult for the crew.

868
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:20,363
(He doesn't forget about his older bestie.)

869
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:22,433
Thank you.

870
00:32:23,603 --> 00:32:26,203
Why are you suddenly speaking in English?

871
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:28,033
You were struggling to speak up until now.

872
00:32:33,373 --> 00:32:34,543
For dinner...

873
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:38,383
What's that called?

874
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:41,453
Is there any place we can drink on the street?

875
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:42,523
Like street bars?

876
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:45,183
- Was it in Euljiro?
- Like drinking outdoors?

877
00:32:45,183 --> 00:32:47,893
Yes, people drink outdoors under some tents and so on.

878
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,263
- There are some briquettes too.
- Earlier...

879
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:50,493
Do you mean...

880
00:32:50,493 --> 00:32:51,863
- food grilled over briquettes?
- So...

881
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:52,993
Right. Something like that.

882
00:32:52,993 --> 00:32:54,963
- Grilling food over fire outdoors?
- Those places...

883
00:32:55,293 --> 00:32:58,133
When we drink at places like that, we won't feel cold.

884
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:00,533
Is there a place we can do that?

885
00:33:01,303 --> 00:33:03,403
(Getting drunk on each other's warmth...)

886
00:33:03,403 --> 00:33:06,743
I want to feel that outdoor vibe.

887
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:11,643
Your nose gets red because it's cold outside.

888
00:33:11,643 --> 00:33:13,783
But when you have a shot, it warms up your body.

889
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,253
We can have some food too.

890
00:33:15,253 --> 00:33:17,823
- Over the briquettes...
- You were cold even during the day.

891
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:21,353
- You were trembling.
- But we'll have the fire.

892
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:23,823
Is there a place we can grill food outside?

893
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:24,863
- Those places are rare now.
- That's...

894
00:33:24,863 --> 00:33:27,133
That place... What's the name of that?

895
00:33:27,293 --> 00:33:29,033
What about the seafood place?

896
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:30,903
- The one in Yeongjong Island?
- Yes. We can grill seafood.

897
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:31,963
They would let us do that outdoors.

898
00:33:31,963 --> 00:33:33,133
We can jump into...

899
00:33:33,133 --> 00:33:34,303
- the mudflat at night...
- Okay.

900
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:36,343
- after having some drinks.
- Are you going to do that?

901
00:33:37,373 --> 00:33:39,713
(Her ultra-sentimental side flusters him.)

902
00:33:39,813 --> 00:33:41,973
We ought to relieve stress like that.

903
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:45,083
The wind will be biting by the seaside today.

904
00:33:45,183 --> 00:33:47,083
- It's going to be so fun.
- It's going to be so cold.

905
00:33:47,653 --> 00:33:49,253
But it's going to be super cool.

906
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:54,223
She talked about having grilled clams on Yeongjong Island.

907
00:33:54,623 --> 00:33:55,663
If we go to Yeongjong Island,

908
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,563
we won't be able to do anything.

909
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:00,233
Going there and coming back...

910
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,563
So I pretended not to hear her.

911
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:07,203
If you want the open-air feel, we can go to a pajeon restaurant...

912
00:34:07,203 --> 00:34:08,573
at the foot of Mount Cheonggye.

913
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:10,943
We can have makgeolli.

914
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:13,943
She doesn't seem to like the idea.

915
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:17,743
That's our only option? Like pajeon and stuff?

916
00:34:17,813 --> 00:34:19,853
They have other types of jeon and acorn jelly.

917
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:23,483
- They also have vegetable bibimbap.
- Yes.

918
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:25,323
- They offer...
- He's clueless about what I want.

919
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:27,253
No. Listen.

920
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:28,963
That's the type of food you like.

921
00:34:28,963 --> 00:34:30,563
That kind of food goes well with makgeolli.

922
00:34:31,223 --> 00:34:34,093
- Listen.
- Remember the park you found?

923
00:34:34,093 --> 00:34:36,963
You're my manager. You ought to know what I want.

924
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:40,333
- Listen. It's...
- I don't want to eat pajeon.

925
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,633
(He's not sentimental or quick at figuring out her needs.)

926
00:34:43,743 --> 00:34:45,203
- Here's what I wanted.
- Okay.

927
00:34:46,173 --> 00:34:47,613
I wanted to dine outdoors...

928
00:34:48,073 --> 00:34:52,043
with a shot of soju in a nice atmosphere.

929
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:54,153
I wanted to share life stories.

930
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:58,253
I wanted to enjoy that sentimental fall vibe.

931
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,493
I'm lonely, you know? I'm at that age.

932
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:03,993
Give me a call then.

933
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:09,633
I wasn't fishing for your company.

934
00:35:11,363 --> 00:35:14,033
Aren't you curious about my heyday when I was the prettiest...

935
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:16,903
and how I enjoyed autumn? You know what I mean?

936
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:18,443
I guess you're not curious.

937
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:20,143
I'll talk to the camera.

938
00:35:20,143 --> 00:35:21,173
No, I'm curious.

939
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:22,843
- Right. Back in the day, - Yes.

940
00:35:22,843 --> 00:35:26,013
I was super sentimental in autumn.

941
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:29,953
I wore insanely high heels. You know?

942
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:31,083
When you were in your 20s?

943
00:35:31,553 --> 00:35:35,593
No. I think I was at my peak...

944
00:35:35,593 --> 00:35:37,063
when I was in my 40s.

945
00:35:37,063 --> 00:35:41,033
I think I was the prettiest in my 40s.

946
00:35:41,563 --> 00:35:42,763
That was my 40s.

947
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:44,563
(That's so true.)

948
00:35:47,473 --> 00:35:51,043
(Like a ripe autumn berry...)

949
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:55,113
(more beautiful than any flower, )

950
00:35:58,683 --> 00:36:01,553
(her beauty was at its peak then.)

951
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:07,593
(It was the autumn of her life.)

952
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:11,163
The height of a woman's heels...

953
00:36:11,163 --> 00:36:13,693
- defined her style.
- Then how high were your heels?

954
00:36:13,693 --> 00:36:15,663
I don't know. But I found a pair with 20cm heels...

955
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:16,833
when I went through my closet to declutter.

956
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,663
You used to wear long boots back in the day.

957
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:19,803
I did wear long boots.

958
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:22,773
I used to walk around in heels in autumn.

959
00:36:22,803 --> 00:36:25,673
I just wandered around aimlessly...

960
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:28,613
at the intersection in Gangnam.

961
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:31,543
I even screamed while walking around...

962
00:36:32,083 --> 00:36:35,283
because I was in a great mood. I was so happy to be walking around.

963
00:36:36,023 --> 00:36:39,253
There was this romantic sentiment in autumn.

964
00:36:41,753 --> 00:36:43,423
That's why every autumn,

965
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:46,463
I want to revisit the feelings I had all those years ago...

966
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:49,033
by doing some of the things I used to do.

967
00:36:49,033 --> 00:36:51,633
I used to drink soju at night...

968
00:36:51,633 --> 00:36:54,673
at those street bars and enjoy myself.

969
00:36:55,673 --> 00:36:57,873
I sometimes miss doing those things in autumn.

970
00:37:02,543 --> 00:37:04,543
Seriously. You look like you're listening...

971
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:06,353
to a boring story.

972
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:11,153
I don't think he can relate to my story.

973
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:13,593
But I completely agree with what you said before.

974
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:15,393
My early 40s...

975
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:17,223
- How was it?
- were the best years.

976
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:19,333
- Right? It's the same for men too.
- Yes.

977
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,093
I think my early 40s were...

978
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:22,733
- my golden years.
- Right.

979
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:25,603
Professionally, you've established yourself...

980
00:37:25,603 --> 00:37:27,333
- in the industry. Right.
- I've reached a certain point then.

981
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:30,673
- That was the peak of my life.
- It's slowly... Right.

982
00:37:30,673 --> 00:37:31,873
Ever since then,

983
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:33,073
- my life began to lose its sparkle.
- Right.

984
00:37:33,143 --> 00:37:34,673
- But I didn't know about that then.
- You didn't.

985
00:37:34,673 --> 00:37:38,143
When it began to lose its sparkle, I could slowly feel it in my bones.

986
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,383
I could feel it in my bones.

987
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:42,623
Right.

988
00:37:42,783 --> 00:37:44,023
How were your 40s?

989
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:46,823
Oh, me? My life was going well.

990
00:37:46,823 --> 00:37:49,223
But I was scammed out of my security deposit in my 40s.

991
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:52,793
I just wasted my 40s.

992
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:53,833
(He had the chilliest autumn in his 40s.)

993
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,663
The lawsuit lasted over three years.

994
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:58,033
It was mentally draining when it lasted over three years.

995
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:01,803
Once the lawsuit got sorted out, I was already in my 50s.

996
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:05,303
(Sharing a real-life problem during a sentimental conversation)

997
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:06,813
All right.

998
00:38:06,813 --> 00:38:08,343
Let's finish up eating and go to a vintage shop.

999
00:38:08,573 --> 00:38:09,583
Sounds good.

1000
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:11,383
Where should we go to visit a vintage shop?

1001
00:38:11,383 --> 00:38:12,413
(3pm, a vintage shop to buy outfits for her drama)

1002
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:13,953
Do you want to go to Itaewon?

1003
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:16,623
- Are there clothing stores too?
- Yes, there are.

1004
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:19,553
So are you done stepping on the leaves?

1005
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:22,663
- Let me step on more leaves.
- Pardon?

1006
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,233
- Let me step on some leaves.
- Do you want to do that in Itaewon?

1007
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:27,793
That's one of my requests.

1008
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:29,663
- Shouldn't you bring leaves?
- Then...

1009
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:33,103
Why don't you bring the pile of leaves over there?

1010
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,103
So I can step on them.

1011
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,043
Earlier at the park, I saw...

1012
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:39,413
ten sacks of leaves. They bagged up everything.

1013
00:38:39,513 --> 00:38:41,213
Hey, leaves are just garbage.

1014
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,483
You saw them, right? They were in garbage bags.

1015
00:38:44,913 --> 00:38:47,753
All the leaves from the street were in the garbage bags.

1016
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,753
Leaves are just garbage.

1017
00:38:50,753 --> 00:38:51,753
(Crushing the sentimental vibe)

1018
00:38:51,753 --> 00:38:52,753
I saw ten sacks of leaves.

1019
00:38:52,753 --> 00:38:53,993
(But if that's what My Star wants...)

1020
00:38:54,093 --> 00:38:55,823
I saw ten sacks of them over there.

1021
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:57,363
Gosh, that's so funny.

1022
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:02,803
(A vast, lofty sky...)

1023
00:39:02,803 --> 00:39:04,963
(awakens our sentiment.)

1024
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,333
Gosh, look at the sky.

1025
00:39:07,703 --> 00:39:09,603
(They arrive in Itaewon at 3pm.)

1026
00:39:09,603 --> 00:39:11,003
The sky looks great.

1027
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:12,743
Look at the sky.

1028
00:39:14,473 --> 00:39:17,683
- This is the route I take to go...
- From Bangbae-dong.

1029
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:19,913
from my 1st gym to the 2nd gym.

1030
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:22,253
I come to Itaewon to work out.

1031
00:39:22,253 --> 00:39:24,953
(This is the path Seo Jin takes almost every day.)

1032
00:39:25,893 --> 00:39:27,893
(Let me see.)

1033
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,933
My gosh. I used to have this style of furniture in my house.

1034
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:37,663
The street with many antique stores starts here.

1035
00:39:37,663 --> 00:39:39,033
- I see. This is the street?
- This is the antique street.

1036
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:40,673
- I've never been here before.
- Right.

1037
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:42,803
(This is the antique street Seo Jin recommended.)

1038
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:44,943
- They sell interior props too.
- I see. Props.

1039
00:39:44,943 --> 00:39:46,113
(The street offers antique props...)

1040
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:47,673
They have some clothes here too.

1041
00:39:47,673 --> 00:39:49,743
(as well as vintage clothes.)

1042
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:53,183
My gosh, this place feels so international.

1043
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:54,853
This neighbourhood has a good vibe.

1044
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,323
(They're in the right place.)

1045
00:39:58,623 --> 00:40:00,353
(Spotting something)

1046
00:40:01,723 --> 00:40:03,193
Do you want some coffee?

1047
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,823
- I do. That sounds lovely.
- Do you drink coffee?

1048
00:40:04,823 --> 00:40:06,033
Should we drink coffee?

1049
00:40:06,033 --> 00:40:07,863
- Let's drink it outside.
- You like dining outdoors.

1050
00:40:08,393 --> 00:40:09,863
- Coffee?
- Let's have coffee outside...

1051
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:11,733
- Sure.
- while admiring the sky.

1052
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:14,033
- Sure.
- You don't want to?

1053
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,173
That sounds good.

1054
00:40:15,173 --> 00:40:16,303
We should sit here.

1055
00:40:16,303 --> 00:40:17,843
No, let's sit on the sofa.

1056
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:19,213
(Their schedule is changed once again.)

1057
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:21,243
We won't be able to see the coffee. I mean, the sky.

1058
00:40:21,843 --> 00:40:24,283
- She wants to sit here. Go ahead.
- Then...

1059
00:40:25,413 --> 00:40:27,613
- Please sit down, Mi Sook.
- Let's sit here. Bring me leaves.

1060
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:30,823
(Bring me leaves.)

1061
00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:32,283
Okay.

1062
00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:35,593
(Leaves will complete My Star's sentiment.)

1063
00:40:39,093 --> 00:40:40,333
What kind of coffee would you like?

1064
00:40:40,693 --> 00:40:42,363
- Let's drink coffee. Hot coffee.
- Which one?

1065
00:40:42,763 --> 00:40:44,563
- Americano or latte?
- Americano.

1066
00:40:44,563 --> 00:40:45,803
- Americano?
- Latte.

1067
00:40:45,803 --> 00:40:47,073
- Latte?
- Yes.

1068
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,273
A latte sounds good.

1069
00:40:48,273 --> 00:40:50,403
(My Star changes her mind every second.)

1070
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:53,013
(He goes off to order before she changes her mind again.)

1071
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:55,413
My gosh. The view looks amazing.

1072
00:40:58,743 --> 00:41:01,913
(My Star who's left all alone...)

1073
00:41:01,913 --> 00:41:06,223
(enjoys the autumn vibe to the fullest.)

1074
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:10,463
(While My Star basks in the autumn vibes, )

1075
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:13,633
(a man is looking for leaves on the cold street.)

1076
00:41:14,033 --> 00:41:15,493
(Looking around)

1077
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:18,163
(Spotting the target)

1078
00:41:20,503 --> 00:41:23,673
(Huge leaves)

1079
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:24,973
(Out of breath)

1080
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:26,373
I'll get one of each kind.

1081
00:41:28,273 --> 00:41:29,313
I'll get one of each kind.

1082
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:34,483
(After picking up different types of leaves, )

1083
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:38,753
(I run to My Star.)

1084
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,763
(Spotting Kwang Kyu)

1085
00:41:43,593 --> 00:41:44,963
(Gosh, I'm so proud of him.)

1086
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:46,033
Hold on.

1087
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:49,463
All right. Here you go.

1088
00:41:49,463 --> 00:41:51,633
(An elevated vibe thanks to the leaves)

1089
00:41:52,263 --> 00:41:53,973
- Kwang Kyu, take a picture of me.
- Okay.

1090
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:56,643
You look great.

1091
00:41:56,643 --> 00:41:58,473
(It's time for a sentimental photo with the leaves.)

1092
00:42:01,213 --> 00:42:04,583
(Smiling brightly)

1093
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:06,813
- Do I look good?
- Yes. You look great.

1094
00:42:06,813 --> 00:42:08,083
(Full of autumn vibes)

1095
00:42:08,253 --> 00:42:09,953
You look great with the leaves.

1096
00:42:09,953 --> 00:42:13,023
Oh, My Star.

1097
00:42:13,723 --> 00:42:16,623
(Pouring his heart and soul to match her sentiment)

1098
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:17,723
Oh, My Star.

1099
00:42:22,163 --> 00:42:24,603
(Satisfied)

1100
00:42:24,603 --> 00:42:25,833
Where did you find them?

1101
00:42:27,473 --> 00:42:29,273
(He learns the hard way what it means to match her vibe.)

1102
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:31,303
- I picked pretty ones for you.
- Really?

1103
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:33,373
(Glancing at her)

1104
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:34,743
(Shaking his head)

1105
00:42:34,743 --> 00:42:36,213
Gosh, her obsession with leaves...

1106
00:42:36,613 --> 00:42:38,613
I only think of them as garbage.

1107
00:42:39,613 --> 00:42:41,113
I hate this sentimental vibe.

1108
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:42,853
(He spews out complaints he's been holding back.)

1109
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,553
Handling a sentimental guest is harder than a passionate one.

1110
00:42:45,553 --> 00:42:47,853
(Handling a sentimental guest is harder than a passionate one.)

1111
00:42:49,323 --> 00:42:51,263
(The 2nd victim of her obsession comes in.)

1112
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,563
- Why did you come in?
- What?

1113
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:54,093
Why did you come in?

1114
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:55,693
She wants her coffee.

1115
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:57,463
- Stop lying.
- She...

1116
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:59,703
- You didn't want to stay with her.
- Gosh, no.

1117
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,573
She changes her mind every second.

1118
00:43:01,573 --> 00:43:02,773
(They start badmouthing her the moment they meet.)

1119
00:43:02,773 --> 00:43:04,673
She asked me to bring her leaves, so I did.

1120
00:43:04,673 --> 00:43:06,073
Then she told me to bring her coffee.

1121
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,713
Which guest is harder to handle?

1122
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:08,743
A sentimental one or a passionate one?

1123
00:43:09,883 --> 00:43:11,343
So far, a passionate one is harder.

1124
00:43:11,343 --> 00:43:12,883
Is that so? For me, a sentimental one is harder.

1125
00:43:12,883 --> 00:43:14,153
It is?

1126
00:43:15,113 --> 00:43:17,023
Reacting to her sentimentality is harder for me.

1127
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:18,323
That's harder for you?

1128
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:20,553
I don't have to show reactions to a passionate guest.

1129
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,793
- That's true.
- But I must show reactions to her.

1130
00:43:22,793 --> 00:43:25,593
He only brought 3. Just 3 leaves.

1131
00:43:26,733 --> 00:43:28,263
He brought 3 because there are 3 of us.

1132
00:43:30,003 --> 00:43:32,363
He at least brought me leaves since I asked for them relentlessly.

1133
00:43:36,173 --> 00:43:37,173
(Disappointed)

1134
00:43:38,203 --> 00:43:40,543
Replace them. My real manager, Joon Woo, is better.

1135
00:43:40,543 --> 00:43:41,543
(Replace them. My real manager, Joon Woo, is better.)

1136
00:43:41,543 --> 00:43:42,713
Joon Woo is better.

1137
00:43:43,283 --> 00:43:46,613
(She's unhappy with her Grumpy Secretaries either.)

1138
00:43:46,783 --> 00:43:49,053
My gosh, this place is amazing.

1139
00:43:49,053 --> 00:43:50,083
(That was a sudden change of topics.)

1140
00:43:50,353 --> 00:43:51,583
I love looking at the sky.

1141
00:43:53,393 --> 00:43:56,863
(While admiring the autumn sky, she waits...)

1142
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:59,633
(for her Grumpy Secretaries, but no one comes back.)

1143
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:00,733
Are they badmouthing me?

1144
00:44:01,363 --> 00:44:04,533
(She goes out on patrol.)

1145
00:44:06,003 --> 00:44:08,173
That day for me...

1146
00:44:08,233 --> 00:44:09,803
- She came in.
- She's here.

1147
00:44:09,803 --> 00:44:11,443
Hello. You badmouthed me, didn't you?

1148
00:44:11,703 --> 00:44:12,943
- She came in.
- She's here.

1149
00:44:13,343 --> 00:44:14,343
- Hello.
- She's impatient.

1150
00:44:14,343 --> 00:44:15,713
- You badmouthed me, didn't you?
- Pardon?

1151
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:18,043
- You badmouthed me, didn't you?
- Pardon?

1152
00:44:18,213 --> 00:44:19,213
Pardon?

1153
00:44:19,813 --> 00:44:21,653
- You badmouthed me, didn't you?
- Gosh, no way.

1154
00:44:21,653 --> 00:44:22,753
Tell me the truth.

1155
00:44:22,983 --> 00:44:24,083
Something didn't feel right.

1156
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:26,323
I have good hunches when it comes to gossiping.

1157
00:44:27,223 --> 00:44:30,323
By then, a lot of time had passed since I asked for my latte.

1158
00:44:30,523 --> 00:44:33,663
After Kwang Kyu brought me leaves, he just disappeared.

1159
00:44:33,863 --> 00:44:34,893
You badmouthed me, didn't you?

1160
00:44:34,893 --> 00:44:35,963
(A man suspected of badmouthing her seems utterly nervous.)

1161
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:37,733
- Tell me the truth.
- Gosh, no.

1162
00:44:37,903 --> 00:44:38,903
Hey.

1163
00:44:38,903 --> 00:44:40,073
Guess what I thought when I saw her earlier.

1164
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:41,833
She looked like she was in her 40s...

1165
00:44:42,003 --> 00:44:43,803
in the picture with natural sunlight.

1166
00:44:44,743 --> 00:44:46,343
Stop trying to flatter me. There are other customers here.

1167
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:48,073
You were badmouthing her. That was a sudden change.

1168
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:49,543
(Quickly severing ties)

1169
00:44:49,543 --> 00:44:51,413
My gosh. Seriously. You're so...

1170
00:44:51,983 --> 00:44:53,613
He's the worst. You know?

1171
00:44:54,183 --> 00:44:55,353
You know what?

1172
00:44:56,053 --> 00:44:57,223
I'm a huge fan.

1173
00:44:57,523 --> 00:44:58,553
- And...
- That was random.

1174
00:44:58,553 --> 00:45:00,523
- I've been...
- Then why did you badmouth her?

1175
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,223
I've been your fan for a long time.

1176
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:05,223
I also subscribed to your channel a long time ago.

1177
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:06,393
(Looking coy)

1178
00:45:06,393 --> 00:45:07,593
You said you watched her video for the first time yesterday.

1179
00:45:07,593 --> 00:45:09,563
- Hey.
- See? He's lying again.

1180
00:45:09,563 --> 00:45:11,203
Stop lying through your teeth.

1181
00:45:11,203 --> 00:45:12,233
(He's caught telling a white lie.)

1182
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:13,733
All you do is lie.

1183
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:17,103
Do you hate my sentimentality that much?

1184
00:45:18,303 --> 00:45:19,373
- Pardon?
- Thank you.

1185
00:45:19,373 --> 00:45:20,473
(Greatly disappointed)

1186
00:45:20,813 --> 00:45:22,143
Let's have coffee outside.

1187
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:24,483
- I don't want to drink coffee.
- Pardon?

1188
00:45:26,253 --> 00:45:27,653
- Let's go outside.
- Let's go.

1189
00:45:29,883 --> 00:45:33,053
(Today feels like a real challenge.)

1190
00:45:33,053 --> 00:45:34,453
You brought leaves.

1191
00:45:34,453 --> 00:45:35,623
Of course.

1192
00:45:36,053 --> 00:45:38,363
Should we put the coffee cups on top of the leaves?

1193
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:42,263
- What do you think?
- On top of the leaves?

1194
00:45:42,263 --> 00:45:44,103
Yes. He only brought three too.

1195
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:47,103
He only brought three.

1196
00:45:47,103 --> 00:45:48,433
- Should I place it on the leaf?
- Let's do that.

1197
00:45:48,433 --> 00:45:50,143
- Let's set it up beautifully.
- Okay.

1198
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:51,503
We're in New York now.

1199
00:45:52,173 --> 00:45:53,243
(Rustling)

1200
00:45:54,643 --> 00:45:56,443
- It sounds like I'm stepping on it.
- It does sound like that.

1201
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:58,643
- Separately.
- Okay. This one...

1202
00:45:58,643 --> 00:46:00,213
will sound super crunchy.

1203
00:46:03,623 --> 00:46:04,623
(Crunchy)

1204
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:08,123
Put it down.

1205
00:46:09,493 --> 00:46:12,263
(Happy laughter)

1206
00:46:12,263 --> 00:46:13,833
(This is the sentimental vibe My Star has been looking for.)

1207
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,133
- It looks better than I thought.
- My gosh. Look at that.

1208
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:18,463
My gosh. This was a great idea.

1209
00:46:18,463 --> 00:46:19,933
They look beautiful.

1210
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,003
All right. Hold on.

1211
00:46:22,003 --> 00:46:23,503
Let me take a shot of the coffee.

1212
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:25,973
Placing the coffee cups on top of the leaves?

1213
00:46:27,113 --> 00:46:30,143
I really hate that. I hate it when dust gets into my food.

1214
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,443
(Unable to understand her)

1215
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:34,753
The leaves were from the street and dusty. I hate how we put them...

1216
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:36,223
on the table.

1217
00:46:36,883 --> 00:46:38,853
Then we put the coffee cups on the leaves,

1218
00:46:38,853 --> 00:46:40,753
so the dust got into the coffee. I hated that.

1219
00:46:40,753 --> 00:46:42,323
I could see the black particles go into the coffee.

1220
00:46:42,323 --> 00:46:43,793
(He's trying his best for Mi Sook.)

1221
00:46:43,793 --> 00:46:44,863
Sit down. Let's take a picture.

1222
00:46:47,593 --> 00:46:48,763
We're in direct sunlight.

1223
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:49,833
It's okay.

1224
00:46:50,403 --> 00:46:51,533
(He finally has a sip of his coffee.)

1225
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:52,833
Look at the sky, Kwang Kyu.

1226
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:55,403
Look at the sky, Kwang Kyu.

1227
00:46:55,603 --> 00:46:58,403
(How many times must he look at the sky?)

1228
00:46:59,373 --> 00:47:01,943
(Gosh, it's blinding me.)

1229
00:47:04,013 --> 00:47:05,283
(Glancing)

1230
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,253
We don't have sunglasses. We can't look at the sky.

1231
00:47:07,913 --> 00:47:08,953
Look at it. Try them on.

1232
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:10,023
(The powerful glare of the sun)

1233
00:47:10,023 --> 00:47:11,253
It's too bright for my eyes.

1234
00:47:13,023 --> 00:47:15,693
(They're particularly vulnerable to direct sunlight.)

1235
00:47:16,993 --> 00:47:18,763
- Look at it. Try them on.
- Pardon?

1236
00:47:18,763 --> 00:47:19,763
(My Star wants to share this sentimental vibe.)

1237
00:47:20,693 --> 00:47:22,593
Look at the sky. Seriously. Look under the clouds.

1238
00:47:23,433 --> 00:47:24,903
When you look at the sky...

1239
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,603
Direct sunlight is the worst thing for your eyes.

1240
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:31,143
My eyes are already bad enough.

1241
00:47:31,743 --> 00:47:33,673
(His eye health comes first before the sentimental vibe.)

1242
00:47:33,673 --> 00:47:34,843
This is nice.

1243
00:47:36,713 --> 00:47:39,443
(Blocking out the sunlight)

1244
00:47:40,883 --> 00:47:45,553
(Satisfied with the sentimental vibe)

1245
00:47:46,453 --> 00:47:47,593
Can you see it?

1246
00:47:47,593 --> 00:47:48,753
(Glancing at her)

1247
00:47:48,853 --> 00:47:49,923
- I've always wanted...
- What do you think?

1248
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:51,063
- to ask you something.
- Okay.

1249
00:47:51,193 --> 00:47:52,793
Can I ask you a question?

1250
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:53,963
Sure. Go ahead.

1251
00:47:53,963 --> 00:47:55,563
You even badmouthed me behind my back.

1252
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:56,663
(You even badmouthed me behind my back.)

1253
00:47:57,203 --> 00:47:58,403
Mi Sook...

1254
00:47:59,433 --> 00:48:00,803
(Cautious)

1255
00:48:00,803 --> 00:48:01,933
Ask it already.

1256
00:48:01,933 --> 00:48:03,203
My gosh. Never mind.

1257
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:05,443
What was that? Come on.

1258
00:48:05,443 --> 00:48:06,843
That's more insulting.

1259
00:48:06,913 --> 00:48:08,043
What is it?

1260
00:48:08,043 --> 00:48:09,983
(What did he want to ask her?)

1261
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,443
Take your time. Go ahead.

1262
00:48:12,483 --> 00:48:14,283
It's about your nose.

1263
00:48:14,453 --> 00:48:15,483
- My nose?
- Yes.

1264
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:17,083
It's natural, right?

1265
00:48:17,923 --> 00:48:20,193
(He carefully asks a rude question.)

1266
00:48:20,193 --> 00:48:21,493
- Touch it.
- Okay.

1267
00:48:22,423 --> 00:48:23,423
It's obvious to me...

1268
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:24,723
- that it's natural.
- Yes. Touch it.

1269
00:48:24,723 --> 00:48:25,763
- She didn't get a nose job.
- Right.

1270
00:48:25,763 --> 00:48:27,233
I see. It's natural.

1271
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:29,233
- Did it shake or something?
- No.

1272
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:30,403
It's my heart that's shaking.

1273
00:48:30,403 --> 00:48:31,563
(It's my heart that's shaking.)

1274
00:48:31,563 --> 00:48:33,533
Growing up,

1275
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,703
I never saw an actress with a nose...

1276
00:48:36,703 --> 00:48:38,303
as sharp and defined as hers.

1277
00:48:38,403 --> 00:48:39,743
I'm serious.

1278
00:48:39,743 --> 00:48:42,413
She has the kind of nose you'd see on Hollywood stars.

1279
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:43,913
I couldn't help...

1280
00:48:43,913 --> 00:48:46,553
but wonder how her nose was so beautiful.

1281
00:48:46,783 --> 00:48:48,313
I thought about that the whole time.

1282
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:51,123
No one had ever touched my nose. Only a crazy...

1283
00:48:51,123 --> 00:48:52,323
Unless they wanted to die.

1284
00:48:52,323 --> 00:48:53,853
(Unless they wanted to die)

1285
00:48:53,923 --> 00:48:55,323
I've mellowed out compared to before.

1286
00:48:55,323 --> 00:48:56,723
He's lucky that he touched my nose...

1287
00:48:56,723 --> 00:48:58,163
after my personality had softened.

1288
00:48:58,163 --> 00:48:59,693
If he touched my nose when it hadn't,

1289
00:48:59,963 --> 00:49:01,893
I would have sued him.

1290
00:49:01,893 --> 00:49:03,433
(Otherwise, I would have sued him.)

1291
00:49:03,563 --> 00:49:05,803
There aren't many actresses whose nose has that kind of angle.

1292
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:07,203
Can I take a picture of you?

1293
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:09,203
- A photo?
- Yes, from here. A profile shot.

1294
00:49:09,203 --> 00:49:10,373
- A profile shot?
- Yes.

1295
00:49:10,373 --> 00:49:11,543
- From the side?
- Can a manager...

1296
00:49:11,543 --> 00:49:13,073
treat his actress like this?

1297
00:49:14,013 --> 00:49:16,683
You must have missed the first part of our title.

1298
00:49:17,343 --> 00:49:19,043
It's My Grumpy Secretary.

1299
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:21,183
(My Grumpy Secretary)

1300
00:49:21,183 --> 00:49:22,213
I'll take it from here.

1301
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:24,283
- Your intention is good, right?
- Of course.

1302
00:49:24,383 --> 00:49:26,283
You're not just grumpy.

1303
00:49:26,283 --> 00:49:27,353
All right. Action.

1304
00:49:27,353 --> 00:49:28,423
(What kind of manager is he?)

1305
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:30,623
(He may be a bit rude, but he does his job.)

1306
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,823
Let me see.

1307
00:49:32,823 --> 00:49:34,493
- Her nose...
- I heard...

1308
00:49:36,263 --> 00:49:38,763
Gosh, you know what? You guys must be struggling...

1309
00:49:38,863 --> 00:49:41,373
to match my sentimentality.

1310
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:42,703
But do better.

1311
00:49:42,703 --> 00:49:43,873
(But do better.)

1312
00:49:43,873 --> 00:49:45,573
It's not too much for me.

1313
00:49:45,573 --> 00:49:46,643
I'm fine.

1314
00:49:47,273 --> 00:49:48,273
The leaves...

1315
00:49:48,273 --> 00:49:49,343
That's why I scolded you.

1316
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:50,543
You only think about yourself.

1317
00:49:50,643 --> 00:49:52,143
Who cares if you're fine?

1318
00:49:52,143 --> 00:49:53,513
You need to comfort me.

1319
00:49:53,513 --> 00:49:55,553
- You want me to comfort you?
- Of course.

1320
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:56,653
How can I do that?

1321
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:58,423
I feel empty inside.

1322
00:49:58,423 --> 00:50:00,593
- Do something to fill that void.
- What?

1323
00:50:00,593 --> 00:50:02,293
- Who cares if you're fine?
- Well,

1324
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:05,323
you said we might be struggling to manage you.

1325
00:50:05,323 --> 00:50:06,993
So I said we were fine.

1326
00:50:07,493 --> 00:50:10,403
But you're suddenly getting angry at me.

1327
00:50:10,403 --> 00:50:12,263
How do you expect me to behave then?

1328
00:50:12,263 --> 00:50:13,433
Should I dance?

1329
00:50:13,433 --> 00:50:14,733
(Should I dance?)

1330
00:50:15,133 --> 00:50:16,173
Sure.

1331
00:50:16,743 --> 00:50:17,903
Dance then.

1332
00:50:18,573 --> 00:50:19,673
I'll dance if you want me to.

1333
00:50:20,213 --> 00:50:24,043
(I'll dance if that's what My Star wants me to do.)

1334
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:28,483
In the forest with falling leaves

1335
00:50:29,013 --> 00:50:30,853
The breeze

1336
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:35,693
You're an excellent dancer.

1337
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:38,663
(Feeling good)

1338
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:45,763
Hey, the sun is going down.

1339
00:50:46,403 --> 00:50:47,803
How beautiful.

1340
00:50:49,273 --> 00:50:51,973
(The sky turns into a red hue...)

1341
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:56,143
(My Star loves)

1342
00:50:56,143 --> 00:50:57,513
The moment the sun goes down,

1343
00:50:57,843 --> 00:50:59,783
you must do something to ease my loneliness.

1344
00:51:01,753 --> 00:51:03,483
I'm serious. Do something.

1345
00:51:03,483 --> 00:51:05,553
(My Star's sentimentality reaches the peak at sunset.)

1346
00:51:08,353 --> 00:51:09,453
Shall we get going now?

1347
00:51:09,453 --> 00:51:10,563
Go where?

1348
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:11,963
- To the clothing store?
- Okay.

1349
00:51:13,363 --> 00:51:14,993
Now that the sun is going down,

1350
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:16,033
- it's getting cold.
- Isn't it scary?

1351
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:17,133
No, it's getting cold.

1352
00:51:17,133 --> 00:51:18,233
Come on. Look at him.

1353
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:19,433
(Hugging himself tightly)

1354
00:51:19,563 --> 00:51:21,103
Come on. Look at him.

1355
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,203
- What about the coffee? Let's go.
- Okay.

1356
00:51:23,203 --> 00:51:24,373
- To ease her loneliness...
- Stop drinking it.

1357
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:25,803
Let's go to the clothing store.

1358
00:51:25,803 --> 00:51:27,443
Shopping is the way to ease one's loneliness.

1359
00:51:27,443 --> 00:51:28,913
(Shopping is the way to ease one's loneliness.)

1360
00:51:29,013 --> 00:51:30,813
Shopping is the way to ease one's loneliness.

1361
00:51:30,813 --> 00:51:31,913
You know what?

1362
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:34,013
Here's what I think.

1363
00:51:34,013 --> 00:51:35,783
We can't keep filming today.

1364
00:51:36,853 --> 00:51:38,883
They have no sentimental bone in their body.

1365
00:51:38,883 --> 00:51:40,023
(My Star explodes in frustration.)

1366
00:51:40,423 --> 00:51:42,193
They're just all flesh without emotions.

1367
00:51:42,193 --> 00:51:43,593
- Just flesh?
- Yes.

1368
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:45,163
I get that they're still unmarried.

1369
00:51:45,163 --> 00:51:46,563
How could they not have an ounce of sentimentality in them?

1370
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:48,533
I can't do this.

1371
00:51:48,993 --> 00:51:50,103
Let's stop filming.

1372
00:51:50,263 --> 00:51:51,303
- Seo Jin.
- Yes?

1373
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:53,163
Let's stop filming. Let's go home and eat.

1374
00:51:53,633 --> 00:51:54,703
- Now?
- Yes.

1375
00:51:54,703 --> 00:51:56,003
- At whose house?
- Let's part ways here.

1376
00:51:57,273 --> 00:51:58,973
We'll just go home separately.

1377
00:51:58,973 --> 00:52:00,143
- Really?
- Yes. Let's stop filming.

1378
00:52:00,143 --> 00:52:01,673
Don't you already have enough for 30 minutes of footage

1379
00:52:01,673 --> 00:52:02,713
(My Star changes her mind every second.)

1380
00:52:02,713 --> 00:52:03,983
Let's stop here.

1381
00:52:05,013 --> 00:52:06,653
There should be a 30-minute episode too.

1382
00:52:06,653 --> 00:52:08,913
Have a Part 2. Film the 2nd half another time and combine it.

1383
00:52:09,353 --> 00:52:10,683
- So we'll film again another time?
- Yes.

1384
00:52:11,223 --> 00:52:12,853
Meet me after you've studied my sentimentality.

1385
00:52:12,853 --> 00:52:13,853
It will be winter.

1386
00:52:13,853 --> 00:52:14,953
- Will you still be sentimental?
- It doesn't matter.

1387
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:16,563
We can do snow fights in winter.

1388
00:52:17,623 --> 00:52:19,223
We can do snow fights in winter.

1389
00:52:22,663 --> 00:52:24,333
Here's what I think. I bet Mi Sook...

1390
00:52:24,333 --> 00:52:25,863
gets sentimental every season.

1391
00:52:27,573 --> 00:52:29,943
You can't seem to satisfy my sentimental side.

1392
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:32,343
You might be able to find something...

1393
00:52:32,873 --> 00:52:34,413
that surprises you at the store.

1394
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:36,313
- It could have a sentimental vibe.
- You could buy something nice.

1395
00:52:36,313 --> 00:52:37,913
(Turning sharply)

1396
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:42,513
- I'll look forward to it.
- What do you think?

1397
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:43,883
You expect me to do the work?

1398
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:44,983
Gosh, no.

1399
00:52:44,983 --> 00:52:46,593
I'm looking forward to visiting the vintage store.

1400
00:52:47,323 --> 00:52:48,993
(Heading over to the vintage store with anticipation)

1401
00:52:48,993 --> 00:52:51,093
(Looking around)

1402
00:52:51,723 --> 00:52:53,593
It says "secondhand luxury items."

1403
00:52:53,593 --> 00:52:54,693
- Okay.
- What do you think?

1404
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:55,993
- Let's go.
- Pardon?

1405
00:52:55,993 --> 00:52:57,163
Let's check it out.

1406
00:52:57,163 --> 00:52:59,033
(A vintage store is right across the street.)

1407
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:00,373
(Secondhand Luxury Items)

1408
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,473
(Glancing)

1409
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:04,443
I see a few leaves. Do you want to step on them?

1410
00:53:06,003 --> 00:53:08,013
- My gosh. There are only a few.
- Yes?

1411
00:53:08,073 --> 00:53:09,773
- This one...
- They're like stepping stones.

1412
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:10,813
Here you go.

1413
00:53:11,443 --> 00:53:12,813
Here you go. Step on them.

1414
00:53:15,513 --> 00:53:19,153
(Stepping on the leaves to feel the autumn vibe...)

1415
00:53:19,153 --> 00:53:20,653
(as she's desperate)

1416
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:22,093
- That's funny.
- Seriously.

1417
00:53:22,493 --> 00:53:23,823
You're still young at heart.

1418
00:53:24,163 --> 00:53:26,733
I should play Lee Moon Sae's song, "A Little Girl."

1419
00:53:28,193 --> 00:53:29,333
Let's go in.

1420
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,903
- Hello.
- Hello.

1421
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,103
- Hello.
- Hello.

1422
00:53:34,573 --> 00:53:35,803
They have clothes over there.

1423
00:53:36,303 --> 00:53:39,103
Why don't you guys pick something out for me?

1424
00:53:39,103 --> 00:53:40,313
Let's check your taste in fashion.

1425
00:53:40,373 --> 00:53:46,953
(My Star has requested them to pick out an outfit for her.)

1426
00:53:47,553 --> 00:53:51,983
(Her character in the drama is a 1st-generation fashion designer.)

1427
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:58,893
(She's sophisticated and charismatic.)

1428
00:53:59,793 --> 00:54:00,963
How long will it take?

1429
00:54:00,963 --> 00:54:03,063
(They are in charge of picking out an outfit for her.)

1430
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:06,973
(They begin picking out the outfit.)

1431
00:54:07,373 --> 00:54:09,133
You can carry that around. It will make you stand out.

1432
00:54:09,133 --> 00:54:10,743
(Staring)

1433
00:54:11,303 --> 00:54:12,943
That outfit looks really old.

1434
00:54:12,943 --> 00:54:14,543
- This one. Right?
- That looks really old.

1435
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:18,183
I can just come here and pick out a few outfits...

1436
00:54:18,183 --> 00:54:20,283
for period dramas. Wouldn't you agree?

1437
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:22,453
They're all from luxury brands.

1438
00:54:22,453 --> 00:54:24,653
Both of them are from a luxury brand.

1439
00:54:25,083 --> 00:54:27,053
(Looking around)

1440
00:54:27,053 --> 00:54:28,223
What do you think about that one?

1441
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,553
- Which one?
- That one.

1442
00:54:29,893 --> 00:54:31,023
- That one?
- No.

1443
00:54:31,023 --> 00:54:32,193
- The one next to it?
- The one on the bottom.

1444
00:54:32,193 --> 00:54:33,223
That one?

1445
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:37,233
What's that?

1446
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,133
(What's that?)

1447
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:40,433
What?

1448
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:43,033
(Seo Jin picks a black coat with a pattern.)

1449
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,343
Your Majesty.

1450
00:54:45,473 --> 00:54:46,943
It was made in Italy.

1451
00:54:47,013 --> 00:54:48,143
- Really?
- Yes.

1452
00:54:48,643 --> 00:54:50,443
- Perhaps, it could work...
- Pardon?

1453
00:54:50,443 --> 00:54:51,543
once I try it on.

1454
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:53,853
- Why don't you try this on?
- Should I?

1455
00:54:55,783 --> 00:54:57,283
- You didn't pick that one, right?
- It might look good on her.

1456
00:54:57,453 --> 00:54:59,423
- No, I did.
- I...

1457
00:54:59,653 --> 00:55:01,993
(Uncertain)

1458
00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:04,963
Oh, My Star. Hello.

1459
00:55:04,963 --> 00:55:06,193
Gosh, there's static.

1460
00:55:07,993 --> 00:55:09,093
Oh, my.

1461
00:55:09,593 --> 00:55:11,763
- Move away from the mirror.
- It goes well with your pants too.

1462
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:15,173
(Checking the outfit right away)

1463
00:55:15,303 --> 00:55:16,903
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1464
00:55:16,903 --> 00:55:18,173
- This is perfect for people...
- How fascinating.

1465
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:19,443
with a small build.

1466
00:55:19,443 --> 00:55:21,143
- It's between small and medium.
- Right? Exactly.

1467
00:55:21,813 --> 00:55:23,213
- Your size must be small then.
- It's the perfect size for me.

1468
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:25,113
(Even in her 60s, she can pull off a size small effortlessly.)

1469
00:55:25,413 --> 00:55:26,853
She looks like a conductor.

1470
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:28,113
(She didn't expect to like it.)

1471
00:55:28,113 --> 00:55:29,753
- This is great. Right.
- Anything would look great on you.

1472
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:32,723
My gosh. It looks different now that you're wearing it.

1473
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:37,693
(Feeling proud)

1474
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:38,863
Let me see.

1475
00:55:39,693 --> 00:55:41,133
This looks nice and elegant.

1476
00:55:41,133 --> 00:55:42,263
I knew it.

1477
00:55:42,263 --> 00:55:44,163
You do have a good eye, Seo Jin.

1478
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,203
I thought I wouldn't like this style of clothing.

1479
00:55:47,273 --> 00:55:48,833
- She looks great.
- How fascinating.

1480
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:50,743
- Does it look good?
- It looks like it's made for you.

1481
00:55:51,403 --> 00:55:52,943
It's the perfect size for you too.

1482
00:55:53,073 --> 00:55:55,613
(Looking for the next item with confidence)

1483
00:55:56,713 --> 00:55:59,313
(He picks out the next item without hesitation.)

1484
00:55:59,313 --> 00:56:00,983
What do you think about wearing this on top of the coat?

1485
00:56:01,813 --> 00:56:03,653
(He confidently recommends another piece of clothing.)

1486
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:04,883
- On top of this?
- Yes.

1487
00:56:04,883 --> 00:56:06,993
I'm going to look messy today, right?

1488
00:56:07,023 --> 00:56:08,523
- Let me see.
- Hello.

1489
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:10,523
What do you think?

1490
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:12,963
It's supposed to be...

1491
00:56:12,963 --> 00:56:14,233
(An expectant look)

1492
00:56:14,763 --> 00:56:16,233
I see. These two together...

1493
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:17,733
(Impressed)

1494
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,763
Why don't you deliver your lines in English?

1495
00:56:19,763 --> 00:56:20,903
"Dancheong is..."

1496
00:56:20,903 --> 00:56:21,933
(Delivering the line right away)

1497
00:56:22,103 --> 00:56:24,103
Why don't you deliver your lines in English?

1498
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:25,373
"Dancheong is..."

1499
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:28,313
- "Dancheong is..." - "It involves..."

1500
00:56:28,313 --> 00:56:30,383
(Getting into her character, the 1st-generation fashion designer)

1501
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:31,643
Did you just call me hey?

1502
00:56:32,043 --> 00:56:33,283
I meant, "Yes."

1503
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,583
(She's happy with Seo Jin's choices.)

1504
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:38,923
I like this.

1505
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:43,123
(My Star is satisfied with his selection of outfits.)

1506
00:56:43,123 --> 00:56:45,393
- Gosh, Seo Jin...
- They look great layered like this.

1507
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,993
- Right?
- Yes.

1508
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:48,793
- They look good together.
- An outfit chosen by Seo Jin.

1509
00:56:48,793 --> 00:56:50,603
(Seo Jin is happy too.)

1510
00:56:50,603 --> 00:56:52,103
I like picking out clothes for people.

1511
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:53,533
(I like picking out clothes for people.)

1512
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:54,773
It's been my thing.

1513
00:56:55,303 --> 00:56:56,943
Well, I did that a lot back in the day.

1514
00:56:56,943 --> 00:56:57,943
(I did that a lot back in the day.)

1515
00:56:57,943 --> 00:56:59,103
- You were really good at that.
- Yes.

1516
00:56:59,103 --> 00:57:00,243
And...

1517
00:57:00,743 --> 00:57:02,173
I think...

1518
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:04,243
I have a good eye for fashion.

1519
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:07,283
An outfit chosen by Seo Jin.

1520
00:57:07,453 --> 00:57:10,683
(An outfit chosen by Seo Jin looks perfect on her.)

1521
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:15,123
(Looking around)

1522
00:57:15,653 --> 00:57:18,123
(Kwang Kyu wants to pick out an outfit too.)

1523
00:57:18,123 --> 00:57:19,463
Let's stop here. It's enough.

1524
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,993
I'm afraid Kwang Kyu is going to make me try that on.

1525
00:57:21,993 --> 00:57:23,263
Let's stop here. It's enough.

1526
00:57:23,903 --> 00:57:25,703
I'm afraid Kwang Kyu is going to make me try that on.

1527
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:26,973
(Already turning down his choice)

1528
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,803
- Try this on.
- Come on.

1529
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:30,803
It won't look different once you try it on.

1530
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:32,403
- Why do you think so? Explain it.
- Pardon?

1531
00:57:32,403 --> 00:57:33,943
Tell me why you think so.

1532
00:57:33,943 --> 00:57:35,613
I think this colour will brighten your face.

1533
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:37,013
- You think so?
- Yes.

1534
00:57:38,983 --> 00:57:40,913
Kwang Kyu is asking to be scolded.

1535
00:57:41,453 --> 00:57:43,283
Kwang Kyu is asking to be scolded.

1536
00:57:44,023 --> 00:57:46,023
- Seriously. Look at that.
- What?

1537
00:57:46,023 --> 00:57:47,853
- Why not?
- That's just...

1538
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,363
- Look at that.
- Why not?

1539
00:57:50,363 --> 00:57:53,363
That's a summer outfit. I have to take off my clothes.

1540
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:56,093
Seo Jin is looking for items I can layer up with.

1541
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:58,003
This store is filled with clothes.

1542
00:57:58,303 --> 00:58:00,473
- That's what he wants me to wear.
- You won't star in period pieces?

1543
00:58:00,473 --> 00:58:02,173
Gosh, there's so much static.

1544
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:06,203
I'll send you the pictures. So it'd be nice...

1545
00:58:06,203 --> 00:58:08,113
- to talk to your stylist about it.
- Really?

1546
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:11,813
- Okay. One, two, three.
- Make me look tall.

1547
00:58:12,413 --> 00:58:14,053
I'm sorry. But could you bring your feet together?

1548
00:58:14,313 --> 00:58:15,513
She's already doing that.

1549
00:58:15,683 --> 00:58:18,023
No. Not like that.

1550
00:58:18,323 --> 00:58:19,753
Stand tall.

1551
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:23,923
(My Star is quite playful.)

1552
00:58:24,023 --> 00:58:25,593
Did you see my facial expression?

1553
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:27,863
Do a better job. Make me look tall.

1554
00:58:27,863 --> 00:58:30,763
- You already look tall. Okay.
- Make my legs look longer.

1555
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:32,533
(They visit the second store right away.)

1556
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:33,933
Hello.

1557
00:58:34,873 --> 00:58:36,943
- Excuse us. Hello.
- We'd like to look around.

1558
00:58:36,943 --> 00:58:37,973
Sure.

1559
00:58:39,103 --> 00:58:41,943
- Clothes here look great.
- Right.

1560
00:58:42,473 --> 00:58:44,043
Are they all vintage clothes?

1561
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:46,583
No. This is a curated store. Clothes here are expensive.

1562
00:58:47,013 --> 00:58:49,913
- He's so funny.
- Ditch that kind of stereotype.

1563
00:58:50,353 --> 00:58:52,253
What stereotype? Clothes here are expensive.

1564
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:55,093
- Is it a famous brand?
- Yes. This is a good brand.

1565
00:58:55,093 --> 00:58:56,523
(The curated store is stocked with clothes from designer brands.)

1566
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:58,393
- It's a curated store?
- Seo Jin, give me my bag.

1567
00:58:58,563 --> 00:59:00,433
I want you guys to pick out an outfit for me.

1568
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:05,263
(Looking for outfits that would suit her character, a top designer)

1569
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:09,703
(They start picking out outfits for the 2nd time.)

1570
00:59:10,773 --> 00:59:12,703
(Browsing)

1571
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:15,873
This is my top pick.

1572
00:59:17,883 --> 00:59:18,943
Beautiful.

1573
00:59:20,113 --> 00:59:21,983
- Should I try it on?
- I like velvet.

1574
00:59:22,153 --> 00:59:23,613
- Really?
- Yes.

1575
00:59:24,423 --> 00:59:26,523
(Glancing at it)

1576
00:59:27,993 --> 00:59:29,693
It looks beautiful. Should I try it on?

1577
00:59:29,693 --> 00:59:31,193
- Yes.
- Okay.

1578
00:59:32,593 --> 00:59:36,263
(She tries on a black velvet jacket Seo Jin picks for her.)

1579
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:40,033
Gosh, it's so light.

1580
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:42,673
This jacket feels so light.

1581
00:59:43,203 --> 00:59:46,403
Everything looks great. Gosh, I love it.

1582
00:59:46,403 --> 00:59:47,443
(Glancing back)

1583
00:59:48,473 --> 00:59:49,973
I'd wear this often.

1584
00:59:50,683 --> 00:59:52,813
- You wear oversized pants too.
- Yes.

1585
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:55,183
- Did you pick them for her?
- Yes.

1586
00:59:55,413 --> 00:59:56,953
- How about this?
- What's that?

1587
00:59:58,083 --> 00:59:59,223
- Did you pick them for her?
- Yes.

1588
00:59:59,223 --> 01:00:00,853
- How about this?
- What's that?

1589
01:00:00,853 --> 01:00:02,193
(Backing away)

1590
01:00:02,793 --> 01:00:03,863
"What's that?"

1591
01:00:04,863 --> 01:00:07,233
- They look good.
- They do, right?

1592
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:08,263
Should I try them on?

1593
01:00:08,463 --> 01:00:10,733
- They look great. How nice.
- They do.

1594
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:14,003
What's this?

1595
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,433
Is this a grocery bag?

1596
01:00:15,873 --> 01:00:17,303
It's a dust bag.

1597
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:19,443
I see. They come as a set.

1598
01:00:22,613 --> 01:00:24,313
(Concerned)

1599
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:25,783
Should I try them on?

1600
01:00:26,183 --> 01:00:27,913
Well, why don't you try them on briefly?

1601
01:00:27,913 --> 01:00:28,953
- Sure.
- Okay.

1602
01:00:28,953 --> 01:00:30,423
- I'll try on anything you want.
- Okay.

1603
01:00:30,653 --> 01:00:32,453
- Is this the front side?
- Yes.

1604
01:00:33,223 --> 01:00:34,753
- You can wear it over your pants.
- Okay.

1605
01:00:35,093 --> 01:00:36,653
- I'll wear them over my pants.
- Okay.

1606
01:00:36,653 --> 01:00:37,923
(She tries on a black flared skirt and a beige jacket.)

1607
01:00:37,923 --> 01:00:40,193
- This is an oversized skirt.
- The clothes...

1608
01:00:40,193 --> 01:00:42,093
- Right here.
- Okay.

1609
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:46,433
(My Star has an unsure look on her face.)

1610
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:49,203
(She tries on the jacket right away.)

1611
01:00:51,803 --> 01:00:54,173
(Nervous)

1612
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:56,313
- Like this?
- Yes.

1613
01:00:57,813 --> 01:00:59,543
I was going for that designer vibe.

1614
01:01:00,883 --> 01:01:02,553
I was going for that designer vibe.

1615
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:12,363
- You picked them out?
- Yes.

1616
01:01:12,563 --> 01:01:14,263
- They look good. I can wear boots.
- Really?

1617
01:01:14,263 --> 01:01:16,063
Yes. You look like a designer.

1618
01:01:16,163 --> 01:01:18,163
- What do you think?
- This store has amazing clothes.

1619
01:01:18,163 --> 01:01:19,333
- Right.
- You look like a designer.

1620
01:01:19,333 --> 01:01:21,503
- This store has amazing clothes.
- Right.

1621
01:01:22,073 --> 01:01:23,133
Seo Jin, this looks good.

1622
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:25,043
My character can wear this. She's a designer.

1623
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:27,143
I can pair this outfit with boots.

1624
01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:28,443
Kwang Kyu, how did you pick them out?

1625
01:01:28,443 --> 01:01:29,673
You didn't pick them out, right?

1626
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:30,713
No, I did.

1627
01:01:31,143 --> 01:01:33,643
You may not know, but I used to work at a clothing store...

1628
01:01:33,643 --> 01:01:35,313
in my 20s.

1629
01:01:36,013 --> 01:01:37,253
- PePe and MARZO.
- I don't recognise the names.

1630
01:01:38,023 --> 01:01:40,183
- PePe and MARZO.
- PePe?

1631
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:41,893
MARZO. It was a brand from a conglomerate.

1632
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:45,823
It was the only conglomerate I ever worked for.

1633
01:01:45,823 --> 01:01:49,333
People who were born in the 90s know the brand.

1634
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:50,463
(A staff member born in the 90s is puzzled.)

1635
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,903
You must know the brand.

1636
01:01:52,063 --> 01:01:53,503
You know MARZO, right?

1637
01:01:53,903 --> 01:01:55,773
PePe and MARZO.

1638
01:01:55,773 --> 01:01:57,943
There were signs, "90 percent off."

1639
01:01:57,943 --> 01:01:59,443
Were the brands for men's clothing?

1640
01:01:59,473 --> 01:02:00,573
No, women's clothing.

1641
01:02:01,743 --> 01:02:03,073
PePe and MARZO.

1642
01:02:03,213 --> 01:02:05,643
(A trained eye of a former employee at a fashion company)

1643
01:02:05,643 --> 01:02:07,153
- PePe and MARZO.
- Pick one more outfit.

1644
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:08,353
- PePe and MARZO?
- PePe and MARZO?

1645
01:02:08,653 --> 01:02:10,213
- You know MARZO, right?
- No, I don't.

1646
01:02:10,923 --> 01:02:13,353
I see a lot of beautiful clothes in the back too. The black one.

1647
01:02:14,093 --> 01:02:16,423
(MARZO is on the move.)

1648
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:17,823
PePe and MARZO.

1649
01:02:20,223 --> 01:02:22,293
(Scanning)

1650
01:02:25,463 --> 01:02:27,803
(Since he's at it, Seo Jin recommends another one.)

1651
01:02:28,803 --> 01:02:31,043
(Skillful)

1652
01:02:31,603 --> 01:02:32,873
I love this one.

1653
01:02:33,943 --> 01:02:35,613
Everything in this store looks good.

1654
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:37,343
(She loves the long gray coat too.)

1655
01:02:37,343 --> 01:02:38,413
(It's Seo Jin's second pick.)

1656
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:40,313
- Gosh, this looks great.
- It looks good.

1657
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:42,653
That kind of colour is hard to come by.

1658
01:02:43,783 --> 01:02:45,383
Forget about sentimentality or whatever.

1659
01:02:46,323 --> 01:02:48,193
It doesn't matter if you're in a bad mood.

1660
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:49,823
Shopping always solves every problem.

1661
01:02:49,823 --> 01:02:51,023
(Shopping is the way to go when feeling lonely.)

1662
01:02:51,123 --> 01:02:52,823
Shopping soothes all of our feelings in the end.

1663
01:02:52,823 --> 01:02:55,233
(Shopping is the solution to loneliness.)

1664
01:02:55,433 --> 01:02:56,993
I don't need to step on leaves.

1665
01:02:57,163 --> 01:02:58,263
I don't need leaves.

1666
01:02:58,703 --> 01:03:00,633
I don't feel lonely anymore.

1667
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:01,833
Shopping is the way to go when you feel lonely.

1668
01:03:01,873 --> 01:03:03,833
- Right. That's perfect for women.
- It's always shopping.

1669
01:03:03,833 --> 01:03:06,003
- Shopping heals loneliness.
- Right. I want to buy everything.

1670
01:03:07,073 --> 01:03:08,643
We don't need to go to another store.

1671
01:03:08,643 --> 01:03:10,343
(My Star's sentimentality is fulfilled through shopping.)

1672
01:03:10,343 --> 01:03:11,413
Let's buy everything.

1673
01:03:13,813 --> 01:03:15,683
- Gosh, this is...
- Oh, my. Kwang Kyu...

1674
01:03:16,313 --> 01:03:19,053
This would look great on a designer.

1675
01:03:19,953 --> 01:03:21,993
- It's a German brand.
- Really?

1676
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:24,563
Yes. It's a German brand.

1677
01:03:24,563 --> 01:03:26,563
(He confidently makes a recommendation now.)

1678
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,333
My gosh, Kwang Kyu. You're great at picking out clothes.

1679
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:32,963
- Gosh, look at this, Seo Jin.
- Yes.

1680
01:03:33,363 --> 01:03:35,603
It's a German brand.

1681
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:36,633
(Brimming with confidence)

1682
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:38,743
- Hello.
- Hello.

1683
01:03:38,743 --> 01:03:40,673
- Dancheong.
- "It involves..."

1684
01:03:40,673 --> 01:03:42,943
(Kwang Kyu picks a black balloon dress.)

1685
01:03:44,343 --> 01:03:45,843
- Dancheong.
- "Dancheong is a traditional..."

1686
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:48,213
Yes. Okay.

1687
01:03:48,713 --> 01:03:49,883
I picked this one.

1688
01:03:51,623 --> 01:03:55,023
- Gosh, I can wear it in my drama.
- It's perfect for your drama.

1689
01:03:55,093 --> 01:03:57,463
- Look at the details of the dress.
- Yes.

1690
01:03:57,463 --> 01:03:59,793
A fashion designer would wear something like this.

1691
01:04:00,293 --> 01:04:01,733
- It's unique.
- Everything in here looks good.

1692
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,633
How about this with the dress?

1693
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:06,303
- On top of the dress?
- Yes.

1694
01:04:11,003 --> 01:04:14,143
(An oversized black jumper)

1695
01:04:17,173 --> 01:04:18,243
Like this?

1696
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:21,283
If you wear that, the dress I picked wouldn't stand out.

1697
01:04:23,813 --> 01:04:26,023
It won't be good for anyone. I think...

1698
01:04:26,323 --> 01:04:29,093
- Yes. This jacket looks fancy too.
- She should wear it separately.

1699
01:04:29,093 --> 01:04:30,293
- This is...
- Yes.

1700
01:04:30,623 --> 01:04:32,323
- It's kind of iffy.
- Yes.

1701
01:04:33,323 --> 01:04:35,263
- Ask how much this is.
- This one?

1702
01:04:36,093 --> 01:04:37,903
Ma'am. The outfit I chose earlier...

1703
01:04:38,433 --> 01:04:40,973
How much is the jacket from the German brand?

1704
01:04:42,803 --> 01:04:45,703
- The jacket?
- Just the jacket.

1705
01:04:46,043 --> 01:04:47,643
It was right here.

1706
01:04:47,643 --> 01:04:48,943
- I was the one who picked it.
- Hold on.

1707
01:04:51,113 --> 01:04:54,383
- It's 1,650 dollars.
- Pardon? It's 1,650 dollars?

1708
01:04:54,953 --> 01:04:56,013
My gosh.

1709
01:04:56,383 --> 01:04:58,453
Can you give us a discount?

1710
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,223
- Is that brand-new?
- Yes.

1711
01:05:00,223 --> 01:05:01,453
I see.

1712
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:03,623
- It costs 1,650 dollars. Pardon?
- It's handmade.

1713
01:05:03,623 --> 01:05:05,363
- It's handmade.
- It's handmade.

1714
01:05:05,463 --> 01:05:06,693
So it costs 1,650 dollars.

1715
01:05:06,823 --> 01:05:08,863
How about a tiny discount then?

1716
01:05:09,933 --> 01:05:11,403
Is the owner here?

1717
01:05:11,863 --> 01:05:13,403
- Where's the owner?
- The owner isn't here.

1718
01:05:15,503 --> 01:05:16,933
I see. Okay.

1719
01:05:16,933 --> 01:05:18,473
(He stops pushing for now.)

1720
01:05:18,473 --> 01:05:20,643
How about calling the owner... Never mind.

1721
01:05:20,913 --> 01:05:22,543
I'm going to...

1722
01:05:23,473 --> 01:05:24,483
Gosh, Mi Sook.

1723
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:27,783
This costs 1,650 dollars.

1724
01:05:29,013 --> 01:05:30,783
- It's handmade. What?
- It's so expensive.

1725
01:05:30,783 --> 01:05:32,083
- It's so expensive.
- Right.

1726
01:05:32,683 --> 01:05:34,623
- Ask how much this costs.
- When you pick...

1727
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:36,723
- Go and ask for the price.
- That's...

1728
01:05:36,723 --> 01:05:38,163
- What? This one?
- Ask how much it is.

1729
01:05:39,263 --> 01:05:41,133
Could you check this one?

1730
01:05:43,563 --> 01:05:45,463
- It's 1,350 dollars.
- It's 1,350 dollars.

1731
01:05:47,503 --> 01:05:51,173
Mi Sook. It costs 1,350 dollars.

1732
01:05:51,603 --> 01:05:52,743
(She likes them, )

1733
01:05:52,743 --> 01:05:54,273
(but they're too pricey to buy just for her role.)

1734
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:55,713
- Why don't you...
- Let me think about it.

1735
01:05:55,713 --> 01:05:57,713
Is it something I can wear in my day-to-day life?

1736
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,313
This costs over 1,000 dollars.

1737
01:06:01,313 --> 01:06:02,553
It's around 1,500 dollars.

1738
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:04,723
Something I can wear off-camera and in my drama.

1739
01:06:04,723 --> 01:06:06,983
Seo Jin. Should I just buy this one?

1740
01:06:07,353 --> 01:06:09,723
So I can wear it off-camera and in my drama.

1741
01:06:09,853 --> 01:06:10,993
That would be even better.

1742
01:06:11,723 --> 01:06:14,093
Would you wear something like this off-camera?

1743
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:16,593
This goes over 2,000 dollars.

1744
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:18,303
It's 4,000 dollars.

1745
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:22,673
Hey, that's over 4,000 dollars.

1746
01:06:24,373 --> 01:06:26,703
(Prudent)

1747
01:06:26,703 --> 01:06:28,243
Seo Jin, I'll take this.

1748
01:06:28,673 --> 01:06:30,373
I can look stylish with this.

1749
01:06:30,573 --> 01:06:33,143
I can wear it when my character goes out too.

1750
01:06:33,813 --> 01:06:36,683
I can pair it with a belt. I would look fashionable.

1751
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:39,383
- Did you pick that one?
- Yes.

1752
01:06:40,123 --> 01:06:41,723
Gosh, mine didn't get chosen in the end.

1753
01:06:42,653 --> 01:06:45,793
(After much deliberation, she goes with Seo Jin's choice.)

1754
01:06:47,393 --> 01:06:49,363
(Can you go and bargain?)

1755
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:56,233
(My Star asked me to haggle.)

1756
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:00,173
We want to ask for a discount.

1757
01:07:00,943 --> 01:07:03,343
- I have to talk to the owner, no?
- Yes, she just...

1758
01:07:03,343 --> 01:07:05,613
- Sorry?
- She's the owner.

1759
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:06,643
- The one who just left?
- Yes.

1760
01:07:06,643 --> 01:07:08,313
But she said the owner wasn't here.

1761
01:07:08,953 --> 01:07:10,653
She was the owner,

1762
01:07:10,653 --> 01:07:12,153
and she said the owner was out?

1763
01:07:13,253 --> 01:07:14,993
She lied to me.

1764
01:07:17,153 --> 01:07:20,023
The owner... Ma'am!

1765
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:23,393
You can't say you're not the owner.

1766
01:07:25,303 --> 01:07:26,403
I just...

1767
01:07:26,733 --> 01:07:28,433
Can we get a discount?

1768
01:07:28,803 --> 01:07:31,243
Please lower the price so that I can save face.

1769
01:07:31,243 --> 01:07:32,943
- Are you paying with a card?
- Yes.

1770
01:07:32,943 --> 01:07:34,173
We normally don't give discounts.

1771
01:07:34,173 --> 01:07:35,273
Really?

1772
01:07:36,843 --> 01:07:37,943
(Impressed)

1773
01:07:38,343 --> 01:07:40,243
You can't bargain...

1774
01:07:40,243 --> 01:07:42,383
when it's a fixed-price system.

1775
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:43,383
(They ended up paying full price.)

1776
01:07:43,383 --> 01:07:45,153
Let's go and look for our mood.

1777
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:47,153
I thought that was over.

1778
01:07:47,153 --> 01:07:49,753
No, we need to eat dinner.

1779
01:07:49,753 --> 01:07:51,163
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1780
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:52,823
Where are we going?

1781
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:54,463
Let's talk on the way.

1782
01:07:54,463 --> 01:07:56,093
Find me a moody restaurant.

1783
01:07:56,093 --> 01:07:57,733
(6:30pm, restaurant, after-party)

1784
01:07:57,733 --> 01:07:58,833
We need to eat.

1785
01:08:00,903 --> 01:08:01,933
You must eat meat.

1786
01:08:03,603 --> 01:08:05,303
Look up "pork belly place with an open sky."

1787
01:08:08,273 --> 01:08:10,613
Pork belly place with an open sky.

1788
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,583
Don't you have to specify that it's in Itaewon?

1789
01:08:13,543 --> 01:08:16,213
We can check that on the map.

1790
01:08:17,413 --> 01:08:18,483
There's none.

1791
01:08:20,283 --> 01:08:21,453
There's none.

1792
01:08:22,753 --> 01:08:25,123
- None.
- We're so stupid.

1793
01:08:25,563 --> 01:08:27,533
We're looking up "pork belly place with an open sky."

1794
01:08:28,263 --> 01:08:31,033
- What do we say?
- You mean an open roof.

1795
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:32,403
Yes, an open roof.

1796
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,473
An open sky sounds a little weird.

1797
01:08:35,473 --> 01:08:37,873
A pork belly place where you can see the sky.

1798
01:08:38,273 --> 01:08:40,103
Open-air pork belly place.

1799
01:08:40,103 --> 01:08:44,513
(The two seem similar.)

1800
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:47,753
- I found one.
- Did you? Show me.

1801
01:08:47,753 --> 01:08:50,413
Pork belly and webfoot octopus place in Itaewon with an outdoor terrace.

1802
01:08:50,883 --> 01:08:52,083
Let me see.

1803
01:08:52,353 --> 01:08:53,583
- That stings.
- That stings.

1804
01:08:56,093 --> 01:08:57,123
(My Star and Kwang Kyu hit it off well.)

1805
01:08:57,123 --> 01:08:59,463
There's so much static between us.

1806
01:08:59,463 --> 01:09:01,233
- It means you're not compatible.
- We're not.

1807
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:03,263
- We're the opposites.
- It's on the rooftop.

1808
01:09:03,263 --> 01:09:04,433
- Really?
- Yes.

1809
01:09:05,463 --> 01:09:06,833
Are you open today?

1810
01:09:06,933 --> 01:09:08,633
(Moving to an open-air pork belly place that Kwang Kyu found)

1811
01:09:08,633 --> 01:09:11,473
We're coming with a camera crew. Can we film inside?

1812
01:09:11,703 --> 01:09:13,043
Yes, you can.

1813
01:09:13,043 --> 01:09:14,643
Okay. Thanks.

1814
01:09:14,643 --> 01:09:15,673
(Dinner outside with My Star, the last atmospheric activity)

1815
01:09:15,673 --> 01:09:18,383
There's a table outside.

1816
01:09:19,843 --> 01:09:20,883
Where should we sit?

1817
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:22,753
- Are you going to sit outside?
- No.

1818
01:09:22,753 --> 01:09:24,683
You should. It's a special day.

1819
01:09:24,753 --> 01:09:25,853
But it'll be cold now.

1820
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:27,523
You insisted that we eat outside.

1821
01:09:28,393 --> 01:09:30,723
- But it's cold.
- You can leave that.

1822
01:09:30,723 --> 01:09:31,823
I'll check.

1823
01:09:37,963 --> 01:09:39,863
Your wish came true. You can see the sky.

1824
01:09:39,863 --> 01:09:41,173
- Is that so?
- There's the sky.

1825
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:42,533
Okay. I'll eat outside.

1826
01:09:42,533 --> 01:09:44,003
- Sure.
- Are you serious?

1827
01:09:44,303 --> 01:09:46,243
- I think you'll feel cold.
- No, I can handle it.

1828
01:09:46,243 --> 01:09:48,143
Sit here. You have a better view of the sky.

1829
01:09:49,943 --> 01:09:52,113
- This side has a better view.
- I don't want to see the sky.

1830
01:09:52,743 --> 01:09:54,783
Just look. You said...

1831
01:09:54,783 --> 01:09:56,683
the autumn sky was beautiful.

1832
01:09:57,013 --> 01:09:58,983
- I shouldn't have said it.
- Take a seat.

1833
01:09:58,983 --> 01:10:01,493
This is... Oh, it's beautiful.

1834
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:02,753
Right? You can see the sky.

1835
01:10:02,753 --> 01:10:04,623
(My Star, who's fickle, loves it.)

1836
01:10:04,793 --> 01:10:06,023
Should we start the barbecue fire first?

1837
01:10:06,023 --> 01:10:07,963
Yes, let's start cooking meat.

1838
01:10:08,293 --> 01:10:10,493
Turn on the fire first. It's cold.

1839
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:12,663
Is it that cold?

1840
01:10:12,663 --> 01:10:13,933
(They might freeze to death, trying to take care of her.)

1841
01:10:14,003 --> 01:10:15,733
- It's on.
- Turn it on.

1842
01:10:15,803 --> 01:10:16,903
Okay.

1843
01:10:16,903 --> 01:10:18,043
(Turning the stove on for survival)

1844
01:10:18,773 --> 01:10:19,943
I'm glad, though.

1845
01:10:20,473 --> 01:10:21,713
We can see the sky.

1846
01:10:22,813 --> 01:10:24,983
I found a pork belly place where you can see the sky.

1847
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,283
This place is so atmospheric, though.

1848
01:10:28,383 --> 01:10:31,623
(The atmosphere enthusiast loves it.)

1849
01:10:33,153 --> 01:10:35,053
I'm so tired that I'll fall asleep after one drink.

1850
01:10:35,923 --> 01:10:38,623
- Are you tired?
- I'm exhausted.

1851
01:10:38,763 --> 01:10:40,863
But you didn't even do much.

1852
01:10:42,033 --> 01:10:43,893
She had a hard time trying on all those clothes.

1853
01:10:43,893 --> 01:10:45,463
Getting changed is so tough.

1854
01:10:45,463 --> 01:10:48,403
It was less tiring because you could try them on without taking it off.

1855
01:10:48,403 --> 01:10:49,773
Of course. I could never do it.

1856
01:10:50,333 --> 01:10:51,903
I've never been a shopper.

1857
01:10:52,643 --> 01:10:56,173
You should have been born as a son.

1858
01:10:56,173 --> 01:10:57,273
- I agree.
- Yes.

1859
01:10:57,913 --> 01:10:59,483
Do you want to take my jacket?

1860
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:01,353
- Yes. I'll take it off.
- Put this on.

1861
01:11:01,353 --> 01:11:03,313
(Giving her a warm jacket to appreciate the autumn mood)

1862
01:11:03,313 --> 01:11:04,423
Then...

1863
01:11:04,423 --> 01:11:05,553
- Thank you.
- Here it is.

1864
01:11:07,553 --> 01:11:08,693
You're high-maintenance.

1865
01:11:09,923 --> 01:11:11,523
You're very high-maintenance.

1866
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,923
Who says that directly to the actor?

1867
01:11:15,463 --> 01:11:16,933
You...

1868
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:18,033
(Grabbing tightly)

1869
01:11:19,763 --> 01:11:22,803
- Man, you're high-maintenance.
- Seriously.

1870
01:11:22,803 --> 01:11:24,033
(He finally gave her his jacket.)

1871
01:11:24,033 --> 01:11:26,403
(It's time to eat.)

1872
01:11:27,273 --> 01:11:28,943
Do you want me to cook the meat?

1873
01:11:28,943 --> 01:11:30,513
- No.
- I'll do it.

1874
01:11:30,813 --> 01:11:33,913
You're so impatient.

1875
01:11:33,983 --> 01:11:35,013
(Embarrassed)

1876
01:11:35,013 --> 01:11:36,013
Goodness.

1877
01:11:36,613 --> 01:11:38,223
(Hurrying)

1878
01:11:38,383 --> 01:11:39,483
Here.

1879
01:11:40,323 --> 01:11:42,553
- Cheers.
- Great work today.

1880
01:11:42,553 --> 01:11:43,853
- Good work.
- Good work.

1881
01:11:44,623 --> 01:11:45,723
I'm a fan.

1882
01:11:47,293 --> 01:11:48,693
(Laughing)

1883
01:11:51,233 --> 01:11:53,563
(It's a little cold, )

1884
01:11:53,563 --> 01:11:55,373
(but it's nice to feel like you're at a cart bar.)

1885
01:11:55,373 --> 01:11:56,533
All right, then.

1886
01:11:57,533 --> 01:11:59,203
- I'll start cooking the meat.
- Okay.

1887
01:11:59,643 --> 01:12:02,313
Frozen pork belly.

1888
01:12:02,313 --> 01:12:03,543
(Kwang Kyu, the Griller Fairy, gets to work.)

1889
01:12:03,873 --> 01:12:07,083
(Sizzling)

1890
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,123
- Should I help?
- That's fine.

1891
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:12,653
- I'll use another pair.
- No.

1892
01:12:12,883 --> 01:12:13,883
Why are you so rushed?

1893
01:12:14,283 --> 01:12:15,623
Do you have an appointment next?

1894
01:12:16,423 --> 01:12:17,423
(My Star is extremely impatient.)

1895
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:18,893
All right.

1896
01:12:19,723 --> 01:12:21,633
It looks incredible.

1897
01:12:22,633 --> 01:12:25,233
- Men are good at grilling meat.
- Right.

1898
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:26,303
(Trust your Griller Fairy.)

1899
01:12:26,303 --> 01:12:28,403
- Is it cooked now?
- Try it.

1900
01:12:28,403 --> 01:12:29,403
(The first slice goes to the impatient My Star.)

1901
01:12:30,473 --> 01:12:34,203
(Big bite)

1902
01:12:34,203 --> 01:12:36,343
(Another bite)

1903
01:12:37,213 --> 01:12:38,543
Do you want me to make you a wrap?

1904
01:12:38,883 --> 01:12:41,383
Well, I'd be grateful.

1905
01:12:42,383 --> 01:12:43,983
I can just wrap it.

1906
01:12:44,483 --> 01:12:45,583
Seo Jin.

1907
01:12:46,853 --> 01:12:47,923
Seo Jin.

1908
01:12:50,223 --> 01:12:51,423
Oh, she didn't mean me.

1909
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:54,533
- Kimchi...
- I'm sure it's good.

1910
01:12:54,833 --> 01:12:56,133
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1911
01:12:56,863 --> 01:12:58,633
Try it, Kwang Kyu. It's good.

1912
01:12:58,633 --> 01:13:00,863
(Griller Fairy also takes a bite.)

1913
01:13:01,203 --> 01:13:02,273
It's good, isn't it?

1914
01:13:05,073 --> 01:13:06,103
What's your problem?

1915
01:13:06,543 --> 01:13:08,143
I didn't even chew it yet,

1916
01:13:08,143 --> 01:13:10,173
and she asked, "It's good, isn't it?"

1917
01:13:10,673 --> 01:13:12,713
She asked me as soon as it touched my lips.

1918
01:13:12,713 --> 01:13:13,713
(My Star is way too impatient.)

1919
01:13:13,713 --> 01:13:16,983
I was thinking that I asked too soon.

1920
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:18,683
Right?

1921
01:13:18,823 --> 01:13:20,083
I didn't even get to chew it once.

1922
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:21,223
It's really good, though.

1923
01:13:23,053 --> 01:13:25,023
Did your daughter move out?

1924
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:26,523
We all live separately.

1925
01:13:28,093 --> 01:13:29,763
- They all live alone?
- All of them.

1926
01:13:29,763 --> 01:13:30,793
(Her children live abroad.)

1927
01:13:30,793 --> 01:13:32,003
My son and my daughter.

1928
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:35,173
How was it looking after me today?

1929
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:37,103
Was I unpleasant?

1930
01:13:37,233 --> 01:13:39,573
It went just as I had expected.

1931
01:13:40,203 --> 01:13:41,643
What was your expectation?

1932
01:13:43,473 --> 01:13:44,683
- What did you expect?
- What?

1933
01:13:44,683 --> 01:13:45,783
What did you expect?

1934
01:13:45,783 --> 01:13:47,983
A neighbourhood friend.

1935
01:13:48,113 --> 01:13:49,213
- Really?
- Yes.

1936
01:13:50,153 --> 01:13:53,623
And you look just as beautiful in real life.

1937
01:13:53,953 --> 01:13:55,023
Especially your nose.

1938
01:13:55,923 --> 01:13:58,323
Back in the day when I was in college,

1939
01:13:59,293 --> 01:14:01,393
you once played Kim Yeong Cheol's wife in a drama.

1940
01:14:01,393 --> 01:14:03,163
- I did.
- That was so fun.

1941
01:14:03,163 --> 01:14:04,703
Right. "How's Your Husband?"

1942
01:14:04,703 --> 01:14:05,703
Yes, that's the one.

1943
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,733
I was in the US at the time,

1944
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:09,933
so I had to rent videos to watch it.

1945
01:14:10,173 --> 01:14:11,403
Oh, I see.

1946
01:14:11,403 --> 01:14:12,903
I could watch every episode.

1947
01:14:12,903 --> 01:14:14,203
(The drama of his lifetime at the time)

1948
01:14:14,203 --> 01:14:16,243
I loved it. It was the most memorable one.

1949
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:19,383
I won all the awards on SBS, thanks to that.

1950
01:14:20,713 --> 01:14:21,813
Hey!

1951
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,723
(Mi Sook was loved...)

1952
01:14:24,723 --> 01:14:27,953
(by the entire country for her incredible acting.)

1953
01:14:28,123 --> 01:14:30,053
(Grand Award, Drama Category, Lee Mi Sook)

1954
01:14:31,993 --> 01:14:38,633
(She proved that it was her prime by winning all the awards.)

1955
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:40,933
- It was so fun.
- It was.

1956
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:42,173
And it was written well.

1957
01:14:43,033 --> 01:14:45,103
She's also like...

1958
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:46,843
an idol to us.

1959
01:14:47,043 --> 01:14:48,713
Definitely. She's our idol.

1960
01:14:48,873 --> 01:14:49,973
Seriously.

1961
01:14:49,973 --> 01:14:51,943
(My Star was their idol.)

1962
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:54,543
The two best actresses when I was younger.

1963
01:14:55,213 --> 01:14:56,383
Lee Mi Sook and Lee Bo Hee.

1964
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:01,753
She was literally the best when I was a student.

1965
01:15:03,393 --> 01:15:06,663
I've watched so many of her movies and dramas.

1966
01:15:06,663 --> 01:15:09,163
So, I actually dreamed of...

1967
01:15:09,163 --> 01:15:10,263
(He spent the day with his idol today.)

1968
01:15:10,263 --> 01:15:11,403
meeting her.

1969
01:15:12,663 --> 01:15:13,663
Definitely.

1970
01:15:13,663 --> 01:15:15,303
I've watched you so many times as I was growing up.

1971
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,873
(He's fascinated that he spent a day with his idol.)

1972
01:15:17,903 --> 01:15:19,443
But you were disappointed, weren't you?

1973
01:15:19,873 --> 01:15:21,103
Slightly.

1974
01:15:22,873 --> 01:15:24,783
He's so...

1975
01:15:24,883 --> 01:15:26,543
Can you say it indirectly like he does?

1976
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,013
I realised that you didn't like it when I was indirect.

1977
01:15:31,013 --> 01:15:32,553
That's not true.

1978
01:15:32,553 --> 01:15:34,423
I don't like being indirect myself.

1979
01:15:34,423 --> 01:15:36,353
- Is that so?
- I like it when you're indirect.

1980
01:15:36,353 --> 01:15:38,463
Is that right? I'll say it indirectly, then.

1981
01:15:38,763 --> 01:15:40,993
- I understand.
- Try to speak indirectly.

1982
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,093
I've been a huge fan ever since I was little.

1983
01:15:44,093 --> 01:15:45,633
That was so insincere.

1984
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:49,233
I wish I could open my chest and show you how I really feel.

1985
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:57,443
I'm not sure what to call you, though.

1986
01:15:59,213 --> 01:16:01,753
You were a superstar when I was a student,

1987
01:16:02,013 --> 01:16:03,183
and I wasn't even an actor.

1988
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:04,283
- Me?
- Yes.

1989
01:16:04,683 --> 01:16:06,323
I'm like your older sister, though.

1990
01:16:06,323 --> 01:16:07,383
But...

1991
01:16:07,753 --> 01:16:09,123
we used to call you...

1992
01:16:09,993 --> 01:16:12,093
- Lee Mi Sook.
- Right.

1993
01:16:12,893 --> 01:16:13,923
So,

1994
01:16:14,423 --> 01:16:15,693
it feels weird...

1995
01:16:15,693 --> 01:16:18,033
to call you my senior, even though I'm actor now.

1996
01:16:18,233 --> 01:16:19,503
Because I used to...

1997
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:21,063
idolize you so much when I was little.

1998
01:16:21,063 --> 01:16:22,603
Keep calling her Lee Mi Sook, then.

1999
01:16:23,373 --> 01:16:24,903
Lee Mi Sook.

2000
01:16:24,903 --> 01:16:26,273
So, it felt...

2001
01:16:26,643 --> 01:16:29,313
- ironic.
- That's true.

2002
01:16:29,313 --> 01:16:31,043
Even today, we called her...

2003
01:16:31,043 --> 01:16:33,083
Ms. Lee, our senior, and Mi Sook.

2004
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,683
But we didn't even go to the same school.

2005
01:16:34,983 --> 01:16:36,013
Call me your girl.

2006
01:16:36,013 --> 01:16:37,283
"You're My Girl?"

2007
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:41,753
Because you're my girl

2008
01:16:41,753 --> 01:16:44,023
I'll call you by your name

2009
01:16:44,023 --> 01:16:45,263
Stop.

2010
01:16:46,363 --> 01:16:47,363
It's so...

2011
01:16:48,193 --> 01:16:49,263
This is fun.

2012
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:52,663
I find it fascinating...

2013
01:16:52,663 --> 01:16:53,863
when I work with other actors...

2014
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:55,603
that I've watched as I was growing up.

2015
01:16:56,173 --> 01:16:58,403
- Many of them aren't active now.
- Right.

2016
01:16:58,603 --> 01:17:01,443
The ones who still are impress me.

2017
01:17:01,443 --> 01:17:02,713
Right.

2018
01:17:03,413 --> 01:17:05,183
- Do you think I can last long?
- Pardon?

2019
01:17:05,183 --> 01:17:06,483
Do you think I can last long?

2020
01:17:06,843 --> 01:17:08,583
You've already lasted long.

2021
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,953
- You're already...
- I mean,

2022
01:17:09,953 --> 01:17:11,553
you already have staying power.

2023
01:17:11,553 --> 01:17:13,783
You've been doing great.

2024
01:17:13,783 --> 01:17:16,253
You don't have to be stressed out about that.

2025
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:17,453
But...

2026
01:17:17,453 --> 01:17:19,993
I'm only human...

2027
01:17:19,993 --> 01:17:21,963
Even before I was old enough to debut,

2028
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:23,833
you had already achieved everything.

2029
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:26,163
- Already.
- It's true.

2030
01:17:26,163 --> 01:17:27,603
- All right?
- He's right.

2031
01:17:27,603 --> 01:17:29,133
I made my debut...

2032
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:30,903
when I was 28 or 29,

2033
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:34,843
but you had swept everything...

2034
01:17:35,143 --> 01:17:36,643
before you reached that age.

2035
01:17:39,943 --> 01:17:42,113
You're filming a melodrama with Kang Seok Woo, even now.

2036
01:17:42,913 --> 01:17:44,213
That's...

2037
01:17:44,613 --> 01:17:46,253
Yesterday, I read...

2038
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:50,023
that you two would play the lead roles of a melodrama,

2039
01:17:50,023 --> 01:17:51,393
and I said to myself,

2040
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:54,723
"We haven't had a romance drama of middle-aged people in so long."

2041
01:17:54,723 --> 01:17:56,633
- Right?
- And...

2042
01:17:56,633 --> 01:17:58,033
even people like me...

2043
01:17:58,163 --> 01:17:59,533
turn it down when we get offers...

2044
01:17:59,963 --> 01:18:01,333
to film middle-aged romance.

2045
01:18:01,603 --> 01:18:03,373
I'm like, "Who would watch that?"

2046
01:18:03,633 --> 01:18:04,903
But it makes me feel good to know...

2047
01:18:04,903 --> 01:18:05,973
that you two would be in it.

2048
01:18:07,143 --> 01:18:09,073
We haven't had a middle-aged romance piece in a long time.

2049
01:18:09,073 --> 01:18:10,113
Right.

2050
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:11,373
(Mi Sook and Seok Woo's romance in their 60s)

2051
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:12,843
From what I think,

2052
01:18:13,883 --> 01:18:15,013
it must have been...

2053
01:18:15,253 --> 01:18:17,153
the toughest for you...

2054
01:18:17,153 --> 01:18:18,923
when you had to step down...

2055
01:18:18,923 --> 01:18:20,253
from continuously playing the lead roles...

2056
01:18:20,353 --> 01:18:21,993
as you got older.

2057
01:18:21,993 --> 01:18:23,123
(It must have been the toughest for you.)

2058
01:18:23,123 --> 01:18:24,393
- To be perfectly honest, - Yes.

2059
01:18:24,493 --> 01:18:25,693
it wasn't tough.

2060
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:27,793
Just because...

2061
01:18:29,293 --> 01:18:30,433
I'm not playing lead roles anymore,

2062
01:18:30,433 --> 01:18:32,463
it doesn't mean that I'm gone.

2063
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:35,233
- So, you took it well.
- I think so too.

2064
01:18:35,233 --> 01:18:36,703
I'm still me.

2065
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:38,803
Whether I'm playing a small role or not,

2066
01:18:38,803 --> 01:18:40,973
I only need to do my best in playing that...

2067
01:18:40,973 --> 01:18:42,773
and act like I'm the main character.

2068
01:18:43,413 --> 01:18:44,543
Right.

2069
01:18:45,343 --> 01:18:47,583
When I used to play lead roles,

2070
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:50,353
I was in 55 out of 60 scenes.

2071
01:18:50,683 --> 01:18:53,083
And there must have been actors who acted in the other five scenes.

2072
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:56,193
I'm in their position now.

2073
01:18:56,193 --> 01:18:58,963
So, I'm not going to waste it.

2074
01:18:58,963 --> 01:19:00,893
(I won't waste even the smallest role.)

2075
01:19:00,893 --> 01:19:03,233
And just because I'm in fewer scenes now,

2076
01:19:03,233 --> 01:19:05,033
it doesn't mean my existence is gone.

2077
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:06,663
(It doesn't mean my existence is gone.)

2078
01:19:07,503 --> 01:19:10,333
(In her 20s, )

2079
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:14,913
(she was an actress who used to shine by herself.)

2080
01:19:17,713 --> 01:19:19,613
(Time had passed, )

2081
01:19:19,613 --> 01:19:26,453
(and My Star has become an actress who let the shows shine.)

2082
01:19:28,823 --> 01:19:30,623
So, you're not that stressed out by that.

2083
01:19:30,623 --> 01:19:31,723
I'm not.

2084
01:19:32,023 --> 01:19:34,663
- I felt so at ease.
- You felt at ease.

2085
01:19:35,093 --> 01:19:36,163
Still,

2086
01:19:36,163 --> 01:19:37,693
you've played leading roles throughout the 80s,

2087
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:40,103
and you stopped acting in romance shows...

2088
01:19:40,103 --> 01:19:42,103
- in the 90s.
- Right.

2089
01:19:42,103 --> 01:19:43,903
Then, you started playing mothers.

2090
01:19:43,903 --> 01:19:46,803
I think you're on the right track.

2091
01:19:47,243 --> 01:19:48,443
It didn't look...

2092
01:19:48,843 --> 01:19:50,943
like you were disappointed to play mothers now.

2093
01:19:50,943 --> 01:19:53,083
You were like, "It's about time I play mothers now."

2094
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:54,583
- Of course.
- "I'll do it."

2095
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,883
Yes, I think I have to keep being nonchalant about it.

2096
01:19:56,883 --> 01:19:58,553
Judging from today,

2097
01:19:58,553 --> 01:20:00,323
you don't seem like the type...

2098
01:20:00,323 --> 01:20:01,693
to overthink things.

2099
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:03,393
You don't seem like the type...

2100
01:20:03,393 --> 01:20:04,623
to overthink things.

2101
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:08,733
You don't strike me as a deep thinker.

2102
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:10,663
I realise that now.

2103
01:20:11,703 --> 01:20:12,703
- Hey.
- You're not...

2104
01:20:12,703 --> 01:20:14,263
- that insightful, to be honest.
- Hey.

2105
01:20:14,263 --> 01:20:15,733
- You could have sugar-coated it.
- But...

2106
01:20:15,733 --> 01:20:17,903
Her thoughts aren't that profound.

2107
01:20:17,903 --> 01:20:18,943
(Sticking to his opinion)

2108
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:20,803
(We spent a day with you today, )

2109
01:20:20,803 --> 01:20:23,813
(and you were more naive than we thought.)

2110
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:28,013
This place is lovely.

2111
01:20:29,013 --> 01:20:30,553
I love the sky.

2112
01:20:32,383 --> 01:20:34,183
Look up "pork belly place with an open sky."

2113
01:20:35,293 --> 01:20:36,593
- None.
- We're so stupid.

2114
01:20:37,523 --> 01:20:38,963
(He noticed how childlike she was...)

2115
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:40,263
(for a 65-year-old.)

2116
01:20:40,263 --> 01:20:41,963
If I don't seem that deep,

2117
01:20:41,963 --> 01:20:44,793
- it means I'm really deep.
- The depth... Sure.

2118
01:20:45,163 --> 01:20:47,003
You lasted so long...

2119
01:20:47,003 --> 01:20:48,403
for someone who's so shallow,

2120
01:20:48,403 --> 01:20:49,833
so it's impressive.

2121
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:51,303
(It's impressive.)

2122
01:20:51,573 --> 01:20:53,143
That's truly impressive.

2123
01:20:53,543 --> 01:20:55,473
Stop mocking her.

2124
01:20:56,013 --> 01:20:57,913
(Laughing)

2125
01:20:58,173 --> 01:21:00,183
How long have you been shallow?

2126
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:02,853
Have you lost your mind?

2127
01:21:02,853 --> 01:21:04,913
He always takes it one step further.

2128
01:21:05,123 --> 01:21:06,223
- He doesn't know when to stop.
- Come on.

2129
01:21:06,223 --> 01:21:07,323
I'm sorry.

2130
01:21:07,323 --> 01:21:08,723
"How long have you been shallow?"

2131
01:21:09,253 --> 01:21:11,923
Were there any happy moments this year?

2132
01:21:12,123 --> 01:21:14,023
What did you like best?

2133
01:21:14,693 --> 01:21:15,963
Making YouTube videos?

2134
01:21:15,963 --> 01:21:17,393
Your channel this year...

2135
01:21:17,393 --> 01:21:18,733
I like how much you enjoy it.

2136
01:21:18,733 --> 01:21:21,263
It was tough making that decision.

2137
01:21:21,263 --> 01:21:22,873
Although it was tough...

2138
01:21:22,873 --> 01:21:24,333
making those videos,

2139
01:21:25,343 --> 01:21:27,943
- my image...
- Yes.

2140
01:21:28,313 --> 01:21:31,213
People normally see me as an actor,

2141
01:21:31,213 --> 01:21:32,283
but how I seem in my YouTube videos is...

2142
01:21:32,283 --> 01:21:34,113
who I truly am.

2143
01:21:34,113 --> 01:21:35,713
(That's who I really am.)

2144
01:21:36,913 --> 01:21:39,353
(My Star has revealed her true self, )

2145
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:41,893
(which she hasn't shown all this time.)

2146
01:21:44,553 --> 01:21:45,793
- Mi Sook.
- Yes?

2147
01:21:46,563 --> 01:21:47,923
Two of your toes went...

2148
01:21:47,923 --> 01:21:49,263
into one toe slot of your sock.

2149
01:21:52,333 --> 01:21:53,633
I was wondering...

2150
01:21:54,503 --> 01:21:56,833
what was stuck to my toe.

2151
01:21:57,733 --> 01:22:00,003
I kept feeling stuffy for some reason.

2152
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:02,773
(She showed how down-to-earth she was.)

2153
01:22:02,773 --> 01:22:04,273
You want to know how I wash my face?

2154
01:22:04,343 --> 01:22:05,583
How women wash their faces?

2155
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:09,483
(She even revealed how she took care of her skin...)

2156
01:22:09,483 --> 01:22:12,353
(and her body in her 60s.)

2157
01:22:12,353 --> 01:22:14,083
Two. Last one.

2158
01:22:14,353 --> 01:22:15,493
Did you just swear at me?

2159
01:22:15,493 --> 01:22:17,053
(I never knew how lovely she was.)

2160
01:22:17,053 --> 01:22:18,793
(Mi Sook is so funny and genuine.)

2161
01:22:18,793 --> 01:22:20,523
(I never liked her, but I'm starting to.)

2162
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:22,733
It's not easy for an actress...

2163
01:22:22,733 --> 01:22:24,393
- to reveal everything about her.
- Indeed.

2164
01:22:24,463 --> 01:22:26,033
I think it was the right choice.

2165
01:22:26,433 --> 01:22:28,133
The fact that I took courage...

2166
01:22:28,133 --> 01:22:29,673
to do it at my age is...

2167
01:22:29,673 --> 01:22:32,243
the decision I'm most glad about.

2168
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:34,603
I really thought it through.

2169
01:22:35,843 --> 01:22:37,513
Did you ever worry...

2170
01:22:37,513 --> 01:22:38,713
that they'd stop offering roles?

2171
01:22:38,713 --> 01:22:40,243
- I never worried about that.
- I see.

2172
01:22:40,243 --> 01:22:42,083
That's something only you worry about.

2173
01:22:42,553 --> 01:22:43,753
(Laughing)

2174
01:22:43,753 --> 01:22:44,883
I never did.

2175
01:22:44,883 --> 01:22:47,083
- You didn't have to point that out.
- Why would you worry about that?

2176
01:22:47,553 --> 01:22:48,953
Just looking at you makes me laugh.

2177
01:22:48,953 --> 01:22:50,253
There are people...

2178
01:22:50,253 --> 01:22:51,723
who naturally make you laugh.

2179
01:22:51,723 --> 01:22:53,663
They're just being themselves,

2180
01:22:54,363 --> 01:22:56,133
and you want to tease them...

2181
01:22:56,133 --> 01:22:58,033
and be friends with them.

2182
01:22:58,033 --> 01:22:59,803
You feel like they'll play along well.

2183
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:02,103
That's because you're Lee Mi Sook.

2184
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,503
That's all it is.

2185
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:05,803
The Lee Mi Sook from my childhood.

2186
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:09,673
You've been my childhood dream.

2187
01:23:10,313 --> 01:23:11,573
Ever since I was little.

2188
01:23:12,313 --> 01:23:13,883
And you called her shallow?

2189
01:23:13,883 --> 01:23:15,513
But it's true!

2190
01:23:15,813 --> 01:23:18,083
I only said the truth.

2191
01:23:18,153 --> 01:23:20,353
It just means that I was a fan when I was little.

2192
01:23:20,353 --> 01:23:21,853
Who cares if she's deep or shallow?

2193
01:23:21,853 --> 01:23:23,093
I like her more because she's not that deep.

2194
01:23:23,093 --> 01:23:24,253
(I like her more because she's not that deep.)

2195
01:23:24,453 --> 01:23:25,823
Fine. I'll admit it.

2196
01:23:26,063 --> 01:23:27,263
I'm not that deep.

2197
01:23:28,163 --> 01:23:30,593
But I am when it comes to acting.

2198
01:23:32,163 --> 01:23:33,733
Because that's what I'm good at.

2199
01:23:33,733 --> 01:23:34,833
(Because that's what I'm good at.)

2200
01:23:35,533 --> 01:23:37,573
How much have your emotions been recharged?

2201
01:23:38,033 --> 01:23:39,173
Today?

2202
01:23:39,743 --> 01:23:41,443
(Pondering)

2203
01:23:41,473 --> 01:23:42,973
I'd say about 80 percent.

2204
01:23:42,973 --> 01:23:44,173
By myself, I mean.

2205
01:23:46,883 --> 01:23:48,243
And it's not...

2206
01:23:48,453 --> 01:23:50,853
stepping on those leaves that made me sentimental.

2207
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:53,583
I was simply happy to have walked...

2208
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,823
around Itaewon.

2209
01:23:55,253 --> 01:23:56,423
Look at those leaves.

2210
01:23:56,993 --> 01:24:03,093
(My Star took a whole day to recharge her autumn sentiment.)

2211
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:07,363
That itself...

2212
01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:09,333
makes you emotional.

2213
01:24:09,673 --> 01:24:10,833
I loved it.

2214
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:12,703
(I loved it.)

2215
01:24:13,403 --> 01:24:14,603
Kwang Kyu.

2216
01:24:15,813 --> 01:24:17,073
I can see my breath now.

2217
01:24:17,873 --> 01:24:18,983
(Ruining the mood until the end)

2218
01:24:19,583 --> 01:24:22,313
I'm starting to feel cold.

2219
01:24:23,883 --> 01:24:26,253
Every time and every moment,

2220
01:24:27,623 --> 01:24:28,823
I just...

2221
01:24:28,823 --> 01:24:30,223
(Today's My Star gets emotional.)

2222
01:24:30,223 --> 01:24:32,463
(The meme generator, Kim Won Hun)

2223
01:24:32,463 --> 01:24:33,563
You want to go or not?

2224
01:24:33,563 --> 01:24:34,723
You want to go or not?

2225
01:24:34,763 --> 01:24:35,793
What's that?

2226
01:24:35,793 --> 01:24:36,833
You want to go or not?

2227
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:40,333
(In My Star's YouTube video, )

2228
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:42,433
(the secretaries make a cameo appearance.)

2229
01:24:42,473 --> 01:24:44,173
Why do I have to give you a monologue?

2230
01:24:44,173 --> 01:24:46,243
(Ad-libbing passionately)

2231
01:24:46,303 --> 01:24:48,573
His dimple surgery went wrong.

2232
01:24:48,943 --> 01:24:50,113
Did it?

2233
01:24:50,113 --> 01:24:51,543
Did he get it at a beauty parlour?

2234
01:24:51,643 --> 01:24:52,913
Cut.

2235
01:24:53,113 --> 01:24:54,413
(They end up bursting into laughter.)

2236
01:24:54,413 --> 01:24:56,753
(How will their cameo appearance go?)

2237
01:24:56,783 --> 01:24:58,583
I need a gargle, Kwang Kyu!

2238
01:24:58,683 --> 01:25:00,123
Stick it in my hand.

2239
01:25:00,953 --> 01:25:02,553
Play along.

2240
01:25:02,553 --> 01:25:04,223
(It's going to be another long day.)

2241
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:07,023
I'm going to sell used items.

2242
01:25:07,023 --> 01:25:09,033
(Sell My Star's used props.)

2243
01:25:09,033 --> 01:25:10,663
(Kwang Kyu struggles with taking photos again.)

2244
01:25:10,663 --> 01:25:12,103
And I have clothes.

2245
01:25:12,103 --> 01:25:13,133
You look amazing.

2246
01:25:13,633 --> 01:25:15,033
It's so rare.

2247
01:25:15,603 --> 01:25:17,003
Karrot!

2248
01:25:17,003 --> 01:25:18,903
I'm getting so many messages!

2249
01:25:18,903 --> 01:25:21,103
(Won Hun ends up coming out alone, )

2250
01:25:21,103 --> 01:25:22,943
(and the secretaries watch.)

2251
01:25:22,943 --> 01:25:24,573
(From a distance)

2252
01:25:24,813 --> 01:25:27,083
I took the photos, wrote the description,

2253
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,813
contacted them, and everything.

2254
01:25:28,913 --> 01:25:31,883
(My Star eventually loses his temper.)

2255
01:25:31,883 --> 01:25:34,383
(How will their first second-hand trade caretaking go?)

2256
01:25:34,383 --> 01:25:36,153
(Putting it in his pocket)

2257
01:25:36,153 --> 01:25:38,253
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2258
01:25:38,993 --> 01:25:44,563
(My Grumpy Secretary)
