1
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,850
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,960
(My Star is waiting at Deungchon SBS Hall.)

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,770
(It's the morning scenery on the day of "Inkigayo" shoot.)

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,939
(My Star, who's already there, is passionately warming up.)

5
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,480
(At 8:50am, the Grumpy Secretaries show up for work at the same time.)

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,510
- You look great today.
- Yes.

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,580
Why are you in such a great shape?

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,820
I am not.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,750
- You are in a good mood today.
- I am not.

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,119
The first part...

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,060
H.O.T. is the greatest idol.

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,830
Did you deliberately dress up...

13
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,529
like an idol for "Inkigayo?"

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,630
- He's like an idol.
- Did you?

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,970
That's one strange idol.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,570
(Dancing)

17
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,269
(You will fall for me)

18
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,809
(You will go crazy about me)

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,710
(The older bestie's talent show activates his dimples.)

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,750
- I don't know what comes after.
- What's in that bag?

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,779
I went to Vietnam,

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,250
and they gave me this grocery bag-like bag.

23
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,750
So I thought I would carry it around today.

24
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,050
Where's the manager's bag?

25
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,920
- I was told not to carry it.
- Who said that?

26
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,390
My mom.

27
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,700
- Put it away then.
- Makes me look like a moneylender.

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,029
Hey.

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,399
(The 60-year-old manager, Kwang Kyu...)

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,499
Let's go.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,870
(listens to his mom well.)

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,010
It's your first day on "Inkigayo."

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,970
I think it's my first time coming here.

34
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,880
We have to pass this street?

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,319
(As soon as they turn the corner, )

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,150
(they face an incredible spectacle.)

37
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,560
(Man forest)

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,129
(K-pop fans flocked in from all over the world.)

39
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,260
(Young energy)

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,569
(Crash-landing right in the middle is...)

41
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,669
We're supposed to pass through here?

42
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,040
(the Grumpy Secretaries whose average age is 55.5 years old.)

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,539
It's Kwang Kyu.

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,140
(The fans start to recognise the Grumpy Secretaries.)

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,480
(Shaking eyes)

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,550
(The singer with 2 albums follow behind Seo Jin.)

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,579
(They walk fast so that they don't disturb the order.)

48
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,580
(No way.)

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,819
(Suddenly, they shout loudly.)

50
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,889
Hello.

51
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,790
(Shaken even more)

52
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,290
(Speed-walking straight ahead, booster on)

53
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

54
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,229
Hello.

55
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,759
(The Grumpy Secretaries are not familiar with a big crowd.)

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,860
Let's go.

57
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,930
(A fiery, frantic dash to work)

58
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,169
- Hello.
- Hello.

59
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,339
Hello.

60
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,609
Hello.

61
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,909
(Embarrassed)

62
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,240
- Hello.
- Hello.

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,310
- Hello.
- Hello.

64
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,919
(The hallway of a music show has the fresh energy.)

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,319
- Hello.
- Hello.

66
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,950
Hello. I am U-Know's manager Byun Si Woo.

67
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,789
He's preparing for the dry rehearsal.

68
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,260
So I will take you to the waiting room first.

69
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,029
Please come this way.

70
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,560
(My Star is busy preparing for the rehearsal happening soon.)

71
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,700
Come in.

72
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,469
Hello.

73
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,310
(My Star doesn't know that the Grumpy Secretaries are here.)

74
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,139
Hey, Seo Jin.

75
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,539
- Long time no see.
- Hey.

76
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,849
(Today's My Star is U-Know Yunho.)

77
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,480
- Hey, Seo Jin.
- Long time no see.

78
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,279
- Hey, Seo Jin.
- Long time no see.

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Hey.

80
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,820
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

81
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,559
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

82
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,460
Of all days... Today is going to be a tough day.

83
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,600
(Today's going to be a tough day?)

84
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,270
(They should've run away as soon as they met.)

85
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,830
His presence itself torments me on a psychological level.

86
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,600
It was really hard.

87
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,770
I can't run.

88
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,080
Please love Yunho.

90
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,179
(Endless challenges)

91
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,580
The worst bug for your health...

92
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,390
is still the one called "carelessness."

93
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,030
(The man with unlimited passion has gotten an upgrade.)

94
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,830
I think you are doing it carelessly.

95
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,099
- You should put your heart into it.
- Yes.

96
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,199
I will.

97
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,929
Let's do it again.

98
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,599
Again. I am sorry.

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,370
- One last try.
- Okay.

100
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,070
We can try a little bit harder.

101
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,010
We are nearly there.

102
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,039
The energy is never cut.

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,480
- One last time.
- Okay.

104
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,250
Yunho gives me a hard time, on a psychological level.

105
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,579
Why are we TVXQ?

106
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,579
And why am I U-Know Yunho?

107
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,080
Let's show them on the stage.

108
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,249
We have to do the dry rehearsal.

109
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,519
Get ready.

110
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,290
- The dry rehearsal.
- Get changed where? Here?

111
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,790
I will go get changed quickly.

112
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,159
He has to do the dry rehearsal.

113
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,260
(Passionate)

114
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,800
- You can ask us to do anything.
- No, no.

115
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,130
- You can ask us to do anything.
- No, no.

116
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,529
I will get to it slowly.

117
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,540
(With a mysterious smile, he leaves them for a short while.)

118
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,140
I will hand you the handbook.

119
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,139
(Not knowing their future, they receive the handbook.)

120
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,279
If you look here...

121
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,410
(What's My Star's schedule of the day?)

122
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,620
(My Star's Schedule)

123
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,650
- There are a lot of things.
- Take a look at it.

124
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,559
He will be starring in a music show today.

125
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,890
It's a very important schedule,

126
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,829
so please take great care of him.

127
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,999
He needs to prepare everything perfectly before going on stage.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,269
Otherwise, he can become a little edgy.

129
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,269
I got everything you will need,

130
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,500
so I will explain them to you.

131
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,970
Look here.

132
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,869
This is the list of other artists...

133
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,709
who will be appearing on the show today.

134
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,810
I've prepared two for you.

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,139
You can take a look at them. As managers, it would be nice...

136
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,579
if you familiarize yourselves with the other artists' names.

137
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,619
(They need to memorize the group names and 84 names.)

138
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,919
(It feels very different from the very beginning.)

139
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,019
BOYNEXTDOOR?

140
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,760
Yes. It's all here.

141
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,260
(The names sound so alien to him, let alone memorizing them.)

142
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,230
Don't you know LE SSERAFIM?

143
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,230
LE SSERAFI?

144
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,970
Isn't it a cosmetics brand?

145
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,770
I've heard of LE SSERAFIM.

146
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,109
- Like I said...
- Not the trot singer, Shin Yu.

147
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,210
Is he a different person?

148
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,780
Goodness.

149
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,410
It's SHINYU.

150
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,079
Aren't you thinking about the trot singer, Shin Yu?

151
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,420
- No.
- No.

152
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,049
I've met him before.

153
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,989
SHINYU. He's my rival.

154
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,250
You're lying.

155
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,060
You're lying, aren't you?

156
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,289
- No, I am not.
- Goodness.

157
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,290
(Worried)

158
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,829
- Right.
- These days...

159
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,059
Who did you say earlier?

160
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,330
BABYNEXTDOOR?

161
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,969
Not BABYNEXTDOOR.

162
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,300
- BOYNEXTDOOR.
- BOYNEXTDOOR.

163
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,839
(We are boys, not babies.)

164
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,600
You got the names mixed up.

165
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,640
There's BABYMONSTER too.

166
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,409
(Laughing)

167
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,909
(He's laughing, but he seems anxious.)

168
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,280
It's MEOVV. Don't say MEHOVV.

169
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,850
(For My Star, they try to memorize the faces.)

170
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,120
I shouldn't watch them.

171
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,530
(He forgets the anxiety and tries to focus on the rehearsal.)

172
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,059
(Meanwhile, the artists approach the waiting room.)

173
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,129
We finally...

174
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,169
- Hello.
- Hello.

175
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,199
Hello.

176
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,899
- Hello.
- Hello.

177
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,540
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

178
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,109
(Who are they?)

179
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,939
- Hello.
- Hello.

180
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,980
Yes.

181
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,339
We are...

182
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,149
(They should know who they are before they say hi.)

183
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,080
They are TWS.

184
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,179
We are TWS.

185
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,389
Twenty-four seven with us!

186
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,790
Hello, we are TWS.

187
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,659
Hello, I am U-Know Yunho of TVXQ.

188
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,660
(The youngest artists have come to greet the most experienced artist.)

189
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,660
They are TWS.

190
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,200
They are the hottest...

191
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,729
new boy band.

192
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,770
(Overjoyed)

193
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,199
Thank you for doing the challenge.

194
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,469
- You did a great job.
- Don't mention it.

195
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,070
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

196
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,539
I will see you later.

197
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,439
- We will do our best.
- Thank you.

198
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,479
- Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,750
They have tiny heads.

200
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,280
They are different.

201
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,779
- Kids these days are...
- They are too slim.

202
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,149
They are like dolls.

203
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,890
(We wish you good health, dear Grumpy Secretaries.)

204
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,120
(After meeting TWS, they become fans.)

205
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,159
- Come in.
- Hello.

206
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,400
Come in, Chang Sub.

207
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,930
(Lee Chang Sub of BTOB)

208
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,030
- Really?
- Here's my new CD.

209
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,769
I have one too.

210
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,499
(Awkward)

211
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,710
Do you know Chang Sub of BTOB?

212
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,710
I think I've seen him somewhere.

213
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,609
(Until recently, Chang Sub hosted "Jeongwaja.")

214
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,510
I loved the show you hosted, "Jeongwaja."

215
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,120
I watched all the episodes.

216
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,290
Thank you.

217
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,789
I watched all the episodes.

218
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,390
- What's "Jeongwaja?" - "Jeongwaja?"

219
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,159
"Jeongwaja?"

220
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,459
(Did he do something wrong?)

221
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,990
Really? What is it?

222
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,760
It's a YouTube content.

223
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,230
He said "Jeongwaja."

224
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,070
I thought it was a drama.

225
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,299
- What?
- Thank you.

226
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,339
- Thank you.
- Sure.

227
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,869
Thank you.

228
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,540
(I'm a good, hard-working man.)

229
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,580
(Yunho's turn approaches.)

230
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,319
(Even the idol with 22 years of experience is nervous.)

231
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,780
- Will you be fine?
- What?

232
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,789
(The rookie manager prepares the in-ear headphone.)

233
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,290
- Hey.
- My in-ear headphone.

234
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,720
- I need to wear it.
- How does it go?

235
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,359
How do you wear it?

236
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,789
You have to pass it...

237
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,900
Pass it through the jacket?

238
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,729
(Careful)

239
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,470
The red one is the left side.

240
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,099
- Do you hang it at the back?
- Yes.

241
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,240
(Seo Jin isn't familiar with it.)

242
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,269
(Music veteran My Star and his novice manager...)

243
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,479
You need to put it here too? Gosh.

244
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,010
(who is clumsy with everything)

245
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,380
Wait. Like this?

246
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,420
(Shaking)

247
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,319
Is his hair going to be okay?

248
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,120
(He checks the details too.)

249
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,589
It might be too tight because the jacket is tight.

250
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,960
That's why I left this out.

251
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,889
(Even if it's his first time, he cares in a detailed manner.)

252
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,200
Right? This is better, right?

253
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,529
(Yunho is done getting ready for the rehearsal.)

254
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,770
As soon as you got here...

255
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,699
This is going to be so fun.

256
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,040
(Finally, it dawns on him that Seo Jin is his manager.)

257
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,610
Before I go in... I've watched this show, you see.

258
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,809
I heard we need to decide how to address each other.

259
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,480
- You get to decide that.
- I do?

260
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,019
In our agency, we have the senior manager...

261
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,450
and the lead manager.

262
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,749
(Senior manager and lead manager?)

263
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,490
We just need to decide who's going to be who.

264
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,590
- Who's the senior manager?
- Who's the boss?

265
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,330
- The senior manager is the boss.
- I am the senior manager then.

266
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,630
- You are the senior manager?
- Yes.

267
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,730
I have to be the senior manager.

268
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,559
(Giving up)

269
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,629
- He's the lead manager then.
- Yes.

270
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,569
Do as you please.

271
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,340
He got a better education than I did.

272
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,110
Although I'm older...

273
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,810
- You're the lead manager.
- Right.

274
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,110
The senior manager is in charge of scheduling and timing things.

275
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,439
Right.

276
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,980
And the lead manager... We've got a lot of crew members.

277
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,690
And they are all very experienced.

278
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,389
- Assist them here and there.
- He's good at that.

279
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,020
I will.

280
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,959
Senior manager, lead manager.

281
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,359
- Lead manager.
- We're going in now.

282
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,760
Okay. The dry rehearsal is starting.

283
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,829
(5 minutes before the rehearsal)

284
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,900
Right.

285
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,169
Can the lead manager do it?

286
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,370
- Is it my job?
- Yes.

287
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,569
(The lead manager's first task is setting the in-ear headphone.)

288
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,570
Here's your water.

289
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,780
You can put it like this.

290
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,610
Put it inside.

291
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,449
(My Star's face completely changed.)

292
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,450
- Okay.
- It won't fall, right?

293
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,749
- Everyone is here.
- Let's go in now.

294
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,250
(Rehearsal)

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,790
Hello.

296
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,490
You got this.

297
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,829
(He cheers for everyone with his dimples.)

298
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,060
(My Star's rehearsal begins.)

299
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,730
(After My Star goes into the rehearsal on time, )

300
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,070
(they hurriedly start to monitor his performance.)

301
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,610
(Confused)

302
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,310
Yunho must have...

303
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,850
done this many times.

304
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,220
- Yes, you're right.
- Then...

305
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,520
The ones doing it for the first time must get very confused.

306
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,190
You get very confused.

307
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:01,860
I've done it too.

308
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,830
It's super nerve-racking and confusing.

309
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,730
(Before they have a chance to chat, )

310
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,170
(My Star's rehearsal begins.)

311
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,040
("Body Language" by U-Know Yunho)

312
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,020
(He watches My Star's performance for the first time.)

313
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,990
(Focused)

314
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,890
(Dancing in perfect sync)

315
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,030
(The artist with 22 years of experience performs passionately.)

316
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,170
(Supporting his artist with passion)

317
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,870
(Peeking)

318
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,670
(The rehearsal ends.)

319
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,579
(Goodness)

320
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,050
(Even the rehearsal is tough.)

321
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,390
(He pours out his passion even during the rehearsal.)

322
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,789
Well done.

323
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,219
(He looks different on stage.)

324
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,330
Goodness.

325
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,160
- Did you enjoy the performance?
- Yes, I did.

326
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,459
Will you keep the headphones on?

327
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,659
- These?
- Yes.

328
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,199
- I will go to the waiting room.
- Okay.

329
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,300
To the waiting room.

330
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,670
Are you okay dancing in those shoes?

331
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,270
- They are a little slippery.
- Right?

332
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,910
Hey, there.

333
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,580
- Did you enjoy the performance?
- I did.

334
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:28,310
Well done.

335
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,309
I filmed it.

336
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,450
Sometimes, we rehearse up to three times.

337
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,850
- You do?
- Usually, we do.

338
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,690
But today,

339
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,460
we'll shoot the clip in advance.

340
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,430
Will you keep these headphones on?

341
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,059
You can take them all off.

342
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,030
- Take them all off.
- Take them all off?

343
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,030
(Seo Genie doesn't forget to take the headphones off him.)

344
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,600
Do you want to take the jacket off too? Isn't it hot?

345
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,240
Take it off.

346
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,909
- Take the jacket off.
- Yes.

347
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,040
(My Star takes off the stage outfit for a short while.)

348
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,610
Goodness.

349
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
- How...
- Goodness.

350
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,580
It's an armour.

351
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,089
Goodness.

352
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,420
(My Star is carrying a huge weight.)

353
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,749
Did you manage to film my performance?

354
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,960
- I did.
- Right.

355
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,729
I need to watch the full performance.

356
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,830
The full performance.

357
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,600
(Seo Genie organises the headphones.)

358
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,870
(He handles My Star's essential equipment with his utmost care.)

359
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,310
(He wraps it up nicely.)

360
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,310
(The monitoring video is on standby as well.)

361
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,580
(Playing the monitoring video)

362
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,520
(Focused)

363
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,920
What did you think of my performance?

364
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,660
I tend to rely on my managers' opinions.

365
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,160
Even before the performance,

366
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,630
we talk a lot, and we brainstorm ideas.

367
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,260
It looks amazing.

368
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,769
The worst comment I can get from my managers is...

369
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,900
a one-liner comment, "It looks amazing."

370
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,910
It's as if you just spat out the line you had prepared.

371
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,040
It makes you sound like you didn't watch it carefully.

372
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,110
Seo Jin, you go first, then.

373
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,079
You already said it. Why pretend like you haven't said anything yet?

374
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
What did you think?

375
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,820
- I worried that you might slip.
- Right.

376
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,189
- These shoes were quite slippery.
- Right.

377
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,320
They are Western boots.

378
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,590
The senior manager is different.

379
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,330
They were slippery.

380
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,099
You spotted that right away.

381
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,730
(Proud)

382
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,700
(During My Star's main recording performance)

383
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,000
(Slipping)

384
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,970
(An accident happens during My Star's performance)

385
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,280
Did you slip?

386
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,580
Yes. I slipped.

387
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,109
I am sorry.

388
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,920
(In the chilled atmosphere, the performance had to be stopped?)

389
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,690
Now the rehearsal has ended.

390
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,590
When the rehearsal is done, you are supposed...

391
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,589
to get some drinks for the dancers and the crew.

392
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,060
You're supposed to check what they want to drink.

393
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,860
Ms. Stylist, what would you like to drink?

394
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,600
I want Iced Americano.

395
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,769
I want Iced Americano too.

396
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,810
- Iced Americano.
- Yes. Two.

397
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,170
- Two iced Americano.
- Yes.

398
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,580
I will have the iced vanilla latte.

399
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,840
- Two.
- Two iced Americano.

400
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,980
When will you check with everyone at that speed?

401
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,579
Next is anilla... Vanilla, is it?

402
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,279
Iced vanilla latte.

403
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,289
What on earth is anilla?

404
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,489
- I think something bad will happen.
- Iced vanilla latte.

405
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,619
- Yes.
- Iced vanilla latte.

406
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,960
- Iced vanilla latte.
- Iced vanilla latte.

407
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,420
One Iced vanilla latte.

408
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,689
There's another crew.

409
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,560
- What else?
- Iced latte, please.

410
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,000
Iced latte.

411
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,129
Gosh.

412
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,000
- Iced latte.
- Iced latte.

413
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,170
And?

414
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,040
Iced milk tea.

415
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,769
- Did you plan this?
- Iced milk tea.

416
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,509
- This is what happens.
- Iced...

417
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,080
They know exactly what they want, don't they?

418
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,780
- This didn't happen in the past.
- Go outside and ask.

419
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,520
- How about you?
- I don't need anything.

420
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,950
Okay.

421
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,350
I'll be back.

422
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,250
Dancers.

423
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,459
- Hello.
- Hello.

424
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,590
Hello.

425
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,560
- He looks young.
- Hello.

426
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,689
Is red for U-Know Yunho?

427
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,829
Hello.

428
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,970
Go, U-Know Yunho!

429
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,200
Where are the dancers?

430
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,399
(Knocking)

431
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,610
Hello.

432
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,769
- Hello.
- Hello.

433
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,039
Where is U-Know Yunho's dance crew?

434
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,180
- It's us.
- Here.

435
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,039
You just danced.

436
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,850
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,850
Why do you all look different?

438
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,249
- Right.
- We are the same people.

439
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,320
I'm going to go buy some drinks.

440
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,690
What would you like to drink? Anything you need?

441
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,560
Can I have strawberry latte?

442
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,700
Darn it.

443
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,499
(They have unique tastes too.)

444
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,300
Strawberry latte. Okay.

445
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,500
One strawberry latte. All right.

446
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,440
- Okay.
- Chocolate latte, please.

447
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,910
I want vanilla latte.

448
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,310
Iced vanilla latte.

449
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,650
Decaffeine.

450
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,050
Gosh.

451
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,480
Gosh, decaf.

452
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,819
- Decaf.
- I will go last.

453
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,390
One decaf.

454
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,589
(8 drinks for the hair and makeup team)

455
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,259
(9 drinks for the dance crew)

456
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,030
I want iced Americano too.

457
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,690
Why do they drink so much coffee?

458
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,299
Goodness.

459
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,470
(He’s stuck fetching 20 cups of coffee.)

460
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,440
(He returns to the waiting room.)

461
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,800
Why are you back?

462
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,509
I need you to come with me. I can't carry them alone.

463
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,610
There are over 20 cups.

464
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,180
It's...

465
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,209
There are too many. Nearly 30 cups.

466
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,380
Did you find the cafe?

467
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,080
There must be a cafe nearby, right?

468
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,989
They need to drink it on time to cheer up, you know.

469
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,119
(They need to drink it on time to cheer up, you know.)

470
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,129
I am putting pressure on you.

471
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,029
- But...
- The atmosphere of the team...

472
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,500
- But...
- will be determined by your hands.

473
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,629
SM Entertainment must be rich.

474
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,600
They have to pay for nearly 30 cups of coffee.

475
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,299
This never happens in my agency.

476
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,810
We drink vending machine coffees.

477
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,640
It's offline.

478
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,080
When the recording begins,

479
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,649
the dancers and the crew...

480
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,750
will start to look grim.

481
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,290
(You should hurry and get the coffee.)

482
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,660
I should ask my old manager.

483
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,030
- I just ran into my old manager.
- There's nowhere...

484
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,490
Hello.

485
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,530
- Chan Won.
- Hello, Kwang Kyu.

486
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,230
- Chan Won.
- How are you?

487
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,829
- I enjoyed your performance.
- Thank you.

488
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:26,599
- Did you hear it?
- I did. Through the monitor.

489
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,699
- Right.
- I saw it.

490
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,570
Where's a cafe nearby?

491
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,909
We've got more than enough coffee.

492
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,909
- Do you want to take some?
- No.

493
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,109
- No.
- But really.

494
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,109
We bought more than enough just in case.

495
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,719
- So we can share.
- Really?

496
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,780
We bought more than 20 cups.

497
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,149
How many can you spare?

498
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,719
About 5 to 6 cups at least.

499
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,789
- I will take them then.
- Do you want them?

500
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,819
If you have six cups you can spare.

501
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,930
Hey.

502
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,959
- Good luck.
- I will see you later.

503
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,660
Okay.

504
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,830
(Caretaker Fairy goes to buy the rest of 15 cups.)

505
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,670
(He hurries.)

506
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,740
Do I have to use the kiosk to order?

507
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,180
Is it not possible to order at the counter?

508
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,540
- You can.
- I will say my order.

509
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,310
(Meanwhile, in the waiting room)

510
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,120
Did Chan Won release a new song?

511
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,219
I think so.

512
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,350
(They are currently recording Chan Won's performance.)

513
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,419
(My Star is performing...)

514
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,860
(right after Chan Won.)

515
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,030
I wonder when Kwang Kyu will come back.

516
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,459
- We...
- Will he make it on time?

517
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,560
We are...

518
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,030
(Seo Jin is starting to feel anxious too.)

519
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,500
It's not the genre we expected.

520
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,470
- Right. It's different.
- Yes.

521
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,569
Do we need to get ready now?

522
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,110
We will do the last touch-up.

523
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,010
(10 minutes before the shoot)

524
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,690
(He calls Kwang Kyu who went to buy coffee.)

525
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,619
Hello?

526
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,959
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes.

527
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,160
- Where are you?
- I'm at a coffee shop.

528
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,630
Hurry.

529
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,460
Hey, they're still making the coffee I ordered.

530
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,200
Hurry up, anyway.

531
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,970
We're about to go into camera rehearsal.

532
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,970
Just hurry up.

533
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,640
- I got it.
- Okay.

534
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,439
- Please stand by.
- Yes.

535
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,509
Is it my turn already?

536
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,510
- Please stand by.
- Yes.

537
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,510
Is it my turn already?

538
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:15,510
- Chan Won is done after this one.
- Really?

539
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,549
- Do I need to stand by?
- Please get dressed.

540
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,549
- Yes.
- Put on the headset and in-ears.

541
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,550
Okay.

542
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,750
(Seo Jin is picking up the in-ears calmly first.)

543
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,090
(Rushing)

544
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,459
(The previous team was done sooner than expected.)

545
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,630
- It's done.
- Thanks.

546
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,170
(Dancers are also gathering.)

547
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,570
(The audience is starting to enter.)

548
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,969
- Please head over to the set.
- Okay.

549
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,809
Our coffee still hasn't arrived. That's not good.

550
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,039
(3 minutes before the stage)

551
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,109
Okay.

552
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,879
(3 minutes before the stage)

553
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,379
The coffee still hasn't arrived.

554
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,250
(The coffee hasn't arrived for the staff.)

555
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,850
You guys are okay without coffee, right?

556
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,590
Are you okay?

557
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,550
The coffee still hasn't arrived.

558
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,020
I'm sorry.

559
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,390
The coffee will be ready when you're done with the stage.

560
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,430
(Serious)

561
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,869
- I'm here.
- Here he is.

562
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:15,109
- I'm here.
- The coffee is here.

563
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,509
Wait. I'm here.

564
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,539
Here he is.

565
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,179
- I'm here.
- Come on. Hurry up.

566
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,309
- The coffee is here.
- Come on.

567
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,509
- I'm here.
- Come on. Hurry up.

568
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,649
Let's have coffee.

569
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,279
- Have coffee.
- If you want a drink, grab one now.

570
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
(The coffee arrived just in the nick of time.)

571
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,779
Kwang Kyu, why did you get iced tea?

572
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,289
Someone requested it.

573
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,890
- Let the dancers have coffee first.
- Who wanted iced tea?

574
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,689
This is iced tea.

575
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,260
(Passing out the coffee quickly)

576
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,590
Who wanted vanilla latte?

577
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,229
- That would be me.
- Okay.

578
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,159
- I asked for decaf.
- Do you want decaf?

579
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,900
Here is decaf.

580
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,100
- All right, who hasn't gotten it?
- I want a latte.

581
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,340
Here is a latte.

582
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,110
- Who wanted an iced Americano?
- That was us.

583
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,979
- These are iced Americanos.
- Thank you.

584
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,240
- Thanks.
- Thanks for the coffee.

585
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,479
- Here is an iced Americano.
- Let's give it one last push.

586
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,750
- Thanks.
- Okay.

587
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,349
- Thanks for the coffee.
- Thanks.

588
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,449
- Thank you.
- Sure.

589
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,550
Hi.

590
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,820
- Hi, how have you been?
- Hi.

591
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,060
They're my managers today.

592
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,259
Yes, I heard that.

593
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,289
This is senior manager, and this is the lead manager.

594
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,489
You really got coffee.

595
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,560
- Of course, I did.
- The time was tight.

596
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,829
Thank you, by the way.

597
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,369
Thanks. You saved us four cups of coffee.

598
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,399
(Chan Won's coffee helped to reduce costs.)

599
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,930
- You saved us four coffees.
- Really?

600
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,139
Did you pay for the coffee?

601
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,270
No, I used his company card.

602
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,880
- Let me put your mic pack on.
- Yes, sure.

603
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,039
That's right. It's urgent.

604
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,980
We need to decide on the ending pose.

605
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,320
We need to decide on the ending pose.

606
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,820
We agreed earlier not to do a heart pose.

607
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,320
- A heart pose is too cliche.
- Yes.

608
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,360
When I get a birdie,

609
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,690
I do something like this.

610
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:44,030
- When you get a birdie?
- Yes.

611
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:45,600
Doing it like this?

612
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,030
(Ditching him over his terrible pose)

613
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,370
Doing it like this?

614
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,369
- I'll do whatever you say.
- No way.

615
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,939
- I noticed...
- Yes.

616
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,469
You did something like that...

617
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,310
- when we were talking earlier.
- Did I?

618
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,810
(Putting his hands together?)

619
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:04,679
- Do you have a habit of doing that?
- Yes, I do.

620
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,949
I think you can just do that pose naturally...

621
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,250
without even trying.

622
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,789
- Okay.
- Because that's your habit.

623
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,020
When I finish the song, just do this pose.

624
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,889
- Is that what you mean?
- Yes, exactly.

625
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,219
I see. Just keep it natural.

626
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,259
- I noticed you do that gesture.
- Oh, I see.

627
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,759
- When you're speaking, - Yes.

628
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,630
- you make this gesture.
- I see.

629
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,529
(Slim pickings)

630
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,840
I was wrong to believe them.

631
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,409
- Did that cross your mind?
- Yes, while I was doing it,

632
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,410
I realised it was my mistake.

633
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,049
So, it's either this or that.

634
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,910
- I'm not sure about this.
- You think it's bad.

635
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,549
That's too old-fashioned.

636
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,379
(He has to choose either one.)

637
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,449
- We're going to roll.
- Yes.

638
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,550
Please spray that here.

639
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,290
Oh, okay.

640
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,329
(Non-slip spray)

641
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:49,690
We just need to spray the ball of the foot.

642
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,760
The heels are rubber.

643
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,660
- Yes, just the ball of the foot.
- Okay.

644
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,169
The soles are leather.

645
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,300
They had leather soles.

646
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,039
I've never danced on stage,

647
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,370
but I know leather soles are slippery.

648
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,110
And the stage was acrylic.

649
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,740
So, it'd be obviously slippery.

650
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,109
That was why I asked him.

651
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,380
(Seo Genie, the keen observer)

652
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,620
Okay.

653
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,380
- All right.
- Does it feel good?

654
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,189
- We're going to roll.
- Let's go.

655
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,019
- We'll hold the ending pose.
- We have to shoot this as well.

656
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,930
Please look at the camera three, the one on the far left.

657
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,459
- The one on the far left.
- Yes, the camera three.

658
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,959
For the ending pose, look at the camera three on the left.

659
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,900
- The camera three on the left.
- Yes.

660
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,230
If you're all set, please head to the stage.

661
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,539
Remember this and this.

662
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
(Checking on the staff right up to the end)

663
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,770
Break a leg.

664
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,380
Break a leg.

665
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,410
- Dancers, please head to the stage.
- Okay.

666
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,479
Let's do a team huddle hands. We do this before the stage.

667
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,679
Do you always do this?

668
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,050
- Yes, we always do.
- I see.

669
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,120
- You know what we always do.
- Oh, yes.

670
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,589
Everyone, hands in please.

671
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,690
Okay. We'll do what we always do.

672
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,760
- The one we always used to do?
- Yes, what we used to do.

673
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,289
How do we do it?

674
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,760
All right. What defines us...

675
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,760
- As TVXQ.
- as TVXQ,

676
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,970
- As TVXQ.
- as TVXQ,

677
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,729
and what makes me U-Know Yunho of TVXQ?

678
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,640
- Let's show it on the stage.
- Yes.

679
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,740
On the count of three, let's cheer, "U-Know Yunho, You got this!"

680
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,740
and put our hands in the air.

681
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,539
One, two, there. U-Know Yunho!

682
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,110
- You got this!
- You got this!

683
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,579
(Fired up.)

684
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,450
(Team Yunho is all set to go!)

685
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,419
- You should do that too.
- Do what?

686
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,620
What defines us as Grumpy Secretaries?

687
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:27,160
What defines us...

688
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,390
What defines us... What makes me Kim Kwang Kyu?

689
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,100
"What defines us as TVXQ?"

690
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,099
- That line sticks with me the most.
- Is it the best moment of the day?

691
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,369
Yes. "What defines us as TVXQ?"

692
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,700
"What makes me U-Know Yunho?"

693
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,370
When I heard him say that,

694
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,180
I thought the line was genuinely brilliant.

695
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:49,150
I found it amusing. I wouldn't mimic a thing like that.

696
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,049
But the line was so funny.

697
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,920
That was why I asked Kwang Kyu to imitate it.

698
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,419
- You should do that too.
- Do what?

699
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,720
What defines us as Grumpy Secretaries?

700
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,150
What defines us...

701
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,020
What defines us... What makes me Kim Kwang Kyu?

702
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,760
(After firing up, My Star headed to the stage.)

703
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,160
(Cheering)

704
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,330
(The audience was filled with red light sticks.)

705
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,770
All right.

706
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,299
(Being in wonder)

707
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,440
Where can we see him? Do we see him from here?

708
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,510
There are monitors.

709
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,680
(The monitors are backstage.)

710
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,820
(Recording the monitor while he's on the stage.)

711
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,289
(My Star interacting with fans before the performance)

712
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,420
U-Know Yunho!

713
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,920
A senior manager is here today for me.

714
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,029
- Go, Grumpy Secretary!
- A senior manager is here.

715
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,800
A special lead manager is also here.

716
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,430
A special lead manager is also here.

717
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,370
I have my special managers here with me today.

718
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,670
So, I hope for your extra support.

719
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,639
(Touching)

720
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,139
As he's so seasoned, he has such a relaxed confidence.

721
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,409
When I performed, I sang my song and then took off.

722
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,849
Since this is a stage we're making together,

723
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,949
let's make it great.

724
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,350
I'm going to enjoy it as well.

725
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,049
We're going to roll.

726
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,490
- We're ready.
- Stand by.

727
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,890
(Finally, My Star starts the performance.)

728
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,259
Stand by.

729
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,690
(It's showtime.)

730
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,340
(Passionate)

731
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,950
(Synchronized choreography)

732
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,150
His dancing is totally different from the rehearsal.

733
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,990
(My Star absolutely owns the stage.)

734
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,100
(Seductive and provocative)

735
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,000
(A flawless performance)

736
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,940
(The mic pack suddenly came off during the performance.)

737
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,280
(Something is dangling.)

738
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,620
(My Star keeps performing anyway.)

739
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,460
(Slippery)

740
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,660
(He almost slipped during the dance.)

741
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,729
(Continuing to perform)

742
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,140
(Performing while grabbing the mic pack)

743
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,110
(He ended up stopping the performance.)

744
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,110
(Stop the performance! Stop!)

745
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,380
Okay.

746
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,380
Okay. I'm sorry.

747
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,919
It's okay!

748
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,950
(Unexpected circumstance)

749
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,649
- I'm sorry.
- The mic pack came off.

750
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,860
(Worried)

751
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,120
How did it come off?

752
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,830
Should he do it from the top?

753
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,759
(Eventually walking off the stage)

754
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,259
- Did it come off?
- Yes.

755
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,359
(Eventually walking off the stage)

756
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,670
- I think we need to secure this.
- Okay.

757
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,940
(The audience went silent after the performance stopped.)

758
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,909
- Secure it.
- My gosh. Oh, no.

759
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,970
- We need to secure it.
- I'm working on it.

760
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,909
- It's unbelievable it fell off.
- I know.

761
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,610
How hard were you dancing?

762
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,509
Can I have a lighter?

763
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,520
(Taping it down as a temporary fix)

764
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,279
(The staff is busy working to fix the problem.)

765
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,350
How come? How about this side?

766
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,849
How were your shoes, Yun Ho?

767
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,960
It looked a bit slippery.

768
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,390
Yes, I almost slipped.

769
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,589
Wouldn't it be better if we taped the sole?

770
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,660
Do we have anything?

771
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,600
Do we have any tape we can use?

772
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,129
(Grumpy Secretary is trying a temporary fix with tape.)

773
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,270
Okay. Let's try that.

774
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,970
Is it going to work?

775
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,209
(Seo Genie is actively handling the situation.)

776
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,510
- That's when I nearly fell.
- It's so hard today.

777
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,680
Yun Ho, tape this to your shoe...

778
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
and see how it feels.

779
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:45,219
Try rubbing them against the floor.

780
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,620
(Seo Genie is making the anti-slip himself.)

781
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,589
- Does it feel better?
- Yes, it's much better.

782
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,789
- Is it much better?
- Yes.

783
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,820
(The taping seems to have worked.)

784
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,230
(Since it worked out well, he's taping his other shoe now.)

785
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,960
That's when I nearly fell.

786
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,130
- Can you tape the heels too?
- Those are rubber.

787
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,430
- Let's try it.
- Yes.

788
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,499
(Doing his best)

789
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,310
What touched me the most was this.

790
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,810
- I slipped on stage.
- Yes.

791
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
I slipped.

792
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:15,679
No one noticed it.

793
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,709
But Seo Jin did,

794
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,850
and he immediately suggested putting tape on the shoes.

795
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:21,080
That was very professional.

796
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,420
I could feel that he cared about the artist.

797
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,790
It made me go, "Oh, gosh."

798
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,559
Rather than just being competent at his work,

799
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,260
he struck me as someone...

800
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,590
who cared about the artist.

801
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,929
From then on,

802
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,029
he felt like my manager.

803
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,129
(He's my manager!)

804
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,970
- He earned your trust.
- Yes.

805
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:41,440
- Try rubbing the floor. Better?
- Yes.

806
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,769
(Working hard)

807
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,939
Do you want me to spray some anti-slip spray on it?

808
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,140
Yes. Please spray it one more time.

809
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,780
Let's spray it once more and check it again.

810
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,410
(Kwang Kyu is also working hard.)

811
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,080
- Let's record one more time.
- You should let it dry.

812
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,120
- Please go up immediately.
- Okay.

813
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:05,960
(Team Yunho returns.)

814
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,570
(He's anxious until the end.)

815
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm sorry.

816
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,110
(Nervous)

817
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,879
(I hope he doesn't slip this time.)

818
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,879
Let's get back to shooting.

819
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,909
Okay.

820
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,949
(Let me show them why I'm TVXQ.)

821
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,109
(Let me show them why I'm U-Know.)

822
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,149
Let's go.

823
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,720
(Let me prove!)

824
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,319
(They start performing again.)

825
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,749
- Let's do this!
- Let's go!

826
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,720
(The performance starts again.)

827
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,160
(Will he be able to finish the performance safely this time?)

828
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,300
(Nervous)

829
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,310
(He's off to a good start.)

830
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,580
(He's watching the performance anxiously.)

831
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,810
(Despite the worries, the performance is going smoothly.)

832
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:02,190
(He looks relaxed as if he didn't make any mistake.)

833
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,520
(The mic has been working fine so far.)

834
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:13,760
(The section where he slipped is coming up.)

835
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,669
(This is the part.)

836
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:24,069
(This is the part.)

837
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:27,410
(He got through the problematic section well.)

838
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,550
(He finally smiles a little.)

839
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,180
(The performance is nearing the end.)

840
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,520
(My Star asked the managers for the ending pose.)

841
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,789
(The "hands together" pose or the "birdie" pose)

842
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,060
(Which pose will he choose at the end?)

843
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,340
(What will My Star choose?)

844
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,380
(It's the "hands together" pose.)

845
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,390
- Isn't it a nice pose?
- Yes, it is.

846
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,559
- It's nice.
- Yes.

847
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,620
(Happy)

848
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,389
(The dancers are coming down after the performance.)

849
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,759
- You did a great job.
- Thank you.

850
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,559
- Great job.
- Thank you.

851
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,830
- Thank you.
- Oh, my.

852
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,369
Good job.

853
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,700
- Great job.
- Great job.

854
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,900
It was perfect.

855
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Wasn't it slippery this time?

856
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:31,769
No. This time,

857
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,080
the tape...

858
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,510
was a genius move.

859
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,380
I think it was today's game-changer.

860
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,619
(Proud)

861
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,790
Could you monitor the performance in the waiting room?

862
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,920
Sure.

863
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,290
Is he done using the in-ear monitor?

864
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,190
I think so.

865
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,930
(He organises the in-ear monitor as soon as the shooting ends.)

866
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,230
(The recording is finally over.)

867
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,030
- Yunho.
- Yes.

868
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,270
It's over now.

869
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,209
These days,

870
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,640
there's something to do...

871
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,710
after the performance.

872
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,510
Why are there so many things to do?

873
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,250
Yes. In between...

874
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,209
- From what I know, yesterday...
- I...

875
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,749
I thought you'd leave after the performance.

876
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,049
I released a song after a while.

877
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,749
And there's a culture where we do challenges for each other.

878
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,220
- That's a new culture.
- Right.

879
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,219
Back then, singers just performed,

880
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,860
- and that was it.
- Right.

881
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,130
So you guys...

882
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,559
know exactly what challenge is, right?

883
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,629
Of course, I know.

884
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,400
Is there any challenge you know?

885
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,500
Well...

886
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,569
Cho Hye Lyun's...

887
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,999
"Anacana" challenge...

888
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,970
went viral.

889
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,639
Anacana

890
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,110
- With all the kids and stuff.
- Yes, I know.

891
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,239
It probably got a few million views.

892
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,250
- Wasn't it 20 years ago?
- No.

893
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,850
- It was a few years ago.
- It was a few years ago.

894
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:52,690
Since the Ice Bucket Challenge...

895
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,659
(The last challenge he knows is from 11 years ago.)

896
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,689
- You had to pick the next person.
- Yes.

897
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,160
I've done it in front of my house.

898
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:05,800
(You can tell how old he is from the quality of the video.)

899
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,199
(Grunting)

900
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,240
Gosh, this is...

901
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,969
It won't be easy today.

902
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,010
(I have a bad feeling about it.)

903
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,479
(The "new song challenge," a trend Grumpy Secretary doesn't know)

904
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,779
(It's about recording a short-form video...)

905
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,320
(where you follow the highlight dance of a singer's new release.)

906
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,919
(The singers he'll collaborate with for the challenge)

907
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,860
MEOVV.

908
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,629
- MEOVV.
- Hearts2Hearts.

909
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,799
They also have...

910
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,400
rehearsals and recordings,

911
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,030
so we need to match our schedules.

912
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,299
We have to check when they're available...

913
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,369
and do the challenges together.

914
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,139
Let's go. Where's their waiting room?

915
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,409
(They quickly set off to schedule the challenge.)

916
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,839
- Where are we going?
- What?

917
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,210
Are we visiting Hearts2 first?

918
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,519
(Grumpy Secretary heads to the other singers' waiting room.)

919
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,649
Hello.

920
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,719
(MEOVV, Hearts2Hearts)

921
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,949
(Coincidentally, they're sharing the waiting room.)

922
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,789
- Hello.
- Hello.

923
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,989
Hearts...

924
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,660
- Is Hearts2Hearts here?
- It's here.

925
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,160
MEOVV is here.

926
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,929
Hearts2Hearts.

927
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,130
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, I am.

928
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,129
We came to ask...

929
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,829
- if they can...
- Can they do it now?

930
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,600
Do the challenge now.

931
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,100
Girls, can you come out?

932
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,740
Yes.

933
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,539
- Hello.
- Hello.

934
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,109
- Hello.
- Hello.

935
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,440
Oh, my gosh.

936
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,309
- Hello.
- Hello.

937
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,510
Oh, my gosh.

938
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,449
- They're babies.
- Hello.

939
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,720
Hi.

940
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,519
(Smiling like an uncle)

941
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,989
- Hello.
- We're...

942
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,420
U-Know's managers.

943
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,560
Today, can you... Hello.

944
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,890
- They keep coming out.
- They keep coming out.

945
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,659
Hello.

946
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,060
Hi.

947
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,470
We...

948
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,729
- They keep coming out.
- They keep coming out.

949
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,970
(They keep coming out.)

950
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,640
(He gets flustered and shows his dimples.)

951
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,409
- Hello, we're Hearts2Hearts.
- Hello, we're Hearts2Hearts.

952
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,040
(Hearts2Hearts)

953
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,250
Hello, we're Grumpy Secretaries.

954
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,379
(Giggling)

955
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,679
Aren't you supposed to do a challenge with U-Know?

956
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,680
- Yes.
- That's true.

957
00:38:01,681 --> 00:38:03,290
Is everyone doing it? Or just some of you?

958
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,489
- Just some of us.
- JUUN.

959
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,689
- JUUN will do it.
- JUUN.

960
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,860
- Who?
- Who?

961
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,920
(He's not sure who to look at.)

962
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,030
- She's JUUN.
- JUUN?

963
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,829
- Just her?
- Yes.

964
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:13,960
Then...

965
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,359
are you available now?

966
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,499
Anytime.

967
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,599
Shall we go then?

968
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,669
- Today...
- You got this, JUUN.

969
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,470
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

970
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,639
Since we came here,

971
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,770
- shall we talk to MEOVV too?
- Talk to MEOVV as well.

972
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,080
I'm just checking when you're available.

973
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,010
We're planning to do a challenge with Hearts2Hearts first.

974
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,779
How long will it take?

975
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,949
- About 15 minutes.
- Around...

976
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,920
- About 15 minutes? Then...
- Yes.

977
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,379
- How about 12:10pm?
- Okay.

978
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,089
Is that okay? We'll come back then.

979
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,350
Okay. See you later then.

980
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,119
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

981
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,959
(My Star's schedule: Hearts2Hearts at 11:50am, MEOVV at 12:10pm)

982
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,060
Shall we film it here?

983
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,099
- This backdrop is better.
- Yes.

984
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,900
- This is better?
- Nothing is blocking the back.

985
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,800
Here? Okay.

986
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,070
You should play the song for us.

987
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,210
(In charge of music, in charge of shooting)

988
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,309
One, two.

989
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,850
(What challenge are they going to film here today?)

990
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,520
("Stretch," the title song of his full-length album)

991
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,329
(With dynamic angles that fit the choreography, )

992
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,660
(it needs to be filmed in a single take!)

993
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,669
(Grumpy Secretary, are you ready?)

994
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,969
We should discuss...

995
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,270
the camerawork.

996
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,109
Are challenges...

997
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,840
usually 15 seconds long?

998
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,739
- It's around 15 seconds.
- Around 15 seconds.

999
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,609
Yes. Please play the song from this part.

1000
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:36,449
- Let's do a rehearsal.
- Okay.

1001
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,179
- I'll be covering the camera.
- Okay.

1002
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,319
Please play the song.

1003
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,479
(The rehearsal...)

1004
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,119
(begins.)

1005
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,290
Here?

1006
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,520
(The senior and junior will dance together for the first time.)

1007
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,789
You should film both of us.

1008
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,960
Let's go.

1009
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,270
(Why is he raising his hand like that?)

1010
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:04,140
(He surely doesn't know what challenges are.)

1011
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,179
(My Star is focused on his work like a professional.)

1012
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,510
It goes like this.

1013
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,180
(Gosh, my body feels sore.)

1014
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,349
(He's tired even before the shooting begins.)

1015
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,590
- It'll go like this.
- Okay.

1016
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,159
You can't just stay still.

1017
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,060
(You can't just stay still!)

1018
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:23,729
- Right.
- I cover the camera like this.

1019
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,190
- Okay.
- Then I go to the back.

1020
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,329
- Okay.
- Then we look at each other...

1021
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,400
and bow.

1022
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,000
Shoot it from the waist up now.

1023
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,199
I go closer after you bow.

1024
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,839
- Come closer when we bow.
- I go closer when you bow.

1025
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,899
We do something like this.

1026
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,999
Then I suddenly say,

1027
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,109
- "Let's go." - Okay.

1028
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,069
- When you say, "Let's go..." - Then you should move back quickly.

1029
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,340
- I should take a big step back?
- Yes.

1030
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,639
- "Let's go." - Let's go.

1031
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,079
(Lesson 2: Step back all the way when he says, "Let's go.")

1032
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,509
Got it. Let's try.

1033
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,550
You can...

1034
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,650
move like this.

1035
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,249
My knees aren't doing so well.

1036
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,120
(My knees aren't doing so well.)

1037
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,659
Okay.

1038
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,129
I'll do my best.

1039
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,060
- I'll do my best.
- Okay.

1040
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,100
- Got it.
- Let's do it.

1041
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,269
Here we go.

1042
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,970
(They start filming the challenge.)

1043
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,770
(Nervous)

1044
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,309
(Lesson 1: Take a big step forward when they bow.)

1045
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,770
Shoot it from the waist up now.

1046
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,309
(Lesson 2: Step back all the way when he says, "Let's go.")

1047
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,379
Okay. Let's go.

1048
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,610
(Lesson 2: Step back all the way when he says, "Let's go.")

1049
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,110
Hold on.

1050
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,119
(Collision)

1051
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,220
Hold on.

1052
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,549
(He acts as if nothing happened.)

1053
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,650
Okay.

1054
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,059
Hold on.

1055
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,820
(Laughing)

1056
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:31,129
(What just happened?)

1057
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,490
Hold on.

1058
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,730
- Wait.
- Hey.

1059
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,829
- No.
- Are you okay?

1060
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,269
Yes. I did my best.

1061
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,140
I know. That was so cool.

1062
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,500
- Let me see.
- See what?

1063
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,170
- There was an accident just now.
- No.

1064
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,639
It wasn't an accident.

1065
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,140
(Checking the dashcam)

1066
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,479
- It wasn't recorded.
- What?

1067
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,650
It wasn't recorded.

1068
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:53,980
It wasn't recorded?

1069
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,319
- I recorded.
- I don't think it was recorded.

1070
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,689
- Did I not press the button?
- No.

1071
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,790
(He didn't press the record button?)

1072
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,620
- I didn't press it?
- No.

1073
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,459
It seems you pressed it after you got surprised.

1074
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,589
I think you didn't record it.

1075
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,100
No. I recorded it.

1076
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,870
(You can clearly see that he didn't press the button.)

1077
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,770
(He pressed it after the accident.)

1078
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,039
- I didn't press it?
- He pressed it after it ended.

1079
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,840
- Now...
- He did it after he got surprised.

1080
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,279
- We should hurry up...
- Let's do it again.

1081
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,410
- and finish off.
- Okay.

1082
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,949
(15 minutes for each team is shorter than expected.)

1083
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,320
Is the camera on?

1084
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,719
- Ready.
- Yes.

1085
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,750
Action.

1086
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,690
(Will he record it properly this time?)

1087
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,560
(Extremely focused)

1088
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,700
Okay. Let's go.

1089
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,470
(It was close.)

1090
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,510
(Try not to laugh challenge)

1091
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:54,740
(He moves the camera aggressively with confidence.)

1092
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:59,780
(It's finally the climax.)

1093
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,550
(Pressing)

1094
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,360
(He scanned his fingerprint at the end.)

1095
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,389
- I mean...
- It was too shaky, wasn't it?

1096
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,489
He was like this.

1097
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:14,129
(It was almost like a roller coaster.)

1098
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,459
When he bumped into the wall,

1099
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,929
he shook the camera too much.

1100
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,470
- I should've done it properly.
- Well...

1101
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,239
- It's...
- Do you shoot it horizontally too?

1102
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,539
It's...

1103
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,770
- Oh, I need to shoot it vertically.
- Vertically.

1104
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,739
(Oh, I need to shoot it vertically?)

1105
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,909
I need to shoot it vertically.

1106
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,080
(Vertical)

1107
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,409
(He followed his instinct and shot it horizontally, )

1108
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:31,880
(which was a big trend back in 2004.)

1109
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,380
(Your fingerprint has been registered.)

1110
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,720
I need to shoot it vertically.

1111
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,249
So Yunho didn't ask you to record it like this?

1112
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,289
I need to shoot it vertically.

1113
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,759
- You should film it vertically.
- Vertically.

1114
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,089
Shoot it vertically.

1115
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,860
After taking a step back,

1116
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,500
go this way...

1117
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,930
and this way.

1118
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,899
Then go back to the center...

1119
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,099
and get closer like this.

1120
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,399
Got it.

1121
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,940
As I said before,

1122
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,679
Seo Jin has been wanting to take control of the direction.

1123
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,709
If that's what he wants,

1124
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:02,680
he should just sell his house and shoot a movie.

1125
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,410
- "Just sell his house?" - Yes.

1126
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,319
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1127
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,349
- Yes.
- Yes.

1128
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,749
- Roll the camera.
- Ready.

1129
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,820
(The camera is ready.)

1130
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,990
Okay. Let's go.

1131
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,290
(He stepped back successfully.)

1132
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:20,460
(He's handling the camera much better than before.)

1133
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,830
(Pressing his lips together in concentration)

1134
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,699
(Passion...)

1135
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,270
(in full force)

1136
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,379
(After many trials, he managed to film it all the way through.)

1137
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,540
Take a look.

1138
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,409
Do you think it's natural?

1139
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:40,680
(Was it recorded properly?)

1140
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,090
Okay. Let's go.

1141
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,460
(Yunho is out of frame.)

1142
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,660
(JUUN is out of frame.)

1143
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,739
Okay. You...

1144
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,539
recorded it in a very interesting way.

1145
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,940
(You recorded it in a very interesting way.)

1146
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,980
- I can't put it into words.
- You can't.

1147
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:14,050
Where do I start?

1148
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,189
There are...

1149
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,889
There are some basics.

1150
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:19,149
He doesn't know, and there's nothing I can do about it.

1151
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,690
So I didn't say anything.

1152
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,489
Yunho was out of frame.

1153
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:24,490
She was also out of frame. You can't do that.

1154
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,429
You got too close.

1155
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,429
That's why they weren't in the shot. Instead of doing that,

1156
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,629
move gently like this when you film a two-shot.

1157
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:32,329
- These days...
- Don't do this.

1158
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,869
These days, people like it when it's real.

1159
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:35,640
It's okay to be out of frame.

1160
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,070
Half of his body was cropped out.

1161
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,209
- It was only for a moment.
- Darn it.

1162
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,439
- You can't let that happen.
- Fine.

1163
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,509
Fine. Okay.

1164
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:42,510
- Do you know what I mean?
- Fine.

1165
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:43,879
- Okay.
- Practice.

1166
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,809
So I shouldn't go any farther from here.

1167
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,280
- You should check the angle.
- Okay.

1168
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,289
Move the camera like this.

1169
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,349
Don't crop their bodies out of the shot.

1170
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,290
Keep this angle while you move.

1171
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,959
(A deep sigh)

1172
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,559
I want to see my mom.

1173
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,590
(I want to see my mom.)

1174
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,230
(Laughing)

1175
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:02,659
Let's film it one last time.

1176
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,269
- One last time. It's not bad.
- Okay.

1177
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,970
- We don't have time now.
- It's not bad.

1178
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,039
Hello, we're MEOVV.

1179
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,970
(It's currently 12:08pm, 2 minutes before meeting MEOVV)

1180
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,540
(1m away from the filming spot for the challenge)

1181
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,809
- We got this! Focus!
- We got this!

1182
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,950
We got this!

1183
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,749
No. Focus.

1184
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,850
Focus.

1185
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,220
Roll the camera.

1186
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,649
Focus.

1187
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,050
- Roll the camera.
- Ready.

1188
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,160
Okay. Let's go.

1189
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,300
Good. This is nice.

1190
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,100
You're doing great.

1191
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,710
(He's already satisfied.)

1192
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,910
(Looking intently)

1193
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,080
It was perfect.

1194
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,390
(It's "read his palm" challenge again.)

1195
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,890
Okay.

1196
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,220
- It's okay.
- Wasn't it good?

1197
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:02,320
- You've improved.
- It was good.

1198
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,889
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1199
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,329
- Great job.
- Good job.

1200
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,499
Thank you.

1201
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,529
- You worked hard. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1202
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,729
(Sneaking)

1203
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,830
Next.

1204
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,800
Just a second.

1205
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,469
- Hi.
- Hello.

1206
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,799
(Taking a selfie)

1207
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,869
Thank you.

1208
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,040
Thank you.

1209
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,140
Okay. Next.

1210
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,979
We don't have time.

1211
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,350
- We don't have time. Next team.
- Okay.

1212
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,809
- Two, three. Hello.
- Hello.

1213
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:27,219
- We're MEOVV.
- We're MEOVV.

1214
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,379
Hi.

1215
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,989
- Hello.
- Hello.

1216
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,949
It's MEOVV's turn now.

1217
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,490
I'll memorize the moves in five minutes.

1218
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,819
- The easier version.
- It's super easy.

1219
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,290
- We don't have to film it, right?
- No.

1220
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:39,289
When someone else is filming,

1221
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,399
can you please watch it...

1222
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,370
- and study it?
- Sure.

1223
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,900
- Let's do it.
- Let's start.

1224
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,269
Nice.

1225
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,439
(MEOVV's dance instructor, great at shooting challenges)

1226
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,540
Let's do it.

1227
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,440
(Dramatically moving the camera back and forth)

1228
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,480
(The experienced one is different.)

1229
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,620
(Sitting technique)

1230
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,060
(A low angle)

1231
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,269
It's going to be interesting.

1232
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,399
(Determined eyes)

1233
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,630
Thank you.

1234
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,040
(Thinking)

1235
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,669
When they do this move at the end,

1236
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,370
you join them and do this together.

1237
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,709
- Can you join us?
- What?

1238
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,239
- Not me.
- You join them too.

1239
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,750
- You join them too.
- Please do this move.

1240
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,879
- Yes. Let's join them together.
- At the end.

1241
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,449
Yes. You're Grumpy Secretary too.

1242
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,580
It's at the end.

1243
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,289
Okay.

1244
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,160
(He's doing his first challenge for My Star.)

1245
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,860
(MEOVV challenge featuring Grumpy Secretary)

1246
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,870
(Fuelling his passion)

1247
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:53,939
(Why are you guys there?)

1248
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,469
(Uncle Kwang Kyu is moving his hands so awkwardly.)

1249
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,110
(Young master's surprising double life)

1250
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,640
- Nice.
- It was good.

1251
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,339
It was nice.

1252
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,209
- At 1st...
- At 1st...

1253
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,309
(My Star's new song challenge)

1254
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,650
When the music plays at first,

1255
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,749
I'm going to punch like this.

1256
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:09,790
Please move the camera accordingly.

1257
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,519
- Do this.
- Yes.

1258
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,749
- Pow.
- Shake the camera.

1259
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,059
Like this. That's the part.

1260
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,589
This is not easy to do.

1261
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,429
- It's a different song this time?
- It's a different song.

1262
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,659
- It's "Body Language" this time.
- Okay.

1263
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,929
I'll cover the camera.

1264
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:22,260
I like the way we do

1265
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,229
(Lesson 1: Shake the camera in sync with the boxing dance)

1266
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,469
- Kwang Kyu.
- Okay.

1267
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,800
You should shake it twice at first.

1268
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:30,539
- Pow.
- He punches twice.

1269
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:31,909
So shake the camera...

1270
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,179
twice like this.

1271
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,109
- Pow.
- Pow. Yes.

1272
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,880
- Then you step back.
- Okay.

1273
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,250
The difficulty has increased from level 1 to level 4.

1274
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,850
- He's super focused.
- This is nice.

1275
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,690
- Let's do it.
- Roll the camera.

1276
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,150
Action.

1277
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,100
(Lesson 1: Shake the camera in sync with the boxing dance)

1278
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,830
(Half a beat late)

1279
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,440
(Copying her technique)

1280
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,639
Oh, my.

1281
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,880
(Impressed)

1282
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,739
Let's go.

1283
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,010
(Doing it one more time)

1284
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:13,880
- Up.
- Up.

1285
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,390
(Jumping)

1286
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,620
(She's never seen this kind of movement.)

1287
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,820
What was that?

1288
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,060
It was a performance.

1289
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,670
Oh, my. I'm out of frame.

1290
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,099
Look. Half of her face was cropped out.

1291
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,040
What if it's cropped out?

1292
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:38,809
Her face was cropped out.

1293
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,079
It's fine.

1294
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,979
I saw it earlier. Even the professional did the same thing.

1295
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,249
But it was cropped out too much.

1296
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,810
She's completely out of frame.

1297
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:46,549
You moved in a hurry,

1298
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:47,919
and people kept being cropped out.

1299
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,079
You try it then.

1300
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,389
You can move it slowly.

1301
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:51,620
Why are you in a rush?

1302
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:53,189
When he says, "Let's go,"

1303
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,589
get closer to them.

1304
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,630
When I get closer, they're out of frame.

1305
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,129
So shoot a single shot of Yunho.

1306
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,629
I asked about it earlier.

1307
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:01,729
You told me not to do it.

1308
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:03,499
If you're going to do it, you should step back further.

1309
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,399
- The neck was cropped out.
- Why don't you switch roles?

1310
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,200
The neck was cropped out. Play it again.

1311
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,469
- Can't they just swap the roles?
- Take a look.

1312
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:10,740
Check the video before shooting again.

1313
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,409
You should step back again like this.

1314
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,509
- Okay.
- Step back again.

1315
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,780
- Got it.
- Okay?

1316
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,749
Seo Jin kept nagging.

1317
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,980
I had my own vision.

1318
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,979
People being cropped out isn't a problem.

1319
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,620
It's the vibe that matters.

1320
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,049
(Laughing)

1321
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,120
The camerawork...

1322
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,290
- was very...
- Okay.

1323
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,220
- unique.
- I can get a single shot.

1324
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,230
Amazing. You're so cool.

1325
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,660
Single.

1326
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,029
Did you get your lip pierced?

1327
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,059
No. It's just...

1328
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:36,730
- I'm just wearing a lip ring.
- It's just a lip ring?

1329
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,930
Yes. Don't get it pierced.

1330
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,970
- Yes.
- You'll be in trouble.

1331
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:44,740
If...

1332
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,139
the feet reach the bottom of the screen...

1333
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,810
- like this, the legs look longer.
- Like this?

1334
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,510
- Like this.
- Make us look taller.

1335
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:52,649
- Make us look pretty.
- Like this?

1336
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:54,280
Yes. This is perfect.

1337
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,950
We'll look taller this way.

1338
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,820
For full-body shots, shoot from a low angle.

1339
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,519
(He's learned the technique.)

1340
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,620
Okay.

1341
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,460
- You can do it!
- I think he'll do a good job.

1342
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,789
- Sir, you can do it.
- You got this!

1343
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,959
- You got this!
- You got this!

1344
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,029
You can do it.

1345
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,160
- You got this.
- Vertically.

1346
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:09,929
Shoot from a low angle so that we look taller.

1347
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,030
All right.

1348
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,530
Ready. Action.

1349
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,639
(Shaking)

1350
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,480
(Shaking?)

1351
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,210
Let's do it again. Hold on. I'm sorry.

1352
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,449
- It was good.
- Yes. It was good.

1353
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,379
- You didn't shake it once, right?
- He didn't.

1354
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,549
- It was good, though.
- Pow.

1355
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,090
- Twice.
- Pow.

1356
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,449
I should shake the camera, then shake it again right away.

1357
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,259
- Yes.
- Shake it once, then right away...

1358
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,089
Can you tell me...

1359
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,259
just a bit sooner?

1360
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,559
Okay. Let's do it.

1361
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,589
All right. Let's go.

1362
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,000
- Roll the camera.
- Action.

1363
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,300
(Where is GAWON?)

1364
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,839
Cut. She was out of frame.

1365
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,999
She was completely out of frame.

1366
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,409
You should get closer to him.

1367
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,840
- She was completely out of frame.
- Yes.

1368
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,309
I was so frustrated.

1369
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,480
(I was so frustrated.)

1370
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,149
I miss my manager.

1371
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:59,380
Yes. Let's start from here.

1372
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,580
Let's do it again.

1373
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,620
I'll do my best.

1374
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,950
All right.

1375
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,289
Roll the camera. The camera is rolling.

1376
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,460
(But it was just the beginning.)

1377
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,760
(Squatting awkwardly)

1378
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,859
Let's do it again.

1379
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,459
Let's do it over. I'm sorry.

1380
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,330
- One last time.
- Okay.

1381
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,200
It'll be okay if you focus just a bit more.

1382
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:20,970
Yes. You're almost there.

1383
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,400
You're almost there.

1384
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,110
(Sparking passion in him)

1385
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:26,639
What gives me chills...

1386
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,410
is that he's improving, though very slightly.

1387
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,809
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1388
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,509
- It's already better than earlier.
- It's already better.

1389
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,680
- It's better.
- True.

1390
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,450
(He's blown away by their passion.)

1391
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,620
- You took off your hat.
- It was nice.

1392
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,959
I'm sweating.

1393
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,220
(I'm sweating.)

1394
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:44,790
Well...

1395
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,530
Nothing is easy.

1396
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,230
I think this is about the tenth take.

1397
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,269
Okay. Here we go.

1398
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,099
- Ready. Action.
- Ready.

1399
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,740
(Please let this be the last one!)

1400
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,310
(You should shake the camera soon!)

1401
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,279
(Now!)

1402
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,050
(One more time!)

1403
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,749
(He finally shook the camera successfully.)

1404
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:11,850
Okay. Let's go.

1405
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,830
(Dropping vertically)

1406
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:18,460
Okay. Let's go.

1407
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,600
(Dropping shot)

1408
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,700
Amazing.

1409
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,100
(Bold moves)

1410
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,410
(Passionate knees)

1411
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,210
(Passionate moves)

1412
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,440
(Levitating)

1413
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,210
I haven't felt this fired up in a long time.

1414
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,820
Though I always try to be passionate.

1415
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,180
I think this is the best.

1416
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,490
This is good enough.

1417
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:45,649
The rest will be completed...

1418
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,219
- during the post-production.
- Okay.

1419
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,820
(He finally got an okay sign.)

1420
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,490
I filmed it.

1421
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,159
It'll hit 5 million views at least.

1422
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,100
(He thinks it'll hit 5 million views at least.)

1423
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,369
He worked so hard.

1424
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,370
I hope he isn't disappointed...

1425
00:54:58,371 --> 00:55:00,070
when he sees the result later.

1426
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,609
The fans might be leaving now.

1427
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,209
Please check the time.

1428
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:06,440
- You should go now.
- Yes.

1429
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,679
After today's pre-recording,

1430
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,310
we'll hand out gifts as the fan event.

1431
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:13,049
Please hand out gifts...

1432
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:14,780
to the fans later.

1433
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:15,879
(Handing out hoppang to Cassiopeia)

1434
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,049
One hoppang for each?

1435
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,149
- Maybe not, right?
- What?

1436
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:19,789
- Cassiopeia, this way.
- Cassiopeia.

1437
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:21,020
- Please come here.
- Cassiopeia.

1438
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,129
(Cassiopeias are swarming out after the shoot.)

1439
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

1440
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,860
(Waving at the fans)

1441
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,899
- You're handsome.
- You're handsome.

1442
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,300
(His dimples react quickly.)

1443
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
You're handsome.

1444
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,870
Young Master.

1445
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:39,509
"Young Master?"

1446
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:40,579
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

1447
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,109
Young Master.

1448
00:55:42,110 --> 00:55:44,110
(Young Master responds with a gentle smile.)

1449
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:45,579
(He opens the steamer.)

1450
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,650
Oh, it's hot.

1451
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,649
(They start packing the hoppang.)

1452
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,820
It's hot.

1453
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:54,360
Kwang Kyu, let's put these on the table.

1454
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,290
- Look at this.
- I'll stack them like a burger.

1455
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,360
The more I do this, the faster I get.

1456
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,400
I got the hang of it.

1457
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:05,000
Don't you think this might not be enough?

1458
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,199
It's not enough.

1459
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,240
Should I put this in?

1460
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,770
(Meanwhile, the fans of other singers are waiting to enter.)

1461
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,380
We should get ready to enter.

1462
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,979
- You can come in now.
- They're going to let them in.

1463
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,149
You hand them out.

1464
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,279
- I'll pack them.
- Do you want to do this?

1465
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,479
You hand them out.

1466
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,749
- You should take it out.
- Yes.

1467
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,819
(The fans are entering.)

1468
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,949
Hello.

1469
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,420
Take one each.

1470
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,790
Thank you.

1471
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,420
Enjoy.

1472
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:31,489
Thank you. I'd like the pizza-flavoured one.

1473
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:32,790
- Which one?
- The pizza-flavoured one.

1474
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,929
- Which one is it?
- The orange one.

1475
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,800
- The orange one?
- I'll take it myself. Thank you.

1476
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,199
Take what you want.

1477
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,369
- Just anything?
- Yes.

1478
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:41,740
Please take what you want.

1479
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:42,899
Thank you.

1480
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,639
- Thank you.
- Thank you for supporting U-Know.

1481
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,610
(Thank you for supporting My Star!)

1482
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,779
- Enjoy.
- Thank you for supporting U-Know.

1483
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,850
Of course.

1484
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,109
(He naturally communicates with the fans of My Star.)

1485
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:54,050
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1486
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,919
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1487
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,649
My mom is a fan.

1488
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,920
Her mom is a fan.

1489
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1490
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,389
- You can choose what you want.
- Thank you.

1491
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,760
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1492
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,330
Enjoy. It's fine.

1493
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,829
Did the fans like it?

1494
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,069
Of course, they did.

1495
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:12,630
(Grumpy Secretaries handed out the hoppang. I enjoyed it!)

1496
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:14,999
Hoppang is the best when it's cold.

1497
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,700
(My Star and Grumpy Secretaries are enjoying hoppang as well.)

1498
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:18,739
- Try it.
- Thank you.

1499
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,740
Try this.

1500
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,679
There are four kinds of flavours.

1501
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,680
So you won't get tired of it.

1502
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,980
It's good.

1503
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,380
Why? Is it good?

1504
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,880
It's good.

1505
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,819
We're exactly...

1506
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,959
at the midpoint of today's schedule.

1507
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:35,119
We're only at the midpoint?

1508
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,259
Yes.

1509
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,430
I'll be practising at the office.

1510
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,099
I always sit in the passenger seat.

1511
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,599
- You do?
- Yes. I always do that.

1512
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,800
- You can go ahead then.
- Yes.

1513
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:47,200
(Exhausted)

1514
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,240
I saw the other singers today.

1515
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,110
And they reminded me of the old days.

1516
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,509
They were performing as a team,

1517
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,680
and they...

1518
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,950
look younger than me.

1519
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:00,820
I was like, "I think I used to be like them too."

1520
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,919
- You must've been like them.
- Right.

1521
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,249
How old were you when you debuted?

1522
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:06,149
It was when I was a senior in high school.

1523
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,660
- You were 18 or 19.
- Yes.

1524
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,760
I have a mindset...

1525
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,699
of not getting too used to things.

1526
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,830
(My Star says, "Don't get too used to it.")

1527
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:19,730
It means...

1528
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:23,610
Many people support me because of the nature of my job.

1529
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,710
So there aren't many things I can do by myself.

1530
00:58:26,910 --> 00:58:28,680
If I get too used to it,

1531
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,610
there's nothing I can do.

1532
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,310
That's what I think.

1533
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:37,350
Some of our fans...

1534
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:38,919
are now married...

1535
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
with children.

1536
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:41,260
And the 2nd and 3rd generations...

1537
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,289
come together to support us.

1538
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:45,460
(Listening to his serious talk)

1539
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:46,959
Body language.

1540
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,229
(Blinking)

1541
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:49,359
It goes...

1542
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,029
beyond language.

1543
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:54,900
I think you can tell what someone is thinking just from their eyes.

1544
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,710
Starting with what I want to convey...

1545
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,810
to the audience,

1546
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,280
the song delivers a message...

1547
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,379
that I want to keep in mind.

1548
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,380
(Uncomfortable gaze)

1549
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,049
Do you drink? Do you like drinking?

1550
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,250
I...

1551
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,260
don't mind drinking,

1552
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:20,190
but drinking with the right people is what really matters to me.

1553
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:21,660
I like drinking slowly while chatting.

1554
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,729
Actually, even though we have a lot of time,

1555
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,440
we're all busy.

1556
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,339
This is what I think.

1557
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,640
If you want to see someone, you have to go.

1558
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,040
That's how relationships work.

1559
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:36,910
In the end,

1560
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:40,109
it was all about enjoying a fun song in a fun way...

1561
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,280
in a way.

1562
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:44,749
But behind that,

1563
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,049
there was a lot of anguish...

1564
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:48,020
and thought put into creating the song.

1565
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,790
Once the performance ends, it feels empty.

1566
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,030
You're very serious.

1567
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:58,370
Once I start, I give it my all.

1568
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,930
I commit until the end.

1569
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:02,600
People think...

1570
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,670
I'm passionate, healthy,

1571
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:05,870
and full of energy.

1572
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,540
I thought of life as a singer...

1573
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,209
as a kind of show,

1574
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,150
which made me come up with the themes of "fake" and "documentary."

1575
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,679
Think of it like an indie film.

1576
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,120
It has storytelling.

1577
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,019
That's how I decided on the concept for the full-length album.

1578
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,219
(Clenching his teeth)

1579
01:00:21,220 --> 01:00:24,130
Do you remember any of his questions in the car?

1580
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,729
I don't remember anything.

1581
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:26,960
(I don't remember anything.)

1582
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:29,160
I was having a hard time.

1583
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,770
Why?

1584
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:32,099
I was...

1585
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,369
(You can tell he's exhausted by his face.)

1586
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:35,000
He's too serious.

1587
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,799
He said something very serious.

1588
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,309
And one of us...

1589
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,580
had to react or answer.

1590
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,310
But Seo Jin didn't say anything.

1591
01:00:42,410 --> 01:00:43,910
This is the only thing I remember.

1592
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:46,180
I was focused on the navigator.

1593
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,380
And he said, "Don't you think so?"

1594
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,420
He asked the question.

1595
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,119
I was like, "What should I say?"

1596
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,560
"How should I answer the question?"

1597
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,960
Meanwhile, I had to figure out the route.

1598
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,460
(My Star likes having a serious talk with them.)

1599
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:02,959
I should turn left, right?

1600
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,529
This one says left turn, and this one says U-turn.

1601
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:06,069
You can take a U-turn.

1602
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:07,199
- A U-turn?
- Yes.

1603
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,339
- The SM building is on the left.
- We...

1604
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,869
- Is this the SM building?
- On the left.

1605
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:12,210
We go to the underground parking lot.

1606
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,240
From now on, I'm going to focus on my main job.

1607
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,480
(In a daze)

1608
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,850
(He suddenly feels tired.)

1609
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:26,889
I think my energy has been drained.

1610
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:28,159
When I arrived at the SM building,

1611
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,659
I suddenly felt extremely tired.

1612
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,090
(I suddenly felt extremely tired.)

1613
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,429
I think Yunho...

1614
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,960
mentally drained me.

1615
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,760
He's too serious.

1616
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:40,129
It exhausts me.

1617
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:41,739
(It's currently 3pm, and U-Know's passion already drained him.)

1618
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:44,039
(It's currently 3pm, and U-Know's passion already drained him.)

1619
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,209
Oh, my.

1620
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,539
It seems you guys are falling asleep already.

1621
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,540
- No.
- Are you okay?

1622
01:01:47,541 --> 01:01:48,579
- No.
- Aren't you?

1623
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,709
The building is really nice.

1624
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,249
Is that so? What do you think?

1625
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:53,819
I want to work here as a K-pop singer too.

1626
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,349
(I want to work here as a K-pop singer too.)

1627
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:56,879
- Do you like it?
- The building is huge.

1628
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,119
I saw many dance studios.

1629
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,289
I saw other people practising.

1630
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,619
- Yes.
- I saw it.

1631
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:02,390
Most of the dancers are in the building.

1632
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,689
Whenever I'm in the studio,

1633
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,159
I feel alive again.

1634
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,359
(I feel alive again when I'm here.)

1635
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,500
- You do?
- Yes. Don't you...

1636
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:10,929
feel the energy?

1637
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,470
With the lights and everything.

1638
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:16,339
Most of SM's performance videos...

1639
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,510
are filmed here.

1640
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,379
You can see the night view from the back sometimes.

1641
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,310
(This is where My Star exudes his passion.)

1642
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:26,250
But the dancers are all here,

1643
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,490
so we have to get them coffee.

1644
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,889
Don't you mean the dancers from earlier?

1645
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,760
- Yes.
- They're having more coffee?

1646
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:40,390
But... It's because...

1647
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,829
(My Star habitually buys coffee for others.)

1648
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:44,330
It's because when you see them do the choreography,

1649
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,799
they're sweating nonstop.

1650
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,769
- They must be in the next room.
- In the next room?

1651
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:49,399
Yes, they've been practising.

1652
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,969
- I'll go, then.
- Okay.

1653
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,710
- You need to get their orders.
- Yes.

1654
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,180
Too much coffee is bad for you, though.

1655
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,249
(Getting something)

1656
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,050
This is my idea notebook.

1657
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,990
I didn't write that much, though.

1658
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,460
I write them down.

1659
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,489
"Photo booth, sticker photos, cutouts, and listening parties."

1660
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,329
I thought it might be nice to hold these events,

1661
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:15,559
so I brainstormed.

1662
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:16,600
(Impressed)

1663
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,530
These are all my ideas.

1664
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,370
I can't remember the last time I picked up a pen.

1665
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,810
I write them down whenever I think of them.

1666
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,609
- That's a good habit.
- Yes.

1667
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:27,979
I've even thought of...

1668
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,979
some scenes to use in the music video.

1669
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,509
When you look at my recent music video,

1670
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,420
everyone follows me as if I'm the Pied Piper.

1671
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,319
I watch a movie and write, "The Pied Piper."

1672
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:41,259
(When are you coming, Kwang Kyu?)

1673
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,260
Something like that.

1674
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:43,290
- Did you get their orders?
- You're back.

1675
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,890
They all...

1676
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:48,429
Can you read that?

1677
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:49,430
(Seo Jin orders them on the delivery app.)

1678
01:03:49,431 --> 01:03:50,630
Can we pay when the delivery guy gets here?

1679
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,800
I can use my card.

1680
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,810
You're paying with your card?

1681
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,169
It's not even that much.

1682
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,239
(Coffee's on Senior Manager Seo Jin today.)

1683
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,280
Senior Manager.

1684
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:03,810
(Touched)

1685
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:05,349
He knows how to take responsibility.

1686
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:08,049
(Lee Seo Jin, a man who knows how to take responsibility)

1687
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,579
- Done.
- All right.

1688
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,589
(The coffee has been ordered.)

1689
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:13,589
NCT is waiting for the challenge, so...

1690
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,160
- Yes.
- There's more?

1691
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,630
- But they only need Yun Ho.
- Right.

1692
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:21,159
I'll be right back.

1693
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,060
- No, take all the time you need.
- Okay.

1694
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:27,670
All he does is film challenges.

1695
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:30,170
Challenges get a good number of views.

1696
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,270
(Yawning)

1697
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,609
(He feels fatigued as soon as My Star leaves.)

1698
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,810
Today, it was...

1699
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,180
endless challenges,

1700
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,850
endless cups of coffee,

1701
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:44,850
endless passion,

1702
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:49,060
and endless serious talks. It was rough.

1703
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:52,560
- I even had difficulty breathing.
- You did?

1704
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:53,929
It was...

1705
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:56,559
(Coffee for tired Caretaker Fairy is here.)

1706
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,570
Is it here?

1707
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,700
(I need caffeine.)

1708
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:02,440
(His hands tremble.)

1709
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:07,170
They didn't give us enough straws.

1710
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:12,610
(Putting the lid on as he's in a rush)

1711
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,450
Why won't it work?

1712
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:20,760
What are you doing now?

1713
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:28,100
(Caffeine withdrawal symptoms)

1714
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,100
What are you doing?

1715
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:35,469
(His genuinely concerned about his older bestie.)

1716
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,200
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1717
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:39,539
We don't have enough straws, so I'm drinking without it.

1718
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,910
- We don't have enough straws?
- No.

1719
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,340
There's a lot over there.

1720
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,080
- What?
- There's a bunch on the side.

1721
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:47,209
Oh, they stuck them on the side.

1722
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,480
Are you serious?

1723
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,619
I thought these were all of them.

1724
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,190
(Here they are.)

1725
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,620
I can use one, then.

1726
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:57,329
Thanks for the coffee.

1727
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,860
(Thanks for the coffee, brother.)

1728
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:04,700
(He finally got his caffeine.)

1729
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:07,369
(Studying the lyrics to the new song while waiting for My Star)

1730
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:09,500
I'm reading the lyrics, yet I still don't get them.

1731
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,169
There are English words everywhere.

1732
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:14,240
It's impossible to understand this type of English.

1733
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,939
And why is the font so small?

1734
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:18,350
(I like English.)

1735
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,219
"I jut want to feel it."

1736
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,350
"I just."

1737
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,320
- What did I say?
- "Jut."

1738
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:31,489
This is how everyone pronounces it!

1739
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:35,400
I went to the UK, and they don't pronounce every letter.

1740
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:39,500
"Oh, what are you waiting?"

1741
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,800
- "Waiting!" - "Waiting?"

1742
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,539
What's "waiting?"

1743
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,740
To wait for something.

1744
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:46,309
Oh, "waiting!"

1745
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,980
(Realising)

1746
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,580
"Waiting for."

1747
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,550
- "Brassiere..." - "Brassiere?"

1748
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:56,550
It's "blaze." "Brassiere?"

1749
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,119
What do you have in your head?

1750
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,559
(He's only reading the lyrics.)

1751
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,590
- Gosh.
- Hey.

1752
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:04,160
You're good at English.

1753
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,430
"Dance over the hill."

1754
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:11,370
"Stretch."

1755
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:12,870
Did you have fun?

1756
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,599
It was fun. They're serious about it.

1757
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,600
They are?

1758
01:07:16,601 --> 01:07:18,239
I bet they're exhausted.

1759
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,509
- I bet.
- They're very tired.

1760
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,980
It's exhausting when you go to music shows.

1761
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:22,580
- Have you been practising?
- Yes.

1762
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,579
- I've been here.
- After practice...

1763
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,210
- When it ends...
- Are you practising?

1764
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,979
I'm back with a special guest.

1765
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:30,520
- We met in the practice room.
- Hello.

1766
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:32,649
(Who's here?)

1767
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:33,919
Who's that?

1768
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,959
- It's Hyoyeon.
- Isn't that Hyoyeon?

1769
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,259
I'm Hyoyeon from Girls' Generation.

1770
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,590
(Girls' Generation, Hyoyeon)

1771
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:39,730
Isn't that Hyoyeon?

1772
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,029
(Jumping up)

1773
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,099
- That's my neighbour.
- Yes.

1774
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,629
- Neighbour!
- Neighbour!

1775
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:46,830
Hi, Kwang Kyu.

1776
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:51,469
She looked like the saviour.

1777
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,970
I was so glad to see her.

1778
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,740
You seemed very excited.

1779
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:57,850
I've always been a fan of Girls' Generation's.

1780
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,109
Neighbour!

1781
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,680
(Smiling brightly)

1782
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:04,989
It's been so long.

1783
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:08,020
I was practising, and he was filming a challenge.

1784
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,420
Right.

1785
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:10,859
Come over here.

1786
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,860
I'm a huge fan, Seo Jin.

1787
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:14,129
You don't have to say that.

1788
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,599
(Shy)

1789
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,030
You ignored me as soon as she walked in.

1790
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,100
- It's such a different vibe.
- You're wrong.

1791
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,270
No, it's just...

1792
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,509
that she's a great dancer.

1793
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:25,510
- I am a good dancer.
- Yes.

1794
01:08:25,511 --> 01:08:27,509
- Welcome.
- Let's go.

1795
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,639
I'm glad you're here.

1796
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,649
Have you been following him throughout today's schedule?

1797
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:33,809
Yes, today... What was it called?

1798
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,219
- "Inkigayo." - "Inkigayo."

1799
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,419
But we usually film that starting at 3am.

1800
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,219
- We met at 9am today.
- At 9am.

1801
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:41,720
- That wasn't so bad.
- It wasn't.

1802
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,089
You look like this is your first shoot today.

1803
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:45,189
- Do I?
- Yes.

1804
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:46,960
You must have been tired, though.

1805
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:49,360
No, we have an endless amount of energy.

1806
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:53,030
Who's "we?"

1807
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,369
The three of us.

1808
01:08:54,370 --> 01:08:55,539
(We)

1809
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,400
This is my first time hearing that.

1810
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,469
We're tired, though.

1811
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:00,670
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

1812
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,379
Why don't we have coffee and try the choreography?

1813
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:05,680
(Time to practice the choreography)

1814
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:08,420
(Intrigued)

1815
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:11,850
(She's also fascinated by this situation.)

1816
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:14,660
- Manager, please play the song.
- Okay.

1817
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,020
- Do I play it?
- Yes, please.

1818
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,860
(Feeling awkward)

1819
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:24,500
(The dance practice begins.)

1820
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:27,369
He's so TVXQ when he's doing this.

1821
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:28,600
- I agree.
- Right?

1822
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:36,579
(Like the rise of TVXQ, )

1823
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:41,520
(My Star's passion also burns.)

1824
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,989
(His enthusiasm...)

1825
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:50,819
(goes on for 30 straight minutes.)

1826
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:51,960
Dance break!

1827
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:54,700
It looks so tough.

1828
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,799
It already looks too tough.

1829
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,530
(Why am I tired when I'm just watching?)

1830
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,100
(Fatigued)

1831
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Are you tired?

1832
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,310
(Laughing awkwardly)

1833
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:13,579
(He gave it his all for the choreography.)

1834
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,420
- That was so cool.
- Awesome!

1835
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:18,889
It was perfect.

1836
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:20,619
- No, it wasn't.
- It was perfection.

1837
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:21,620
No.

1838
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:22,620
(Now, let's go to our after-party.)

1839
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,620
It was perfect.

1840
01:10:23,621 --> 01:10:26,129
Watching your performance reminds me...

1841
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,800
of one of the things you said.

1842
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,970
What do you think the most harmful insect is?

1843
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,869
- Mosquitoes.
- Mosquitoes?

1844
01:10:33,870 --> 01:10:36,339
- Yes.
- There's an insect...

1845
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,769
that he says is the most harmful.

1846
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,139
(The insect that My Star thinks is the most harmful?)

1847
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,510
What is it? I don't know.

1848
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,679
Does anything come to mind?

1849
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:44,309
- Going easy on things.
- What?

1850
01:10:44,310 --> 01:10:45,580
(Going easy on things)

1851
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:50,920
(Realising)

1852
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,149
- Going easy on things.
- It's what teachers...

1853
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,320
from back in the day used to say.

1854
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:55,220
They used to say that.

1855
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,360
(Sighing)

1856
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,100
The most harmful emotion for your body is...

1857
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:02,630
passion.

1858
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:07,840
Let's come up with this, at least.

1859
01:11:08,070 --> 01:11:10,039
We're going to pick the ending pose.

1860
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,939
(My Star asked them for an ending pose to "Stretch.")

1861
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,240
What's the original pose?

1862
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,280
- The one you have now.
- I look back...

1863
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,980
and scoff.

1864
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:21,650
I like the way you look from behind.

1865
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:23,450
- Are you being serious?
- Yes.

1866
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,189
- Can you show me?
- You'll stand like this, right?

1867
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,959
- The song ended, right?
- Yes.

1868
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,860
Then, you look back.

1869
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,230
(Seo Genie's ending pose)

1870
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,329
The eyes...

1871
01:11:35,330 --> 01:11:36,900
- That was an intense look.
- Yes.

1872
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,299
What?

1873
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:39,470
From here...

1874
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:42,799
When a man slightly opens his mouth,

1875
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:43,899
he looks more rebellious.

1876
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:44,909
(It's cooler that way.)

1877
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:46,709
You're here when the song ends,

1878
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:47,710
- but after that...
- Is it a side-eye?

1879
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:49,980
Take a deep breath,

1880
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,609
and look.

1881
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:53,079
You need to pace it.

1882
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,210
So, it's two breaths.

1883
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:55,919
- I look first.
- Yes.

1884
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,149
- And he looks back again?
- Then, look back with a breath.

1885
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,350
- That's good.
- Oh, like that?

1886
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:00,919
After the song, I saw earlier...

1887
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,920
Then, it's camera number three.

1888
01:12:01,921 --> 01:12:04,219
Camera number three comes in for a close-up shot.

1889
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:06,989
- That's when you look back.
- One more time.

1890
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,030
I got it.

1891
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,960
- It's very detailed.
- Yes.

1892
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,070
He's been playing lead roles, so...

1893
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,039
(What was on your mind during the ending pose discussion?)

1894
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,270
I was trying to come up with an excuse.

1895
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:20,539
Did you just want to avoid the situation?

1896
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:22,940
What do I even know about dancing?

1897
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:24,849
(After 2 months of being a manager, he gets better at handling crises.)

1898
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,580
Make sure to watch "Inkigayo" when the song first airs.

1899
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:30,719
I'll tell them that this idea is from you.

1900
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,720
(The ending pose that Seo Jin came up with as an excuse)

1901
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,720
I mean it.

1902
01:12:32,721 --> 01:12:35,720
(Did he actually do it on "Inkigayo?")

1903
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,129
(The ending pose produced by Grumpy Secretary)

1904
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:42,030
(Confirmed)

1905
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:44,329
We made a reservation...

1906
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,770
at the gamjatang place that U-Know likes.

1907
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:48,699
I'm hungry too. Can I join you?

1908
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,169
- Of course.
- Sure.

1909
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:51,469
(Of course!)

1910
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,569
- Can I?
- Come with us.

1911
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,209
- Can you drink?
- I can.

1912
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:55,679
- Right?
- That's great.

1913
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:56,880
She's a good drinker.

1914
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,409
- Is she?
- Yes.

1915
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:00,109
- Shall we get going, then?
- Let's head out.

1916
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:01,119
(My Star's Schedule: 5:30pm, after-party)

1917
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,220
Let's go to the after-party.

1918
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:03,750
- Great.
- The after-party...

1919
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,419
Let's go inside.

1920
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,789
This is a well-known restaurant at our agency.

1921
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:08,790
(My Star's true story you can only hear after work)

1922
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:11,590
- He likes gamjatang.
- Yes, I love gamjatang.

1923
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:14,500
- Should we get the big one?
- Mild and savoury gamjatang.

1924
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,199
- Sir?
- Yes.

1925
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,569
We'll get a large mild and savoury gamjatang.

1926
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,570
Thank you.

1927
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,270
I'm sorry, but can you ask us once before ordering?

1928
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:26,240
(Our fault.)

1929
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,239
Can we also order one earthen pot bibimbap?

1930
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,409
Of course.

1931
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:31,610
(They peacefully order more food.)

1932
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:34,880
Here you go.

1933
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:36,920
It's the brightest that Seo Jin has looked today.

1934
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,450
The brightest I've seen today.

1935
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:42,790
It's past 6pm already. I need alcohol now.

1936
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:46,560
- Great work today!
- Good work, My Star.

1937
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,299
You did great today, My Star.

1938
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,060
(They all down it.)

1939
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,399
It tastes good.

1940
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,429
(Tasty)

1941
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,700
Growl.

1942
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:58,110
That's EXO's song. He's TVXQ.

1943
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:00,840
(You're into me)

1944
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,410
- The soup looks milky.
- Yes, it's very thick.

1945
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:08,920
- Eat up, guys.
- Thanks.

1946
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,949
(Putting the meat straight into his mouth)

1947
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,759
(Nom)

1948
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,530
(One more bite)

1949
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,059
(Hyoyeon, who was hungry, also takes a bite.)

1950
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,260
- It's delicious.
- It's so good.

1951
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,699
(Pleased)

1952
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:26,830
It's so tender.

1953
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,869
How was your day?

1954
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:31,909
I'm the first singer you had to look after.

1955
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:35,209
Yes. I didn't know you spent that much time...

1956
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:36,740
filming challenges.

1957
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,179
(There were countless challenges.)

1958
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,209
- The challenges...
- That's the tough part.

1959
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,320
It was tiring just to look at.

1960
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,920
(It was such a long day.)

1961
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,420
I'm so exhausted.

1962
01:14:46,421 --> 01:14:47,590
(It's all thanks to the passionate artist.)

1963
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,260
You're too passionate.

1964
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:52,359
Can you just go easy?

1965
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,729
You're too serious about everything.

1966
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:56,099
You need to loosen up a little.

1967
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,399
In which parts should I loosen up?

1968
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:59,630
- You're almost 40 now.
- Yes.

1969
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:02,540
Have you ever wanted to take a break?

1970
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:06,210
I don't want to set a limit for myself.

1971
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,839
- I don't...
- "I don't have a limit."

1972
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:12,750
I feel that I don't have that much time left.

1973
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,749
Thinking that...

1974
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:18,290
makes me more enthusiastic.

1975
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:21,519
(My Star's passion is rekindled.)

1976
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,759
- I mean it.
- But not all singers are like him.

1977
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,960
But you have the physical strength to back that up.

1978
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:30,800
When you get deeply hurt once,

1979
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,700
you're bound to change.

1980
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:33,930
- Right.
- "Hurt?"

1981
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:35,440
- That's true.
- I have to get hurt?

1982
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:38,770
- Maybe a rental deposit fraud.
- Well, not to that extent.

1983
01:15:39,870 --> 01:15:43,210
If you could fall deeply in love, break up,

1984
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:45,079
and fail to get over her...

1985
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,309
I think he'll get over her, though.

1986
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:47,650
Are you passionate even when you're dating?

1987
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,080
Dating?

1988
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,449
I believe it's the same.

1989
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:52,689
- I think he is passionate.
- Right.

1990
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,319
- I agree.
- When I'm in love...

1991
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,590
He's never had a love scandal like someone here, right?

1992
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,030
"Like someone here?"

1993
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:01,959
I have had scandals before.

1994
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,659
- When?
- Back in the day.

1995
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:06,229
- There were scandals.
- Were there?

1996
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:08,099
With other celebrities.

1997
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:10,300
But all my relationships lasted long.

1998
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:12,840
- When I date...
- It lasts long if you work hard.

1999
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:14,880
Your relationships weren't long.

2000
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,340
- Because I don't work hard.
- Well, why don't you?

2001
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,740
What?

2002
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,610
What is it that you work hard for?

2003
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:23,119
- I'm passionate only at first.
- Only at first?

2004
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,520
That's so disappointing.

2005
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:26,149
- Why?
- Why only at first?

2006
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:27,249
You have to follow through.

2007
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,020
- He's the type that women hate.
- He is.

2008
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,559
- Because I'm too passionate...
- You're too nice at first.

2009
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:33,690
At first.

2010
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:36,559
I return to my old self after three months,

2011
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,970
and they tell me I've changed.

2012
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:39,800
Then, the relationship can't last long.

2013
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,900
I guess he's a hopeless romantic who falls fast.

2014
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:43,700
He's a hopeless romantic.

2015
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,069
He might be.

2016
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,809
(He doesn't exactly deny it.)

2017
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,540
Do your relationships last long?

2018
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,339
Too long.

2019
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,509
- Really?
- Not just in dating.

2020
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:53,779
I just like to be loyal.

2021
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,179
You seem like the loyal type.

2022
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,180
Me?

2023
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:57,949
- I am loyal.
- He is loyal.

2024
01:16:57,950 --> 01:16:59,590
- Totally.
- He's always been loyal.

2025
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:02,660
I think timing beats all of that.

2026
01:17:02,790 --> 01:17:04,090
- Timing.
- Yes.

2027
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:06,660
I actually wanted to get married early.

2028
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:10,329
At the time, I told my teacher and the CEO...

2029
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,130
that I'd get married in my 20s.

2030
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,830
I just threw it out there.

2031
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,600
I wasn't being passionate.

2032
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,969
I didn't want them to be mistaken.

2033
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:20,969
"I'm in love with someone right now,"

2034
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,340
"so I'll get married."

2035
01:17:22,610 --> 01:17:24,650
- In your 20s?
- Yes.

2036
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:27,050
You know what he said?

2037
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:28,849
"That's all good,"

2038
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,919
"but try to have children later."

2039
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,520
That's what he told me.

2040
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:38,229
I didn't know exactly how long our relationship would last,

2041
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:40,329
but I genuinely wanted to protect her...

2042
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,800
because I was truly in love.

2043
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,100
- I was in my 20s, after all.
- Right.

2044
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,330
But it didn't work out.

2045
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:49,370
- It doesn't work out as you want.
- Never.

2046
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,409
- It's just...
- Things change, you know.

2047
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:52,769
You're absolutely right.

2048
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:55,780
And your CEO must have seen it.

2049
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,449
He must have seen how passionate you were about work...

2050
01:17:58,450 --> 01:18:01,380
and thought, "He's never going to get married early."

2051
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:04,080
- Right. I think he did.
- Yes.

2052
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,989
Passionate people find it difficult to let it go.

2053
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:08,520
I have a few of those around me.

2054
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,590
And they're all single.

2055
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,329
Like who?

2056
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,929
The one everyone knows about. Gang Dong Won.

2057
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:17,359
(Dong Won is another famously passionate man.)

2058
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,900
He's an athlete at this point.

2059
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:21,870
I envy his passion, though.

2060
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,539
I only focus on one job,

2061
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:25,839
but he acts too.

2062
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,610
I watched the new movie "Low Life..."

2063
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:31,140
because my friends recommended it.

2064
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:34,820
My friends said, "U-Know Yunho killed it in this movie."

2065
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,980
They said he killed it, so I watched it.

2066
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:44,890
(His realistic acting in "Low Life" was the talk of the town.)

2067
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,159
Soften your eyes.

2068
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:48,859
(He played a villain with an accent, )

2069
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,959
(which is quite different from himself.)

2070
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:53,170
I heard you worked really hard for the role.

2071
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,040
I had to live as that character,

2072
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:59,439
but he and I are not that similar.

2073
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,339
He's a villain,

2074
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,209
and he's been a gangster in Mokpo.

2075
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,479
So, I went to Mokpo the next day.

2076
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,550
- Before shooting the movie?
- Well...

2077
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,349
You must have beaten up some people too.

2078
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:14,149
No, I didn't do that. I shouldn't.

2079
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:17,289
- Did you join a gang?
- No.

2080
01:19:17,290 --> 01:19:19,890
I went to Mokpo and kept taking taxis.

2081
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:24,660
I wanted to quickly understand their accent and culture.

2082
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,469
The character I played was 30 years old in the 1970s,

2083
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:32,609
so I kept taking taxis until I met drivers...

2084
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,179
who were in their 50s and 60s.

2085
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:36,439
He worked really hard.

2086
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,249
I think he's a type who can't sit still.

2087
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:39,709
I'm very curious.

2088
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,749
- I'm incredibly curious.
- Yes, I can tell.

2089
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:43,919
He'll find more things to do if he can't do this.

2090
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,949
(He's the type to learn on the scene.)

2091
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:47,990
I actually used an ad-lib that I had learned.

2092
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,059
- From one of the taxi drivers?
- Yes.

2093
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:51,359
(He put the conversation to use.)

2094
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,490
As soon as I went there...

2095
01:19:52,930 --> 01:19:54,930
Well, I say this as soon as I appear in the movie.

2096
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,560
Hey, outsider.

2097
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:00,129
What are you up to, wagging that fox tail around?

2098
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,430
Something like this.

2099
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:05,839
"Wagging that fox tail around."

2100
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,969
- I had never heard of that.
- I didn't understand one bit.

2101
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,180
- Were you asking their weight?
- No.

2102
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:12,149
(He wouldn't have known if he hadn't heard it.)

2103
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:15,049
- It means you act like a girl.
- Yes, like a girl.

2104
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:17,519
I tried using those words,

2105
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,449
and the director thought it was good.

2106
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:21,589
Hey, outsider.

2107
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:26,189
(He turned into a Mokpo man through passion.)

2108
01:20:26,190 --> 01:20:27,790
It's been ten years since you started acting.

2109
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,759
- Yes.
- People rarely put in...

2110
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:31,770
that much effort after ten years.

2111
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:33,570
Such passion.

2112
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:36,000
- What is passion?
- Fashion.

2113
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:38,170
What did you just say?

2114
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:39,270
Fashion.

2115
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:40,970
It's "passion."

2116
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:42,679
Not "fashion." It's a P.

2117
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,680
(Correcting his pronunciation)

2118
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:45,880
Move on.

2119
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:50,650
Watching these two today,

2120
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:52,949
they had different styles.

2121
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:54,589
- They're very different.
- But...

2122
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:56,519
Seo Jin points one out and tells him,

2123
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,029
and Kwang Kyu understands it instantly and does it.

2124
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:01,429
I realised once again that you need...

2125
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:03,330
both types of people.

2126
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,529
There's that banter because these two are together.

2127
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:09,370
Do you have a friend who exchanges banter with you?

2128
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:10,470
Me?

2129
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,470
A friend whom I banter with...

2130
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:16,010
- Son Ho Jun?
- Yes.

2131
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,480
If I had to pick one, it'd be Ho Jun.

2132
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:21,210
I'm sure Ho Jun was very disappointed in me.

2133
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,319
I've contacted him...

2134
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,919
every single birthday before. Like, "Happy birthday, Ho Jun."

2135
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,760
This year, I forgot to wish him a happy birthday.

2136
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:33,660
On my birthday, he cooked seaweed soup for me.

2137
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:37,630
I guess he was disappointed in me.

2138
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:39,929
(He must be.)

2139
01:21:39,930 --> 01:21:41,370
If I call him now...

2140
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:43,800
- Should I give him a call?
- Sure.

2141
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:46,039
Let's see what he says.

2142
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,109
(Calling Ho Jun right away)

2143
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,210
I hope he's not drinking right now.

2144
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:51,680
Ho Jun also likes Kwang Kyu.

2145
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,609
- Really?
- Hello?

2146
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:54,680
Hey, Ho Jun.

2147
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,820
You called.

2148
01:21:57,050 --> 01:21:59,220
Yes. What are you doing right now?

2149
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,090
I was cooking, so I missed your call.

2150
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:03,319
Really?

2151
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,659
I think you'll be glad to hear his voice.

2152
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,330
He's my daily manager.

2153
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:10,000
I'll put him on.

2154
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:11,800
Where are you cooking?

2155
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,469
(Surprised)

2156
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:15,739
It's Seo Jin!

2157
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,970
Where are you cooking?

2158
01:22:17,670 --> 01:22:18,739
At home.

2159
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:19,970
Do you want to come and eat with us?

2160
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:22,440
I'm eating right now.

2161
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,240
So, you're not coming?

2162
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,849
Well, where are you?

2163
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:27,250
We're in Seongsu-dong.

2164
01:22:28,180 --> 01:22:30,480
Then, I'll finish eating this and be there.

2165
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:33,290
Your way of speaking has changed compared to the past.

2166
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:36,060
You speak in a deeper voice when you talk to Yun Ho.

2167
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:39,330
I'm older than him, after all.

2168
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:42,129
Gosh. You really surprised me.

2169
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,159
I almost didn't recognise you.

2170
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,530
You usually say, "Seo Jin," in a high pitch.

2171
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,430
But when I'm talking to my juniors...

2172
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:52,539
- Please understand.
- Sure.

2173
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:55,010
I envy you. I can't do that, even when I'm talking to Seo Jin.

2174
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:58,139
(Laughing)

2175
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:00,580
Don't eat too much kimchi fried rice.

2176
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:03,649
- Okay. I'll be there soon.
- Good.

2177
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:05,989
Text me, Ho Jun.

2178
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:07,489
Yes, send me the address.

2179
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:08,619
Okay.

2180
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,959
You two don't seem so close.

2181
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,089
- Who?
- The younger one...

2182
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,459
has to be polite, I guess.

2183
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:13,460
- Do you mean me?
- Yes.

2184
01:23:13,461 --> 01:23:15,929
I've never spoken to him in the non-honorifics.

2185
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:17,459
- Seriously?
- Yes.

2186
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,029
Sometimes...

2187
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:20,229
You should learn from him.

2188
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:22,739
- Sometimes, as a joke...
- Learn a thing or two.

2189
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,839
- What's your age gap?
- We're only a year apart.

2190
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,070
- One year?
- One year?

2191
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,139
He's only a year younger, yet he's so polite.

2192
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,939
Is it your way of showing respect?

2193
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,249
(A man gets out of the taxi moments later.)

2194
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,850
I think he's here.

2195
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,319
Hello.

2196
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,620
(Puzzled by the big crowd)

2197
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,449
I think he's here.

2198
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:41,960
Isn't that Ho Jun in a mask?

2199
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:45,790
Wait. This is too burdensome.

2200
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,660
- Are you a celebrity?
- We have a star.

2201
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,300
- Sit in the middle.
- I...

2202
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:54,370
- This is your seat.
- Hello.

2203
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:55,940
- Say hi to Kwang Kyu.
- Yes.

2204
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,669
- Hello.
- Just in case...

2205
01:23:58,670 --> 01:23:59,770
Hello.

2206
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:01,339
(Ho Jun and Hyoyeon have never met before.)

2207
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,409
You two should say hi.

2208
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,709
I know who she is.

2209
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:05,880
(Awkward)

2210
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:08,450
This is so funny.

2211
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,649
I wanted to ask you.

2212
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:12,049
Can you switch seats with me?

2213
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:14,319
- No, sit in the middle.
- Sit in the middle.

2214
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:18,160
I was watching these two, and they had such good banter.

2215
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:22,500
And you're the one I have the best chemistry with.

2216
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:23,659
- Am I?
- Yes.

2217
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,069
So, I told them about you.

2218
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:28,099
Did you come here because of them or for no reason?

2219
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,099
Seo Jin said,

2220
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,469
"So, you're not coming?"

2221
01:24:31,470 --> 01:24:32,809
So, I thought, "I guess I have to go."

2222
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,539
(He must have missed Seo Jin too.)

2223
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:35,709
That's why I came.

2224
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,040
(I'm still glad to see you.)

2225
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,279
Did you drink a lot?

2226
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,409
No, just one glass.

2227
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:40,980
- You reek of alcohol.
- You should have a drink.

2228
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:43,050
- He's wearing cologne.
- I only had one glass.

2229
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,049
Did you have a schedule today?

2230
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,749
No, I was at home.

2231
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,619
So, you naturally have good skin?

2232
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,489
- He does.
- Just in case...

2233
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:53,290
Oh, he's wearing something!

2234
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:57,129
- Just BB cream.
- He applied BB cream.

2235
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,569
- What about the cologne?
- It smells so good.

2236
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:00,600
Just in case.

2237
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,840
Just in case.

2238
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,870
I wore these clothes yesterday, so...

2239
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,770
His cologne is very strong.

2240
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:09,380
- Does it smell too much?
- No, I'm all right with it.

2241
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:11,879
What do you think of Girls' Generation?

2242
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:13,909
- I love them. They're excellent.
- What?

2243
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:15,219
Who's your favourite member?

2244
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:16,580
Hyoyeon.

2245
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:21,150
- Come on.
- He's changed so much.

2246
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,889
- What happened to you?
- He's different...

2247
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:25,689
from what I've seen on "Three Meals a Day."

2248
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:27,989
- You're right. He's changed.
- He's a professional entertainer.

2249
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,959
- At the time...
- You've changed.

2250
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,360
I was young back then.

2251
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,399
Now, I'm over 40.

2252
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:35,739
It's not the same Ho Jun...

2253
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,240
who used to be intimidated by Cha Seung Won and Yoo Hai Jin.

2254
01:25:37,670 --> 01:25:40,510
(Ho Jun has become sly.)

2255
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,409
But you used to be a huge fan of Kwang Kyu's.

2256
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:43,810
- I was a huge fan.
- You pitied him.

2257
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:45,509
- You pitied me?
- Remember?

2258
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:46,979
Yes, he's said you were pitiful since a long time ago.

2259
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:47,980
No.

2260
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:50,419
You've been saying that ever since "Three Meals a Day."

2261
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,949
I just meant that I cared for him.

2262
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:53,789
- Exactly.
- Isn't that the same thing?

2263
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:54,919
(Kwang Kyu is a pitiful man to Ho Jun.)

2264
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,259
It's because he's always walked on eggshells around them.

2265
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:02,330
And he walks on eggshells around me and Yeong Seok.

2266
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,830
So, Ho Jun must have thought,

2267
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:06,729
"He and I are in the same position."

2268
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:07,969
(He could relate to Kwang Kyu.)

2269
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:10,469
So, he really liked you because you were pitiful.

2270
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:11,910
(And he gradually fell in love.)

2271
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,569
I've been less pitiful, right?

2272
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:14,739
By the sea...

2273
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:17,510
But to him, you're in a worse position.

2274
01:26:18,910 --> 01:26:20,479
He thought you were even more cautious.

2275
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:24,219
But these two have gone through so much because of me today.

2276
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,220
I did brace myself before coming here, though.

2277
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:29,589
Because I knew how Yun Ho was.

2278
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:30,789
It was really tough now that you've tried it, right?

2279
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:32,290
- What?
- It was tough, wasn't it?

2280
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,960
It was tough.

2281
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,829
This is my first time hearing his honest thoughts.

2282
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:38,969
(He hears it for the first time.)

2283
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:41,770
But I understand because he's always enthusiastic.

2284
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:46,010
I once went shopping with Yun Ho.

2285
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:48,839
I was...

2286
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:50,540
trying to buy a pair of shoes,

2287
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:53,909
and he was trying to buy some clothes.

2288
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:55,679
He asked, "Can we go together?"

2289
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,150
But I knew what shoes I was going to buy.

2290
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,549
So, I stopped by the store, and it only took me...

2291
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:01,749
five minutes to buy the shoes.

2292
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:04,189
Then, we went shopping for his clothes,

2293
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:06,190
and we walked around for 6 to 8 hours.

2294
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,389
- He's being dramatic.
- Are you serious?

2295
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:09,559
(He doesn't even shop half-heartedly.)

2296
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,729
That's not true.

2297
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,169
- I'm serious.
- It wasn't six hours.

2298
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:13,529
- I bet he only bought one item.
- That's not true.

2299
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:14,669
- Yes! Just one item.
- I knew it.

2300
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,839
- And he stopped by multiple stores.
- Here, there, in another area...

2301
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,239
Then, he came back and tried it on again,

2302
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,639
only to go to another store.

2303
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,539
In the end, he bought it at the first store he entered.

2304
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:24,640
I didn't know that happened.

2305
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:27,510
Yun Ho is such a good guy,

2306
01:27:28,050 --> 01:27:29,280
but he lacks social awareness.

2307
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:32,189
(Even his close friend experienced his overzealousness.)

2308
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:33,449
And this one's interesting.

2309
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:34,919
I even told them that.

2310
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,720
That I forgot your birthday when you cooked seaweed soup for me.

2311
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:40,130
I said that you were probably disappointed.

2312
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:42,730
You're right.

2313
01:27:42,860 --> 01:27:45,729
Do you still resent him or not?

2314
01:27:45,730 --> 01:27:47,530
- For that incident?
- "Incident?"

2315
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:49,639
- It's an incident now?
- You think it's an incident.

2316
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,839
Of course.

2317
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,210
It was a major incident for me.

2318
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:58,440
So, I didn't call him or text him on purpose.

2319
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,249
I usually call him first.

2320
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,780
I thought, "I'm sure he'll call me once."

2321
01:28:02,150 --> 01:28:03,749
It must have meant a lot to you.

2322
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:04,880
So much.

2323
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:07,989
Because it's true that I've texted him...

2324
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:09,620
on his birthday every year.

2325
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:10,960
Right?

2326
01:28:10,961 --> 01:28:13,190
Also, I cooked that seaweed soup...

2327
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:17,029
with so much love and devotion...

2328
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:19,529
and threw him a birthday party.

2329
01:28:19,530 --> 01:28:20,530
And he...

2330
01:28:20,970 --> 01:28:23,699
Well, I wouldn't be disappointed if he hadn't cried then.

2331
01:28:23,700 --> 01:28:25,439
But he showed tears while eating the soup...

2332
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,810
- because he was so touched.
- What...

2333
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:28,169
- I didn't cry.
- You cried!

2334
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,380
- I only got choked up.
- You cried.

2335
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,679
He sniffled...

2336
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,210
as he ate.

2337
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:36,680
I thought, "He must be really touched."

2338
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:38,420
So, I was...

2339
01:28:39,490 --> 01:28:42,019
really upset when he didn't even give me a single call.

2340
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,660
That's entirely my fault.

2341
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:46,160
It's very complicated as if they're boyfriend and girlfriend.

2342
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:49,399
- Does it look that way?
- Yes.

2343
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,930
(What a bantering bromance)

2344
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:53,570
Now that I hear the full story, you're very petty, Ho Jun.

2345
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:58,670
And you looked after him back in the day.

2346
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:01,139
- I did.
- Right?

2347
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,839
I heard he crashed at your place.

2348
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,710
He often came by.

2349
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:12,789
I stayed at his house when I had nowhere else to go.

2350
01:29:12,790 --> 01:29:15,489
That's fine, then. No need to call him on his birthdays.

2351
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:16,759
(Yun Ho was his benefactor.)

2352
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:18,889
I still remember.

2353
01:29:18,890 --> 01:29:20,559
I think I was...

2354
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:21,959
a freshman or a sophomore in high school.

2355
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,900
- Yes. You were really young.
- It was a cold winter.

2356
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:26,729
You gave me exactly 30 dollars.

2357
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:28,170
- I did.
- Right?

2358
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:33,509
He was barely getting by in Seoul at the time.

2359
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,980
When I went to Seoul to hang out once in a while,

2360
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:39,980
we'd give him all the leftover money we had.

2361
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:41,110
So that he could use it.

2362
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:45,179
I think that was when I genuinely thought...

2363
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:46,920
he was cool.

2364
01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:51,020
As far as I knew, he wasn't that wealthy either.

2365
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:52,859
We were all struggling at the time.

2366
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:54,029
Those who helped you when you were struggling...

2367
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:55,190
are the ones you remember the most.

2368
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:58,460
Yun Ho, do you get...

2369
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,899
any allowance or monthly pay when you're a trainee?

2370
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:02,269
No.

2371
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:04,770
I used to work part-time when I was a trainee.

2372
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:08,139
So, the ones from outside of Seoul...

2373
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,809
would go to Gwangju at 2am after practice...

2374
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,980
and go to school.

2375
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:13,709
We often did that.

2376
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:15,109
- Oh, right.
- Right?

2377
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:16,649
(Taking a trip down memory lane)

2378
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:17,920
That's how I endured it.

2379
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:20,090
You're right.

2380
01:30:20,650 --> 01:30:22,389
I also wondered...

2381
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:25,019
where his passion came from.

2382
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,490
It sounds like it was way back in the past.

2383
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:29,500
It goes way back.

2384
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,329
No.

2385
01:30:31,330 --> 01:30:33,730
With that type of passion,

2386
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,600
I think he deserves to be one of the directors.

2387
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:39,869
I've actually gotten offers to be a producer...

2388
01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:41,470
from other agencies too.

2389
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:44,409
But being a producer to someone else...

2390
01:30:44,410 --> 01:30:48,709
means that I'm taking control of that person's life.

2391
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,119
- I didn't want to...
- It's that significant?

2392
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:51,850
Stop engaging him in conversation.

2393
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,690
(Changing the topic just when he was about to get serious)

2394
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,059
He keeps trying to sound cool, right?

2395
01:30:57,060 --> 01:30:58,790
- That's not it.
- He's even talking about lives.

2396
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:02,260
The more we drink, the more serious he gets.

2397
01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:08,530
I want to talk at ease now.

2398
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:13,669
(How much energy do you have left now?)

2399
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,709
Probably half.

2400
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:16,779
That's admirable.

2401
01:31:16,780 --> 01:31:18,679
I don't want to act tough.

2402
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,349
I have leftover energy because I'm with the right people.

2403
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:22,549
(The right secretaries who helped him save energy)

2404
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:23,850
I'm also a human.

2405
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:29,119
I think the next guest should refrain from getting serious.

2406
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:31,459
(Mirror therapy)

2407
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:33,730
Don't talk about serious things. They tend to get tired faster.

2408
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:35,699
(They've been exhausted since a long time ago.)

2409
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,600
Try not to get serious.

2410
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:41,670
(What do you want to say to your actual manager?)

2411
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:42,840
Si Woo.

2412
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:47,840
I'm like an engine that won't get tired,

2413
01:31:48,510 --> 01:31:50,640
so I know I often wear you out.

2414
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:52,680
Thank you.

2415
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:55,080
I can't thank you enough.

2416
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:57,180
I'm serious until the end! I should stop doing this.

2417
01:31:57,480 --> 01:31:59,750
I've been serious from the beginning to the end.

2418
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,989
I'm so worried about today.

2419
01:32:03,990 --> 01:32:06,130
(Talented My Star, Cho Jung Seok)

2420
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:07,960
(The car battery died.)

2421
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:10,830
(His eyes tremble.)

2422
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:13,670
(This was the beginning of their misfortune.)

2423
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,669
(You didn't film the congratulatory video vertically, did you?)

2424
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:16,670
(I did.)

2425
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,069
(The first misfortune: Not doing the right job of filming a video)

2426
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:21,769
(Did you eat tteokbokki without me?)

2427
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,039
(The second misfortune)

2428
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,110
(Failing to look after My Star during a shoot)

2429
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,879
(One of my least favourite qualities in a manager is...)

2430
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,250
(That's a cute car.)

2431
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,720
(The third misfortune: Failing to continue the conversation)

2432
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,819
(But I asked you.)

2433
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:35,219
(How do I use this?)

2434
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,060
(It wasn't even a big favour, but he didn't do it.)

2435
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,959
(He even took the humidifier away.)

2436
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,460
(My Star has reached his limit.)

2437
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:46,230
(Turn My Star's misfortune around.)

2438
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:47,499
I apologise.

2439
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,800
(Nothing goes right in taking care of My Star.)

2440
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,170
(I feel like I'm the one sacrificing myself.)

2441
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:55,609
(What were the unhappy moments of today?)

2442
01:32:55,610 --> 01:32:56,979
(All moments?)

2443
01:32:56,980 --> 01:32:58,640
(Especially when I was driving.)

2444
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:01,610
(This is actually happening.)

2445
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:03,519
(My Star.)

2446
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,050
(Drive properly.)

2447
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:07,220
(The managers and My Star have switched roles?)

2448
01:33:07,350 --> 01:33:09,760
(It irritates me that we look natural in these seats.)

2449
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:15,629
(The first look at the jam session...)

2450
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:17,659
(of "2025 Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B")

2451
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:24,839
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2452
01:33:24,840 --> 01:33:30,940
(My Grumpy Secretary)
