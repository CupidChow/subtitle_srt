1
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:19,169
(My Star awaits in a building in Sadang-dong.)

2
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,638
(Hip air...)

3
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:24,339
(fills the place.)

4
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,179
(The birthplace of trends, live commerce studio)

5
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:31,078
(My Star is waiting for the secretaries here.)

6
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,018
I have a lisp because of my face.

7
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:34,119
- It's understandable.
- Yes.

8
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:36,788
(Both secretaries arrive at work at the hub of trends.)

9
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:37,789
Your pants...

10
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:39,759
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

11
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:41,658
What will you do with those pants and shoes?

12
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:42,759
This is a disaster.

13
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:45,928
I realized that I had worn my sneakers too much.

14
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,929
What will you do with those socks and shoes? Hey.

15
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:50,069
What?

16
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:51,698
They're so embarrassing.

17
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:52,968
(They're so embarrassing.)

18
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,168
Your pants and shoes are so embarrassing. Your socks too.

19
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:58,479
A manager's outfit doesn't matter. Hey.

20
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,208
Kwang Kyu, that outfit...

21
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:01,579
isn't suitable for TV.

22
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:02,808
I matched...

23
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:05,478
the color of the shoes and pants.

24
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:06,618
It's too...

25
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:07,778
Don't you have other shoes in the car?

26
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:08,788
Don't you have sneakers?

27
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:10,088
- He does have black shoes.
- Good.

28
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:11,549
- What sneakers?
- Hurry up and bring them.

29
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:14,558
- What sneakers?
- Good. Hurry up and bring them.

30
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,589
(Hurried)

31
00:01:15,889 --> 00:01:18,289
Why did you wear those pants?

32
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:19,429
It's cold!

33
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,099
These are the only winter pants I have.

34
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,969
- You look shabby in those pants.
- No.

35
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:26,269
Hey, as a manager,

36
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,639
I want to make My Star shine.

37
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:30,669
That outfit will destroy My Star.

38
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,309
What?

39
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,078
(Oh, my)

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,179
Give me those shoes.

41
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:38,408
(He does have spare shoes.)

42
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,379
(Vintage black shoes that look very old)

43
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,088
(Clenching his teeth)

44
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:44,819
Give me those shoes.

45
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,589
Give me those shoes.

46
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:47,858
Hey, choose!

47
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,459
(Hey, choose!)

48
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,398
(The two pair of shoes are about the same.)

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,598
Which pair should I wear?

50
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,759
This is number one.

51
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:56,269
This is number two.

52
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:58,738
If I must choose, that pair is better.

53
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,169
- What? Is this pair better?
- That pair is better.

54
00:02:00,669 --> 00:02:02,208
- Really?
- Yes. If I must choose...

55
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,769
For goodness' sake.

56
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,479
You're so difficult to please.

57
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,649
Hey, I matched the color...

58
00:02:08,849 --> 00:02:10,348
of the two items today.

59
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:11,348
Seong Yong,

60
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:12,519
- take off your pants.
- Hold on.

61
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:15,489
- No.
- Come on.

62
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,218
(They make a compromise to keep things reasonable.)

63
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,249
(Sighing)

64
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:21,559
Maybe I need a stylist.

65
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:23,159
Seriously.

66
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:25,758
Will it be better to do everything at once...

67
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,228
or one at a time?

68
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:28,429
- Let's do it later.
- Okay.

69
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,128
(See you soon, my secretaries.)

70
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:31,468
- Right now...
- Let's go.

71
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,569
(See you soon, my secretaries.)

72
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:35,769
Look at that. It's very nice.

73
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,809
Gosh, it's nice.

74
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,138
- Kwang Kyu, they sell clothes.
- What?

75
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:42,208
Aren't those clothes for sale?

76
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,248
(He spots a clothing store at the entrance of the building.)

77
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:44,578
- Right?
- Are they for sale?

78
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,649
I think so.

79
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:46,978
- Really?
- Yes.

80
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:48,689
(His face lights up.)

81
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,949
- Are there men's clothes?
- Yes.

82
00:02:51,249 --> 00:02:52,419
Kwang Kyu, they have men's clothes.

83
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:53,788
- Really?
- Yes.

84
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:55,158
(They suddenly begin shopping on their way to meet My Star.)

85
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,328
Let's buy a pair of pants.

86
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,189
- A pair of pants?
- What?

87
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,229
I think these are golf pants.

88
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,899
This pair is nice.

89
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:03,229
- Will you buy it?
- What?

90
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:04,728
- It's 15 dollars.
- It's cheap.

91
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,138
- It's cheap.
- It's ten dollars.

92
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:07,599
- Ten dollars?
- Yes.

93
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:11,138
(They're having a Black Friday clearance sale.)

94
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:12,708
I should buy these pants.

95
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:14,738
Kwang Kyu, these pants are nice. Look. These pants are nice.

96
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:15,979
Do you have these pants in size 33?

97
00:03:16,179 --> 00:03:17,349
Size 33?

98
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,649
Thank goodness. Seriously.

99
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,279
You wore...

100
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,648
a lousy outfit to buy new pants, right?

101
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:25,419
(Thankfully, My Star will see him in a nice outfit.)

102
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,259
Do they fit or not?

103
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:30,359
- Hey, Seo Jin.
- Yes?

104
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,498
Ask for size 32.

105
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,899
- Are they big?
- They're big.

106
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:35,829
- Are they big?
- They're a bit big.

107
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,598
They aren't big.

108
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,138
Hey.

109
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,368
They aren't big.

110
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:42,438
Hey.

111
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,009
The waistband is under your belly.

112
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:46,909
I'll lose weight.

113
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:48,648
No, wear that size.

114
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:50,149
I'll go with this size.

115
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:51,448
Kwang Kyu.

116
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:52,449
(He checks out the tops as well.)

117
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,019
- Is this for men?
- Yes.

118
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:55,149
All of these clothes are for men.

119
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,749
Please give me one in large.

120
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,419
Why are you shopping in earnest?

121
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,788
- I mean, - Why?

122
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:03,258
the fabric is nice.

123
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:04,358
Please wait.

124
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:05,759
(It's a chance to buy nice clothes for a cheap price.)

125
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,459
Hey, look at this.

126
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:08,669
It's six dollars.

127
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,068
- Is it for the employees?
- Yes.

128
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,169
(It's the price of one gimbap roll.)

129
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,768
Please give me ten.

130
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:14,998
(Laughing)

131
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,139
It's six dollars.

132
00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:18,368
- You need to pay and leave.
- Really?

133
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:20,109
- Kwang Kyu, stop shopping.
- Then...

134
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,008
I'll take this one.

135
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:23,049
No.

136
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:24,608
I'll take these two.

137
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:25,849
(I'll take these two.)

138
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,518
- Kwang Kyu, we need to go.
- Let's go.

139
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,818
- Put them on.
- Let's go. What?

140
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:29,989
- Give your clothes to the staff.
- Let's go.

141
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,248
All right.

142
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:33,719
- These are new items.
- Yes.

143
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:35,188
(Meanwhile, My Star is done with the commerce meeting.)

144
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,158
The idea of having strangers look after me...

145
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,428
I hope I won't walk on eggshells around these managers.

146
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:40,529
Seriously.

147
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,999
(She's the mom of 2 girls who are 8 and 5.)

148
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:48,808
(She's busy with shows, live commerce, and YouTube.)

149
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:51,639
(She's busy with shows, live commerce, and YouTube.)

150
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:56,379
(She's a popular working mom who needs more than 24 hours a day.)

151
00:04:56,549 --> 00:04:58,408
(The secretaries arrive after shopping.)

152
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:01,848
- Ji Hye, hello.
- Hello.

153
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:02,888
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

154
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:03,948
- Hello.
- Hello.

155
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:05,989
Why are you saying hello so coyly?

156
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:07,089
- Because I became a mom...
- Seriously.

157
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,518
Why are you saying hello so coyly?

158
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,759
(Do the two of them know each other?)

159
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,758
(His dimples deepen as soon as he sees My Star.)

160
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,429
- You need this as well.
- Have you been well?

161
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,998
It has been so long.

162
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:20,638
Yes. It was before you got married.

163
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,938
- It was years before that.
- Yes.

164
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:24,839
I was in my mid 20s or early 30s.

165
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:26,908
I rarely go to the Hongdae area.

166
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,478
We often hung out in Gangnam.

167
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,648
Where did we hang out?

168
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:30,949
Do you remember?

169
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:33,848
- We went to the karaoke.
- Did we go to the karaoke?

170
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:35,948
- Of course.
- I think we went to the karaoke...

171
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,989
- with your older brother.
- Discuss personal matters later.

172
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,889
Your manager needs to relay the duties. I'm sorry.

173
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:41,989
You need to work.

174
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,858
You kept talking about personal matters.

175
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:44,859
We can work now.

176
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,598
Today, to celebrate one million subscribers,

177
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,269
she'll film a YouTube video with the joint childcare concept.

178
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,828
(The joint childcare?)

179
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:54,198
It's for a party.

180
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,609
I'll invite the moms and film a YouTube video.

181
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,778

182
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,208
(6 years after starting a YouTube channel.)

183
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:05,478
Did I get one million subscribers?

184
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:06,648
The number is 999,999.

185
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,348
(Number of subscribers)

186
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,448

189
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,028
Thank you so much for sending my family...

190
00:06:16,029 --> 00:06:17,489
so much love and support.

191
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:19,258
(Aunts and uncles, thank you!)

192
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:20,998
Korean citizens.

193
00:06:20,999 --> 00:06:24,298
(Her YouTube channel has a total of 450 million views.)

194
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,239
It isn't easy to get one million subscribers.

195
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,808
You must've received a Gold Play Button.

196
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:29,969
It's coming.

We can't be late.

213
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:17,488
- Pick up your children?
- Yes.

214
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:20,888
Today, we're celebrating one million subscribers on YouTube.

215
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:22,859
My children contributed,

216
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:25,059
so I'll film a YouTube video with them.

217
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,798
- What do we need to do with them?
- We need to pick them up.

218
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,928
My children...

219
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,928
- Will they participate in filming?
- Yes. After all...

220
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,828
- You're filming at a kids' cafe.
- Yes.

221
00:07:31,829 --> 00:07:35,768
I gained more subscribers thanks to my children.

222
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:36,938
Because of that,

223
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:38,838
- the children...
- Tae Ri and Ellie.

224
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,008
Your second child has the same name as my niece.

225
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:42,648
- Really? Is she Ellie?
- Ellie.

226
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:44,148
That's perfect.

227
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,848
How old are they? How old is the first child?

228
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:48,478
The 1st child is 8 and the 2nd child is 5.

229
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,689
- First grade?
- Yes, first grade and five.

230
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:53,219
- It'll take a long time.
- Gyeseong Elementary School?

231
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:54,589
She's my junior.

232
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,659
Did you attend Gyeseong Elementary School?

233
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,228
- Yes, I did.
- Really? That's incredible.

234
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,359
(Seo Jin attended the same school as JI Hye's first daughter, Tae Ri.)

235
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,869
It was so hard to enroll her in that school.

236
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:04,329
But she won the lottery.

237
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:07,069
- You did well with the lottery.
- Yes.

238
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,468
Seo Jin, you attended Gyeseong Elementary School. Nice.

239
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:10,639
(He'll meet his junior of 40 years soon.)

240
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:15,108
(The happy coincidence makes My Star's face light up.)

241
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:16,478
- They shouldn't wait.
- We need to go.

242
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:17,549
We can't be late.

243
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:18,948
Let's go.

244
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:20,549
(12:30pm, Setting out to pick up Tae Ri)

245
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,589
Seo Jin...

246
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:25,659
didn't attend the meeting very often, right?

247
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,158
Both Seo Jin and I...

248
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,388
were shy,

249
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,888
so we weren't very close.

250
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:32,959
Isn't that right?

251
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,728
Back then, Baek Z Young...

252
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,328
- Yes. You and Z Young were close.
- and Yu Ri...

253
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,869
- I...
- Yu Ri and...

254
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:41,468
Ji Hye is an incredible singer.

255
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,268
- Of course.
- I don't even remember.

256
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:44,269
You should learn how to sing from her.

257
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,608
Ji Hye is great at singing trot.

258
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,609
Teach him how to sing.

259
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,348
- Really?
- Take a singing lesson in the car.

260
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,708
I'm a judge at "The Best K-Trot Singer."

261
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:52,248
Shall I teach you a lesson?

262
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:53,578
- Teach me a lesson.
- Okay.

263
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:54,618
- Okay. That sounds good.
- Okay.

264
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,418
- That's right.
- Okay.

265
00:08:56,419 --> 00:09:00,258
- I'll drive then.
- Really?

266
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,459
- Learn how to sing.
- Shall I do that?

267
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,159
Okay.

268
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:04,429
This is...

269
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,658
Ji Hye is really good at singing.

270
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:09,069
I know that.

271
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:11,069
She's also good at live commerce.

272
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:14,239
What Kwang Kyu wants to do the most is live commerce and singing.

273
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:17,038
I did that because I wanted him to learn from Ji Hye...

274
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,779
during the drive.

275
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,408
(Offhanded affection for the older bestie)

276
00:09:23,409 --> 00:09:26,748
How will we get in?

277
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,078
We have a lot of stuff to carry.

278
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,149
(Tight)

279
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:32,689
- How will we get in?
- You can do it.

280
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:37,229
(He runs into an issue as soon as he decides to drive.)

281
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:40,399
Kwang Kyu, I can't get in.

282
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:43,168
(Squeezing)

283
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:44,568
It's too tight.

284
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:48,169
(He wants to help, but the environment won't let him.)

285
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:52,138
- Can't you get in?
- I can't get in.

286
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:54,338
- I'll take the car out.
- No. It's impossible to get in.

287
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:55,779
I can take the car out.

288
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,249
It's impossible to get in.

289
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:58,909
No. It's possible.

290
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:02,748
Kwang Kyu, it's too tight for me.

291
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,819
(Squeezing)

292
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,988
Seo Jin got in from the other side.

293
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:10,389
He's something else.

294
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:13,558
(Squeezing in)

295
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,899
Kwang Kyu, it's too tight for me.

296
00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:20,768
(Seo Jin crosses the passenger seat for the older bestie.)

297
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:21,839
I'll give you the key.

298
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:23,939
I can't believe...

299
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:26,079
Seo Jin offered to drive today.

300
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:28,508
(The secretaries' warm journey at the cold year-end begins.)

301
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:29,778
Let's go.

302
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:32,179
(The secretaries' warm journey at the cold year-end begins.)

303
00:10:32,849 --> 00:10:35,418
Ji Hye, I recently read an article about you.

304
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:36,449
- What article?
- What article?

305
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,118
It said that you got a surgery.

306
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:39,758
Was that why you stared intently earlier?

307
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,359
What changed about my face?

308
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,188
- Seriously.
- What changed about my face?

309
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:45,288
- Your face...
- It changed a lot.

310
00:10:45,289 --> 00:10:46,698
- became much prettier.
- Did it become much prettier?

311
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:49,528
I read in an article that you had a philtrum surgery.

312
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:50,828
- That's right.
- What?

313
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:51,928
- That's right.
- When did you get it done?

314
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,969
- She came clean about it.
- Do you prefer my old or new face?

315
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,738
- Be honest.
- I prefer your old face.

316
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:58,839
- Really?
- Yes.

317
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:00,909
I already had plastic surgery. What should I do?

318
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,649
- I prefer...
- It's not completely healed yet.

319
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,608
- You look a bit awkward...
- I need a few more months.

320
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,448
- You're right. My philtrum...
- around the mouth.

321
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:09,289
My philtrum...

322
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,388
I got it done because they said that recovery would take two weeks.

323
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:13,488
But it isn't fully healed even after a month.

324
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,788
It takes about six months.

325
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:16,058
Yes. How do you know?

326
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:17,988
- Well, that's...
- Did you shorten your philtrum?

327
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:20,558
No. Everyone who had plastic surgery said that.

328
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,728
It takes 6 months. I thought it'd take 2 weeks.

329
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:24,769
I'm someone who's on TV every day.

330
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:27,039
I had shoots lined up,

331
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,608
and I couldn't cancel them because of my responsibility.

332
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:30,708
So I came clean...

333
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:32,538
and explained what had happened.

334
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:33,809
Since then,

335
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,078
so many articles talk about how I had a philtrum shortening surgery.

336
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:38,148
("Philtrum shortening surgery, Lee Ji Hye")

337
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,318
"Philtrum shortening surgery, Lee Ji Hye" is in every title.

338
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,148
("Philtrum shortening surgery, Lee Ji Hye")

339
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:46,918
- There are those articles.
- It's hard to reveal a surgery,

340
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,319
but you did it on YouTube.

341
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:50,589
Ji Hye once had a press conference at a swimming pool.

342
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:52,498
- That came out of nowhere.
- At a swimming pool?

343
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:55,028
Seo Jin, you've been keeping up.

344
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:56,728
- Why did you watch my press...
- He has been keeping up.

345
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:59,738
- conference at a swimming pool?
- There were articles everywhere.

346
00:11:59,739 --> 00:12:00,768
I couldn't read any other articles.

347
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,008
Why did you do that?

348
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,608
Did someone pick a fight?

349
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:07,208
Yes, they did. There was an issue.

350
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,108
That's right. People said that I had gotten a breast surgery.

351
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:12,179
- They accused you of lying.
- Yes.

352
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:13,978
- Back then...
- You showed that they were wrong.

353
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:16,748
Back then, they had to make an incision in the underarm area.

354
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,448
So I revealed my underarm area.

355
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:19,789
"I didn't get it done."

356
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,788
- It was impressive.
- How impressive.

357
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:23,989
She was so angry.

358
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:27,258
Is that why your YouTube channel is “Gwanjong,” an attention-seeker?

359
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:28,299
That's right.

360
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:31,428
(My Star's YouTube channel title was born from such history.)

361
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:32,968
I thought it was the perfect title.

362
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:35,239
I love receiving attention,

363
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,469
but I don't do it in an annoying way.

364
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,339
The title captures that vibe.

365
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,779
(Since Working Mom Ji Hye always shows her genuine self,)

366
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:47,818
(1 million fans have gathered with warm attention.)

367
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:50,389
(1 million fans have gathered with warm attention.)

368
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:52,718
I think people began to see me for myself...

369
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,388
through my YouTube channel.

370
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,929
They realized that I worked hard.

371
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,789
They watched me talk all the time.

372
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:02,799
It couldn't have been easy to call yourself an attention seeker.

373
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,169
("Gwanjong Un-ni," let's get 2 million subscribers.)

374
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,839
You'll see children there.

375
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,678
Seo Jin likes children a lot.

376
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,709
- Really?
- Don't dump the duties on me.

377
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,248
You like children.

378
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,979
- You look after your niece.
- Do you take good care of children?

379
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:23,919
(Very sweet)

380
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:28,789
(Very warm-hearted)

381
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,459
(He becomes a sweet uncle when he's with children.)

382
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,998
(What kind of memories will he make with children today?)

383
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:42,069
First graders act strong.

384
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:45,108
- Really?
- Even though Tae Ri is a shy girl,

385
00:13:45,109 --> 00:13:46,878
he acts strong at times.

386
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,878
And you need to show reactions to girls.

387
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,109
I'm in charge of reactions.

388
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:52,849
Kwang Kyu, good luck.

389
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,279
- Reactions.
- You must show reactions.

390
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,318
But show genuine reactions, not fake reactions.

391
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:57,349
Children can tell.

392
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:58,719
You know what I mean, right?

393
00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:00,858
Tae Ri is sensitive.

394
00:14:00,859 --> 00:14:02,559
- I'm in trouble.
- She reads people's faces.

395
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:05,459
With my second child, it's easy.

396
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:07,458
My second child loves to eat.

397
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,729
She becomes happy when you give her chocolate.

398
00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:12,268
It'll be easy to look after my second child.

399
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,738
- Is she 5?
- Yes, she's 5.

400
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,398
- Five-year-olds are cute.
- She loves to eat.

401
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:17,208
- They're the cutest.
- She's cute and is a funny talker.

402
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:18,809
(Excited)

403
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:20,939
Have you been to the school after it moved locations?

404
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:23,479
- I did visit once.
- Why?

405
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:26,578
They asked me to come to the reunion once.

406
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,479
(The last visit was for a reunion 15 years ago.)

407
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:33,219
There won't be a single teacher I know at this point.

408
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:35,659
(So many years have passed.)

409
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,728
There are many schools in the area.

410
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:40,759
(They are already near Seo Jin's elementary school.)

411
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,428
It's the one to the left, right?

412
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:46,599
Yes. Go to the left and make an immediate turn.

413
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,609
That's the location. You see the school, right?

414
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:54,109
- I think I graduated in 1982.
- Really?

415
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:56,178
I guess that's how it is.

416
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:57,509
The buried memories...

417
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:00,218
can surface when you aren't even expecting them.

418
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:01,879
The childhood memories...

419
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:05,989
How many years ago did you attend this school?

420
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,088
(It was a long time ago.)

421
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:10,359
Tell me. How many years ago was it?

422
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,858
(Well...)

423
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:12,899
Forty-five years ago?

424
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:16,298
- Really?
- It was 45 years ago.

425
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,498
- Forty-five years ago?
- But the school wasn't here.

426
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:20,238
I see. It was at a different location.

427
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,869
- It was in Myeong-dong.
- Your elementary school. No way.

428
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:25,738
(Many things have changed,)

429
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:29,138
(but he's always happy to visit the school grounds.)

430
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,179
My daughter is your junior.

431
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:34,419
Is the school song still the same?

432
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:36,019
Sing it with her.

433
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,148
- When my daughter...
- I don't remember it very well.

434
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:41,589
- sings it, sing along.
- Children are coming out.

435
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:43,529
- Children are coming out.
- Yes.

436
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:48,499
(Parents are waiting for their children to come out.)

437
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:52,629
(These 2 uncles wait for their niece.)

438
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,669
- Moon Tae Ri!
- Hello.

439
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,308
Tae Ri!

440
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:58,668
- Are we going home?
- Okay.

441
00:15:58,669 --> 00:15:59,679
(She runs to her mom right away.)

442
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,678
Let's go. Tae Ri, say goodbye.

443
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,408
Ah Yoon.

444
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:05,208
(She says hello to Tae Ri's friend.)

445
00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:07,149
Ah Yoon, let's hang out soon, okay?

446
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:09,418
Bye, Ah Yoon.

447
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:10,549
Let's go.

448
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:13,419
It was unimaginable when I attended elementary school.

449
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:17,129
(The man who graduated years ago is unfamiliar with the sight.)

450
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:20,058
Tae Ri, say hello. They're my managers.

451
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:21,898
- Hello.
- Hello.

452
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,199
Hello.

453
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,829
(Hello.)

454
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,268
(Moon Tae Ri, My Star, Ji Hye's first daughter)

455
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:31,038
Usually, only your mom picks you up in front of the school.

456
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,739
Weren't you surprised to see unfamiliar uncles?

457
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,379
- I was a bit surprised.
- Were you surprised?

458
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:39,149
But they seemed like Mom's friends.

459
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:41,318
- They seemed like Mom's friends.
- Friends.

460
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:42,449
(So it was okay.)

461
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,689
They're Uncle Kwang Kyu and Uncle Seo Jin.

462
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:46,858
I graduated from this school.

463
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:47,889
(Showing dimples)

464
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,358
- Really?
- Yes.

465
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,559
He's your senior by 50 years.

466
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,459
Uncle...

467
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,329
Uncle graduated from this school.

468
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:57,598
Really?

469
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,599
Yes, really.

470
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,999
I graduated in 1982 or something.

471
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,668
- In 1982?
- Yes.

472
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:03,609
- I graduated in 1982 or something.
- I was born in 1980.

473
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:05,908
- Tae Ri.
- Did she have lunch?

474
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:07,178
I received a random eraser today.

475
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:08,278
She ate...

476
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,348
- at the school cafeteria.
- I got it for the book exercise.

477
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,509
- Really? Did you do a good job?
- What's that?

478
00:17:12,879 --> 00:17:15,749
- What's that?
- It's a random eraser.

479
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,189
What's that?

480
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:18,749
Today, I got a seal.

481
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:20,559
- It doesn't look like a eraser.
- An eraser?

482
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:22,488
(My goodness. An eraser?)

483
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,188
- It's cute.
- Right?

484
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,329
It'll be perfect to use it for studying.

485
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:28,958
- Did it make you happy...
- Yes.

486
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:30,398
- to receive a present?
- Yes.

487
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:31,799
- Did you have a happy day?
- Yes.

488
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,338
- Did you have fun?
- I had a lot of fun.

489
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:35,769
I see. Do you want me to carry your bag?

490
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,069
I love looking at someone else's child.

491
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:41,109
I love looking at the child someone else has raised well.

492
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:43,209
I don't want to raise my own child.

493
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:44,849
But...

494
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,849
when I see a child from time to time,

495
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:49,849
it feels really great.

496
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:51,819
Let's go.

497
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:54,888
- Is there a restroom near here?
- A restroom?

498
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:56,128
There isn't a restroom here.

499
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:57,288
- No?
- Why would there be one here?

500
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,428
- There isn't a restroom here.
- No?

501
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,599
Where are we going next?

502
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,128
Use it at the salon. Do you need to go right away?

503
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:03,228
- Where?
- The salon.

504
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:04,598
- Ji Hye needs to go to the salon.
- If you go up...

505
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,668
- Hold it in.
- I know.

506
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,298
- It's over there.
- Do you need to go right away?

507
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,438
- Sinbanpo Church.
- Sinbanpo Church.

508
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,568
- Sinbanpo Church. There's...
- It's a church across the street.

509
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,008
- A church?
- a restroom in it.

510
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,538
- Have you been there?
- Take Uncle there.

511
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:16,849
- Take Uncle there.
- But...

512
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:18,978
- Take Uncle there.
- Thank you.

513
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,348
Help him pee at the church.

514
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,248
- Sinbanpo Church, okay?
- We'll take the car to the front.

515
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:23,619
Okay. Let's go.

516
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,818
- Mom, don't leave without me.
- Are you okay?

517
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:27,519
Okay. I'll go to the front.

518
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:30,359
Uncle is old, so take good care of him.

519
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,059
Okay?

520
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:34,158
(Happy)

521
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,029
(Even an 8-year-old thinks it's funny.)

522
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:38,669
- Isn't he a grandpa?
- He's old enough to be one.

523
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,368
Tae Ri became flustered.

524
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,369
You know,

525
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,269
she isn't very shy.

526
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:47,278
The fact that she took Kwang Kyu to the restroom...

527
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,139
tells me she's very cheerful.

528
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,678
Tae Ri could be secretly feeling very embarrassed.

529
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,449
She's shy. She's just like me.

530
00:18:54,879 --> 00:18:57,519
I guess Kwang Kyu didn't seem like a bad man.

531
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,119
I guess he looked nice.

532
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,288
- Are you in first grade?
- Yes.

533
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:06,429
My goodness. What do you learn?

534
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,799
- In classes?
- Mathematics?

535
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,199
Do you learn mathematics?

536
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:13,069
Yes, I learn mathematics.

537
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,639
(Impressed)

538
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:18,308
How does a first grader learn mathematics?

539
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:19,939
(The conversation strangely continues.)

540
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:21,179
Seriously.

541
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:23,448
Have you been here?

542
00:19:23,449 --> 00:19:24,449
Yes.

543
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,749
(With Tae Ri's help, he arrives at the church restroom.)

544
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,748
- Then...
- It's here.

545
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,418
- you...
- It's here.

546
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,049
- Don't you need to use it?
- No.

547
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:32,549
Then sit here for a second.

548
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,659
- Don't go anywhere.
- Okay.

549
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,829
Stay here.

550
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,729
(Hurried)

551
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,029
(Grinning)

552
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,599
(Freezing)

553
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,609
(Glancing over)

554
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:54,279
(Peeking)

555
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:56,139
When will he come back?

556
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:58,009
He'll come back soon.

557
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,389
(She becomes bored.)

558
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,759
(Wailing)

559
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:08,988
Why are you crying?

560
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:10,589
(Hurried)

561
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:12,529
- Did you cry?
- No.

562
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,159
Didn't you wail?

563
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:17,369
What was that?

564
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:18,829
Let's go.

565
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:21,098
Why would I cry?

566
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:22,268
What did you say then?

567
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:25,869
I could barely pee because you were crying.

568
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:27,579
Seriously.

569
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,048
I didn't cry.

570
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:31,978
I was so startled.

571
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:33,049
Hello.

572
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:35,018
My pee stopped.

573
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:36,079
(She even says hello to a stranger.)

574
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:38,118
I got tired of waiting,

575
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:39,288
so I shouted.

576
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:41,389
You didn't wait that long.

577
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:44,058
I didn't poop.

578
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:45,889
(The restroom mates bicker cheerfully.)

579
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,999
The car is here.

580
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:50,968
Here.

581
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,269
(Uncle Seo Jin drove over to pick them up.)

582
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:54,869
My daughter.

583
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,238
Let's go.

584
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:57,869
- I feel refreshed.
- Did you show him the way?

585
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,508
Tae Ri, did you guide him to the restroom...

586
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,879
- in Sinbanpo Church?
- Yes.

587
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:03,309
Fasten your seatbelt.

588
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,579
I took care of the urgent matter thanks to Tae Ri.

589
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,549
- Clap!
- What's this?

590
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,448
(Chuckling)

591
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:11,449
- She isn't even listening.
- Gum?

592
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,188
- Gum.
- She isn't even listening.

593
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,319
I want a pink one.

594
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,919
- Mom.
- It's here.

595
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:17,428
We're here, Tae Ri.

596
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:18,789
We're here.

597
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:21,899
Be careful.

598
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:26,599
(They became close thanks to the restroom trip.)

599
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:29,598
Moon Tae Ri, is it your first time coming here with Mom?

600
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,038
- No.
- Have you been here?

601
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,039
Yes.

602
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,808
- Let's apply it lightly.
- Mom.

603
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:35,778
- Moon Tae Ri. Do you want to watch?
- I want to watch.

604
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:37,309
(Sticking close)

605
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:38,848
- Moon Tae Ri.
- Mom is the best.

606
00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:40,979
My daughter is the best.

607
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:44,949
(Affectionate)

608
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:47,289
Tae Ri.

609
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,729
Tae Ri, Uncle Kwang Kyu will bring back cookie sticks.

610
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,899
(Grinning)

611
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,399
What kind of snacks do you like?

612
00:21:58,699 --> 00:22:00,798
What kind of snacks do I like?

613
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,839
(Thinking)

614
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,108
Cookie sticks.

615
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:04,368
- Cookie sticks?
- Yes.

616
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:05,609
Do you like cookie sticks?

617
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:07,838
Okay. Cookie sticks.

618
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,839
(He learns about Tae Ri's favorite snack.)

619
00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,579
She talked about cookie sticks inside the car.

620
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,049
I found them.

621
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,878
(Kwang Kyu's small present to repay Tae Ri's kindness.)

622
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:17,019
I found it.

623
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:20,159
Play with Uncle.

624
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:21,518
Play a game with Uncle.

625
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,089
- What game?
- Word Chain Game.

626
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:25,128
Uncle is very smart, Tae Ri.

627
00:22:25,129 --> 00:22:26,999
Uncle is very smart, Tae Ri.

628
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,328
- Which Uncle?
- Play it with Uncle Seo Jin.

629
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:31,169
- Play the Word Chain Game.
- Don't I look...

630
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,369
smarter than Uncle Kwang Kyu?

631
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,338
(Instinct versus Loyalty)

632
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:38,239
No? Do you think Uncle Kwang Kyu is smarter?

633
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:39,809
Yes.

634
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:40,979
Don't lie.

635
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:42,639
Why are you lying?

636
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,308
(She looks like someone who got caught lying.)

637
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,149
(Blinking)

638
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:47,519
(He looks at her sweetly because she's so cute.)

639
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,418
- Why are you lying?
- My goodness.

640
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:51,319
- Let's play the Word Chain Game.
- The Word Chain Game?

641
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:52,689
Sure.

642
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,359
Go first.

643
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:56,088
Shall I go first?

644
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:57,159
(Confident)

645
00:22:57,189 --> 00:22:58,359
Can I give a name?

646
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,358
- No!
- No names?

647
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,629
(No names are allowed.)

648
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:03,669
Can it be a two-syllable word? Apple.

649
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,939
Gwa? Fruit.

650
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:09,809
Journal.

651
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:11,908
- What?
- Journal.

652
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:13,579
Gi? Giraffe.

653
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,979
(Lin?)

654
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,009
Something we put in our hair.

655
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,679
That's oil.

656
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,188
- It starts with "Lin."
- "Lin?"

657
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,689
- Conditioner.
- Conditioner.

658
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:26,958
- Were you giving me a hint?
- Yes.

659
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:28,219
I see.

660
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:30,188
- Were you giving me a hint?
- Yes.

661
00:23:30,189 --> 00:23:31,289
I see.

662
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:33,598
(Laughing)

663
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,259
She gave you a hint so that you wouldn't get it wrong.

664
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,568
Uncle, you need to think.

665
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:41,169
What? You didn't give me time to think.

666
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:42,469
Come on.

667
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,738
(This uncle isn't an easy target.)

668
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:45,938
I'll start with S.

669
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:47,309
Switzerland.

670
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,139
Switzerland?

671
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:51,978
- Mom, look.
- Ski.

672
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:53,108
I'm listening, Tae Ri.

673
00:23:53,109 --> 00:23:55,279
- Ki. Kiwi.
- Ki.

674
00:23:55,419 --> 00:23:56,449
Kiwi?

675
00:23:57,719 --> 00:23:59,089
Wi? Consolation.

676
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:01,789
Ro.

677
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,589
("Ro" is a hard one.)

678
00:24:03,629 --> 00:24:05,559
Ro... Rose.

679
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:07,559
Rose? That's a name.

680
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,199
- Does a name work?
- Ro...

681
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,799
Ro.

682
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,499
Rose isn't a name.

683
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:15,769
What is it then?

684
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,739
Are you going to be...

685
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,338
(Are you going to be so difficult?)

686
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:20,978
Isn't Rose the name of a singer?

687
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:22,078
No, it isn't.

688
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,478
- It's something else.
- Isn't it Rose of BLACKPINK?

689
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:24,708
- No.
- Then what?

690
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:25,908
Are you talking about rose Champagne?

691
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:29,119
You can't be talking about rose Champagne.

692
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,019
- No.
- How would you know that?

693
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:34,688
I'll say it's rose Champagne.

694
00:24:34,689 --> 00:24:35,818
Will you say it's rose Champagne?

695
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,358
What's going on? For goodness' sake.

696
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,389
(An 8-year-old who knows what Champagne is)

697
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:40,659
Se.

698
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:42,559
After Rose comes Jennie.

699
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:44,599
BLACKPINK members.

700
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:46,468
(Uncle, you're too much.)

701
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:48,468
Will you say Jennie doesn't work when Rose does?

702
00:24:48,469 --> 00:24:49,939
Don't show favoritism.

703
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:51,469
It isn't like that.

704
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,909
Mom, I won't play the Word Chain Game with Uncle.

705
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,239
Did you lose to his way of words?

706
00:24:56,309 --> 00:24:58,408
Mom, I won't play the Word Chain Game with Uncle.

707
00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:00,719
Did you lose to his way of words?

708
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,418
It isn't like that. I just want to play with you.

709
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,749
You're embarrassed.

710
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:07,158
Uncle didn't go easy on you.

711
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:08,189
(Her feelings are hurt.)

712
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:11,558
When we played the Word Chain Game,

713
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:13,558
he should've let me off once.

714
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,529
- But he didn't do that.
- Did it upset you?

715
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:17,799
Yes, it upset me.

716
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,168
It upset you.

717
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:20,499
(Sullen)

718
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,338
Play the Baskin-Robbins 31.

719
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:23,468
(She challenges Uncle to a different game.)

720
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:24,469
Which game shall we play?

721
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,808
Baskin-Robbins 31.

722
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:26,879
How do you play it?

723
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,808
You can say 1, 2, 3...

724
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,978
or 1, 2 or 1.

725
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:32,208
Okay. Three at most.

726
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,949
- Then we go up to 31.
- I see.

727
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:37,148
Okay. Set, go.

728
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:40,519
- Baskin-Robbins 31 - Baskin-Robbins 31

729
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,459
Shall I begin? One, two, three.

730
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:44,859
Four, five.

731
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:46,229
Six, seven, eight.

732
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:47,629
Nine.

733
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:49,358
Ten, eleven, twelve.

734
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:50,899
Why do you keep saying three numbers?

735
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,399
Can't I say three numbers?

736
00:25:52,729 --> 00:25:54,038
You told me that I could.

737
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:55,099
Thirteen.

738
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:56,809
Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

739
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:58,909
Twenty-three.

740
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:00,809
Twenty-four.

741
00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:02,039
Twenty-five.

742
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,409
Twenty-six.

743
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:05,149
Twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

744
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:10,589
(The person who says the last number, 31, will lose.)

745
00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:12,719
Twenty-nine, thirty.

746
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:15,659
Twenty-nine, thirty.

747
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,959
Thirty-one.

748
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:19,828
(Sad)

749
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:20,999
Then...

750
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:23,768
Tae Ri lost.

751
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:25,968
(He stays true to his instinct.)

752
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:27,569
But he didn't do that.

753
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,399
Tae Ri, do the calculations.

754
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:32,509
I want to stop.

755
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:36,709
(Her feelings are hurt for the 2nd time.)

756
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,319
Did I win?

757
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,149
- You won three times.
- Really?

758
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,989
You need to do that for children.

759
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:48,888
- You raise them to be tough.
- Okay?

760
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:52,929
She attends a tough school.

761
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:56,498
- Uncle.
- Yes?

762
00:26:56,499 --> 00:26:57,699
Let's sing the school song together.

763
00:26:58,229 --> 00:26:59,329
How does it begin?

764
00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:01,238
- Sing the beginning.
- Teach me the beginning.

765
00:27:01,239 --> 00:27:02,998
- Okay.
- "Virgin Mary's star."

766
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,138
(He goes through the 40-year-old memories.)

767
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:08,279
Virgin Mary's star, the morning star

768
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:12,678
Virgin Mary's star, the morning star

769
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:13,919
How do you remember that?

770
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,049
It gives off holy lights Are those the lyrics?

771
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:20,488
(Yes.)

772
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:21,559
He remembers.

773
00:27:21,989 --> 00:27:23,388
Seo Jin, your memory is no joke.

774
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:24,628
I don't remember at all.

775
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:25,788
(He's too perfect.)

776
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:27,099
What comes before that line?

777
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,098
The true wisdom

778
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,168
It shines on our school

779
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:33,328
That's all I know.

780
00:27:33,329 --> 00:27:34,999
The true wisdom

781
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:37,769
Hold on. What was it? Gyeseong...

782
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:40,579
I forgot the lyrics!

783
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:42,209
You're confused, right?

784
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,449
If you're confused, think about how confused I must be.

785
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:48,978
(They overcame half a century to sing the school song together.)

786
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:50,688
I brought back cookie sticks.

787
00:27:50,689 --> 00:27:52,418
- Uncle is back.
- Thank you.

788
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:53,588
All right.

789
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,888
Oreo cookie sticks.

790
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,888
- Thank you.
- Uncle, thank you.

791
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:58,029
(He paid back for the restroom trip with Tae Ri's favorite snacks.)

792
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,028
- Uncle is the best. Thank you.
- Okay.

793
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,799
(She enjoys a sweet treat to ease the bitter defeat.)

794
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:05,599
(Satisfied)

795
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:08,238
We need to pick up my second child.

796
00:28:08,239 --> 00:28:09,239
At what time?

797
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,469
We can pick up my second child from 2:20pm.

798
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:14,779
Ji Hye, seriously.

799
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,079
You live so diligently.

800
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,909
Seo Jin, I split up five minutes in my life.

801
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:22,748
- Seriously.
- You pick up children,

802
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,788
appear on shows,

803
00:28:24,789 --> 00:28:26,018
and film YouTube videos.

804
00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:28,019
(So much respect for the working mom)

805
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:30,558
What was that?

806
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,789
(There's a reason why Ji Hye feels energized.)

807
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:34,559
Mom, your lips smell like...

808
00:28:36,129 --> 00:28:37,369
flowers.

809
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:42,639
This one smells like a peach.

810
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:46,038
(She fills her mother with energy.)

811
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:48,379
- This one smells like a tangerine.
- Does it?

812
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:52,648
- You smell like fresh fruits.
- Do I?

813
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:53,819
My cutie pie.

814
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,419
- Well... Let's go.
- Mom, wait for me.

815
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:58,249
Let's go together.

816
00:28:59,349 --> 00:29:00,619
Let's go.

817
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:03,159
Let's go, Tae Ri. Get in the car.

818
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:05,528
- Did you set up a car seat?
- Sorry?

819
00:29:05,529 --> 00:29:06,859
- A car seat.
- It's the one we set up earlier.

820
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,658
- We need another one for Ellie.
- Is there a problem?

821
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,099
- We need to change the car seat.
- There's another one in the back.

822
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:13,768
We can't let Ellie sit by herself in the back.

823
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:14,938
- Should we change the seat?
- Yes.

824
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:16,068
- Should we change the position?
- Then...

825
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:18,208
- Move Ellie's car seat here.
- Right.

826
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:20,068
And I'll sit in the front passenger seat,

827
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:22,378
and Kwang Kyu will be in the back. I think we should do that.

828
00:29:22,379 --> 00:29:24,379
- We should move this one?
- Yes, take it off.

829
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,748
There's ISOFIX under the baby car seat.

830
00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:29,679
Grab the clips with both hands and pull it out.

831
00:29:29,779 --> 00:29:31,318
- They're under the car seat.
- Under the car seat?

832
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:32,389
Yes, under it.

833
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:34,859
- Where?
- Right here.

834
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:36,888
- Look under the car seat.
- Oh, here.

835
00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:38,429
Pull the connectors...

836
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:40,299
while pushing the buttons.

837
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,929
- Pushing the buttons?
- Yes. Pull them.

838
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:44,798
Does it come out?

839
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,328
(He looks like a father who tries hard for his daughter.)

840
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:48,199
- Oh, you mean this?
- Can you see it?

841
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:49,538
Yes, that's it.

842
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,839
There you go. Both sides. Push the buttons and...

843
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,339
Yes, that's how you take it off.

844
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:56,509
Now, move it to the middle seat.

845
00:29:56,779 --> 00:29:58,249
Once they fit in, you can just push the car seat.

846
00:29:58,509 --> 00:29:59,778
- There you go. Is it done?
- It's done, right?

847
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:01,118
Okay. You did a good job.

848
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,278
You're good at this.

849
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,448
Let's get going.

850
00:30:03,449 --> 00:30:04,618
- Now...
- Okay.

851
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,889
- Should I sit in the front or back?
- Me?

852
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:08,618
What should we do?

853
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:11,089
(Then where should I sit?)

854
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:12,488
- Kwang Kyu, you...
- Me?

855
00:30:12,489 --> 00:30:13,998
- You should sit in the back.
- Should I sit in the back?

856
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,259
- Me?
- Yes.

857
00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:17,229
I should sit here?

858
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:19,729
- Oh, boy. What should we do?
- For now...

859
00:30:19,869 --> 00:30:21,368
(There's space that's only enough for a shopping bag.)

860
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:22,539
It's tight.

861
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,768
(For My Star's family,)

862
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:26,978
Dear me.

863
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:31,779
(Kwang Kyu squishes himself into the back seat.)

864
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:34,449
Pull it to your right side.

865
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:38,588
(Kwang Kyu is not visible from here.)

866
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:41,159
- Shall I come to help you?
- No, that's okay.

867
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,388
Goodness. I'm tired.

868
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:45,589
(Grumpy Secretary Baby seems unusually pitiful today.)

869
00:30:46,189 --> 00:30:47,428
Let's go.

870
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,798
(They set off to pick Ellie up,)

871
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,128
(the 2nd major contributor to reaching 1 million subscribers.)

872
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:51,368
- Oh, dear. Gosh.
- That's right.

873
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:53,128
(Oh, dear. Gosh.)

874
00:30:53,129 --> 00:30:55,369
- Gosh. Can't you drive nicely?
- Tae Ri...

875
00:30:56,069 --> 00:30:57,269
- What's wrong?
- Oh, no.

876
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:59,469
(Uncle Kwang Kyu, are you okay?)

877
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:00,979
There's no handle...

878
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:02,939
- in the back seat.
- It's uncomfortable in the back.

879
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,949
Exactly. He was so unlucky.

880
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:08,079
I volunteered to drive for Kwang Kyu.

881
00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:11,888
But he ended up being squished in the back seat.

882
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:13,418
I don't know why...

883
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:15,519
things like that always happen to him.

884
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:17,588
- Should we go this way?
- Correct.

885
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,358
Go straight and then turn right.

886
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,129
(They arrive at Ellie's daycare center with Kwang Kyu in the back.)

887
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:23,029
Mom, I'll go in.

888
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,368
- You will? You can come with me.
- Will you pick up your sister?

889
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:27,798
- Will you go by yourself?
- Yes.

890
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,839
Okay.

891
00:31:28,969 --> 00:31:31,408
Tae Ri, get out of the car and bring Ellie here.

892
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:33,268
(The 8-year-old oldest daughter goes to pick up her little sister.)

893
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:34,539
- Open the door, please.
- Okay.

894
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:36,508
- Is it open now?
- No.

895
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:39,108
I'm sorry. I can't open it for you.

896
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:40,949
(I'm sorry. I can't open it for you.)

897
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,078
Wait just for a moment.

898
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,189
(Tae Ri, I'll open it for you.)

899
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:49,858
See you in a bit.

900
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:51,488
(I'll go and pick up Ellie.)

901
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:53,558
(We prepared Ellie's seat.)

902
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,499
- Done.
- Okay.

903
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:57,398
Uncle Seo Jin, I can go by myself.

904
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:58,998
- If you go in... I really...
- Got it.

905
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,129
I won't go in.

906
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:01,638
I'll be waiting outside.

907
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:02,899
(I'll be waiting for you.)

908
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:05,269
It's open.

909
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,639
Hello.

910
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:11,678
(The man who's excited to meet Ellie)

911
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,779
Ellie.

912
00:32:13,149 --> 00:32:14,319
I...

913
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:16,248
- My niece's name is Ellie too.
- Right.

914
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:18,319
It was a surprising coincidence.

915
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:20,418
I was surprised to hear that her name was also Ellie.

916
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:23,589
(The fool who thinks of nothing but Ellie)

917
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:30,669
(He seems more excited than he was when he met My Star.)

918
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:34,398
- Is Kwang Kyu sleeping?
- Sorry?

919
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,769
Is Kwang Kyu sleeping?

920
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:37,609
- What?
- Is he sleeping?

921
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:39,308
Is my manager sleeping?

922
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:41,678
He's just stuck in his seat.

923
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,009
- He's sleeping.
- He can't...

924
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:45,548
Ellie!

925
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,548
- Oh, my. Hi.
- Ellie.

926
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,218
(My Star's second daughter, Moon Ellie)

927
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,549
Ellie. Come, Ellie.

928
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,588
(As soon as he sees Ellie, he smiles with dimples.)

929
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:56,789
Ellie, say hello to Uncle Seo Jin.

930
00:32:57,529 --> 00:32:59,659
(Toddling)

931
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:01,328
(I'll help you.)

932
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:02,499
Are you shy?

933
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:04,628
Say hi to Uncle Seo Jin.

934
00:33:04,629 --> 00:33:05,629
Are you shy?

935
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,828
(He finds Ellie cute.)

936
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:08,198
Say hi to Uncle Seo Jin.

937
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,368
- Hello.
- Hello. Bye, Ellie.

938
00:33:10,369 --> 00:33:11,908
Ellie, say goodbye to her.

939
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:13,368
Say goodbye to your teacher.

940
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:15,939
- Goodbye.
- Bye, Tae Ri.

941
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,549
Ellie, say hello to Uncle Seo Jin.

942
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,708
- Ellie, say hello to him.
- What are you eating?

943
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:20,849
A chewing gum.

944
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,418
- Ellie, say hello to Uncle Seo Jin.
- I want to eat it too.

945
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,719
- But there's just one flavor.
- You want it too? Right.

946
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:27,488
She can have it.

947
00:33:27,489 --> 00:33:29,418
- She can't go through to her seat.
- Come here.

948
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,288
- Ellie, go to the other side.
- Mom, here's Ellie's bag.

949
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:32,929
- Get in on the other side. Yes.
- On the other side?

950
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:34,959
Put her bag down here.

951
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:40,599
(Behaving well)

952
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,238
You can sit here.

953
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,839
(You can sit here.)

954
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:47,638
- Ellie, put your seatbelt on.
- There you go.

955
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:48,679
(The sweet voice only for Ellie)

956
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:54,048
- I'll do it by myself.
- You'll do it by yourself?

957
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,279
(- I'll do it by myself.
- You'll do it by yourself?)

958
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:58,219
- Do you have a daughter?
- Sorry?

959
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:00,049
I don't have a daughter.

960
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,359
(Glancing)

961
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:04,128
- They don't have a child, Tae Ri.
- It would've been nice.

962
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,558
(It's hard to read Ellie's face.)

963
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,198
(How is she feeling?)

964
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,898
How did you feel when you first met them?

965
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:13,229
He looked handsome.

966
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,609
(Ellie liked Uncle Seo Jin too.)

967
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,878
Hi. You're doing it by yourself?

968
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,239
I see that she's stubborn.

969
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:23,979
- She does it on her own.
- I've been chewing it for too long.

970
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:26,509
Can you put it in there?

971
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:29,448
- That's good.
- Nice work.

972
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,248
Ellie, make sure to place it across the middle of your chest.

973
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:32,718
(He feels proud of her.)

974
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,018
Sit straight. Or else, you might get hurt.

975
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:35,788
I want to eat chewing gum too.

976
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:37,758
I'll give you one. Sit straight.

977
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,389
(The handsome uncle takes good care of her to the end.)

978
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:42,529
(Mom is proud of her daughters.)

979
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,768
Children at her age are the cutest, Seo Jin.

980
00:34:44,769 --> 00:34:46,129
- I know.
- They're the cutest at that age.

981
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,039
- They're the cutest at that age.
- They're so adorable.

982
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:50,238
They become so much cuter after they start talking.

983
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,408
Mom, are we going to a kids' cafe?

984
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,579
Yes, we're going to a kids' cafe.

985
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:57,078
I recently reached one million subscribers.

986
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:00,548
I invited a few mothers. We'll make a YouTube video together.

987
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:02,049
(3:30pm, kids' cafe, Filming a YouTube video)

988
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,419
Tae Ri.

989
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:05,049
Can you sing a song for me?

990
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:07,758
(Sing a song?)

991
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:11,029
(Tae Ri's jukebox starts playing.)

992
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:14,998
(She chose "Golden," the most popular song among kids.)

993
00:35:14,999 --> 00:35:16,158
Is Ellie singing too?

994
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,329
(Ellie: Chorus)

995
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:26,009
(She suddenly starts singing as the main vocalist?)

996
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,779
I won't sing.

997
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:31,949
(Sulky)

998
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,618
(Ellie continues singing solo without knowing how Tae Ri feels.)

999
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:40,389
(Ellie continues singing solo without knowing how Tae Ri feels.)

1000
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:43,589
(Everyone exclaims.)

1001
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:46,158
(Upset)

1002
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:48,128
- Next...
- Mom, I'll sing this time.

1003
00:35:48,129 --> 00:35:49,559
Ellie, don't sing.

1004
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:51,798
I'm not...

1005
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,329
I'm not going to eat anymore.

1006
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,899
I'll sing this time, so don't sing along, okay?

1007
00:35:55,969 --> 00:35:58,009
I didn't sing when you were singing.

1008
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,208
Okay?

1009
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:00,309
(Okay?)

1010
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,008
I'll sing.

1011
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,309
Ellie, do you want to sing again?

1012
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:05,178
You can't sing it.

1013
00:36:05,179 --> 00:36:06,779
You don't even understand English.

1014
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:10,479
(Nervous)

1015
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:12,849
(Ellie sings first.)

1016
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:21,858
(She finishes her performance hastily.)

1017
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:22,928
Now you can sing, Tae Ri.

1018
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:24,468
- Ellie, are you done?
- Yes.

1019
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:26,368
Okay. Wait quietly while Tae Ri sings, okay?

1020
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,499
- No, I'm not done yet.
- When will you be done?

1021
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,069
(Ellie's cheery energy doesn't go away.)

1022
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,609
(Stop singing already, will you?)

1023
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:42,448
I'm done now.

1024
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:44,488
Okay. Let Tae Ri sing now, okay?

1025
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:46,018
Let's be quiet and hear her sing.

1026
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:47,049
Ready, go.

1027
00:36:49,659 --> 00:36:51,759
(Singing)

1028
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,228
(Frustrated)

1029
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:55,959
Mom, I won't sing. I'm serious.

1030
00:36:56,699 --> 00:36:58,028
All right. Stop, you two.

1031
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:00,099
I will never play with you again, Ellie.

1032
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:02,899
Uncle Seo Jin, don't ever have a baby.

1033
00:37:02,939 --> 00:37:04,309
I shouldn't have a baby?

1034
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:06,269
Look how stressful it is.

1035
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:08,639
Oh, is it?

1036
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,209
Is it so stressful?

1037
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:12,448
Stop fighting, you guys. We're almost there.

1038
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,949
It's right there. We're almost there.

1039
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:16,018
We're almost there. Look.

1040
00:37:16,019 --> 00:37:17,988
It's so stressful for me to be with Ellie.

1041
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:19,819
You guys played together just fine. Don't be like that.

1042
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,989
Let's go.

1043
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:23,559
Mom, I'll put the bag here.

1044
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:25,888
- Let's see if Yeong Seo is here.
- Take off your seatbelt.

1045
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:27,189
Let's go.

1046
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:29,299
You look gorgeous.

1047
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:32,699
(Ellie can do it by herself.)

1048
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,468
- Ellie.
- Ellie, get out on this side.

1049
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:36,799
Ellie, get out on this side.

1050
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,008
- She's going to her mom.
- What?

1051
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,438
(Ellie gets out of the car safely.)

1052
00:37:40,439 --> 00:37:42,138
They fought again. They both wanted to sing.

1053
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:43,208
Come and get out of the car.

1054
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:44,909
- There you go.
- Kwang Kyu, can you come out?

1055
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:46,449
I'll try.

1056
00:37:47,779 --> 00:37:49,279
- Will you come through the trunk?
- No.

1057
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:53,148
- On which side will you come out?
- We won't... This side.

1058
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,059
- We won't need the bag, right?
- You can leave it there.

1059
00:37:55,419 --> 00:37:59,389
(Struggling)

1060
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:01,499
(Grunting)

1061
00:38:02,859 --> 00:38:05,669
(Everyone got out of the car including the last baby.)

1062
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:07,939
(Sighing)

1063
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:09,299
Sitting in the back seat was hard.

1064
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:11,408
Let's go.

1065
00:38:11,409 --> 00:38:12,938
Hold Uncle Kwang Kyu's hand. It's dangerous.

1066
00:38:12,939 --> 00:38:14,238
Slow down. Don't run.

1067
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,709
- You might fall down.
- Okay. Let's go.

1068
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:19,109
(Bouncing)

1069
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:21,378
Ellie, hold my hand. Hold my hand tightly.

1070
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,919
(The kids are excited to be at a kids' cafe.)

1071
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:26,789
There you go.

1072
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,359
(Ellie enters first.)

1073
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:31,658
- Take off your jacket. Oh, my.
- Ji Hye.

1074
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:33,159
Oh, my. Hyun Yi. My goodness.

1075
00:38:33,629 --> 00:38:35,729
- Ji Hye.
- Oh, my. Hyun Yi. My goodness.

1076
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:37,528
This is Lee Hyun Yi.

1077
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:38,829
- Oh, my.
- This is Lee Hyun Yi.

1078
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,668
Hello.

1079
00:38:40,669 --> 00:38:42,068
- Hi.
- Hello. Yes, hello.

1080
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,499
(My Star, Model Lee Hyun Yi)

1081
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:45,208
- Hello. Yes, hello.
- Hello.

1082
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:47,068
(Finally, they meet everyone of Mommies.)

1083
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:48,139
Hello.

1084
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:50,278
- Hello.
- Hello.

1085
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:52,249
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Hello.

1086
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:54,218
(My Star, Comedienne Lee Eun Hyeong)

1087
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:56,818
- Oh, hello.
- Eun Hyeong.

1088
00:38:56,819 --> 00:38:58,448
- Am I overly dressed?
- You look gorgeous.

1089
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,588
- Hi, Hyeon Jo. Hyeon Jo is here.
- Hyeon Jo.

1090
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:01,819
(Toddling)

1091
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:03,619
Oh, my.

1092
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,989
(Walking forward quickly)

1093
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:10,529
Hyeon Jo, he's not your dad.

1094
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:12,698
(He turns around and walks away.)

1095
00:39:12,699 --> 00:39:15,068
- A boy or a girl?
- He's a boy.

1096
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:16,138
- A boy?
- Yes.

1097
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:17,198
(He's cute.)

1098
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,408
My goodness.

1099
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:20,368
Hyeon Jo, come here.

1100
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:21,708
How about we go over there?

1101
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:24,079
(Let me tell you something about My Baby Hyeon Jo.)

1102
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:27,479
(Kang Hyeon Jo, 16 months old, Eun Hyeong's son)

1103
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:30,818
Oh, my. Hyeon Jo, you have a pot belly too.

1104
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:32,718
(Plump)

1105
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:33,719
Hyeon Jo.

1106
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:39,029
(He has a 3-head, plump body that is so adorable.)

1107
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:42,358
- Does he look like me?
- Sorry?

1108
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:43,599
He looks a lot like his dad.

1109
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:46,898
I love you.

1110
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:48,068
(Comedian Kang Jae Jun, Eun Hyeong's husband, Hyeon Jo's dad)

1111
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:49,598
What is it? Can you hear your mom's voice?

1112
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,538
(He's a carbon copy of his dad.)

1113
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:54,539
(His dad will come after his work is done.)

1114
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,809
(I tagged along with my mom to her shoot.)

1115
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:01,878
Hyeon Jo, look who's here. Yeong Seo is here.

1116
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,678
- Yeong Seo is here.
- Yeong Seo, did you say hi?

1117
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:05,748
Say hello to Tae Ri's mom and the uncles here.

1118
00:40:05,749 --> 00:40:07,288
Hello.

1119
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,058
- Hello.
- A boy?

1120
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:11,258
- Yes, he's a boy.
- She has two sons.

1121
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:12,559
- She has two sons?
- Yes.

1122
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:15,828
(Hong Yeong Seo, 7 years old, Hyun Yi's 2nd son)

1123
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:18,369
- He looks just like you.
- He takes after me, right?

1124
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:20,839
You're handsome.

1125
00:40:21,569 --> 00:40:23,468
- Shall we start right now?
- Yes.

1126
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:25,068
Please come here, Hyeon Jo's family.

1127
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:26,069
(Yeong Seo inherited his mom's model gene.)

1128
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,978
- She has two sons.
- She has two sons?

1129
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:29,379
Yes, and Ji Hye has two daughters.

1130
00:40:30,139 --> 00:40:31,579
- Eun Hyeong has one son.
- I see.

1131
00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:34,778
- Mom.
- Mom.

1132
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:36,048
(His eyes are fixed on the children.)

1133
00:40:36,049 --> 00:40:37,819
Ellie, let me try it just once.

1134
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:41,019
Goodness. She never listens to me.

1135
00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:45,029
- How far are you going?
- I'll ride this one.

1136
00:40:45,189 --> 00:40:46,588
- I'll ride this one.
- How far are you going?

1137
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:47,598
(A shoot with children is always unpredictable.)

1138
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,799
Why is this so small?

1139
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:51,528
I'm so out of it. Let me put this down first.

1140
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:53,199
- Shall we start the shoot now?
- Okay.

1141
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:55,169
Let's begin.

1142
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,238
(Mom is sweaty too.)

1143
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:59,768
Let's do the opening while the kids are together.

1144
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:00,878
Shall we do it without them?

1145
00:41:00,879 --> 00:41:01,979
- Okay.
- Shall we?

1146
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:04,408
(She prepares to work her main job.)

1147
00:41:04,409 --> 00:41:05,449
(Mom)

1148
00:41:06,979 --> 00:41:09,448
- Goodness.
- Mom, let's go in there...

1149
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:11,448
- I don't remember my lines at all.
- Let's go in there together.

1150
00:41:11,449 --> 00:41:13,988
Mom, shall we go in there together?

1151
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:16,188
Play without me. I'll join you in a bit after shooting the video.

1152
00:41:16,189 --> 00:41:17,859
You can be brave and play alone, right?

1153
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:20,029
Be brave. That's good.

1154
00:41:21,129 --> 00:41:22,998
Hello, everyone. Thank you for coming to my channel.

1155
00:41:22,999 --> 00:41:25,029
There's a reason why I dressed up.

1156
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:28,768
(She starts the shoot naturally.)

1157
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:32,108
We reached a million subscribers recently. Thank you so much.

1158
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:33,308
("Gwanjong Un-ni," 1 million subscribers)

1159
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:34,708
Reaching a million subscribers...

1160
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,078
- is not what matters most.
- Tae Ri.

1161
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,579
- Every week, we work hard...
- Tae Ri.

1162
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:39,648
- Our voices are overlapping.
- Mom.

1163
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:40,649
- Our voices are overlapping.
- Mom.

1164
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:42,348
- What matters is...
- Let's play together.

1165
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:44,078
to get high views every week.

1166
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,049
- I want you to know the importance.
- Let's go in there together.

1167
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,188
(The professional YouTuber continues the shoot despite her interference.)

1168
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:52,058
We won't be arrogant because we have a million subscribers.

1169
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:54,189
We always do our best with a beginner's mindset.

1170
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:56,798
But reaching a million subscribers is something to celebrate.

1171
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:58,868
- Did they start the shoot already?
- I think so.

1172
00:41:58,869 --> 00:41:59,899
She's amazing.

1173
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:04,309
(He's amazed by My Star who's a seasoned working mom.)

1174
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:06,768
(My Star is a pro at both her work and parenting.)

1175
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:11,508
- To celebrate... We still...
- Mom, I'll take off my socks.

1176
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:12,778
Okay. You can take off your socks.

1177
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:15,218
It's a meaningful achievement that we should celebrate.

1178
00:42:15,219 --> 00:42:17,248
- And especially...
- I want to take off my socks.

1179
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:19,418
All right. Take them off. Okay.

1180
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:22,318
Until we reached a million subscribers...

1181
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:23,958
She's holding the sock while speaking.

1182
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,129
(Ji Hye doesn't stop speaking even while taking off her socks.)

1183
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:28,099
We haven't even started, but I'm already mentally tired.

1184
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:29,459
Right?

1185
00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:31,629
- We should do three things now.
- I'm already tired.

1186
00:42:33,629 --> 00:42:36,138
You're such a good boy. You're so good.

1187
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,339
He's adjusting well.

1188
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:39,238
You're such a good boy.

1189
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,539
Over two million...

1190
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:45,978
Many people contributed to reaching a million subscribers.

1191
00:42:45,979 --> 00:42:49,048
Like Ms. Lee Hyun Yi, who appeared in the Mom Needs a Break segment.

1192
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:52,588
The videos she appeared in got over two million views.

1193
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:55,188
Those videos made her a popular star.

1194
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:57,018
When I went to the bathroom to take a shower...

1195
00:42:57,019 --> 00:43:00,258
- I was standing to take a shower.
- When you take a shower...

1196
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:01,598
(Breast milk)

1197
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:02,758
(The moms' stories helped them get 1.69 million views.)

1198
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:04,929
- It's a true story.
- It sprayed out in the shower?

1199
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:06,798
- You haven't experienced that?
- No way.

1200
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:09,138
- I'm sure you pressed here.
- I didn't.

1201
00:43:09,139 --> 00:43:10,538
- It's a true story. They swelled...
- It sprayed out like this?

1202
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:12,409
- It's true. It came out like this.
- It must've just leaked.

1203
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:16,838
(I contributed a lot to reaching 1 million subscribers.)

1204
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:19,578
- Mom, come in here.
- I'm so out of it.

1205
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:22,819
- Mom needs a break. I invited...
- Mom, come in here.

1206
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,649
- Play without me for a while.
- Come in here.

1207
00:43:25,249 --> 00:43:27,388
I invited Ms. Lee Hyun Yi.

1208
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:30,758
As for Ms. Lee Eun Hyeong, she shared her everyday life...

1209
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:33,828
before, during her pregnancy, and after her childbirth.

1210
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:36,158
She revealed everything on my channel.

1211
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:38,228
She's one of the major contributors...

1212
00:43:38,229 --> 00:43:40,068
to reaching a million subscribers...

1213
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:41,069
(Mom, help me get out of here.)

1214
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,468
She's one of those...

1215
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:43,469
(Unexpected things keep happening so frequently.)

1216
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,108
- who played a major role...
- How cute.

1217
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:49,178
I wanted to let our children play...

1218
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:51,378
I invited our children as well...

1219
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,378
because Tae Ri and Ellie...

1220
00:43:53,379 --> 00:43:55,818
contributed a lot to my channel's success.

1221
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:59,188
Likewise, Yoon Seo and Yeong Seo helped Hyun Yi become more popular.

1222
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:01,988
Also, the reason why Eun Hyeong is so popular these days is...

1223
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:03,058
- Doesn't she owe it to Hyeon Jo?
- Hyeon Jo.

1224
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,888
That's why I asked them to bring their kids.

1225
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:07,859
I hope many people will watch this. Let's go.

1226
00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:10,328
She's having fun in there alone.

1227
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:12,428
- Ji Hye, you're so good at it.
- You're amazing.

1228
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:13,429
- How do you...
- Did I do okay?

1229
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:15,739
- Absolutely.
- You didn't make a single mistake.

1230
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:17,568
I'll get there first.

1231
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:18,769
(At that time, Uncle Kwang Kyu is playing with the children.)

1232
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:21,479
I'm going up on the trampoline.

1233
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:23,578
- What did you say?
- I'm going over there.

1234
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,678
(Hitting)

1235
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:27,818
(Counterattacking)

1236
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:29,149
(One more time)

1237
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:31,419
What did you say?

1238
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:34,089
I'm going to jump on the trampoline.

1239
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,759
- Are you leaving?
- I'll show you how I do a split.

1240
00:44:37,829 --> 00:44:40,288
Kwang Kyu... That's so funny.

1241
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:43,228
- The kids like Kwang Kyu a lot.
- Right.

1242
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:44,359
Why?

1243
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:46,828
- Let's hurry up and do the shoot.
- Exactly.

1244
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:48,438
- We'll finish the shoot quickly.
- I'll jump on the trampoline too.

1245
00:44:48,439 --> 00:44:50,699
Hyun Yi and Eun Hyeong, please come.

1246
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:52,868
Those two kids play well without their moms.

1247
00:44:52,869 --> 00:44:53,869
Right.

1248
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,108
Tae Ri, look after the other kids while I'm shooting the video.

1249
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:57,638
Oh, okay, Mom.

1250
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:58,749
Thank you.

1251
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,908
I can trust her with them, right?

1252
00:44:59,909 --> 00:45:02,319
- Let's go and do the shoot.
- Let's hurry up.

1253
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:04,789
Okay. We're good to go.

1254
00:45:05,419 --> 00:45:06,589
It's hard.

1255
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:09,658
It's not easy. This is why...

1256
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:10,858
- Exactly.
- the Mom Needs a Break segment...

1257
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,528
- is loved by many people.
- Oh, my. This is awesome.

1258
00:45:12,529 --> 00:45:13,588
I prepared this for you...

1259
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:15,158
- Really?
- with love.

1260
00:45:15,159 --> 00:45:16,558
- Hold on.
- My dear Hyun Yi and Eun Hyeong.

1261
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:18,328
We need an alcoholic drink to go with this. Oh, we have it.

1262
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:20,598
Of course. I know you want to get drunk.

1263
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:21,938
- Very much.
- Right?

1264
00:45:21,939 --> 00:45:24,538
I think I need four separate brains.

1265
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:26,438
- Every mom does.
- Right.

1266
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:28,308
I thought moms needed a break from time to time...

1267
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,739
and started the Mom Needs a Break segment.

1268
00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:32,978
Why do you...

1269
00:45:32,979 --> 00:45:34,818
Help me fly to the end of the world.

1270
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:37,948
(Tae Ri and Yeong Seo are having fun without their moms.)

1271
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:39,519
Those two kids play well without their moms.

1272
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,318
- Kids love to do it.
- Right.

1273
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:45,328
(The shoot is going smoothly.)

1274
00:45:45,329 --> 00:45:47,028
Mom. Tae Ri.

1275
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:48,899
Tae Ri.

1276
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,499
Tae Ri.

1277
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:53,098
- Twenty times for each, okay?
- Tae Ri.

1278
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:55,638
- Tae Ri.
- I'll push you 20 times too.

1279
00:45:55,639 --> 00:45:56,998
(Ellie wants to play with Tae Ri and Yeong Seo.)

1280
00:45:56,999 --> 00:45:59,909
Tae Ri.

1281
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:01,138
(She loves her sister so much that she asks only for her sister.)

1282
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,309
Push me 20 times, okay?

1283
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,679
(And Seo Jin looks only at Ellie.)

1284
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:07,878
I'll push you. I want to push you.

1285
00:46:07,879 --> 00:46:09,879
- Wait. You might get hurt.
- I'll do it.

1286
00:46:10,019 --> 00:46:12,249
(He stops her quickly.)

1287
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:14,718
- Okay. Four.
- Let's do it.

1288
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:15,758
(He stopped Ellie quickly so that she wouldn't fall down.)

1289
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:18,088
- Five.
- That's twenty.

1290
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:19,188
Are you done with the swing?

1291
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:20,189
(Skillful)

1292
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:21,698
Stop. Okay?

1293
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:24,459
I'll do it. I'll go on the swing.

1294
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:26,528
- Ellie, you don't mind me...
- She wants...

1295
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:28,538
- pushing you hard, right?
- to play on the swing.

1296
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:31,338
- I do.
- Don't. Push her gently.

1297
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:33,208
Ellie is younger than you, so push her gently.

1298
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:34,938
- Should I push her gently?
- Yes.

1299
00:46:34,939 --> 00:46:36,078
Gently.

1300
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:38,578
Here we go. Yeong Seo, keep holding it.

1301
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:40,249
- You're strong.
- Okay.

1302
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:41,418
It's fun, right?

1303
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:43,148
(Giggling)

1304
00:46:43,149 --> 00:46:44,318
She's laughing hard.

1305
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,588
(Ellie's smile makes his dimples deeper.)

1306
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:47,819
No, that's not it. Do it like this.

1307
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:51,229
- Ellie, your time is up.
- Help me get off the swing.

1308
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:53,758
Over there. I'll go first.

1309
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:55,428
- I'll go there too.
- I'll go first.

1310
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:56,959
- Hey, stop.
- I want to go there too.

1311
00:46:57,699 --> 00:46:59,168
I'll go there too.

1312
00:46:59,169 --> 00:47:01,439
Tae Ri, don't leave me alone here.

1313
00:47:01,939 --> 00:47:04,839
I can't keep up with you. Hold my hand.

1314
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:08,139
Ellie, catch up.

1315
00:47:09,139 --> 00:47:11,378
- Tae Ri went that way.
- Give me your hand.

1316
00:47:11,379 --> 00:47:12,809
She'll come out over there.

1317
00:47:13,279 --> 00:47:15,018
Let's go this way.

1318
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:16,648
Come on. Let's go this way.

1319
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:17,649
(I'll take you there.)

1320
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:20,888
I want to go there with Tae Ri.

1321
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:23,688
You can't go that way by yourself.

1322
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:25,188
(Let's go to your sister together.)

1323
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:27,089
Let's go to your sister, okay?

1324
00:47:29,459 --> 00:47:33,799
(She's held in his arms.)

1325
00:47:33,869 --> 00:47:36,869
She's so cute. She's plump and everything.

1326
00:47:37,239 --> 00:47:39,809
Watching the kids play made me happy.

1327
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:43,278
Some may think I hate it, but I like watching kids play.

1328
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:45,779
I believe that kids should have fun, running around.

1329
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:48,748
On top of that, there was one I adored.

1330
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:49,879
I like things like that.

1331
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:53,019
Your sister is over there.

1332
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:56,959
(Ellie starts to hold Uncle Seo Jin's hand.)

1333
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:02,028
Grab it. Come on.

1334
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:03,199
(He lifts Ellie up whenever she wants.)

1335
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:04,599
- Do you want to ride it, Ellie?
- Yes.

1336
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,909
(They got glued together.)

1337
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:15,879
(Sucking)

1338
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:18,379
Thank you.

1339
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:22,479
(The date with Ellie is successful.)

1340
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:24,889
To be honest, I was surprised.

1341
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:26,848
- His eyes were full of affection.
- Right.

1342
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:28,318
- Looking at someone else's child...
- Right.

1343
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,388
Not many people are like him.

1344
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:32,258
He adored her so much and took good care of her.

1345
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:35,028
- Honestly, I was so happy.
- I see.

1346
00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:36,958
- You look much younger now.
- Kids around her age...

1347
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:38,798
- Do I look okay? Do you like it?
- You look way better now.

1348
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,128
I see that you've recovered a lot.

1349
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:41,468
- I saw her right after the surgery.
- Right. You saw me...

1350
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:42,898
- right after.
- I saw her right after.

1351
00:48:42,899 --> 00:48:44,398
She was very shocked. I was like this.

1352
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:46,469
Jae Jun saw her and said,

1353
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:49,179
"Did Ji Hye eat very spicy food?"

1354
00:48:51,109 --> 00:48:52,578
He said, "So spicy!"

1355
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:54,818
It requires time.

1356
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:56,278
You look much better after doing it.

1357
00:48:56,279 --> 00:48:57,478
- It needs like...
- It's...

1358
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:58,648
- two months.
- It's so different.

1359
00:48:58,649 --> 00:49:00,089
Is that Hyeon Jo?

1360
00:49:00,749 --> 00:49:01,759
(Crying)

1361
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:05,289
(The shooting pauses.)

1362
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:06,988
(Someone's crying fills the cafe.)

1363
00:49:06,989 --> 00:49:08,228
No.

1364
00:49:08,229 --> 00:49:09,499
Did you make him cry?

1365
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:12,269
- Did you make him cry?
- He couldn't see his mom.

1366
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:14,628
Did you make him cry?

1367
00:49:14,629 --> 00:49:16,369
(Running)

1368
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,908
(Hyeon Jo is wailing.)

1369
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,968
- He couldn't see his mom.
- What is it?

1370
00:49:20,969 --> 00:49:22,878
- He cried because he missed you.
- Did he play well?

1371
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:24,848
- He was playing well.
- Is that so?

1372
00:49:24,849 --> 00:49:27,108
I gave him a mandarin because he wanted some.

1373
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:28,448
Hold on.

1374
00:49:28,449 --> 00:49:30,519
Did he hit you?

1375
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:32,618
(What happened between Kwang Kyu and Hyeon Jo?)

1376
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:35,059
No? He really likes mandarins.

1377
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,559
(15 minutes before the incident)

1378
00:49:37,919 --> 00:49:38,988
(Kwang Kyu is taking close care of Hyeon Jo.)

1379
00:49:38,989 --> 00:49:40,459
Tiger?

1380
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:41,729
Yes. It's a tiger.

1381
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:43,558
Right? Tiger.

1382
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:44,729
What is this?

1383
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,499
What is it? An elephant.

1384
00:49:48,399 --> 00:49:50,638
An elephant.

1385
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:53,068
Hyeon Jo also has a big belly.

1386
00:49:53,069 --> 00:49:54,239
(Standing up)

1387
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:57,879
Hyeon Jo? It's not over.

1388
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:00,348
(He moves to find something else to play with.)

1389
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:02,248
Where are you going? What do you want to play with?

1390
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,379
Which one?

1391
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,319
(He goes to the diaper bag.)

1392
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:09,789
(Picking)

1393
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:13,689
Mandarins? Do you want mandarins?

1394
00:50:14,689 --> 00:50:16,899
Mandarins? Do you want mandarins?

1395
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:18,168
Do you want mandarins?

1396
00:50:18,169 --> 00:50:19,428
(This is amazing.)

1397
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:20,598
Here.

1398
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:23,438
I'll give you mandarins.

1399
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:24,638
Mandarins, Hyeon Jo.

1400
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,239
(He quickly delivers the mandarins so he doesn't cry.)

1401
00:50:30,439 --> 00:50:32,948
(He's satisfied for now.)

1402
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:35,418
Please.

1403
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:38,418
Don't cry.

1404
00:50:38,419 --> 00:50:39,449
(Your mom is in the middle of a shooting.)

1405
00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:40,918
(He moves with the mandarin.)

1406
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:44,688
Okay.

1407
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:46,259
Do you want to go there? Go on.

1408
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:48,599
Let's go inside.

1409
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,058
(Hyeon Jo wants to be alone.)

1410
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,968
Where do you want to go?

1411
00:50:52,969 --> 00:50:55,269
(The man keeps following him.)

1412
00:50:55,869 --> 00:50:58,169
This is trouble.

1413
00:50:59,439 --> 00:51:01,438
Where do you want to go?

1414
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:03,179
I'll peel this for you.

1415
00:51:03,939 --> 00:51:05,009
Goodness.

1416
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:07,848
(On the brink)

1417
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:09,149
Here.

1418
00:51:11,449 --> 00:51:12,518
Here.

1419
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:15,288
(Hyeon Jo burst into tears, overwhelmed with frustration.)

1420
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:16,389
Did you make him cry?

1421
00:51:19,229 --> 00:51:20,929
Goodness.

1422
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:23,159
I thought my ears were going to tear.

1423
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:24,659
Actually,

1424
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,869
I took good care of my nephews and nieces.

1425
00:51:29,499 --> 00:51:31,399
After a few minutes passed,

1426
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,008
he started looking around. That's when I knew.

1427
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:35,638
It's here.

1428
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:36,678
(Finally tasting the reality of parenthood)

1429
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:39,248
He's looking for his parents. It's here.

1430
00:51:39,249 --> 00:51:41,378
I'm going to live alone from now on.

1431
00:51:41,379 --> 00:51:44,119
(Kwang Kyu declares to live alone.)

1432
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,748
- Come here.
- Let's carry on with him.

1433
00:51:45,749 --> 00:51:48,188
- We can carry him.
- We can carry the baby.

1434
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,189
Let's sit.

1435
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:51,858
Your perspective really changes...

1436
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:53,388
after giving birth.

1437
00:51:53,389 --> 00:51:54,628
That's right. It certainly changes.

1438
00:51:54,629 --> 00:51:57,359
We have a one-day babysitter here.

1439
00:51:57,929 --> 00:51:59,328
He's a really nice babysitter.

1440
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:01,868
- He looks kind.
- He's really nice.

1441
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,568
- It's okay.
- It's too big.

1442
00:52:03,569 --> 00:52:05,738
I guess he's a famous babysitter.

1443
00:52:05,739 --> 00:52:07,568
He's famous nationwide,

1444
00:52:07,569 --> 00:52:09,638
and he's from Pasadena, LA.

1445
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:11,608
- Can he speak English as well?
- He'd speak good English.

1446
00:52:11,609 --> 00:52:14,109
(He's careful not to make Hyeon Jo cry.)

1447
00:52:14,149 --> 00:52:15,549
Right.

1448
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:19,388
Goodness.

1449
00:52:19,389 --> 00:52:22,119
Our audio is overlapping.

1450
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:24,488
(He cries whenever Kwang Kyu touches him.)

1451
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:26,629
- You don't want to go?
- Is that so?

1452
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:28,158
Tell your dad to come.

1453
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:29,629
What does your dad do for a living?

1454
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:31,529
- Tell your dad to come.
- Dad is here.

1455
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,499
Dad is here!

1456
00:52:34,729 --> 00:52:36,439
- Tell your dad to come.
- Dad is here.

1457
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,609
(His dad is really here!)

1458
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:41,808
- Thank you so much.
- Dad.

1459
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:43,879
- Goodness.
- Dad.

1460
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:46,248
Goodness. It's Dad.

1461
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:47,508
He didn't recognize you.

1462
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:49,649
Why is he crying? His dad is here.

1463
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,648
(Hyeon Jo and Kwang Kyu spent a short but intense time.)

1464
00:52:52,649 --> 00:52:55,259
(Hyeon Jo and Kwang Kyu spent a short but intense time.)

1465
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:59,689
Did you have fun with the Grumpy Secretary uncles?

1466
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:03,859
(Throwing)

1467
00:53:04,899 --> 00:53:06,699
Why are you throwing the apple?

1468
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:10,869
Was Kwang Kyu very scary?

1469
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:17,409
(We can feel his heart even if he doesn't say it.)

1470
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:20,549
Peace came after you came.

1471
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:22,849
He's surely his blood.

1472
00:53:22,979 --> 00:53:24,349
He didn't cry after Dad came.

1473
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:26,549
- The way I see it, - Yes?

1474
00:53:27,289 --> 00:53:29,189
Hyeon Jo will become a singer.

1475
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:32,288
Hyeon Jo. Seriously.

1476
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:35,759
Kim Kyung Ho. Grow your hair long like him.

1477
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:38,968
(It's scary even to think about it again.)

1478
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,768
But you're so cute like this, aren't you?

1479
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:42,599
Why did you cry so much?

1480
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:44,268
(Smiling)

1481
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:45,739
Is he smiling?

1482
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:49,438
(Is he smiling?)

1483
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,238
Are you smiling because Dad came?

1484
00:53:51,239 --> 00:53:52,678
- He's smiling at you.
- Right.

1485
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:55,319
Are you smiling because Dad came? Thank you.

1486
00:53:55,549 --> 00:53:57,449
You never smiled before.

1487
00:53:57,879 --> 00:53:59,649
(Feeling sad)

1488
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:02,518
While you're talking with me,

1489
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,618
Seo Jin is taking care of the kids.

1490
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,888
No. I took care of them before.

1491
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,528
I think...

1492
00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:11,529
- you're resting away from them.
- Hey.

1493
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:14,169
- You're resting away from them.
- Hey.

1494
00:54:14,569 --> 00:54:17,099
It's not easy to take care of your son.

1495
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:19,668
- It's not easy, right?
- Three minutes with him...

1496
00:54:19,669 --> 00:54:21,678
equals one hour with them.

1497
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:23,239
- That's true.
- Right.

1498
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:27,549
(Seo Jin feeds them.)

1499
00:54:27,779 --> 00:54:28,848
Let's eat.

1500
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,648
What are you eating?

1501
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:33,449
Do you want to eat just one? You can eat just one.

1502
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:38,559
(Dipping honey)

1503
00:54:40,029 --> 00:54:41,959
(A 5-year-old who's had some honey pizza before)

1504
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:45,498
(Feeling proud)

1505
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,028
Jae Jun...

1506
00:54:47,029 --> 00:54:49,038
is in the phase where he's struggling with parenting.

1507
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:50,468
It is exhausting. That's why I'm curious.

1508
00:54:50,469 --> 00:54:53,108
It's easy to take care of a child when he or she is like this.

1509
00:54:53,109 --> 00:54:56,578
When they grow, it's not childcare, it's education.

1510
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:59,148
When they enter the phase of education,

1511
00:54:59,149 --> 00:55:01,278
you have to communicate...

1512
00:55:01,279 --> 00:55:03,078
- with their schools and teachers.
- Right.

1513
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:04,578
You have to meet the parents,

1514
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,218
arrange their academy schedules,

1515
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,388
and arrange everything they wear and use,

1516
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,959
even their study materials.

1517
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:15,058
- You do all that.
- I do all that.

1518
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:16,558
It's called planning.

1519
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,568
If you're really...

1520
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:20,268
doing 70 to 80 percent of that...

1521
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:21,938
This is what it is.

1522
00:55:21,939 --> 00:55:23,338
When men...

1523
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:25,038
experiences parenting...

1524
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:26,268
I want to ask the men.

1525
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:28,978
I want to ask Seo Jin or Kwang Kyu.

1526
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:30,738
Uncle Seo Jin!

1527
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:32,379
We have a question.

1528
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,848
Uncle Seo Jin!

1529
00:55:33,849 --> 00:55:35,378
We have a question.

1530
00:55:35,379 --> 00:55:37,548
We're curious about the male perspective.

1531
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:40,748
When a man and woman do something together,

1532
00:55:40,749 --> 00:55:42,558
up to what percentage of that work do you think you can take?

1533
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:45,358
Like recycling, doing the laundry...

1534
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,028
- Washing dishes.
- Housework?

1535
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:48,528
- Yes.
- Housework and childcare.

1536
00:55:48,529 --> 00:55:50,059
- Yes.
- Childcare as well.

1537
00:55:51,029 --> 00:55:53,169
Childcare should be done together.

1538
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:55,098
- Together.
- Yes.

1539
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:57,338
I think I'll put more care into childcare.

1540
00:55:57,339 --> 00:55:59,868
I don't think I can do housework because I'm not good at it.

1541
00:55:59,869 --> 00:56:01,739
- That's cute.
- That's not cute.

1542
00:56:01,939 --> 00:56:04,338
I don't think I can do housework because I'm not good at it.

1543
00:56:04,339 --> 00:56:06,048
- That's cute.
- That's not cute.

1544
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:08,009
- What's cute?
- What's cute?

1545
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:11,649
- Why did you say that?
- I just found that cute.

1546
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,148
- Yes.
- I'm interested in childcare.

1547
00:56:14,149 --> 00:56:15,358
You're interested in childcare.

1548
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,658
He's interested. That's cute.

1549
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:18,959
(She's in fan mode.)

1550
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:20,928
I love you.

1551
00:56:20,929 --> 00:56:21,929
(Mom?)

1552
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:23,629
What is it? Do you hear Mom?

1553
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,599
(Yes. Mom is fangirling.)

1554
00:56:27,899 --> 00:56:30,098
Dad loves you too.

1555
00:56:30,099 --> 00:56:31,839
(Stop, Mom.)

1556
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:34,338
- It's nice.
- He loves children.

1557
00:56:34,339 --> 00:56:36,578
Have you ever taken care...

1558
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:38,448
of such young nephews or nieces?

1559
00:56:38,449 --> 00:56:40,549
When my niece was young.

1560
00:56:40,649 --> 00:56:43,719
Do you have plans to do it again?

1561
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,789
Life is easier without kids.

1562
00:56:47,089 --> 00:56:48,419
I have two kids.

1563
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:50,659
You can tell me.

1564
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:53,128
(I have two kids.)

1565
00:56:53,129 --> 00:56:54,188
(The Mommies get annoyed.)

1566
00:56:54,189 --> 00:56:55,228
- How is our life?
- I have...

1567
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:57,158
- I have two kids.
- Well...

1568
00:56:57,159 --> 00:56:58,358
As long as you have a happy family...

1569
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:00,798
- I'm curious.
- You have so many questions.

1570
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,468
It's not like you're going to come as our guest here.

1571
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:04,938
I want to get some minutes while you're here.

1572
00:57:04,939 --> 00:57:08,678
Do you tend to be in touch with your girlfriend often?

1573
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:11,948
Or do you just reply to the messages for the day?

1574
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:13,009
I don't keep in touch so often.

1575
00:57:13,749 --> 00:57:15,218
- You don't?
- Even if you love her so much?

1576
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:16,778
Even if you love her so much? Is that cute?

1577
00:57:16,779 --> 00:57:18,118
That's my style.

1578
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:20,219
That's cute!

1579
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:23,459
I also have a question.

1580
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:29,629
(Eating)

1581
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:33,599
(Eating)

1582
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,439
(He's eating the food the children left.)

1583
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:38,399
It's cold,

1584
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:40,139
but it's still good.

1585
00:57:44,139 --> 00:57:45,139
(Eating)

1586
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,579
(His day was particularly hard.)

1587
00:57:52,889 --> 00:57:56,019
(Who am I? Where am I?)

1588
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:02,199
(Is this the sweet taste of getting out of childcare?)

1589
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,628
(He finishes a plate of pasta.)

1590
00:58:04,629 --> 00:58:05,998
We're all done with the shooting.

1591
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:07,928
Let's all say goodbye.

1592
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:10,538
The managers should also come and say goodbye.

1593
00:58:10,539 --> 00:58:13,168
The managers should also come and say goodbye.

1594
00:58:13,169 --> 00:58:14,208
Come, children.

1595
00:58:14,209 --> 00:58:15,908
He's so exhausted.

1596
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:16,979
Hold hands and come together.

1597
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:18,338
(Trudging)

1598
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:19,978
Come here. Let's say goodbye.

1599
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:21,549
It's over.

1600
00:58:21,979 --> 00:58:23,219
Kwang Kyu.

1601
00:58:23,449 --> 00:58:24,678
He worked so well.

1602
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:26,388
- Goodness.
- It was...

1603
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:28,089
Are you all right?

1604
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:29,888
- I'm all right.
- Kwang Kyu.

1605
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:31,818
- I feel so bad.
- Finally,

1606
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:33,288
"Gwanjong Un-ni."

1607
00:58:33,289 --> 00:58:36,259
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1608
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,399
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1609
00:58:38,729 --> 00:58:39,769
Do this.

1610
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:41,269
Let's go!

1611
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:43,999
(He shakes his finger.)

1612
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:47,208
- Thank you.
- Well done.

1613
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:48,438
Thank you.

1614
00:58:48,439 --> 00:58:49,508
(The shooting ends.)

1615
00:58:49,509 --> 00:58:50,578
Goodness.

1616
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,409
Thank you so much.

1617
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:54,448
This is so good.

1618
00:58:54,449 --> 00:58:56,619
I wasn't going to eat it because it was cold,

1619
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:57,718
- It's good.
- but I tried a little, and...

1620
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:58,748
- It's so good.
- Right.

1621
00:58:58,749 --> 00:59:00,349
- It's so good and spicy.
- It was cold but good.

1622
00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:02,919
- This didn't exist before.
- It didn't.

1623
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:04,618
There were no kids cafes.

1624
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:06,628
There aren't many places for kids to play these days.

1625
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:08,188
So the mothers let the children play...

1626
00:59:08,189 --> 00:59:09,528
at kids cafes like this...

1627
00:59:09,529 --> 00:59:11,529
while they drink some tea.

1628
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:13,598
They also sell alcohol.

1629
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:14,668
They also sell alcohol.

1630
00:59:14,669 --> 00:59:16,438
You can get some beer with grilled pollack.

1631
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:17,969
Thank you.

1632
00:59:18,099 --> 00:59:21,109
It's quite something to drink beer at kids cafes.

1633
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:24,179
Kwang Kyu really...

1634
00:59:24,909 --> 00:59:26,109
Hello.

1635
00:59:26,409 --> 00:59:28,479
- You're here.
- Hey.

1636
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:30,419
- Hello.
- Jae Wan.

1637
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:32,088
- Goodness.
- Nice to meet you.

1638
00:59:32,089 --> 00:59:33,148
Nice to meet you.

1639
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:34,319
They're the managers.

1640
00:59:35,149 --> 00:59:36,788
(She gets carried.)

1641
00:59:36,789 --> 00:59:38,318
Mom, you didn't give me the cake.

1642
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,028
I'll give it to you. Come here.

1643
00:59:40,029 --> 00:59:41,658
(Feeling proud)

1644
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:43,529
Could you stay until my husband comes?

1645
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,829
He'll be here in 15 minutes.

1646
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:47,928
Did I cut the conversation?

1647
00:59:47,929 --> 00:59:49,368
No. They suffered so much...

1648
00:59:49,369 --> 00:59:51,498
while taking care of the children.

1649
00:59:51,499 --> 00:59:53,069
They're all exhausted.

1650
00:59:53,569 --> 00:59:54,709
Thank you.

1651
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:56,309
Well...

1652
00:59:56,779 --> 00:59:58,138
It was a good experience.

1653
00:59:58,139 --> 00:59:59,348
(A white lie)

1654
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:01,378
Aren't they still cute? Don't you want to have children?

1655
01:00:01,379 --> 01:00:02,448
I'm...

1656
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:03,748
- I'm going to live alone.
- Really?

1657
01:00:03,749 --> 01:00:05,178
They're really cute.

1658
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:06,688
You'll adore your own children.

1659
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:07,848
I really recommend it.

1660
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:09,359
(I really recommend it.)

1661
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:12,328
I didn't really carry them a lot.

1662
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:13,428
Why does my shoulder hurt so much?

1663
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:15,398
- It's because you were bending.
- Is that so?

1664
01:00:15,399 --> 01:00:16,798
You followed the child around because he was small.

1665
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:18,828
- Is that so?
- I carried all the children.

1666
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:20,468
It's because you were bending.

1667
01:00:20,469 --> 01:00:21,868
- My shoulder hurts.
- You were running around too.

1668
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:23,768
- You were hunching.
- Right.

1669
01:00:23,769 --> 01:00:25,098
- We should drink... He's here.
- He's here.

1670
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:27,038
- Seong Gi is here.
- Seong Gi is here.

1671
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:28,208
- They're my managers.
- Hello.

1672
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:29,778
Nice to meet you.

1673
01:00:29,779 --> 01:00:30,879
(Hong Seong Gi, Lee Hyun Yi's husband)

1674
01:00:31,739 --> 01:00:33,048
We should go home and eat.

1675
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:34,548
(The dads are in charge of the children tonight.)

1676
01:00:34,549 --> 01:00:35,778
Bye.

1677
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:37,048
- Bye.
- Bye.

1678
01:00:37,049 --> 01:00:38,248
Tae Ri.

1679
01:00:38,249 --> 01:00:39,318
- Tae Ri.
- Thank you.

1680
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:40,818
- Bye.
- Bye.

1681
01:00:40,819 --> 01:00:42,588
- Bye.
- Bye, Tae Ri.

1682
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:44,659
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1683
01:00:44,919 --> 01:00:46,229
All the best.

1684
01:00:46,729 --> 01:00:47,828
Bye.

1685
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:50,199
Bye. Thank you.

1686
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:51,998
Bye!

1687
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:53,628
Yes!

1688
01:00:53,629 --> 01:00:56,569
(We're finally free from the children.)

1689
01:00:57,939 --> 01:00:59,039
Yes!

1690
01:00:59,169 --> 01:01:00,369
Is that beer?

1691
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:02,308
Make somaek.

1692
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:04,378
Goodness.

1693
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:05,678
We should eat.

1694
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:06,908
We should enjoy too.

1695
01:01:06,909 --> 01:01:08,378
- Let's go somewhere nice.
- Okay. Let's go.

1696
01:01:08,379 --> 01:01:09,449
Let's go.

1697
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:13,618
I suddenly feel nervous seeing them.

1698
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:14,889
(I suddenly feel nervous.)

1699
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:17,659
Can't we end it here?

1700
01:01:18,589 --> 01:01:20,229
Why are they suddenly like that?

1701
01:01:20,659 --> 01:01:21,888
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1702
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:23,158
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1703
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,628
(It's a golden time the Mommies can't miss.)

1704
01:01:24,629 --> 01:01:26,368
(My Star's Schedule: 6:30pm, afterparty at a live club)

1705
01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:27,568
This thrill.

1706
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:29,769
The thumping noise. Back in the days...

1707
01:01:29,799 --> 01:01:31,068
When you enter Boss nightclub.

1708
01:01:31,069 --> 01:01:33,468
- Do you remember Juliana?
- Goodness.

1709
01:01:33,469 --> 01:01:35,109
I feel excited.

1710
01:01:35,439 --> 01:01:36,579
Goodness.

1711
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:38,379
Goodness.

1712
01:01:39,049 --> 01:01:40,078
Yes!

1713
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,378
(A live club perfect for a party)

1714
01:01:41,379 --> 01:01:42,379
Turn off the music.

1715
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,478
Goodness.

1716
01:01:43,479 --> 01:01:44,748
(Exclaiming)

1717
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:45,989
Turn off the music.

1718
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:49,289
What?

1719
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:51,919
The bass.

1720
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:55,429
(She gets a tambourine.)

1721
01:01:55,999 --> 01:01:58,359
(The energy is building.)

1722
01:01:59,769 --> 01:02:01,329
(Looking away)

1723
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:04,099
Where should we sit?

1724
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:05,739
Here.

1725
01:02:07,169 --> 01:02:09,138
(Deeply immersed)

1726
01:02:09,139 --> 01:02:10,339
(Confiscating them)

1727
01:02:10,709 --> 01:02:12,608
These are my hoop earrings.

1728
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:13,678
They're earrings.

1729
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:15,209
Who is that man?

1730
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:18,949
(Get rid of the tambourines.)

1731
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:20,289
I love the music.

1732
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:23,089
It's so nice.

1733
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:24,889
My heart is beating. What should I do with it?

1734
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:26,959
My heart is racing right now.

1735
01:02:27,229 --> 01:02:29,298
You're so different from us.

1736
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:31,499
- Aren't you happy?
- Maybe he's not.

1737
01:02:31,559 --> 01:02:34,098
Enjoy your life.

1738
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:35,798
We always went to pork belly BBQ restaurants.

1739
01:02:35,799 --> 01:02:37,039
It's our first time being in such a place.

1740
01:02:37,469 --> 01:02:39,608
We can't go to a restaurant...

1741
01:02:39,609 --> 01:02:42,038
for a gathering...

1742
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:43,738
because we don't have time.

1743
01:02:43,739 --> 01:02:45,078
We need a place that serves both food and drinks.

1744
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:46,178
We have to have fun quickly and go home.

1745
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,478
We need to go to a place...

1746
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:48,818
- where we can do everything.
- That's right.

1747
01:02:48,819 --> 01:02:50,219
Goodness.

1748
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:52,919
I really looked forward to it because of these members.

1749
01:02:53,319 --> 01:02:55,349
Eun Hyeong and Ji Hye.

1750
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:57,858
We're really close,

1751
01:02:57,859 --> 01:02:59,958
but no one really set up a stage for us.

1752
01:02:59,959 --> 01:03:01,458
- That's right.
- I thought,

1753
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:03,428
"What will happen today?"

1754
01:03:03,429 --> 01:03:04,729
I came very excited.

1755
01:03:06,399 --> 01:03:08,939
- That's so nice.
- So nice.

1756
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:11,339
So nice. Seriously.

1757
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:12,668
Are you sleeping?

1758
01:03:12,669 --> 01:03:13,739
(Are you sleeping?)

1759
01:03:14,669 --> 01:03:17,309
- He looks so tired.
- I'm worried about the children.

1760
01:03:17,339 --> 01:03:19,008
We didn't leave them at the daycare.

1761
01:03:19,009 --> 01:03:20,348
They're with their dads.

1762
01:03:20,349 --> 01:03:21,549
- It's okay.
- I know, right?

1763
01:03:21,649 --> 01:03:23,718
Their dads would be having such a hard time.

1764
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:25,178
- Their dads.
- Their blood relatives took them.

1765
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:26,448
- Right.
- It's okay.

1766
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:27,648
We can be comfortable.

1767
01:03:27,649 --> 01:03:29,119
- They're biological fathers.
- Right.

1768
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:31,689
- They can take care of them.
- Right.

1769
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:34,389
Everyone knew the Hakdong Swallowtail.

1770
01:03:35,189 --> 01:03:37,199
I forgot about it.

1771
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:39,168
I really had all the fun I wanted.

1772
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:41,769
That's why I can focus on parenting now.

1773
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:44,769
Did you have a nickname?

1774
01:03:44,969 --> 01:03:46,569
- Weirdo?
- A nickname?

1775
01:03:46,909 --> 01:03:48,009
Weirdo?

1776
01:03:48,509 --> 01:03:49,878
You had nicknames?

1777
01:03:49,879 --> 01:03:50,879
(Culture shock)

1778
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,578
Didn't you have a nickname when you went out for fun?

1779
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:53,678
- When I went out for fun?
- Yes.

1780
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:54,848
I didn't go out so much.

1781
01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:56,948
I used to brainstorm ideas for the comedy show.

1782
01:03:56,949 --> 01:03:58,048
You didn't?

1783
01:03:58,049 --> 01:04:00,318
I shared 50 cans of beer with someone.

1784
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:01,448
With Do Yeon.

1785
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:04,218
Do Yeon can drink beer endlessly.

1786
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:05,858
- We're beer killers.
- Really?

1787
01:04:05,859 --> 01:04:06,928
- With Do Yeon?
- Yes.

1788
01:04:06,929 --> 01:04:09,098
- You get really full.
- We drank 50 cans.

1789
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:11,458
I used to drink a crate of beer before.

1790
01:04:11,459 --> 01:04:12,528
- Really?
- Yes.

1791
01:04:12,529 --> 01:04:13,668
You drink well.

1792
01:04:13,669 --> 01:04:14,968
I think...

1793
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:16,499
I have a long bladder.

1794
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:18,539
I'm sorry.

1795
01:04:18,569 --> 01:04:19,909
People...

1796
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:22,039
- with a long bladder drink well.
- Right?

1797
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:24,138
- My crotch length is long.
- Crotch?

1798
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:25,239
It's long.

1799
01:04:25,509 --> 01:04:26,878
The basketball and baseball players...

1800
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,378
It feels like I'm in a dream.

1801
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:30,848
I never thought I'd talk about my bladder...

1802
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:32,849
in front of a celebrity I really liked.

1803
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:34,688
You keep...

1804
01:04:34,689 --> 01:04:36,559
In front of the people I really like.

1805
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:38,219
The mothers...

1806
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:40,289
really speak boldly.

1807
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,958
- Here. Chicken.
- "Here."

1808
01:04:42,959 --> 01:04:44,358
- It's warm.
- Thank you.

1809
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:45,559
Eat.

1810
01:04:46,729 --> 01:04:47,929
The chicken is so tasty.

1811
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:49,369
Why aren't you eating?

1812
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:52,038
- You ate a lot earlier.
- No.

1813
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:53,239
I don't have the energy.

1814
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:55,569
That's right. That's why mothers lose weight.

1815
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,508
It's not easy to take care of children.

1816
01:04:57,509 --> 01:04:59,549
- It's not easy.
- Right.

1817
01:04:59,609 --> 01:05:00,908
Is it because of Hyeon Jo?

1818
01:05:00,909 --> 01:05:02,919
(Is it because of Hyeon Jo?)

1819
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:05,848
It's because of Hyeon Jo.

1820
01:05:05,849 --> 01:05:07,118
It's because of Hyeon Jo, right?

1821
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:08,248
I'm sorry.

1822
01:05:08,249 --> 01:05:09,919
I shouldn't have given birth.

1823
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:13,028
I'm sorry.

1824
01:05:13,029 --> 01:05:14,288
(He starts choking from laughing too hard.)

1825
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:15,929
Is it something to be sorry about?

1826
01:05:15,999 --> 01:05:17,229
Is it that bad?

1827
01:05:18,399 --> 01:05:19,828
No.

1828
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:21,498
- Is it that bad?
- No.

1829
01:05:21,499 --> 01:05:23,868
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...

1830
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:25,439
conceived.

1831
01:05:26,769 --> 01:05:29,378
I shouldn't have used my womb.

1832
01:05:29,379 --> 01:05:30,578
(The adult-only spicy talk is too much for Kwang Kyu.)

1833
01:05:30,579 --> 01:05:32,238
You conceived?

1834
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:33,348
But Kwang Kyu,

1835
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:35,409
you only took care of Hyeon Jo.

1836
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:37,948
- I was worried he'd get hurt.
- You were worried.

1837
01:05:37,949 --> 01:05:39,388
He was on the horse toy,

1838
01:05:39,389 --> 01:05:40,649
and he almost bumped into things.

1839
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:42,118
Goodness.

1840
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:44,089
Why that...

1841
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:45,359
Hey.

1842
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:46,759
To a baby?

1843
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:48,998
People used to be like that before.

1844
01:05:48,999 --> 01:05:50,999
They wouldn't have done that to a baby.

1845
01:05:52,599 --> 01:05:53,899
What does that make me?

1846
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:57,069
Whenever a child was doing something dangerous,

1847
01:05:58,239 --> 01:05:59,509
they'd do something like that.

1848
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,068
There isn’t anything like that these days.

1849
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:03,239
I think children should run around and play.

1850
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,008
I don't say anything...

1851
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:06,848
even if children upstairs run around like crazy.

1852
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:07,979
Really?

1853
01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:09,849
You're such a good neighbor.

1854
01:06:09,949 --> 01:06:11,348
How cute.

1855
01:06:11,349 --> 01:06:12,918
(How cute.)

1856
01:06:12,919 --> 01:06:14,318
In the past,

1857
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,958
I also thought,

1858
01:06:15,959 --> 01:06:18,258
"Why do they make so much fuss while raising their children?"

1859
01:06:18,259 --> 01:06:19,858
But after giving birth,

1860
01:06:19,859 --> 01:06:21,559
things changed.

1861
01:06:21,759 --> 01:06:23,158
That's why I can't have children.

1862
01:06:23,159 --> 01:06:24,698
I think I'd struggle so much with my child.

1863
01:06:24,699 --> 01:06:27,169
- Because you'd get overprotective.
- Yes. Especially for daughters.

1864
01:06:27,269 --> 01:06:29,198
I think I'd get so stressed...

1865
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:31,368
when I have a child.

1866
01:06:31,369 --> 01:06:33,139
Did you have the opportunity?

1867
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:34,668
To get a child.

1868
01:06:34,669 --> 01:06:35,938
Opportunity...

1869
01:06:35,939 --> 01:06:38,479
I could just create that.

1870
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:40,248
- You have to get married.
- Right.

1871
01:06:40,249 --> 01:06:41,749
Do you want to get married?

1872
01:06:41,909 --> 01:06:43,978
- Not at the moment.
- No.

1873
01:06:43,979 --> 01:06:45,248
What kind of person do you like?

1874
01:06:45,249 --> 01:06:46,419
Someone cute?

1875
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:49,089
Adu du.

1876
01:06:49,659 --> 01:06:52,219
(He's shocked.)

1877
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:54,658
Adu du.

1878
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:56,128
Not someone with problems.

1879
01:06:56,129 --> 01:06:57,229
(Not someone with problems.)

1880
01:06:58,759 --> 01:07:00,199
How cute.

1881
01:07:00,969 --> 01:07:03,299
Eat, Eun Hyeong.

1882
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:05,569
He's cuter.

1883
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:07,838
He's cuter.

1884
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:09,408
I rarely lose my phone.

1885
01:07:09,409 --> 01:07:10,878
- Right.
- People would bring it to you.

1886
01:07:10,879 --> 01:07:12,379
They wouldn't even take it.

1887
01:07:12,609 --> 01:07:13,848
Why are you saying it like that?

1888
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:14,878
It's scary.

1889
01:07:14,879 --> 01:07:16,749
I'm the only one who can insult my husband.

1890
01:07:16,979 --> 01:07:18,748
That's right. I know what you mean.

1891
01:07:18,749 --> 01:07:20,448
I can insult my husband,

1892
01:07:20,449 --> 01:07:22,318
- but if others do it, I feel bad.
- Right. You feel annoyed.

1893
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,258
That wasn't my intention, but if it came out like that,

1894
01:07:24,259 --> 01:07:25,859
- I'd like to apologize.
- No.

1895
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:27,428
I'm joking.

1896
01:07:27,429 --> 01:07:29,659
I think he had a hard time because of Hyeon Jo.

1897
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:31,759
Kwang Kyu looked...

1898
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:33,999
very skinny earlier.

1899
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:35,199
Is Hyeon Jo sleeping?

1900
01:07:35,569 --> 01:07:38,868
He's stepping on my stomach now.

1901
01:07:38,869 --> 01:07:40,008
Kwang Kyu has to come now.

1902
01:07:40,009 --> 01:07:41,769
(Kwang Kyu has to come now.)

1903
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:43,408
Please come.

1904
01:07:43,409 --> 01:07:45,339
Hyeon Jo wants to see you now.

1905
01:07:45,579 --> 01:07:47,278
Shall we sing?

1906
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:48,548
- Now?
- Already?

1907
01:07:48,549 --> 01:07:50,379
- So suddenly?
- We have to start.

1908
01:07:50,479 --> 01:07:52,118
- We have to build the energy.
- Okay.

1909
01:07:52,119 --> 01:07:53,688
Do it if you want.

1910
01:07:53,689 --> 01:07:54,748
Right.

1911
01:07:54,749 --> 01:07:56,989
Shall we start from Cheongdam-dong Whistle?

1912
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:59,288
- Who's that?
- Whistle?

1913
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:00,428
- Cheongdam-dong.
- It's Hakdong Swallowtail.

1914
01:08:00,429 --> 01:08:01,829
Swallowtail. I'm sorry.

1915
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:04,299
- I have a bad memory.
- Don't go first.

1916
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:07,068
If you go first, we'll be discouraged.

1917
01:08:07,069 --> 01:08:08,428
- Are you...
- You can go first.

1918
01:08:08,429 --> 01:08:09,468
- I'll go first.
- You go.

1919
01:08:09,469 --> 01:08:10,538
- I'll do it.
- Yes.

1920
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:11,868
Hyun Yi can sing.

1921
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:13,339
- Okay. That's nice.
- A karaoke..

1922
01:08:13,809 --> 01:08:15,468
Hyun Yi sings well.

1923
01:08:15,469 --> 01:08:16,739
Right. Hyun Yi sings well.

1924
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:19,008
I always...

1925
01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:20,548
It's been a while since I last went out for fun.

1926
01:08:20,549 --> 01:08:21,708
It was five years ago.

1927
01:08:21,709 --> 01:08:22,978
(It was 5 years ago.)

1928
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:24,618
(Ivy)

1929
01:08:24,619 --> 01:08:26,348
(A somewhat dated song selection)

1930
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:27,419
Those are old...

1931
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:30,559
It's been so long since I last sang.

1932
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:32,688
The songs I know ended in the past.

1933
01:08:32,689 --> 01:08:35,559
I only know old songs.

1934
01:08:36,599 --> 01:08:38,099
It came out a little.

1935
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,868
(The time when my child was the center of my life, not me)

1936
01:08:40,869 --> 01:08:45,038
(The time when my child was the center of my life, not me)

1937
01:08:45,039 --> 01:08:49,409
(The time when my child was the center of my life, not me)

1938
01:08:49,879 --> 01:08:52,648
(Today is a party to celebrate 1 million YouTube subscribers!)

1939
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:56,049
(Today is a party to celebrate 1 million YouTube subscribers!)

1940
01:08:56,119 --> 01:08:58,948
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1941
01:08:58,949 --> 01:09:00,349
(At least for this moment, I'm going back to being a "weirdo.")

1942
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:03,789
("Touch Me" by IVY)

1943
01:09:05,789 --> 01:09:09,059
(She's a weirdo now.)

1944
01:09:09,559 --> 01:09:12,059
(Bring up the energy.)

1945
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:21,639
Sing it together!

1946
01:09:26,009 --> 01:09:28,949
(It's time to sing along.)

1947
01:09:29,379 --> 01:09:30,749
(Touch)

1948
01:09:30,849 --> 01:09:32,319
(Closing his mouth)

1949
01:09:39,629 --> 01:09:40,688
(Working moms...)

1950
01:09:40,689 --> 01:09:42,189
(are always short on time.)

1951
01:09:43,299 --> 01:09:44,558
(Starving for time...)

1952
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:46,228
(to have fun.)

1953
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:48,229
(to have fun.)

1954
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:53,769
(Shouting to quench her thirst)

1955
01:09:54,739 --> 01:09:57,038
(The stress of being a working mom is gone.)

1956
01:09:57,039 --> 01:09:58,039
Amazing.

1957
01:09:58,309 --> 01:10:00,108
- My throat...
- You got 97 points.

1958
01:10:00,109 --> 01:10:01,749
- My throat didn't feel good.
- You got 97 points.

1959
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:03,678
- It was the best.
- You're so good.

1960
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,578
That was incredible.

1961
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:07,448
In a way, this is our little act of rebellion.

1962
01:10:07,449 --> 01:10:09,418
We don't normally get to have fun like this.

1963
01:10:09,419 --> 01:10:11,388
- We don't. We don't have time.
- So today,

1964
01:10:11,389 --> 01:10:12,488
let loose and shake off some stress before you leave.

1965
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:13,958
- Sounds good.
- Yes.

1966
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,428
Please support us.

1967
01:10:15,429 --> 01:10:16,429
We need your support.

1968
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,328
- Have all the fun you want.
- Let me sing a song then.

1969
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:19,529
- Eun Hyeong first.
- Let me sing a song.

1970
01:10:19,829 --> 01:10:21,598
(Grumpy Secretaries will set the stage for you.)

1971
01:10:21,599 --> 01:10:26,039
(My Mom, enjoy yourselves to the fullest!)

1972
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:31,238
(A serenade filled with her love as a fan...)

1973
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:34,679
(she's been holding back while raising a child)

1974
01:10:35,449 --> 01:10:38,279
(Set the mood.)

1975
01:10:41,489 --> 01:10:44,859
(I love you)

1976
01:10:45,019 --> 01:10:46,158
I've never seen something like this.

1977
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,459
("Sexy Man" by Space A)

1978
01:10:53,899 --> 01:10:56,069
I'm sitting in the wrong place.

1979
01:10:56,739 --> 01:10:57,838
I shouldn't have sat here.

1980
01:10:57,839 --> 01:10:59,169
(Hyeon Jo, close your eyes.)

1981
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:12,350
(She's already immersed.)

1982
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,150
(Amazed)

1983
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,020
(Peekaboo, startled)

1984
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:27,070
(She's ready to become a free woman.)

1985
01:11:30,726 --> 01:11:34,126
(Why are you doing this to me?)

1986
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:37,426
(Building to the climax)

1987
01:11:37,596 --> 01:11:39,965
(No, even if I)

1988
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:42,735
(Die)

1989
01:11:42,736 --> 01:11:43,736
(You're the only one)

1990
01:11:43,737 --> 01:11:45,536
(So please)

1991
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:48,536
(Sweating)

1992
01:11:49,446 --> 01:11:50,875
(I love you)

1993
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:52,276
(Okay)

1994
01:11:53,016 --> 01:11:54,516
You're cute.

1995
01:11:55,446 --> 01:11:56,486
Cut it.

1996
01:11:58,286 --> 01:12:00,115
She's losing her breath.

1997
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:01,116
(I can't handle it anymore.)

1998
01:12:03,056 --> 01:12:04,086
Take the mic away from her.

1999
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:07,156
Take the mic away from her.

2000
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:11,995
(He can't take it away from her.)

2001
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:12,996
Let's go.

2002
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:15,596
Oh, my goodness.

2003
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,906
They must've really had a hard time because of their kids.

2004
01:12:20,806 --> 01:12:22,576
Well, I understand.

2005
01:12:23,546 --> 01:12:24,546
I feel bad.

2006
01:12:25,106 --> 01:12:27,376
- I felt bad for them.
- Why? What's the reason?

2007
01:12:28,976 --> 01:12:30,416
It felt like...

2008
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:35,016
they'd been holding a lot for a long time.

2009
01:12:35,056 --> 01:12:38,092
I'm glad they could release some stress.

2010
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,526
(A music video is playing.)

2011
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,256
Oh, my gosh.

2012
01:12:43,266 --> 01:12:44,595
Is that Ji Hye?

2013
01:12:44,596 --> 01:12:46,635
I can barely sing because I'm out of breath.

2014
01:12:46,636 --> 01:12:48,465
- That's not Ji Hye.
- What?

2015
01:12:48,466 --> 01:12:49,566
Is that Ji Hye?

2016
01:12:49,736 --> 01:12:51,035
"Closer" is a great song.

2017
01:12:51,036 --> 01:12:53,275
"My Lips like Warm Coffee" is amazing too.

2018
01:12:53,276 --> 01:12:55,106
(It's a S#arp music video. Where is My Star Ji Hye?)

2019
01:12:56,546 --> 01:12:58,675
(Comparing the faces)

2020
01:12:58,676 --> 01:13:00,875
- Ji Hye, is that you?
- "Is that you?"

2021
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:01,876
That's another member. That's me.

2022
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,986
That's me.

2023
01:13:04,786 --> 01:13:06,286
- That's me.
- She's a different woman.

2024
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,186
What are you talking about? It's me.

2025
01:13:09,056 --> 01:13:10,556
The faces are different.

2026
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:14,256
(The suspicions intensified.)

2027
01:13:14,396 --> 01:13:15,426
Do I look that different?

2028
01:13:15,526 --> 01:13:17,095
The faces are completely different.

2029
01:13:17,096 --> 01:13:18,495
- This is her!
- Is that her?

2030
01:13:18,496 --> 01:13:19,995
- That's Ji Hye? Is that you?
- Hey!

2031
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:21,666
Who is she?

2032
01:13:22,036 --> 01:13:23,906
- Who is that woman?
- Who is it?

2033
01:13:24,006 --> 01:13:25,566
- That's her.
- Where's My Star?

2034
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:27,705
Are you mocking me? You're so mean.

2035
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:29,035
No.

2036
01:13:29,036 --> 01:13:30,045
(Her face has a long history.)

2037
01:13:30,046 --> 01:13:31,375
The three of us should sing this.

2038
01:13:31,376 --> 01:13:34,115
- We should sing this song.
- The three of us should sing it.

2039
01:13:34,116 --> 01:13:35,976
("Come A Come" by My Stars)

2040
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:37,946
(Flopping)

2041
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:39,755
The three of us should stand here.

2042
01:13:39,756 --> 01:13:41,255
(She's ready to shine at the center.)

2043
01:13:41,256 --> 01:13:43,456
- You go to the back.
- Okay.

2044
01:13:43,886 --> 01:13:47,156
You know the move, right? Move your left arm. I'll move my right arm.

2045
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:50,996
(Here come the working moms.)

2046
01:13:54,596 --> 01:13:56,735
(Shaking off the exhaustion of parenting,)

2047
01:13:56,736 --> 01:14:00,406
(they're flapping their wings powerfully.)

2048
01:14:01,776 --> 01:14:04,946
(Their teamwork rivals the original singers.)

2049
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,546
(Flustered)

2050
01:14:09,246 --> 01:14:11,245
(Even if you die)

2051
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:14,756
(Don't ever come looking for me)

2052
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:17,556
Jae Jun, don't look for me!

2053
01:14:20,396 --> 01:14:23,366
Hyeon Jo, just grow up on your own!

2054
01:14:24,766 --> 01:14:25,995
Don't look for me!

2055
01:14:25,996 --> 01:14:27,996
(She shouted to blow away the struggles of being a working mom.)

2056
01:14:28,436 --> 01:14:30,905
- That was a huge stress release.
- I know.

2057
01:14:30,906 --> 01:14:32,305
It was amazing.

2058
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:35,006
We've done all this.

2059
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:36,775
- At least sing one song for us.
- Seo Jin,

2060
01:14:36,776 --> 01:14:39,716
let's sing "The Blue in You" together.

2061
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:44,646
(My Star requested a duet.)

2062
01:14:44,816 --> 01:14:47,686
- Would you...
- Yes. Just once. Please.

2063
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:54,626
I went to karaoke with him a few times.

2064
01:14:55,656 --> 01:14:57,226
Whenever I sang,

2065
01:14:57,396 --> 01:14:58,965
he only pointed out...

2066
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:00,565
- how bad my singing was.
- He did?

2067
01:15:00,566 --> 01:15:02,935
- And he never sang himself.
- Even off camera?

2068
01:15:02,936 --> 01:15:06,306
On camera or off.

2069
01:15:07,106 --> 01:15:08,975
(Seo Jin can sing.)

2070
01:15:08,976 --> 01:15:10,106
He's a good singer.

2071
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:14,276
(Only 1 witness)

2072
01:15:14,976 --> 01:15:18,886
(Only Hwa Jeong has ever heard him sing.)

2073
01:15:19,346 --> 01:15:22,356
(That's how rare his singing is.)

2074
01:15:22,616 --> 01:15:25,356
(It's revealed now.)

2075
01:15:25,568 --> 01:15:28,907
("The Blue in You" by Kim Hyun Chul and Lee So Ra)

2076
01:15:28,908 --> 01:15:32,208
What? No way. I might cry.

2077
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:34,808
I'll hand the mic to you.

2078
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:04,938
(Her heart is pounding.)

2079
01:16:10,418 --> 01:16:11,617
It isn't working. Try this one.

2080
01:16:11,618 --> 01:16:13,587
(One of the mics doesn't work at the worst possible timing.)

2081
01:16:13,588 --> 01:16:16,158
Use this one. Why isn't it working?

2082
01:16:21,958 --> 01:16:23,428
You're good.

2083
01:16:42,078 --> 01:16:46,447
(Under My Star's lead,)

2084
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:51,058
(they're carefully singing together.)

2085
01:16:56,828 --> 01:17:01,268
(He may be prickly, but his singing voice is sweet.)

2086
01:17:01,398 --> 01:17:02,697
Let's share the mic.

2087
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:05,168
(She moves closer to share the mic with him.)

2088
01:17:15,648 --> 01:17:18,778
(Capturing the rare moment on his phone)

2089
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:24,818
(It's time to fully take it in.)

2090
01:17:58,858 --> 01:17:59,888
It's so nice.

2091
01:18:17,108 --> 01:18:18,207
You're good!

2092
01:18:18,208 --> 01:18:19,748
(He suddenly feels shy.)

2093
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:22,818
(I have to admit. He's good.)

2094
01:18:23,848 --> 01:18:26,087
(I envy her.)

2095
01:18:26,088 --> 01:18:28,048
I've never seen him sing before.

2096
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,388
It was so nice.

2097
01:18:29,518 --> 01:18:32,218
I was happy to see Ji Hye after a long time.

2098
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:34,488
I'm glad...

2099
01:18:34,788 --> 01:18:36,497
they were able to let off some stress.

2100
01:18:36,498 --> 01:18:38,828
Our show didn't do anything special for them.

2101
01:18:39,328 --> 01:18:41,828
I'm relieved they at least had a chance to let loose.

2102
01:18:41,928 --> 01:18:43,538
There's nothing we did for them.

2103
01:18:43,798 --> 01:18:47,268
I'm glad that we could buy them a drink,

2104
01:18:47,808 --> 01:18:49,308
and we helped them let off some stress.

2105
01:18:50,838 --> 01:18:53,077
I was so happy and grateful.

2106
01:18:53,078 --> 01:18:56,477
I feel recharged today.

2107
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:59,948
I think I can move forward with a happier mindset.

2108
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:02,987
- We sang earlier.
- Yes.

2109
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:05,787
I think we could release an album.

2110
01:19:05,788 --> 01:19:07,057
I don't think so.

2111
01:19:07,058 --> 01:19:08,587
Eun Hyeong, I don't think so.

2112
01:19:08,588 --> 01:19:10,657
- Give it some thought.
- I don't agree with you.

2113
01:19:10,658 --> 01:19:12,627
- Ji Hye, let's put out a carol.
- Yes.

2114
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,227
- Don't do that.
- A carol.

2115
01:19:14,228 --> 01:19:15,567
- Don't do that. Calm down.
- Let's drop a carol.

2116
01:19:15,568 --> 01:19:16,568
- You can just sing the chorus.
- Calm down.

2117
01:19:16,569 --> 01:19:18,037
- We'll sing the verse.
- Hold your horses.

2118
01:19:18,038 --> 01:19:19,167
I'm sorry.

2119
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:21,138
- They're too excited.
- You...

2120
01:19:21,308 --> 01:19:24,108
Aren't they just trying to get a piece of your album's success?

2121
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:26,577
- It means we shouldn't do that.
- He got us.

2122
01:19:26,578 --> 01:19:28,407
- It means we shouldn't do that.
- He got us.

2123
01:19:28,408 --> 01:19:30,048
He got us.

2124
01:19:30,918 --> 01:19:33,917
("SBS Gayo Daejeon" where the best K-pop groups come together)

2125
01:19:33,918 --> 01:19:36,958
("SBS Gayo Daejeon" where the best K-pop groups come together)

2126
01:19:37,118 --> 01:19:40,157
(Among all these shining stars,)

2127
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:42,557
(who is today's My Star?)

2128
01:19:42,558 --> 01:19:44,098
(My Star An Yu Jin)

2129
01:19:44,358 --> 01:19:45,958
(She's hosting "SBS Gayo Daejeon" for the 6th consecutive time.)

2130
01:19:46,828 --> 01:19:48,598
(Take care of her.)

2131
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:50,198
(What does it take to host "SBS Gayo Daejeon" 6 years straight?)

2132
01:19:50,438 --> 01:19:51,597
(The mindset of a queen)

2133
01:19:51,598 --> 01:19:52,807
(Queen, the band?)

2134
01:19:52,808 --> 01:19:53,907
(When it's delicious)

2135
01:19:53,908 --> 01:19:55,168
(Sassy)

2136
01:19:55,238 --> 01:19:57,378
(When you call someone, do this.)

2137
01:19:57,408 --> 01:20:00,278
(What does a queen’s mindset have to do with that hand gesture?)

2138
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,408
(Grumpy Secretaries are off to a bad start.)

2139
01:20:02,608 --> 01:20:04,417
(They want Dubai chewy cookies.)

2140
01:20:04,418 --> 01:20:05,547
(Dubai dewy cookie?)

2141
01:20:05,548 --> 01:20:07,648
(Dewy cookie? Is that a dog name?)

2142
01:20:08,088 --> 01:20:10,658
(They give them a chocolate cookie instead of Dubai chewy cookie.)

2143
01:20:10,688 --> 01:20:12,158
(Disappointed)

2144
01:20:14,528 --> 01:20:15,628
(They provide care without any difficulty.)

2145
01:20:15,858 --> 01:20:17,128
(Do you need water?)

2146
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:18,358
(You're not drinking, are you?)

2147
01:20:18,728 --> 01:20:20,728
(Seo Jin who takes care of My Star's voice)

2148
01:20:20,998 --> 01:20:22,797
(Was something missing? Was something not working?)

2149
01:20:22,798 --> 01:20:24,868
(What's going on?)

2150
01:20:24,998 --> 01:20:29,008
(Kwang Kyu takes care of his own My Star as a fan.)

2151
01:20:29,268 --> 01:20:31,708
(It's followed by the Christmas home party with My Star.)

2152
01:20:32,438 --> 01:20:34,378
(Royal Chef Eom cooks.)

2153
01:20:34,448 --> 01:20:36,348
(And Seo Jin decorates the house.)

2154
01:20:36,548 --> 01:20:39,448
(How will the Christmas party they prepared turn out?)

2155
01:20:39,948 --> 01:20:40,948
(Go, IVE!)

2156
01:20:42,518 --> 01:20:45,157
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2157
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:47,758
(My Grumpy Secretary)
