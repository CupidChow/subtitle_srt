1
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:13,536
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:13,537 --> 00:00:16,007
(My Grumpy Secretary)

3
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,737
(My Star's House in Ichon-dong)

4
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:23,677
(A car enters the parking lot.)

5
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,617
(At 9:45am, Seo Jin arrives first, as usual.)

6
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:34,157
- You look grumpy.
- What's up with his face?

7
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:36,427
Is it too early in the morning?

8
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:38,656
Is that why he's grumpy?

9
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:40,097
(Grumpy Secretary isn't cut out for a morning shoot.)

10
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:47,037
Isn't your energy too low?

11
00:00:47,337 --> 00:00:49,666
You all keep leeching off me.

12
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,307
No wonder I'm exhausted.

13
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,977
(Even if he's exhausted, his dimples are still wide-open.)

14
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,647
- Is Kwang Kyu not here yet?
- He's arriving soon.

15
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,277
He's always late.

16
00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:00,646
(Seo Jin tries to regain strength...)

17
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,016
(while waiting for Kwang Kyu.)

18
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:03,046
(And Kwang Kyu is getting ready for work nearby.)

19
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,317
I didn't get to sleep yesterday because I was too excited.

20
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:06,817
Why were you so excited?

21
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:09,087
Well...

22
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:12,696
I haven't seen her in a long time.

23
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,727
How do you know her then?

24
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,866
"Three Wheels" was my first show, and I met her there.

25
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:20,197
(He went on "Three Wheels" with My Star.)

26
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:22,937
She always smiled brightly,

27
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,536
and she had the greatest energy.

28
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:29,377
She's always friendly to younger artists.

29
00:01:30,077 --> 00:01:31,516
(He dolls up meticulously...)

30
00:01:31,517 --> 00:01:33,147
(with excitement.)

31
00:01:33,687 --> 00:01:35,087
(Shaking his jacket)

32
00:01:36,817 --> 00:01:38,556
(He dresses up by putting on a jacket...)

33
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:41,226
(that matches the colour of his pants.)

34
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,827
It's been ages since I last saw her.

35
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:48,567
(For My Star, he even puts on the chequered hat.)

36
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:50,436
(Caretaker Fairy really dolled up...)

37
00:01:50,437 --> 00:01:51,697
(for My Star.)

38
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:55,136
(He will now go meet My Star.)

39
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:56,506
I slept in the wrong position.

40
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,936
(His back is in pain.)

41
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:59,076
My back hurts.

42
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,507
(He's excited, but that doesn't stop his back from hurting.)

43
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:03,746
(Kwang Kyu groaning)

44
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,377
It hurts!

45
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:06,777
Goodness me.

46
00:02:13,187 --> 00:02:15,857
What's wrong with you?

47
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:18,757
- What is it?
- Gosh.

48
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:21,867
"What's wrong with you?" Don't be so rude.

49
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:24,797
You should've ironed your clothes. Did you not iron them?

50
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:26,866
(Wrinkled)

51
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:28,266
I don't have a stylist, you know.

52
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,337
(He doesn't have a stylist.)

53
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:31,376
(Feeling bad)

54
00:02:31,377 --> 00:02:32,637
What's up with that hat?

55
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:35,407
I was afraid the sun was going to be strong.

56
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:37,646
(Can't understand him)

57
00:02:37,647 --> 00:02:38,916
- I...
- His pants.

58
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:40,416
I got this tailored for my role in a drama.

59
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,617
Lose the hat at least.

60
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:43,756
The hat ruins it all.

61
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:46,216
Put on a baseball cap instead. That just ruins the whole mood.

62
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:50,527
For her generation, this is considered stylish.

63
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:52,356
Mr. Noh Joo Hyun is famous...

64
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:53,796
for always wearing this hat.

65
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:55,326
- He never wears that.
- Really?

66
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:57,097
Even Shin Gu wouldn't wear that.

67
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:58,537
- Really?
- He doesn't.

68
00:03:00,637 --> 00:03:01,866
(Disappointed)

69
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:03,267
That was a terrible idea.

70
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:05,236
All right.

71
00:03:05,237 --> 00:03:08,907
I will accept your opinion, and...

72
00:03:09,347 --> 00:03:11,247
Hey!

73
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:14,546
How dare you treat my precious hat like that?

74
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:15,617
Gosh, you!

75
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:19,616
Don't you dare edit this part out.

76
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,727
Do it again.

77
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,997
Come on, do it.

78
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:25,827
Gosh, you.

79
00:03:25,927 --> 00:03:27,327
(Laughing)

80
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:28,766
(After a good fight, they go to meet My Star.)

81
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:29,927
- Let's go up.
- Okay.

82
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:31,436
- Does she live alone?
- Yes.

83
00:03:31,437 --> 00:03:32,697
She lives alone.

84
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:34,306
It's been a long time.

85
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:36,006
- Kwang Kyu.
- I will get out first.

86
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,406
You're close to her,

87
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,137
so you should lead the conversation.

88
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:42,947
But they like you more than they like me.

89
00:03:43,277 --> 00:03:45,817
They like you.

90
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:48,586
(Looking around)

91
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:50,757
I have a feeling it's here.

92
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:52,317
She's like me.

93
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,827
- The spring fortune talisman.
- She must be a Buddhist.

94
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:56,557
Press the doorbell.

95
00:03:57,427 --> 00:04:00,197
(Ding-dong)

96
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:05,236
(He's excited to meet My Star after a long time.)

97
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:06,637
Coming.

98
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,237
(Nervous)

99
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,237
(He grabs the door sweetly.)

100
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,446
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

101
00:04:15,447 --> 00:04:17,147
Nice to see you.

102
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:21,247
(My Star, Sunwoo Yong Yeo)

103
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,417
(Bowing at 90 degrees)

104
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:25,786
(Deploying dimples)

105
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:26,856
Hello.

106
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:27,986
(Kwang Kyu is here too.)

107
00:04:27,987 --> 00:04:29,226
I will speak English to him.

108
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,056
- Welcome to my house.
- Thank you.

109
00:04:31,057 --> 00:04:32,096
Right.

110
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,497
I don't know. I shouldn't talk to her anymore.

111
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:37,497
(At the age of 80, she debuted as a YouTuber.)

112
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:39,536
(Driving a luxury car...)

113
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:40,806
(herself, )

114
00:04:40,807 --> 00:04:42,107
(she communicates with it too.)

115
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,506
(She's a rich grandma...)

116
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:47,376
(who eats breakfast at a hotel every day.)

117
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:49,806
(She's crazy about that man.)

118
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:52,147
(You don't get pregnant by doing it often.)

119
00:04:52,247 --> 00:04:54,317
(She's got a 79-rated mouth on her.)

120
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:58,617
(She's got the cute and charming side too.)

121
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:02,027
(Her video had 4.12 million views.)

122
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:04,996
(Isn't it better to live alone?)

123
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,526
(Soonpoong Sunwoo Yong Yeo)

124
00:05:06,527 --> 00:05:07,766
(The channel started in April this year, )

125
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,267
(and it got over 70 million views in a short period of time.)

126
00:05:09,527 --> 00:05:11,596
(Whenever I watch her, I feel good. She's my role model.)

127
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,767
(I want to live a fun life even when I'm older.)

128
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:17,536
(My Star is the star of 2025 who is leading the trend.)

129
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:18,836
I should speak to him in English.

130
00:05:18,837 --> 00:05:20,776
- Welcome to my house.
- Thank you.

131
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:22,276
(Unique necklace, red cardigan)

132
00:05:22,277 --> 00:05:23,916
(She welcomes them cheerfully with a great fashion style.)

133
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,377
(Unique necklace, red cardigan)

134
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,916
- Is that right?
- Come on in.

135
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:28,386
- She doesn't remember me.
- Come on in.

136
00:05:28,387 --> 00:05:29,887
All right. Let's go inside.

137
00:05:30,617 --> 00:05:33,686
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

138
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,327
- Why are you so shy?
- No.

139
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:37,496
He's your biggest fan.

140
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:38,726
- Are you really?
- Yes.

141
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:40,796
But we've never acted together.

142
00:05:40,797 --> 00:05:42,426
Right. We've never done a show together.

143
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:43,726
You starred in "Three Wheels" together.

144
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:45,396
- We were on "Three Wheels." - We were on "Three Wheels."

145
00:05:45,397 --> 00:05:46,467
- Yes.
- Yes.

146
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,266
- That's a variety show.
- Yes.

147
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:49,337
Right.

148
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,437
Come on in.

149
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:55,647
(Come on in.)

150
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:59,146
(They carefully enter the house of My Star.)

151
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:00,686
Come on in.

152
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:01,746
(Feeling awkward)

153
00:06:01,747 --> 00:06:03,486
- How should we sit?
- However you like.

154
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,157
- I will sit here. Sit here.
- Of course.

155
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:08,057
You should sit in the royal seat.

156
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:09,986
You should sit here. Where do you want to sit?

157
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,596
- You two should sit there.
- Okay.

158
00:06:11,597 --> 00:06:14,096
(Seo Jin carefully looks at the photos.)

159
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:15,197
Have a seat.

160
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:18,837
- She's your daughter, right?
- Yes, she's my daughter.

161
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,236
- And her son.
- Her daughter is famous.

162
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:21,567
My daughter and my son.

163
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:23,436
Goodness.

164
00:06:23,437 --> 00:06:24,907
- My daughter and my son.
- Did he play American football?

165
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:27,446
Yes, my son used to play American football.

166
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:29,076
- He's got a big body.
- He played football.

167
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:30,347
(Talking about her children, he gets closer to her.)

168
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:32,216
- Right.
- Yes.

169
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,777
(Talking about her children makes My Star smile brightly.)

170
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:36,047
What... Yes.

171
00:06:41,387 --> 00:06:43,087
- You are very awkward.
- Yes.

172
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,326
- Why are you so awkward?
- We are...

173
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:47,827
- That's bad.
- We are much younger than her,

174
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:51,067
so we have to watch what we say.

175
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:53,436
(He quietly activates his dimples.)

176
00:06:53,437 --> 00:06:55,766
We have to watch what we say.

177
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:56,867
- How should we...
- Just be yourself.

178
00:06:57,607 --> 00:06:59,677
Should we call you, "Ma'am?"

179
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:02,306
No, just be yourself. It's fine by me.

180
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:03,776
- Just talk like your usual self.
- I can take in...

181
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:05,347
whatever you say.

182
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:09,187
So it's best that you say whatever you feel like saying.

183
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:10,956
We're not here to act.

184
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:12,417
- Of course.
- Right?

185
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:15,086
- You should be yourself.
- We should...

186
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:17,256
- How should we call her?
- What's today's concept?

187
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,597
What am I to do today?

188
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:21,227
Wherever you need to go,

189
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:24,936
we will drive you there. That's all there is to it.

190
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:26,736
- You are the secretary then, right?
- There's nothing special.

191
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,766
- Yes.
- Yes.

192
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,037
We are at your disposal.

193
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:32,737
- Am I their boss today?
- Boss?

194
00:07:34,447 --> 00:07:37,146
(Carefree lady Yong Yeo doesn't mind whatever they call her.)

195
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:38,947
By the way, my daughter...

196
00:07:39,077 --> 00:07:40,747
- Can you hand me my bag?
- Yes.

197
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:42,546
- You're my secretary after all.
- Of course.

198
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:44,257
- You can ask us to do anything.
- So...

199
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:46,887
This morning, my daughter...

200
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:50,557
sent a writing in English.

201
00:07:50,697 --> 00:07:54,497
She said she would send me the translated version.

202
00:07:54,767 --> 00:08:00,337
But this wench sent the English version only.

203
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,706
It turned out perfectly.

204
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:05,776
I got a secretary, and he happens to speak English very well.

205
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,407
He graduated from NYU.

206
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:10,407
How lucky am I? I thought I would ask him to translate it.

207
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:12,977
She sent me this.

208
00:08:17,017 --> 00:08:18,017
(Surprised)

209
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,056
(He's flustered because it's very long.)

210
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:22,687
(Frowning)

211
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:25,396
She said it's supposed to mean something good.

212
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:27,326
- Do you want reading glasses?
- No.

213
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:28,767
- Reading glasses!
- Are those song lyrics?

214
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:30,797
- No, this is...
- This is bad.

215
00:08:31,037 --> 00:08:33,396
He must still be quite young.

216
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:34,766
And you have to do this to read?

217
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:37,237
I'm 54 years old.

218
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:40,077
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

219
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:42,677
Now that I'm over 50, I got farsighted.

220
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,746
- It can't be helped.
- But...

221
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:48,347
Ma'am, this is... Are you a Buddhist?

222
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:49,817
I am a Buddhist.

223
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:51,686
It seems to be the words of Buddha.

224
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:53,756
It's about why you are always...

225
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:55,327
upset about things and yell.

226
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:56,856
It says you should calm your anger.

227
00:08:56,857 --> 00:08:58,327
It's the Buddha's words.

228
00:08:58,727 --> 00:08:59,927
This is hard.

229
00:09:00,197 --> 00:09:02,466
It goes, "Why are you always angry and yelling?"

230
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:04,996
- But you know, this is...
- Aren't you getting married?

231
00:09:04,997 --> 00:09:06,037
- Pardon me?
- Goodness.

232
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:07,966
You need to bear children.

233
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,207
He looks decent, you know. He's good-looking too.

234
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:13,306
He's perfect as he is,

235
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:14,677
although it's my first time meeting him.

236
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:17,547
It's ridiculous that he hasn't got a woman.

237
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,047
That's just wrong.

238
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,787
Why aren't you getting married?

239
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,457
- How old are you?
- Me?

240
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:25,886
He's turning 60 next year.

241
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:27,316
(He's turning 60 next year.)

242
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,387
Are you really?

243
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:30,587
Yes.

244
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,726
- It's too late.
- He should just end it then.

245
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,897
(He should just end it then.)

246
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:39,497
- Right?
- It's over for him already.

247
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,067
(Shocked)

248
00:09:43,637 --> 00:09:47,207
That's why you like these colours.

249
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:50,776
No, I chose these specifically because I was coming to see you.

250
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:52,477
I put on a suit I never usually wear.

251
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:55,147
- Do you not like it?
- No, that's not it.

252
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:56,887
She doesn't seem to like it.

253
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:00,286
(He chose his outfit with much anticipation.)

254
00:10:00,287 --> 00:10:02,857
- It's strictly my personal opinion.
- Right.

255
00:10:03,487 --> 00:10:06,596
Priests usually wear colours like that, you see.

256
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:08,967
(Priests usually wear colours like that, you see.)

257
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:12,536
(Kwang Kyu's outfit is full of grace.)

258
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:13,567
I can see it.

259
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,707
Right?

260
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:17,337
- Holy.
- Priests...

261
00:10:17,607 --> 00:10:18,707
Here's why.

262
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:21,546
- I was trying to...
- Priests...

263
00:10:21,547 --> 00:10:22,876
- usually go for that colour.
- Ma'am,

264
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:24,746
when you go to the Vatican, you see people in this colour.

265
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,477
Bald and...

266
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:29,746
Cardinals usually. You see a lot of them there.

267
00:10:29,747 --> 00:10:32,016
- Right.
- Or bishops.

268
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:34,526
It's my first time seeing you again after "Three Wheels."

269
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,857
- Is it really?
- So I chose this outfit carefully.

270
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:38,696
If you don't like it, I will go get changed.

271
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:40,557
No, there's no need.

272
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,897
I love all clergymen.

273
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,737
Your pants.

274
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:48,706
(Getting up)

275
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:50,167
Right. You look much better without the jacket.

276
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:52,237
Goodness, take that jacket off.

277
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:54,307
(She must've wanted him to take off the jacket.)

278
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,076
- Now that's much better, isn't it?
- It is.

279
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:57,276
Much better.

280
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:58,346
- Yes.
- Much better without the jacket.

281
00:10:58,347 --> 00:11:00,177
He even wore this hideous hat,

282
00:11:00,447 --> 00:11:01,917
so I threw it away.

283
00:11:02,447 --> 00:11:04,556
He wore it, saying you might like it.

284
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,356
But it was a hat even Lee Soon Jae...

285
00:11:06,357 --> 00:11:07,856
- and Shin Gu wouldn't wear.
- No.

286
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:10,086
It's like the hat Shin Gu usually wears.

287
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,256
He doesn't wear one with that pattern.

288
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,857
Whether it's a man or a woman,

289
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:14,927
I hate one wearing a hat.

290
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,197
Did you hear that?

291
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,396
(He doesn't seem to be My Star's type.)

292
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:20,196
You were right.

293
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:22,037
Yes, I don't like hats.

294
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:27,677
Ichon-dong isn't a good place for me.

295
00:11:29,907 --> 00:11:31,276
Where do you want to sit then?

296
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:32,477
- I will...
- You can sit there.

297
00:11:32,847 --> 00:11:34,247
- Should I sit over there?
- Yes.

298
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:36,647
(Who's this lady who's been standing next to them?)

299
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,087
Teach them.

300
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:39,657
What?

301
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:42,527
(Lee So Yeong, Writer)

302
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:46,027
(She goes wherever My Star goes.)

303
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:48,466
(Writer Lee So Yeong is My Star's friend of 14 years, )

304
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,667
(who is much like her own daughter.)

305
00:11:51,097 --> 00:11:53,566
I wrote down...

306
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,466
- her schedule today.
- Okay.

307
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:56,936
Please take a look at it.

308
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:59,377
If you have any questions, I will tell you.

309
00:11:59,477 --> 00:12:00,876
(My Star's Handbook)

310
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:02,476
(Her lifelong bucket list at 60)

311
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:03,806
(Visiting the Soonpoong Postpartum Care Center site together)

312
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:05,246
(Expect bold, borderline-R-rated banter and react accordingly)

313
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,176
To spend time with her,

314
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:10,017
you should understand her better.

315
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,186
I thought I would give you a few tips.

316
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:14,227
Right.

317
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:17,227
First, she's a little impatient.

318
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:18,926
- Is she?
- So...

319
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:22,396
you need to understand what's going on inside her.

320
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:25,396
She won't tell you each time how she feels about something.

321
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:27,496
So you should read the room...

322
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,467
and understand what she wants.

323
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:34,246
For example, if she says, "There's a cafe here."

324
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,207
It means she wants coffee.

325
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:38,376
She could just say so.

326
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,316
Right.

327
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:42,286
It's because I am originally from Chungcheong Province.

328
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:43,386
Is that right?

329
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,457
As a manager, it's important...

330
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:49,827
that you understand her needs.

331
00:12:50,057 --> 00:12:52,796
(I don't know. Just get what I want.)

332
00:12:52,797 --> 00:12:56,127
She's worked her whole life without a manager.

333
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,666
(She's worked...)

334
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,036
(her whole life...)

335
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:04,106
(without a manager?)

336
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,476
Today is the first time for her...

337
00:13:06,477 --> 00:13:08,146
to have a manager in 60 years.

338
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,147
It's true.

339
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,516
(Grumpy Secretaries are My Star's first-ever managers.)

340
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,076
That makes this day a memorable day.

341
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:14,787
I'm truly happy for her,

342
00:13:14,847 --> 00:13:16,616
but there's something that worries me a little.

343
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:17,717
What would that be?

344
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:21,156
I've never had a secretary, so I wouldn't know.

345
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,657
But personally, I find having either a secretary...

346
00:13:22,987 --> 00:13:26,226
or a manager inconvenient.

347
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:28,327
(I find it inconvenient.)

348
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:32,696
(We're here to do that job.)

349
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:34,666
How do you manage going to shoots then?

350
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:36,907
I guess I have to put up with it now.

351
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,676
How did you manage going to shoots then?

352
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:39,936
I went alone.

353
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,007
- You went alone?
- For 60 years I've been doing this,

354
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:43,746
I put makeup on myself,

355
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:45,746
and I did my own hair. I did everything on my own.

356
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:46,776
- Did you really?
- Yes.

357
00:13:46,777 --> 00:13:48,686
- And you drove yourself?
- I drove.

358
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:49,887
For 60 whole years.

359
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:52,286
Since when have you been driving?

360
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:53,757
It's been 60 years.

361
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,326
- You've been driving...
- I've been driving...

362
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:57,757
since I was 23 years old.

363
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:01,366
Did you drive yourself even when the location...

364
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:02,466
- was far?
- I drove even if it was far.

365
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,026
I drove to Busan and Gangwon Province.

366
00:14:04,027 --> 00:14:05,467
- You drove?
- Yes.

367
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:07,397
- She must drive better than we do.
- So...

368
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:09,167
- I'm sure.
- Until now...

369
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,237
In 60 years of my life,

370
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:14,807
I have never let anyone else drive for me.

371
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:17,147
I wouldn't even let my daughter drive for me.

372
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:19,276
Even when she offers, I say no.

373
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:21,086
I let her sit next to me.

374
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,786
I'd rather be the driver.

375
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:24,046
(The designated driver is flustered.)

376
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:26,386
The secretary has to sit at the back,

377
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:27,686
and I should sit in the front.

378
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:28,986
In the front seat?

379
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:30,856
- Yes.
- Can he drive though?

380
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,827
He can drive, and I will sit next to him.

381
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:34,826
The secretary will sit at the back.

382
00:14:34,827 --> 00:14:36,897
- I will sit at the back.
- Okay.

383
00:14:36,997 --> 00:14:39,196
(I am a secretary too.)

384
00:14:39,197 --> 00:14:42,067
I should think that I'm serving the secretary.

385
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:44,877
I guess you like driving then?

386
00:14:45,237 --> 00:14:47,136
I feel comfortable when I drive.

387
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,877
I'm good at playing by myself.

388
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,976
(My Star loves to drive.)

389
00:14:51,977 --> 00:14:54,217
(She drives around the entire nation.)

390
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,286
(Reading My Star's Handbook)

391
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,586
You're going to see a realtor today?

392
00:14:58,587 --> 00:14:59,587
Yes.

393
00:14:59,588 --> 00:15:02,086
(Incheon Ganghwa Island, meeting a realtor)

394
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:03,727
What's the reason?

395
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:06,526
It's her bucket list.

396
00:15:06,527 --> 00:15:07,627
(My Star's Bucket List)

397
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:09,667
(Buying a property is in her bucket list?)

398
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:13,267
Let me tell you about it.

399
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,567
(Actually, My Star Yong Yeo is...)

400
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:18,377
(I used to own four houses.)

401
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:21,037
(She's the rich grandma, real estate investment genius.)

402
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:24,046
(Don't buy a house on a slope.)

403
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:25,777
(The rigid rulebook for house-hunting)

404
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,886
(This is a nice place to buy.)

405
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:30,447
(- Next to the road! - That's right!)

406
00:15:30,747 --> 00:15:31,856
(Off to discover My Star's bucket list, )

407
00:15:31,857 --> 00:15:32,957
(together with her Grumpy Secretaries)

408
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:36,186
(From overlooked details...)

409
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:38,396
(to master-level big-picture plans, )

410
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:39,796
(My Star crunches numbers...)

411
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:41,227
(like a real estate genius.)

412
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,096
(Rich grandma drops...)

413
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:45,536
(her top-tier property-scouting secrets!)

414
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,637
I have contacted a few agencies.

415
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:52,407
Your job is to accompany her to visit several properties.

416
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:53,776
- Will do.
- Thank you.

417
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:54,777
We will do our best.

418
00:15:54,778 --> 00:15:56,806
(The former real estate assistant is confident.)

419
00:15:56,807 --> 00:15:58,716
(Feeling reassured)

420
00:15:58,717 --> 00:15:59,746
Yes?

421
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:01,316
- That's my car.
- Right.

422
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:03,586
- You can just open the door.
- Okay.

423
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,256
(For the first time on the show, they will take My Star's car.)

424
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,257
It's a huge car.

425
00:16:10,787 --> 00:16:12,426
(Please get in, ma'am.)

426
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:15,427
It's my first time to have someone open the door for me.

427
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:18,237
What a happy life I have!

428
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,766
It's my first time to have someone open the door.

429
00:16:20,767 --> 00:16:23,037
(As an experienced caretaker, he assists her skilfully.)

430
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:25,706
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

431
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:27,006
(With his escort, she gets in the passenger seat.)

432
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,777
(He carefully closes the door too.)

433
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:34,486
(Taking a look around)

434
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,887
This is a big car.

435
00:16:37,147 --> 00:16:38,317
How is this big?

436
00:16:39,087 --> 00:16:40,116
It's not big.

437
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:41,757
(Feeling pressured)

438
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:44,926
(As My Star requested, )

439
00:16:44,927 --> 00:16:46,156
(Seo Jin gets in the back.)

440
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,756
Should we put that in the trunk?

441
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,626
- No, I can put it here.
- Is it all right?

442
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:50,926
It might rain.

443
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,366
(Moving the tissue box)

444
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:55,207
Let's put the umbrella in the trunk.

445
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,506
(My Star's things welcome the Grumpy Secretary.)

446
00:16:57,507 --> 00:16:59,607
My car's messy.

447
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:04,307
It's fine as long as the car doesn't break down, right?

448
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:05,747
This is such a nice car.

449
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:09,316
Let's put the umbrella in the trunk.

450
00:17:09,317 --> 00:17:10,687
- It's fine.
- Is it okay?

451
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:15,257
(The former porter rides in the back.)

452
00:17:16,027 --> 00:17:19,296
(Caretaker Fairy is in the car too.)

453
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:21,266
- Please wear your seatbelt.
- I will.

454
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,296
Okay.

455
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:23,896
Where is the first location?

456
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:25,067
Should I give you the address?

457
00:17:25,297 --> 00:17:26,597
What is it you want to do?

458
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:29,067
What is it you want to do? Where will you go?

459
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:31,977
Can I have my phone?

460
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:33,137
From my bag.

461
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:35,777
Should I connect this to the phone?

462
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:37,947
That's for the GPS navigation.

463
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:40,317
- I've never used it before.
- Try it.

464
00:17:40,747 --> 00:17:42,717
(Kwang Kyu is a digital novice.)

465
00:17:42,947 --> 00:17:44,587
TMAP. There you go.

466
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:46,156
(Suddenly, music is on.)

467
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:47,187
Turn it off.

468
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,097
- Your phone is...
- Who is playing this music?

469
00:17:52,997 --> 00:17:54,597
- Is it your phone?
- It must be mine.

470
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:57,666
(Busy fingers)

471
00:17:57,667 --> 00:17:59,736
Why is that music suddenly playing?

472
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,067
Press that first.

473
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,436
- No, that.
- Right.

474
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:04,807
Let's use mine.

475
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,206
- Yours is connected.
- It's connected.

476
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,306
- T.
- There. TMAP.

477
00:18:09,307 --> 00:18:10,876
Open TMAP.

478
00:18:10,877 --> 00:18:12,147
It's TMAP.

479
00:18:13,017 --> 00:18:14,177
Where will you go?

480
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:16,246
- It's Ganghwa Island...
- Write that down.

481
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:18,217
Write down the address here.

482
00:18:19,587 --> 00:18:22,027
I can't believe I am the one teaching you.

483
00:18:22,557 --> 00:18:25,556
Because he's my first driver,

484
00:18:25,557 --> 00:18:26,856
I have to teach him.

485
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,266
Secretary, tell him.

486
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,566
- I will do it for him.
- You don't know anything.

487
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,126
- It's okay.
- Give me the address.

488
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:32,436
It's Ganghwa-eup.

489
00:18:32,437 --> 00:18:34,136
- Ganghwa-eup.
- Ganghwa-eup.

490
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,206
(He finally manages to set the destination.)

491
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:37,367
Let's go.

492
00:18:40,937 --> 00:18:42,277
Right turn there.

493
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:44,147
- Right turn.
- Yes.

494
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:47,117
Relax and drive now.

495
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:50,516
- I will.
- You have to think...

496
00:18:50,517 --> 00:18:53,056
that you're driving alone.

497
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:55,486
(My Star's Schedule)

498
00:18:55,487 --> 00:18:57,827
(11am, drive to Ganghwa Island)

499
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:01,126
Did you choose Ganghwa yourself?

500
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:02,266
Or did someone from there recommend it?

501
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,796
I go to Bomun Temple...

502
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,036
- in Ganghwa.
- Right.

503
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:06,867
Bomun Temple in Ganghwa is nice.

504
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,537
You had to ride a boat to get there 40 years ago.

505
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:13,437
But now they've built a road.

506
00:19:13,677 --> 00:19:16,377
You can now get there in just two and a half hours.

507
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,617
It's still far.

508
00:19:18,717 --> 00:19:20,746
Two and a half hours isn't far.

509
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,646
- Did you go there alone?
- Of course I did. Who else?

510
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:23,746
It's not easy to drive...

511
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:25,857
- for two and a half hours alone.
- I love it.

512
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:27,657
I am good at playing alone.

513
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:31,157
It's tiring to play with people.

514
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:33,927
(Right. I see.)

515
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:36,667
(They suddenly feel sorry.)

516
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:39,597
(Looking around)

517
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,277
My throat is in bad shape.

518
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,506
I guess we need to get some water.

519
00:19:48,507 --> 00:19:49,846
- Water...
- I've got a lot here.

520
00:19:49,847 --> 00:19:50,976
- Do you need water?
- You brought it?

521
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:53,247
Thank you. I've got mine.

522
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:56,517
(He understood her need right away.)

523
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,987
I've got mine.

524
00:19:58,657 --> 00:20:00,316
- You can have this.
- But I have one right here.

525
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:01,426
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

526
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:02,556
- You're a great secretary.
- I will...

527
00:20:02,557 --> 00:20:03,586
(Thank you very much.)

528
00:20:03,587 --> 00:20:04,756
- You're a great secretary.
- I will...

529
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:06,797
hand it to you once you get the medicine.

530
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:08,527
Or I will open that for you.

531
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:11,436
- Open it for her.
- My throat is in bad shape.

532
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:12,966
Are you recovering from a cold?

533
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,566
My throat has gone weird.

534
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:17,966
I saw it on your YouTube channel. You were taking some medicine.

535
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,137
- Goodness.
- I will get that.

536
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:22,677
(He collects trash.)

537
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:25,176
(Looking around)

538
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:26,916
I guess the trash bin is in the back.

539
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:28,317
(It means you should put the trash in the back.)

540
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,216
I am not sure if this is a trash bin,

541
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:31,887
but there's definitely trash here.

542
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,387
To be honest, my car is messy.

543
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:36,487
Don't say that.

544
00:20:36,488 --> 00:20:39,296
As long as my seat is clean, I am all set, you know.

545
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:41,726
I put everything else here or in the back.

546
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,497
It's quite a mess in the back.

547
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,867
It's much cleaner than my car.

548
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:49,007
As long as it doesn't break, it's all good, isn't it?

549
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:51,067
This is such a nice car.

550
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:52,906
It's not that nice.

551
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:54,576
At this age, I deserve to ride a car this nice.

552
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:57,076
(I am Yong Yeo.)

553
00:20:57,077 --> 00:20:58,877
(Respectful)

554
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,686
And I drive it myself too.

555
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:03,417
(Rich Grandma's unapologetic flex)

556
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:06,787
It's my first time to let someone else take the wheel.

557
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:09,057
(First-ever designated driver)

558
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:12,027
You must be surprised that I am not the one driving.

559
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:13,957
I'm sorry.

560
00:21:14,327 --> 00:21:16,697
- You're sorry.
- Yes, I should've driven.

561
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,697
I always thank my car.

562
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:22,167
- You talk to your car.
- Of course.

563
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:23,966
When I'm driving alone, I say,

564
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,877
"Thank you for taking me everywhere."

565
00:21:27,307 --> 00:21:28,377
This is nice.

566
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:29,976
(Building connections with her car every day, )

567
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:32,277
(she hasn't let anyone take the wheel.)

568
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:35,817
(Glancing over)

569
00:21:36,017 --> 00:21:37,986
Now that I'm not driving,

570
00:21:37,987 --> 00:21:39,916
I can check out the surroundings.

571
00:21:39,917 --> 00:21:40,917
Yes.

572
00:21:41,587 --> 00:21:44,556
It's strangely nice to take the passenger seat.

573
00:21:44,557 --> 00:21:46,297
(The scenery from the passenger seat is unfamiliar, but nice.)

574
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:48,926
(Glancing over)

575
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,427
(Glancing over)

576
00:21:51,297 --> 00:21:53,737
(He turns on the right turn signal.)

577
00:21:55,437 --> 00:21:57,507
- Enter through here.
- Okay.

578
00:21:58,537 --> 00:21:59,607
(Looking)

579
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:01,547
(Looking)

580
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:03,077
(Looking)

581
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:05,017
Ms. Sunwoo is checking the road.

582
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:06,576
She must be nervous.

583
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:08,077
Drive properly, okay?

584
00:22:09,187 --> 00:22:12,257
I... I was looking too.

585
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:13,517
Okay.

586
00:22:14,257 --> 00:22:15,527
You need to go straight.

587
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:17,027
Make a right turn here.

588
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:19,997
- Go in there.
- I...

589
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:24,296
(Nervous)

590
00:22:24,297 --> 00:22:26,266
Although he has driven a taxi,

591
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:28,467
- his driving makes you nervous.
- It isn't like that.

592
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:32,237
It's different from driving alone.

593
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:37,807
Driving the car of someone...

594
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:41,447
who doesn't usually let another person take the wheel...

595
00:22:41,817 --> 00:22:44,287
is very nerve-racking.

596
00:22:47,357 --> 00:22:48,787
Go in there.

597
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:51,426
(He's expected to have a difficult drive today.)

598
00:22:51,427 --> 00:22:52,897
Okay. Thank you.

599
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:55,497
(I feel bad for my older brother.)

600
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,096
Did you skip breakfast today?

601
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:01,936
- No. I had...
- Okay.

602
00:23:01,937 --> 00:23:04,537
I had yogurt in the morning.

603
00:23:05,277 --> 00:23:08,137
Plain yogurt. That's my breakfast.

604
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:10,947
That and two eggs.

605
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:14,177
- But I didn't have eggs today.
- Why not?

606
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:16,017
I forgot to pack them after boiling them.

607
00:23:16,217 --> 00:23:17,586
I got distracted since you guys were coming.

608
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:18,716
Oh, no.

609
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:20,757
So I only had yogurt.

610
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,827
- Oh, no.
- Don't you drink coffee?

611
00:23:22,957 --> 00:23:24,826
- I stopped drinking coffee.
- Did you stop?

612
00:23:24,827 --> 00:23:26,696
My daughter made me stop drinking coffee.

613
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,896
- Really?
- Yes.

614
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:31,266
So I drink green tea, barley tea,

615
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:32,336
(Listening)

616
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:34,337
and other types of tea.

617
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:38,137
I drink ginger tea a lot.

618
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:40,106
We're in trouble! He's yawning!

619
00:23:40,107 --> 00:23:41,977
It isn't like that.

620
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,306
(He got caught in the act.)

621
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:46,916
I was so excited last night that I couldn't sleep.

622
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:48,746
- Don't lie!
- I'm serious.

623
00:23:48,747 --> 00:23:50,886
- I'm serious.
- You're driving me crazy.

624
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,056
I'm serious.

625
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:53,186
- Why would you tell such a lie?
- Kwang Kyu...

626
00:23:53,187 --> 00:23:55,187
tells a lot of white lies these days.

627
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,486
(No one believes him.)

628
00:23:57,487 --> 00:23:59,996
He tells white lies on this show.

629
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:01,126
- For goodness' sake.
- That isn't true.

630
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:02,526
I'm serious.

631
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:04,396
How can I sleep...

632
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:05,966
when your words are so entertaining?

633
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:08,536
- Okay. I'll keep chitchatting then.
- Okay.

634
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:11,437
The passenger seat is for chitchatting.

635
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:13,536
You should keep talking...

636
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,307
if the manager seems to be drowsy.

637
00:24:16,677 --> 00:24:18,447
How did this happen?

638
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,776
I feel like I'm serving you guys.

639
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:22,017
No, Ma'am.

640
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:23,816
It isn't like that.

641
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:25,556
(Today as well, My Star looks after the secretaries.)

642
00:24:25,557 --> 00:24:27,456
- Seriously.
- Of course.

643
00:24:27,457 --> 00:24:28,527
(Of course.)

644
00:24:29,787 --> 00:24:33,456
I lived in California in the 80s.

645
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:34,966
I went there in 1982.

646
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,066
I went there in 1986.

647
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:38,097
I see.

648
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,036
I visited LA often.

649
00:24:41,037 --> 00:24:42,207
- I see.
- Yes.

650
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,177
I did all sorts of jobs.

651
00:24:46,237 --> 00:24:47,706
There's nothing I haven't done.

652
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:48,777
In the US?

653
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:51,847
When I went to the US,

654
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:54,417
I gave up on acting.

655
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,217
I thought, "I'll live in the US from now on."

656
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,757
"I'll do anything in the US."

657
00:25:01,087 --> 00:25:02,186
- Did you run a restaurant?
- So...

658
00:25:02,187 --> 00:25:04,827
in the US, I ran a sewing factory at first.

659
00:25:05,397 --> 00:25:08,627
After that, I ran a restaurant. Then, I ran a hair salon.

660
00:25:09,197 --> 00:25:10,696
- Did you run a restaurant?
- What?

661
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,767
- Did you run a restaurant?
- I ran a restaurant for five years.

662
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,336
- A Korean restaurant.
- Where?

663
00:25:14,337 --> 00:25:15,606
- In the US?
- Where in the US?

664
00:25:15,607 --> 00:25:16,806
- LA?
- LA.

665
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,336
- Koreatown?
- Yes, Koreatown.

666
00:25:18,337 --> 00:25:20,736
I studied it for a year before moving there.

667
00:25:20,737 --> 00:25:21,776
Cooking?

668
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:24,207
I studied Korean cuisine for a year.

669
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:25,917
It was called Hyang Mi Korean Restaurant.

670
00:25:26,147 --> 00:25:28,077
I went bankrupt by running that restaurant.

671
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,416
- What?
- I ran it for five years in the US.

672
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,417
Did you go bankrupt?

673
00:25:32,418 --> 00:25:34,156
- Well, I didn't go bankrupt.
- Okay.

674
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:38,056
In any case, I made a mistake in the contract...

675
00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:39,427
and lost the restaurant.

676
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:41,796
I guess I went bankrupt in a sense.

677
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:43,367
That was when I came back to Korea.

678
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:45,737
I came back, starred in "History Goes On,"

679
00:25:45,937 --> 00:25:47,597
and worked without rest.

680
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:49,107
After that...

681
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,006
- After that first drama, - After that...

682
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,106
- you didn't take a single break.
- That's right.

683
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:55,247
I didn't take a single break. I starred in 3 or 4 dramas at once.

684
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:58,377
My husband spent money happily,

685
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:00,676
and I earned money happily.

686
00:26:00,677 --> 00:26:03,987
When you're married, you shouldn't brag about...

687
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:07,717
making money to your spouse.

688
00:26:08,087 --> 00:26:09,557
A married couple should be like that,

689
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:11,687
So meet a woman like that.

690
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:15,167
- Okay?
- I want to do that.

691
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:17,097
You'll be able to do that.

692
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:18,797
(Laughing)

693
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:20,536
- Seo Jin, you too.
- Okay.

694
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,167
It's time to pick someone.

695
00:26:22,437 --> 00:26:24,007
- Seo Jin, you too.
- Okay.

696
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:27,036
(Not even Seo Jin can avoid My Star's pressure to get married.)

697
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,747
You need to get married next year.

698
00:26:29,407 --> 00:26:33,077
Of course, a man can have a baby even when he's 60 years old.

699
00:26:33,517 --> 00:26:35,147
You told me earlier that it was too late for me.

700
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:37,916
You can be like Kim Yong Gun.

701
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,657
He had a baby.

702
00:26:39,757 --> 00:26:40,916
(At the age of 75,)

703
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,086
(Yong Gun had a baby.)

704
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:44,557
After having a baby,

705
00:26:45,157 --> 00:26:46,926
Yong Gun filmed so many commercials.

706
00:26:46,927 --> 00:26:48,627
- He did well.
- He filmed commercials...

707
00:26:48,997 --> 00:26:50,396
for medicinal tonics...

708
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:51,596
- for strength.
- Then...

709
00:26:51,597 --> 00:26:53,766
I bet his son brought him good fortune.

710
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:54,997
I guess so.

711
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:56,407
He did well.

712
00:26:56,737 --> 00:26:58,507
It was a good idea to do that for his child.

713
00:26:58,607 --> 00:26:59,836
His son brought him good fortune.

714
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:01,606
I'll pluck up my courage.

715
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:05,147
(I'll pluck up my courage.)

716
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:08,687
Get married and have a child.

717
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:10,447
My goodness.

718
00:27:14,987 --> 00:27:16,957
The rice plants are turning golden.

719
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:18,327
Yes.

720
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:19,927
The rice plants.

721
00:27:19,928 --> 00:27:21,256
(Outside the window, )

722
00:27:21,257 --> 00:27:22,626
Time passes so quickly.

723
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:24,396
(the world is dyed in autumnal colours.)

724
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:26,097
It feels just like yesterday that people planted them.

725
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,806
Isn't it really nice to enter nature?

726
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,407
It's nice.

727
00:27:33,307 --> 00:27:34,676
(As they enjoy the scenery)

728
00:27:34,677 --> 00:27:37,046
We need to cross this bridge to enter Ganghwa.

729
00:27:37,047 --> 00:27:38,977
Yes. We entered Ganghwa.

730
00:27:39,877 --> 00:27:41,647
The trip takes no time when you chitchat.

731
00:27:43,687 --> 00:27:45,987
(My star must be hungry.)

732
00:27:47,217 --> 00:27:50,186
Ms. Sunwoo, do you want to have lunch or check out the house...

733
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:51,756
- upon arrival?
- Right.

734
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:54,056
- We should have lunch 1st.
- We should have lunch 1st, right?

735
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:56,967
Okay. I punched in the address in the GPS,

736
00:27:57,097 --> 00:27:58,666
but I'll look for a restaurant when we get near.

737
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,867
- Okay.
- Yes.

738
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,106
You're the best.

739
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:03,436
(My secretary is the best.)

740
00:28:03,437 --> 00:28:05,207
(Showing off his cute dimples)

741
00:28:07,737 --> 00:28:09,706
Why don't we eat some meat?

742
00:28:09,707 --> 00:28:12,147
(Why don't we eat some meat?)

743
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:13,846
That sounds great.

744
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:15,887
- Meat sounds good, right?
- Beef?

745
00:28:16,147 --> 00:28:17,787
- Beef.
- Beef sounds good, right?

746
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,417
- Yes.
- Beef is great.

747
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:22,087
It's good to have a hearty meal for lunch.

748
00:28:22,727 --> 00:28:26,157
Now that I'm old, I can't eat a lot in the evening.

749
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:27,726
Is there a good restaurant for bulgogi?

750
00:28:27,727 --> 00:28:30,297
- Well, steak works too.
- Bulgogi?

751
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:32,337
Steak?

752
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:34,696
(Steak?)

753
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:36,666
It doesn't have to be steak.

754
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,336
(Steak in Ganghwa?)

755
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:39,337
But...

756
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,277
But we're in the countryside.

757
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:44,577
(Will there be a steak restaurant?)

758
00:28:44,578 --> 00:28:45,947
I think there are only fields.

759
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:47,076
Seriously.

760
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:48,316
(I'm Lee Seo Jin, )

761
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:53,157
(the man who served Korean food to the grandpas in Europe.)

762
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:56,956
(If the task is finding a steak restaurant in Ganghwa, )

763
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:58,656
I see a big building.

764
00:28:58,657 --> 00:29:00,526
(I'll succeed in it.)

765
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,166
It wouldn't be anywhere but there.

766
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:03,367
(He searches nonstop during the drive to Ganghwa.)

767
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:07,497
(His lips go dry.)

768
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:12,076
I think we should go back a little.

769
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:13,807
- Shall I make a U-turn?
- Yes. Go back.

770
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:17,947
- For how long?
- What?

771
00:29:18,777 --> 00:29:20,317
Not much. Ten minutes.

772
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,286
- Ten minutes? Should I go straight?
- Yes.

773
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,517
Turn left over there.

774
00:29:24,517 --> 00:29:25,887
- Are we going back?
- Yes.

775
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:30,657
- Do I turn right or go straight?
- Turn right.

776
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:33,796
Go straight.

777
00:29:33,797 --> 00:29:34,897
- Go straight?
- Yes.

778
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:36,996
- Turn right.
- Turn right?

779
00:29:36,997 --> 00:29:38,796
(Are you sure there's a steak restaurant?)

780
00:29:38,797 --> 00:29:40,297
- Go straight?
- Yes.

781
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,776
(He can't stop yawning even during that time.)

782
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:47,377
(Wary)

783
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:49,206
Aren't we going too far?

784
00:29:49,207 --> 00:29:50,477
We're nearly there.

785
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:52,816
(Kwang Kyu keeps driving down the road.)

786
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,046
I just saw a butcher's restaurant.

787
00:29:54,047 --> 00:29:56,286
(He spots a butcher's restaurant.)

788
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:57,887
I just saw a butcher's restaurant.

789
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:00,716
I saw a big sign for Korean beef.

790
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,486
But it's a butcher's restaurant.

791
00:30:03,487 --> 00:30:05,756
- Really?
- The place I found will be better.

792
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:07,756
(Not a butcher's restaurant)

793
00:30:07,757 --> 00:30:09,827
(Disappointed)

794
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:12,737
I guess we're going to a nice place.

795
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:17,806
(What kind of a restaurant did Seo Jin find for My Star?)

796
00:30:17,807 --> 00:30:18,907
Is this the restaurant?

797
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:22,046
- The black building?
- Enter through the right.

798
00:30:22,047 --> 00:30:24,447
(They finally arrive at the restaurant.)

799
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:26,347
- Shall we go?
- Okay.

800
00:30:26,477 --> 00:30:28,147
- Thank you for driving.
- Okay.

801
00:30:28,647 --> 00:30:30,687
Thank you. All right.

802
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:34,957
(He gets My Star's handbag.)

803
00:30:35,427 --> 00:30:37,686
My back hurts.

804
00:30:37,687 --> 00:30:38,756
(Hunched)

805
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:39,856
Are you okay?

806
00:30:39,857 --> 00:30:40,997
(Their average age is 55.5.)

807
00:30:41,657 --> 00:30:43,827
(He didn't forget My Star's handbag.)

808
00:30:44,197 --> 00:30:45,797
Which one is the restaurant?

809
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:47,436
You can go in through that door.

810
00:30:47,437 --> 00:30:48,596
(After being in pain for a short moment, )

811
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,167
(he runs over to guide her to the restaurant.)

812
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:51,507
(Glancing over)

813
00:30:51,837 --> 00:30:52,906
What do they sell?

814
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:55,207
Hey, this isn't a meat restaurant.

815
00:30:55,677 --> 00:30:58,206
- This place?
- What?

816
00:30:58,207 --> 00:30:59,476
This one looks nice, right?

817
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:00,716
- This one.
- Chuck flap tail.

818
00:31:00,717 --> 00:31:01,916
You wanted something like this.

819
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:03,146
- A steak.
- I'll eat this.

820
00:31:03,147 --> 00:31:04,147
- Okay.
- Really?

821
00:31:04,617 --> 00:31:06,586
(He found a steak in Ganghwa!)

822
00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:09,026
I thought you'd like the cubed chuck flap tail meal.

823
00:31:09,027 --> 00:31:10,686
- I like this one. I'll eat this.
- A steak.

824
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,997
- Okay.
- Really? Let's go inside.

825
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,367
- Let's go inside.
- How cool.

826
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,737
Prime chuck flap tail.

827
00:31:18,867 --> 00:31:19,867
(Turning his head)

828
00:31:20,497 --> 00:31:21,637
Let's eat together.

829
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:25,377
Korean beef. Prime Korean beef.

830
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:28,437
From the photos, the restaurant was atmospheric too.

831
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,406
I'll use the restaurant first.

832
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:32,747
The restroom is here.

833
00:31:33,647 --> 00:31:35,816
(After guiding her to the restroom, )

834
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:37,146
(he walks forward to secure a table.)

835
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,916
- Hello.
- Hello.

836
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:40,186
(His eyes dart quickly.)

837
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:42,017
- Hello.
- Hello.

838
00:31:42,157 --> 00:31:43,157
- Welcome.
- Hello.

839
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:44,386
- Are you the owner?
- Yes.

840
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:46,396
Would it be okay to film...

841
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:47,896
during the meal?

842
00:31:47,897 --> 00:31:48,926
Of course.

843
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:50,526
- Okay.
- I'll guide you to the table.

844
00:31:50,527 --> 00:31:51,796
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

845
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,967
(He lingers while Kwang Kyu settles down.)

846
00:31:54,897 --> 00:31:56,337
You found a nice restaurant.

847
00:31:57,807 --> 00:31:59,376
(Seo Jin was waiting for My Star...)

848
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:02,176
(to come back from the restroom.)

849
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:03,876
(He's an expert when it comes to looking after senior citizens.)

850
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:05,977
You'll need this if your family is big, right?

851
00:32:06,877 --> 00:32:09,016
People don't eat much at home.

852
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:10,217
You're right. I'm the same.

853
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,716
There's a salad bar as well.

854
00:32:12,717 --> 00:32:14,156
Yes, there's a salad bar.

855
00:32:14,157 --> 00:32:15,387
- It's nice.
- Yes.

856
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:18,157
- Let's go further inside.
- Further inside? Okay.

857
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:19,656
(My Star loves the restaurant Seo Jin has picked.)

858
00:32:19,657 --> 00:32:20,727
Hello.

859
00:32:20,997 --> 00:32:22,426
Please take your time.

860
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:23,597
- Can you see the words?
- No.

861
00:32:24,127 --> 00:32:25,367
You should do it.

862
00:32:26,197 --> 00:32:27,697
(Getting to work)

863
00:32:27,837 --> 00:32:28,967
Read them to me.

864
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,667
Move it here.

865
00:32:31,507 --> 00:32:33,037
Move it here. There you go.

866
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:35,207
I still can't see the words.

867
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:36,947
This one has...

868
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:39,046
the premium strip steak...

869
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:41,077
in bite-sized pieces...

870
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,416
and seven vegetables in bite-sized pieces.

871
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:44,517
Okay.

872
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:46,817
- Does that sound good?
- That sounds good.

873
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,857
What would you like to drink?

874
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:53,226
I just want warm water.

875
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:55,157
(My Star has requested warm water.)

876
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:57,166
(He puts in the order first.)

877
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,837
(The order is complete.)

878
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:02,067
(After completing the order, Seo Jin comes out.)

879
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,607
(Looking around)

880
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:08,737
(Where is warm water?)

881
00:33:14,317 --> 00:33:15,547
Is this water?

882
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,316
You can use the water purifier.

883
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:21,156
- You can have it warm or cold.
- Warm water.

884
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:22,387
(Chuckling)

885
00:33:23,057 --> 00:33:25,527
(He gets warm water.)

886
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:29,267
(Here comes warm water.)

887
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,026
Back in the day, when you were in...

888
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,096
(Here you go.)

889
00:33:33,097 --> 00:33:34,566
Ma'am, it might be a bit hot.

890
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,767
Thank you.

891
00:33:36,837 --> 00:33:38,537
- You need to put it back up.
- You're a great secretary.

892
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:43,177
He went as soon as I asked.

893
00:33:43,307 --> 00:33:44,506
A secretary should be like that.

894
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:45,776
Did you say that you were thirsty?

895
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:47,376
When I asked for warm water,

896
00:33:47,377 --> 00:33:48,616
he left right away...

897
00:33:48,617 --> 00:33:50,017
and brought this back.

898
00:33:50,247 --> 00:33:51,686
(I see.)

899
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:53,417
Why didn't I hear that?

900
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:57,657
(They get a side dish first.)

901
00:33:58,357 --> 00:34:01,357
(Seo Jin tastes it.)

902
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:03,466
- There are beans inside.
- I won't eat it.

903
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:04,467
Okay.

904
00:34:04,997 --> 00:34:07,167
(My Star has distinct tastes.)

905
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:09,936
(Then I'll move it right away.)

906
00:34:09,937 --> 00:34:12,577
Do you have any rules on what you eat or do not eat?

907
00:34:12,977 --> 00:34:15,006
You get a sense of it when you reach my age.

908
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,176
If she doesn't want it, she doesn't eat it.

909
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:17,406
- That's right.
- When you look at it...

910
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:19,516
But she could've liked something in her younger days.

911
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:22,487
If it's sweet food... When it comes to food,

912
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:24,616
(Getting up)

913
00:34:24,617 --> 00:34:26,917
you need to eat differently depending on your age group.

914
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,157
When it comes to food,

915
00:34:29,557 --> 00:34:31,827
you need to eat differently depending on your age group.

916
00:34:32,797 --> 00:34:34,356
You can eat anything when you're young.

917
00:34:34,357 --> 00:34:36,897
- Of course.
- But when you reach middle age,

918
00:34:37,797 --> 00:34:39,767
- you begin to feel it.
- Okay.

919
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:41,966
When you reach old age,

920
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,937
you figure out what you shouldn't eat.

921
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,476
You should drink less.

922
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:48,036
- What?
- You reached old age.

923
00:34:48,037 --> 00:34:50,676
You're past middle age, okay?

924
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:53,077
Saying that I reached old age in front of Ms. Sunwoo...

925
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:54,946
- is ill-mannered.
- He's a middle-aged man.

926
00:34:54,947 --> 00:34:56,286
- A middle-aged man.
- A middle-aged man.

927
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:57,887
It's really like that.

928
00:34:58,447 --> 00:35:00,257
If you drink less, you'll be comfortable in your old age.

929
00:35:01,587 --> 00:35:03,457
I try to drink in moderation.

930
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:05,627
After a few drinks, I'm done.

931
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:09,026
But when he gets excited, he begs me to drink more.

932
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:10,726
- Don't be like that.
- I usually don't drink much.

933
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,196
And if you want to drink, you should drink by yourself.

934
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,537
Why do you make Seo Jin drink as well?

935
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:16,907
Ma'am, I... I feel victimized.

936
00:35:17,807 --> 00:35:21,077
(Laughing)

937
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:24,947
I tell him that I won't drink.

938
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,347
But he goes, "Are you really not going to drink?"

939
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:29,586
- He scolds me.
- Is it true?

940
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,716
- Then I say I'll have one drink.
- Your words don't add up.

941
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:33,587
I suggest that we have one drink...

942
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:36,056
when we have a meal.

943
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:38,557
- And?
- But once he has a drink,

944
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:42,427
he goes, "Seo Jin, let's drink one more bottle."

945
00:35:42,897 --> 00:35:43,966
"Aren't you going to leave?"

946
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:44,997
He goes, "Let's drink one more bottle."

947
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:46,537
When we're done,

948
00:35:46,737 --> 00:35:48,967
he goes, "Seo Jin, let's drink one more bottle at your place."

949
00:35:50,237 --> 00:35:51,237
Seriously.

950
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:53,907
- I...
- I don't let him in the house.

951
00:35:54,077 --> 00:35:56,107
- I...
- I don't let him in the house.

952
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:59,717
Why do you guys say different things?

953
00:36:00,947 --> 00:36:03,087
I mean... Are my words true or not?

954
00:36:03,387 --> 00:36:04,816
- While they're true...
- My words are true, Ma'am.

955
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:05,886
- My words are true.
- Then you should just admit it.

956
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:08,656
- You're so strange.
- While his words are true,

957
00:36:08,657 --> 00:36:11,926
he becomes sullen if I turn down his offer to drink...

958
00:36:11,927 --> 00:36:13,157
in the beginning.

959
00:36:13,427 --> 00:36:16,096
Then you shouldn't drink whether or not he becomes sullen.

960
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:17,566
It doesn't concern you.

961
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,397
Why do you care about him becoming sullen?

962
00:36:20,537 --> 00:36:22,736
- Seriously.
- It's because I always play...

963
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:24,106
- an accommodating sidekick...
- That's ridiculous.

964
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,377
You shouldn't be so accommodating.

965
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:29,007
- Okay.
- You should be your own man.

966
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:30,946
(Okay.)

967
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:33,377
- My own man.
- Say, "Okay. I won't drink."

968
00:36:33,647 --> 00:36:36,017
You shouldn't use others as an excuse.

969
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:38,247
Okay?

970
00:36:38,717 --> 00:36:39,717
(Glaring)

971
00:36:39,718 --> 00:36:40,757
Okay.

972
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:45,486
I hate it when people use others as an excuse.

973
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:46,927
- Right.
- I hate it too.

974
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:50,597
Don't ask me to drink with you.

975
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,437
I never do that.

976
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:57,037
You're making me look bad.

977
00:36:57,337 --> 00:37:00,537
Seriously, watching them talk makes me tired.

978
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:03,707
(Embarrassed)

979
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:04,777
Seriously.

980
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:08,447
In any case, my words are a fact.

981
00:37:08,617 --> 00:37:11,187
- It was your side of the story.
- No, it wasn't.

982
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:13,487
I shouldn't have hired them.

983
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,526
(Failed employment)

984
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:17,527
Come on.

985
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:20,597
They use each other as an excuse, so it's tiring.

986
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:22,826
I hate excuses the most.

987
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:24,166
I wasn't giving an excuse.

988
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,896
I wasn't saying that he did wrong and I did right.

989
00:37:26,897 --> 00:37:28,096
I was just relaying a fact.

990
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,366
- But he kept saying...
- He kept giving excuses.

991
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:31,066
- that he drank because of me.
- Exactly.

992
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:32,136
I don't give excuses.

993
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:34,236
You know, you shouldn't be like that.

994
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:35,846
You shouldn't say, "It was because of so-and-so."

995
00:37:35,847 --> 00:37:37,006
I feel victimized.

996
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:38,647
I don't know why he tells on me so much.

997
00:37:39,077 --> 00:37:40,147
I mean,

998
00:37:40,517 --> 00:37:43,046
I had a drink to keep him happy...

999
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,547
and ended up going on a drinking spree.

1000
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:46,717
That was why I said, "Let's order one more bottle."

1001
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,017
I can't believe he told on me.

1002
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:52,626
Hey, why did you come to my interview?

1003
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:53,956
What's taking so long?

1004
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:55,967
I'm answering questions.

1005
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:57,927
I... Look at that.

1006
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:01,097
Look at that. There he goes again.

1007
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,407
He's asking me to drink with him again.

1008
00:38:04,807 --> 00:38:06,576
- Aren't you going to drink?
- What?

1009
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:08,007
You should have a drink.

1010
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,176
(It's always like this.)

1011
00:38:11,177 --> 00:38:12,346
- I mean...
- You're going to drink.

1012
00:38:12,347 --> 00:38:13,516
- What?
- Aren't you going to drink?

1013
00:38:13,517 --> 00:38:14,716
(Grinning)

1014
00:38:14,717 --> 00:38:15,947
You're going to drink, right?

1015
00:38:17,147 --> 00:38:18,317
Wait right there.

1016
00:38:20,017 --> 00:38:21,586
Please be careful since it's hot.

1017
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:22,786
- Is it mine?
- Yes.

1018
00:38:22,787 --> 00:38:23,956
It looks delicious.

1019
00:38:23,957 --> 00:38:25,326
It looks great.

1020
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,796
(Appetizing beef and tasty side dishes)

1021
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:30,267
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1022
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:33,936
It's too bad that there's no kimchi.

1023
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,197
I'll ask for kimchi.

1024
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,006
(He gives her eating utensils first.)

1025
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:39,836
- Here.
- Please give us some kimchi.

1026
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,477
I'll bring some kimchi.

1027
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:44,407
It looks delicious.

1028
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:48,677
(She tries the seaweed soup.)

1029
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:53,387
The seaweed soup is a bit salty.

1030
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:56,356
("The seaweed soup is a bit salty" means, )

1031
00:38:56,357 --> 00:38:58,926
("I want them to adjust the seaweed soup.")

1032
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:01,056
Should I bring some hot water?

1033
00:39:01,057 --> 00:39:02,127
No, it's okay.

1034
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:04,796
She has hot water.

1035
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:07,267
- It'll be easier to use this.
- What's this?

1036
00:39:07,537 --> 00:39:10,167
It's strip steak of Korean beef.

1037
00:39:10,567 --> 00:39:11,737
Sir.

1038
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:13,477
Yes?

1039
00:39:14,877 --> 00:39:17,307
- It's about the seaweed soup.
- Okay.

1040
00:39:17,547 --> 00:39:19,476
She says it's a bit salty.

1041
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:21,246
Would you please bring her a bowl of seaweed soup...

1042
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:23,647
- with hot water added to it?
- Okay.

1043
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:30,757
(He stretches his back since he has gotten up already.)

1044
00:39:32,227 --> 00:39:34,297
(She tries the meat this time.)

1045
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,127
Ma'am, is it okay?

1046
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:38,897
(Nodding)

1047
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:40,497
(The main dish, steak, suits her taste.)

1048
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,737
(Feeling proud, he shows his dimples.)

1049
00:39:43,007 --> 00:39:44,407
I picked a nice secretary.

1050
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:48,607
(Highly satisfied)

1051
00:39:49,447 --> 00:39:51,076
(Since My Star is satisfied, )

1052
00:39:51,077 --> 00:39:55,447
(we can begin eating.)

1053
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:03,587
It's tasty, right?

1054
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,656
I'll switch the seaweed soup.

1055
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,596
- Why?
- I made it a bit blander.

1056
00:40:08,597 --> 00:40:09,896
Thank you.

1057
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:11,226
- You must've heard it.
- Okay.

1058
00:40:11,227 --> 00:40:13,167
- Kwang Kyu asked for it.
- Let me get the seaweed.

1059
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:15,636
- My secretary must've asked for it.
- Yes.

1060
00:40:15,637 --> 00:40:17,566
- Please give her more seaweed.
- Okay.

1061
00:40:17,567 --> 00:40:19,066
(Seo Jin informs her of Kwang Kyu's effort.)

1062
00:40:19,067 --> 00:40:20,536
Please give her more seaweed.

1063
00:40:20,537 --> 00:40:21,607
Okay.

1064
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:24,446
It's perfect. It's tasty.

1065
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:25,607
Is it tasty?

1066
00:40:27,477 --> 00:40:28,477
It's the best.

1067
00:40:31,187 --> 00:40:32,487
The anchovies are tasty.

1068
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:34,556
Please eat up.

1069
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,857
- Okay.
- Please eat up.

1070
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,226
(Glancing over)

1071
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,457
I ate all of them.

1072
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:41,757
(Getting up)

1073
00:40:42,927 --> 00:40:44,466
(He gets up quietly...)

1074
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:46,837
(and goes outside.)

1075
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,306
Would you give us more anchovies?

1076
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:50,367
Okay.

1077
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:53,777
(His body remembers how to take care of the elders.)

1078
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:55,877
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1079
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:58,776
("They're tasty" means "I want more.")

1080
00:40:58,777 --> 00:41:01,147
(He understood the intention behind the Chungcheong-style speech.)

1081
00:41:01,717 --> 00:41:04,686
Ms. Sunwoo said she didn't want more because she was afraid...

1082
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:05,956
that they'd give too much.

1083
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:07,357
That was why I brought back a small amount.

1084
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,456
- You're very considerate.
- You know,

1085
00:41:09,457 --> 00:41:10,926
you're number one when it comes to understanding the elderly.

1086
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,796
Seriously. How did you figure out her intention so well?

1087
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:15,026
I've been on many shows...

1088
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:17,767
with the senior male actors.

1089
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:20,436
Because of that, my body remembers what to do.

1090
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,437
That's right.

1091
00:41:22,637 --> 00:41:23,906
It's annoying.

1092
00:41:23,907 --> 00:41:25,167
(He's annoyed by himself.)

1093
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:27,976
It's annoying that I'm used to it.

1094
00:41:27,977 --> 00:41:29,377
(Seo Jin is the best when it comes to taking care of the elderly.)

1095
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:31,647
- You ate well since childhood?
- Yes.

1096
00:41:34,377 --> 00:41:35,517
Look at him.

1097
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:38,917
Look at him.

1098
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:45,687
My secretary read the room and brought more.

1099
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:47,727
I can't believe it.

1100
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:49,426
I said, "The anchovies are tasty."

1101
00:41:49,427 --> 00:41:51,867
(She meant, "I want more.")

1102
00:41:52,097 --> 00:41:53,837
Don't you know anything about the Chungcheong style?

1103
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,537
Kwang Kyu, you got an explanation earlier...

1104
00:41:57,737 --> 00:42:00,307
on her style of speech.

1105
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:03,277
When I said that the anchovies were tasty,

1106
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:04,877
he looked at the dish like this.

1107
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:07,747
Since the bowl was empty, he went right away.

1108
00:42:08,677 --> 00:42:10,146
You were busy eating.

1109
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:11,517
(You were busy eating.)

1110
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,357
(He eats even in this situation.)

1111
00:42:14,787 --> 00:42:16,056
(Chewing)

1112
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:18,927
You told us to think of you as an aunt and ease up.

1113
00:42:19,227 --> 00:42:20,856
- Aunt!
- Hey.

1114
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:21,857
(Aunt!)

1115
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:25,166
You're the same age as my mom's younger sister.

1116
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,167
Don't call me "Aunt" as you please.

1117
00:42:32,137 --> 00:42:35,106
Had you thought of me as an aunt,

1118
00:42:35,107 --> 00:42:36,906
you would've noticed the dish I liked...

1119
00:42:36,907 --> 00:42:39,077
and told the secretary to get more.

1120
00:42:42,547 --> 00:42:43,947
(He's in tears.)

1121
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,887
Ma'am, you don't like me, do you?

1122
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:48,757
Right? You don't like me.

1123
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,487
I'm already eating.

1124
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:53,256
I'm already eating.

1125
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:54,257
(He feels so victimized.)

1126
00:42:54,757 --> 00:42:56,896
- Anchovies.
- Hey, go and get more again.

1127
00:42:56,897 --> 00:42:58,167
Forget it. I'm done eating.

1128
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:00,967
(Looking after a star is all in the timing.)

1129
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:03,237
- I want to taste them as well.
- Here.

1130
00:43:03,437 --> 00:43:04,867
I want to taste them as well.

1131
00:43:05,507 --> 00:43:06,806
I haven't had a taste.

1132
00:43:06,807 --> 00:43:08,907
I haven't had a single bite.

1133
00:43:09,777 --> 00:43:12,077
Hey, I heard that anchovies were good for calcium.

1134
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:14,647
(Fact: Anchovies are good for bones.)

1135
00:43:17,147 --> 00:43:20,457
When you think about it, being a secretary must be hard.

1136
00:43:20,687 --> 00:43:22,186
- Of course.
- Right?

1137
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:24,586
Earlier, after sitting still for a while,

1138
00:43:24,587 --> 00:43:26,527
he went, "You should have lunch first."

1139
00:43:26,897 --> 00:43:29,357
I thought, "He read my mind."

1140
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,396
(He senses a crisis.)

1141
00:43:33,397 --> 00:43:36,167
Do you know what Kwang Kyu said?

1142
00:43:36,837 --> 00:43:38,737
"Let's go to any restaurant that's nearby."

1143
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:43,607
- I'm sorry.
- Then...

1144
00:43:44,507 --> 00:43:47,777
Seo Jin looked up the restaurants on his phone.

1145
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:51,446
Since I was driving, I couldn't look things up.

1146
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:52,856
Since you were driving,

1147
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:54,417
you wanted to go to a place that was nearby.

1148
00:43:54,957 --> 00:43:56,016
(She caught me.)

1149
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:57,227
Yes.

1150
00:43:59,027 --> 00:44:00,827
Do you know what Kwang Kyu kept saying?

1151
00:44:01,457 --> 00:44:03,027
"Is it this place?"

1152
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,267
"Is it this place?"

1153
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:08,597
He didn't want to go far.

1154
00:44:08,697 --> 00:44:11,107
- Seriously.
- That wasn't the reason.

1155
00:44:11,537 --> 00:44:13,636
Beef is tasty...

1156
00:44:13,637 --> 00:44:15,736
- at a butcher's restaurant.
- Is that so?

1157
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,306
That was why I suggested going to a butcher's restaurant.

1158
00:44:17,307 --> 00:44:21,177
Seo Jin knew my love for steak.

1159
00:44:21,417 --> 00:44:23,116
I don't like seasoned meat.

1160
00:44:23,117 --> 00:44:26,116
Seasoned meat usually contains sugar.

1161
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:27,157
That's right.

1162
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:28,887
- Sure.
- Old people...

1163
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:31,057
Old people shouldn't have sweet food.

1164
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,556
He knows me so well.

1165
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:36,096
Also, my preferred level of doneness is medium-rare.

1166
00:44:36,097 --> 00:44:37,727
My steak was exactly medium-rare.

1167
00:44:38,797 --> 00:44:40,466
- Do you like medium-rare steak?
- Yes.

1168
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:41,497
I see.

1169
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:43,606
It's tasty.

1170
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:45,206
He can't eat medium-rare steak.

1171
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:47,537
- Why not?
- He likes well-done steak.

1172
00:44:49,037 --> 00:44:50,507
I'm scared of blood.

1173
00:44:51,977 --> 00:44:53,346
(Despite having a lot to say, she keeps her mouth shut.)

1174
00:44:53,347 --> 00:44:55,346
I'm scared of blood.

1175
00:44:55,347 --> 00:44:57,187
(The charismatic Yong Yeo becomes annoyed.)

1176
00:44:58,717 --> 00:45:00,556
I haven't had it in my childhood.

1177
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:01,617
What?

1178
00:45:02,217 --> 00:45:03,287
I mean...

1179
00:45:04,187 --> 00:45:07,226
Since I haven't adjusted the seat to my body before driving,

1180
00:45:07,227 --> 00:45:08,557
my back hurts so much.

1181
00:45:09,327 --> 00:45:11,227
What? What did you say?

1182
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:13,736
It's nothing.

1183
00:45:13,737 --> 00:45:14,737
(Chuckling)

1184
00:45:14,738 --> 00:45:16,036
(He senses the 2nd crisis.)

1185
00:45:16,037 --> 00:45:17,606
- It's okay.
- I didn't hear you.

1186
00:45:17,607 --> 00:45:19,877
(I didn't hear you.)

1187
00:45:20,237 --> 00:45:22,206
Without adjusting the seat to my body,

1188
00:45:22,207 --> 00:45:24,677
I drove in a seat that was adjusted to your body.

1189
00:45:25,177 --> 00:45:26,517
My back hurts because of that.

1190
00:45:27,677 --> 00:45:28,947
Is it an excuse?

1191
00:45:29,177 --> 00:45:30,686
(Seo Jin senses that he'll get another scolding.)

1192
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:31,886
I shouldn't have said anything.

1193
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:34,387
(I shouldn't have said anything.)

1194
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:36,926
- I...
- If your back hurts...

1195
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:38,987
- after a measly one-hour drive, - Seriously.

1196
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:42,357
you just have a bad back to begin with.

1197
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:45,097
For goodness' sake.

1198
00:45:46,397 --> 00:45:48,597
(Crying)

1199
00:45:50,337 --> 00:45:52,136
Did you suddenly think...

1200
00:45:52,137 --> 00:45:54,277
- to go house viewing today?
- What?

1201
00:45:54,707 --> 00:45:56,207
- It wasn't a sudden decision.
- Okay.

1202
00:45:56,477 --> 00:45:58,277
- I've planned it since last year.
- How many years... Last year?

1203
00:45:58,877 --> 00:46:01,316
If you make it, you'll need employees.

1204
00:46:01,317 --> 00:46:02,447
- That's right.
- Yes.

1205
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:05,416
When women give birth,

1206
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:08,017
they go to a postnatal center.

1207
00:46:08,587 --> 00:46:10,556
Are you looking for a place to build a postnatal center?

1208
00:46:10,557 --> 00:46:11,657
That's right.

1209
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:14,056
There has to be a fire pit.

1210
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:15,827
- A traditional fire pit.
- A place where water can be boiled.

1211
00:46:16,027 --> 00:46:18,297
I want to make something like that.

1212
00:46:18,327 --> 00:46:21,497
Back in the day, a mom would build a fire in the fire pit...

1213
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:24,207
after giving birth.

1214
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,207
She'd walk out after giving birth,

1215
00:46:27,407 --> 00:46:29,076
build a fire in the fire pit,

1216
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,477
and sit like this. Because of the heat,

1217
00:46:32,607 --> 00:46:36,547
she'd get healed naturally.

1218
00:46:36,817 --> 00:46:39,516
She'd regain full health after one week.

1219
00:46:39,517 --> 00:46:42,186
I experienced that. I became skinny too.

1220
00:46:42,187 --> 00:46:44,827
Thus, I've always wanted to make something like that.

1221
00:46:44,957 --> 00:46:47,656
So I want a thatched roof house...

1222
00:46:47,657 --> 00:46:48,856
(A postnatal center in a thatched roof house)

1223
00:46:48,857 --> 00:46:51,997
with a traditional fire pit.

1224
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:54,566
- You can build a fire there.
- That's right.

1225
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:56,036
You like getting warm, right?

1226
00:46:56,037 --> 00:46:57,237
It's nice.

1227
00:46:58,437 --> 00:47:00,077
- It wasn't a sudden decision.
- Okay.

1228
00:47:00,337 --> 00:47:02,077
- I've planned it since last year.
- How many years... Last year?

1229
00:47:02,607 --> 00:47:05,146
If you make it, you'll need employees.

1230
00:47:05,147 --> 00:47:06,277
- That's right.
- Yes.

1231
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:09,147
- But I want to make a center...
- Okay.

1232
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,447
that's empty without employees.

1233
00:47:11,817 --> 00:47:13,486
- When a call comes, - Okay.

1234
00:47:13,487 --> 00:47:15,017
they can go...

1235
00:47:15,657 --> 00:47:18,687
and build a fire or make a meal.

1236
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:23,066
- It'll be a self-service center.
- A self-service center.

1237
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:24,927
- So...
- Will it be non-profit?

1238
00:47:25,027 --> 00:47:26,436
It'll be non-profit.

1239
00:47:26,437 --> 00:47:27,466
(Of course.)

1240
00:47:27,467 --> 00:47:29,497
I'm not doing this to make a lot of money.

1241
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:31,267
Right.

1242
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:34,076
Although I didn't pass the exam to become a licensed realtor,

1243
00:47:34,077 --> 00:47:36,506
- I have experience...
- Of course.

1244
00:47:36,507 --> 00:47:38,276
as a former assistant realtor.

1245
00:47:38,277 --> 00:47:39,346
That's perfect.

1246
00:47:39,347 --> 00:47:41,276
I'll check out the place well.

1247
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:42,717
- Okay. Well done.
- Okay.

1248
00:47:44,087 --> 00:47:46,887
(Kwang Kyu is working hard.)

1249
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:48,587
- Ma'am, get in from this side.
- Okay.

1250
00:47:48,817 --> 00:47:51,057
Out of habit, I tried to take the driver's seat.

1251
00:47:52,827 --> 00:47:55,257
(Relaxed)

1252
00:47:55,557 --> 00:47:56,626
- Hey!
- Kwang Kyu.

1253
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:58,196
- Start the car first. It's hot.
- Who should be waiting,

1254
00:47:58,197 --> 00:47:59,326
me or you?

1255
00:47:59,327 --> 00:48:01,896
Okay. I had to use the restroom.

1256
00:48:01,897 --> 00:48:03,266
- Okay. You couldn't help it.
- That's right.

1257
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:04,367
(Quick acceptance)

1258
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:07,806
Gosh, my aunt is impatient.

1259
00:48:07,807 --> 00:48:09,377
- I admit that I am.
- Yes.

1260
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:13,007
I should've held my pee.

1261
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,776
Don't do that. You'll get sick if you do that.

1262
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:17,547
Then I'll be held accountable.

1263
00:48:17,947 --> 00:48:19,346
Don't do that.

1264
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:20,457
(My goodness)

1265
00:48:20,657 --> 00:48:22,686
I should've told you in advance.

1266
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:24,326
(Kwang Kyu's clothing)

1267
00:48:24,327 --> 00:48:25,987
(Yong Yeo's handbag goes on the top.)

1268
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:27,656
(In search of Yong Yeo's bucket list, )

1269
00:48:27,657 --> 00:48:28,926
(a postnatal center with a fire pit)

1270
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,166
It's the sea.

1271
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,727
- We can see the sea right away.
- Yes.

1272
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:34,767
A place like this is nice.

1273
00:48:35,237 --> 00:48:37,007
- It's right next to a road.
- That's right.

1274
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,266
And you can see the sea.

1275
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:40,436
(The surroundings get an okay from her.)

1276
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:42,806
It'll be a bit expensive if it has a view of the sea.

1277
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:43,977
- Right?
- Yes.

1278
00:48:44,177 --> 00:48:46,347
We need to pay attention to those things.

1279
00:48:47,747 --> 00:48:49,477
(They enter a downhill road.)

1280
00:48:50,747 --> 00:48:52,547
A downhill road is bad.

1281
00:48:54,957 --> 00:48:56,556
You like flatland.

1282
00:48:56,557 --> 00:48:57,957
Flatland is good.

1283
00:48:58,557 --> 00:49:00,997
It's the same for a house. Don't buy a house on a slope.

1284
00:49:01,527 --> 00:49:02,826
- A slope.
- Then the energy is too strong.

1285
00:49:02,827 --> 00:49:03,827
It's bad.

1286
00:49:04,527 --> 00:49:05,827
Flatland is the best.

1287
00:49:07,497 --> 00:49:09,496
- What's your budget?
- What?

1288
00:49:09,497 --> 00:49:11,007
What's your budget?

1289
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:13,276
You shouldn't build a thatched roof house...

1290
00:49:13,277 --> 00:49:15,407
- with hopes of making money.
- Okay.

1291
00:49:15,637 --> 00:49:17,076
If I build a house here,

1292
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:19,477
women who have given birth in summer...

1293
00:49:19,777 --> 00:49:21,616
will need to use a fire pit.

1294
00:49:21,617 --> 00:49:25,547
It's very important to keep the body warm.

1295
00:49:26,087 --> 00:49:28,457
But who does that these days?

1296
00:49:29,957 --> 00:49:31,187
A boiler keeps the house warm too.

1297
00:49:31,457 --> 00:49:34,657
I'm talking about keeping the private part warm.

1298
00:49:34,927 --> 00:49:36,766
How many times do I need to tell you?

1299
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,926
(Flustered)

1300
00:49:37,927 --> 00:49:39,466
When you go to a sauna,

1301
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:41,266
- there's a mugwort steam.
- At a sauna,

1302
00:49:41,267 --> 00:49:42,936
- women...
- There's a mugwort steam.

1303
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:45,707
open their legs and steam their private parts.

1304
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:48,206
(They suddenly get an R-rated topic.)

1305
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:49,607
How would I know that?

1306
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:51,006
That was why women didn't get unhealthy vaginal discharge...

1307
00:49:51,007 --> 00:49:52,247
back in the day.

1308
00:49:52,747 --> 00:49:54,347
They didn't get that.

1309
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:57,417
The goal of opening a postnatal center...

1310
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:01,287
is improving women's health, not making money.

1311
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:04,386
It's for women.

1312
00:50:04,387 --> 00:50:05,527
(He decides to talk less.)

1313
00:50:06,157 --> 00:50:08,397
Come to think of it, I don't have a single plot of land.

1314
00:50:09,057 --> 00:50:10,767
I don't have a single plot of land.

1315
00:50:11,267 --> 00:50:13,897
Isn't it a bigger goal of yours to live in Seoul?

1316
00:50:14,437 --> 00:50:17,006
But your place is in Seoul.

1317
00:50:17,007 --> 00:50:18,037
What?

1318
00:50:18,367 --> 00:50:20,137
I can move into Seo Jin's house.

1319
00:50:20,377 --> 00:50:22,606
Why would you move into someone else's house...

1320
00:50:22,607 --> 00:50:23,947
when you have a healthy body?

1321
00:50:24,347 --> 00:50:25,477
Seriously.

1322
00:50:25,707 --> 00:50:28,017
Even if it's a studio apartment, you should own a place for yourself.

1323
00:50:29,717 --> 00:50:32,947
I see that you don't like such jokes.

1324
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:34,456
Of course not.

1325
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:36,357
A tendency to rely on others is bad.

1326
00:50:36,857 --> 00:50:39,726
But it wouldn't be a problem to sleep over once a year.

1327
00:50:39,727 --> 00:50:42,097
- You should lead your own life.
- You're right.

1328
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:44,597
(A joke doesn't work on her.)

1329
00:50:45,127 --> 00:50:47,767
- Kwang Kyu, make a left turn.
- Make a turn here.

1330
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,566
We're here, right?

1331
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:51,007
- It must be the one on the left.
- I think it's this house.

1332
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:52,106
- This house?
- I think so.

1333
00:50:52,107 --> 00:50:53,437
It's this house.

1334
00:50:54,037 --> 00:50:55,607
It's this house.

1335
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:57,107
We're here.

1336
00:50:57,907 --> 00:50:59,277
You have the number, right?

1337
00:50:59,547 --> 00:51:00,976
Yes. I'm calling.

1338
00:51:00,977 --> 00:51:03,687
(Calling the landlord)

1339
00:51:04,287 --> 00:51:05,317
Hello.

1340
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:07,617
Hello, I'm Ms. Sunwoo Yong Yeo's manager.

1341
00:51:07,787 --> 00:51:09,886
- Okay.
- We've arrived at the house.

1342
00:51:09,887 --> 00:51:13,357
You need to give us the location of the house.

1343
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:17,096
To the right of the entrance, you'll see a white mailbox.

1344
00:51:17,097 --> 00:51:18,097
- Yes.
- Yes.

1345
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:20,537
- Stick your hand in it.
- Okay.

1346
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:22,266
- There's a side door, right?
- Yes.

1347
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,567
We put a lock on it, so use the key to open it.

1348
00:51:24,767 --> 00:51:26,106
- Then you can go inside.
- How about the front gate?

1349
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:27,436
Can't we enter through there?

1350
00:51:27,437 --> 00:51:28,736
(He's ahead of Seo Jin for once.)

1351
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,376
We put a bar down from the inside.

1352
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:31,506
Okay.

1353
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:32,976
- How do we go in?
- Thank you.

1354
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:34,676
(In this neighbourhood, house viewing is self-service.)

1355
00:51:34,677 --> 00:51:35,677
This way.

1356
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:39,147
(Laughing)

1357
00:51:40,287 --> 00:51:42,817
(He's quick.)

1358
00:51:43,327 --> 00:51:44,956
(Staring)

1359
00:51:44,957 --> 00:51:46,186
After getting a scolding,

1360
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,456
- you've gotten used...
- Let's go.

1361
00:51:48,457 --> 00:51:49,657
- to my ways.
- Let's go.

1362
00:51:50,727 --> 00:51:53,767
(What's this?)

1363
00:51:55,497 --> 00:51:58,137
(Yong Yeo enters the tile-roofed house first.)

1364
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,977
Shall we go inside? I guess no one lives here.

1365
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:04,806
(Scanning the area quickly)

1366
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:05,946
Watch your step.

1367
00:52:05,947 --> 00:52:06,977
(Attentive)

1368
00:52:07,217 --> 00:52:09,317
- I guess there's no fire pit.
- I'll take a lot.

1369
00:52:10,747 --> 00:52:12,386
(Condition 1,)

1370
00:52:12,387 --> 00:52:14,487
(a traditional fire pit for vaginal steaming)

1371
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:16,786
(Condition 2,)

1372
00:52:16,787 --> 00:52:19,057
(a heated floor for warming the body)

1373
00:52:20,957 --> 00:52:26,097
(Will this house meet My Star's conditions?)

1374
00:52:28,067 --> 00:52:29,136
Here.

1375
00:52:29,137 --> 00:52:31,767
(Starting a search for a fire pit)

1376
00:52:33,537 --> 00:52:35,807
Is this a bath?

1377
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,676
- What is it?
- It's a storage room.

1378
00:52:37,677 --> 00:52:38,777
- A storage room?
- Yes.

1379
00:52:39,247 --> 00:52:41,147
(Fire pit)

1380
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:43,947
(Looking around)

1381
00:52:43,948 --> 00:52:45,617
- It's further inside.
- Where is it?

1382
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:49,116
- Is there a fire pit?
- Yes, there is.

1383
00:52:49,117 --> 00:52:50,986
- Where is it?
- It's here.

1384
00:52:50,987 --> 00:52:52,756
(Seo Jin found...)

1385
00:52:52,757 --> 00:52:56,197
(two fire pits.)

1386
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:59,066
(I see.)

1387
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:01,196
These are what you see...

1388
00:53:01,197 --> 00:53:02,837
in the old palaces...

1389
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,436
Where is this connected to?

1390
00:53:04,437 --> 00:53:06,066
I guess it goes in there.

1391
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:07,377
- To that room?
- Yes.

1392
00:53:07,507 --> 00:53:09,706
(Shaking)

1393
00:53:09,707 --> 00:53:11,846
That's used outside.

1394
00:53:11,847 --> 00:53:13,007
It's just for making fire.

1395
00:53:13,207 --> 00:53:14,476
It's just for making fire?

1396
00:53:14,477 --> 00:53:15,976
It's not meant to heat up the room?

1397
00:53:15,977 --> 00:53:18,916
It's just for cooking.

1398
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:20,686
You don't need this fire pit.

1399
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:23,527
Would a pregnant woman come out to make fire?

1400
00:53:24,557 --> 00:53:26,156
(Feeling embarrassed)

1401
00:53:26,157 --> 00:53:28,226
I want a married couple to come after having a child,

1402
00:53:28,227 --> 00:53:30,296
make fire,

1403
00:53:30,297 --> 00:53:33,797
and cook doenjang stew...

1404
00:53:33,997 --> 00:53:37,837
or seaweed soup. I want them to do that.

1405
00:53:38,937 --> 00:53:40,506
(He finds another fire pit.)

1406
00:53:40,507 --> 00:53:44,407
It's under the floor. You can't go there.

1407
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:45,877
I guess they didn't use it.

1408
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:49,216
It's not the fire pit you like.

1409
00:53:49,217 --> 00:53:52,187
You can't use this as well. There's a wooden floor above it.

1410
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:54,357
- How would you go there?
- Right.

1411
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:56,316
- You can't use this.
- How would you go there?

1412
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,356
You can't use this.

1413
00:53:57,357 --> 00:53:59,086
If the pregnant lady squats to use that,

1414
00:53:59,087 --> 00:54:00,426
- she'd get into serious trouble.
- She can't do that.

1415
00:54:00,427 --> 00:54:01,696
She'd get into serious trouble.

1416
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,627
- That can't happen.
- That's out of the question.

1417
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:05,097
It's not here.

1418
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:06,966
Should we turn the car around first?

1419
00:54:06,967 --> 00:54:09,337
- Turn it around.
- Turn the car around, Kwang Kyu.

1420
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:12,507
Where do I turn the car around?

1421
00:54:13,537 --> 00:54:15,177
It would be hard to turn it around.

1422
00:54:16,537 --> 00:54:19,177
That's why I said we should park over there. How will we turn it?

1423
00:54:20,377 --> 00:54:22,447
(He can't find a way to get the car out.)

1424
00:54:23,077 --> 00:54:24,147
What are you doing?

1425
00:54:24,347 --> 00:54:26,687
We can't turn it around. We have to go in reverse.

1426
00:54:27,187 --> 00:54:28,686
Do what you're comfortable with.

1427
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:30,786
You can go in reverse,

1428
00:54:30,787 --> 00:54:32,187
- and I can walk with her.
- Okay.

1429
00:54:32,827 --> 00:54:34,927
(He's reversing.)

1430
00:54:35,657 --> 00:54:37,967
(Looking around)

1431
00:54:38,297 --> 00:54:39,366
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

1432
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:41,337
I think you could turn it here. It's quite spacious.

1433
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:43,237
Can't you turn it?

1434
00:54:43,567 --> 00:54:44,607
Here?

1435
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:46,806
Come forward and go there.

1436
00:54:46,807 --> 00:54:48,477
No! Stop!

1437
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:50,677
No! Stop!

1438
00:54:51,347 --> 00:54:53,347
(An abrupt stop)

1439
00:54:56,987 --> 00:54:59,246
(My Star's Mercedes-Benz...)

1440
00:54:59,247 --> 00:55:01,686
(almost went down the ditch.)

1441
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:03,457
That was close.

1442
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:05,386
(He froze on the spot.)

1443
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:07,027
My heart almost dropped.

1444
00:55:07,297 --> 00:55:08,496
Go this way.

1445
00:55:08,497 --> 00:55:11,567
You could have turned it here.

1446
00:55:11,797 --> 00:55:13,296
Tell him to turn it here.

1447
00:55:13,297 --> 00:55:14,837
It's spacious here. It's okay.

1448
00:55:15,537 --> 00:55:16,737
Turn it.

1449
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:18,137
Go this way.

1450
00:55:18,337 --> 00:55:20,537
- I can't turn it there.
- No. Come here.

1451
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,177
Go a bit further.

1452
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:25,276
Further.

1453
00:55:25,277 --> 00:55:26,707
That's enough. A bit more.

1454
00:55:27,847 --> 00:55:30,887
There's a ditch here.

1455
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:33,687
I should have driven.

1456
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:35,756
More.

1457
00:55:35,757 --> 00:55:37,387
(For My Star who is tired of waiting...)

1458
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,427
Go forward and come back.

1459
00:55:41,357 --> 00:55:42,826
- Should I get in the car?
- Yes.

1460
00:55:42,827 --> 00:55:44,297
- Okay.
- We'll move...

1461
00:55:45,027 --> 00:55:47,667
(His neck is stiff because of the shock.)

1462
00:55:48,367 --> 00:55:50,306
I almost fell into the ditch.

1463
00:55:50,307 --> 00:55:51,467
(Faint-hearted)

1464
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:53,707
Turn left.

1465
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:55,737
Two minutes until we get there.

1466
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:58,447
You go out as soon as it goes in.

1467
00:55:58,577 --> 00:56:00,177
(Glancing)

1468
00:56:00,547 --> 00:56:03,887
There are very nice houses here.

1469
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:06,086
- Vacation homes.
- They are...

1470
00:56:06,087 --> 00:56:07,787
- all like vacation homes.
- There are many of those.

1471
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,617
I don't think they'll have fire pits.

1472
00:56:12,457 --> 00:56:15,056
- Isn't it the house right there?
- I think it is.

1473
00:56:15,057 --> 00:56:16,797
It looks like someone is there.

1474
00:56:17,397 --> 00:56:20,067
Yes. Isn't he the realtor?

1475
00:56:21,037 --> 00:56:22,196
Which house is it?

1476
00:56:22,197 --> 00:56:25,307
(Is this the right place?)

1477
00:56:26,507 --> 00:56:28,706
- It's not.
- Is it not?

1478
00:56:28,707 --> 00:56:30,137
It's 206-4.

1479
00:56:30,477 --> 00:56:31,806
Is it not?

1480
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:33,177
It's 206-4.

1481
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:34,646
You have to go further in.

1482
00:56:34,647 --> 00:56:36,077
You're near the destination.

1483
00:56:37,047 --> 00:56:38,716
(It doesn't look right.)

1484
00:56:38,717 --> 00:56:39,946
They're honking from behind.

1485
00:56:39,947 --> 00:56:41,457
- Ask someone.
- Okay.

1486
00:56:42,017 --> 00:56:44,386
- Is there no road this way?
- There's no road.

1487
00:56:44,387 --> 00:56:46,326
I'm sorry.

1488
00:56:46,327 --> 00:56:48,396
Is there no house beyond this point?

1489
00:56:48,397 --> 00:56:49,857
All right. I'm sorry.

1490
00:56:50,927 --> 00:56:52,527
Aren't we supposed to go in this way?

1491
00:56:54,137 --> 00:56:55,796
- Why did we come here?
- Reverse.

1492
00:56:55,797 --> 00:56:58,037
- I'm sorry.
- He took the wrong road.

1493
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,267
I took the wrong road.

1494
00:57:01,007 --> 00:57:03,377
(His fingers are busy.)

1495
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:05,307
We have to go out and take the next right.

1496
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,817
(Keeping her mouth shut)

1497
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:11,617
(Glancing)

1498
00:57:13,857 --> 00:57:15,056
How are you going to go out?

1499
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:16,816
- In reverse?
- In reverse.

1500
00:57:16,817 --> 00:57:18,586
- Can't you turn the car here?
- I can't.

1501
00:57:18,587 --> 00:57:20,026
(It's a narrow alley where you can't turn the car around.)

1502
00:57:20,027 --> 00:57:22,056
- I think you could turn it here.
- Here?

1503
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:24,867
- Can't you turn it?
- There's a road if we go further.

1504
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:27,237
- Really?
- There's plenty of space to turn.

1505
00:57:28,337 --> 00:57:29,466
I'll turn it.

1506
00:57:29,467 --> 00:57:31,207
Should I get out and help you look?

1507
00:57:31,467 --> 00:57:32,806
There's plenty of space to turn it.

1508
00:57:32,807 --> 00:57:34,907
- You shouldn't turn it like this.
- You should do it like this.

1509
00:57:35,137 --> 00:57:36,737
Should I go this way and go that way?

1510
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:39,076
- You should do it like this.
- That's right.

1511
00:57:39,077 --> 00:57:41,247
- Move the car back a bit more.
- Okay.

1512
00:57:42,377 --> 00:57:43,446
All right.

1513
00:57:43,447 --> 00:57:45,187
(Kwang Kyu used to be a taxi driver.)

1514
00:57:46,887 --> 00:57:48,216
Go all the way up.

1515
00:57:48,217 --> 00:57:49,957
(Fortunately, there is no ditch.)

1516
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:53,027
Go further.

1517
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:55,497
A bit more.

1518
00:57:55,927 --> 00:57:57,326
That's enough. Go back again.

1519
00:57:57,327 --> 00:57:59,527
(Flinching)

1520
00:58:01,037 --> 00:58:02,937
- No.
- You should drive properly.

1521
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:06,437
Don't you get the sense that you should turn it?

1522
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,077
- You...
- It's not my car!

1523
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:14,876
- If you keep driving...
- I do get the sense, but...

1524
00:58:14,877 --> 00:58:16,446
Does it have to be your car?

1525
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,217
- Does it?
- Aunt.

1526
00:58:18,587 --> 00:58:20,787
- Look at the rice plants.
- Here...

1527
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:22,456
There are many rice plants.

1528
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:23,656
Okay.

1529
00:58:23,657 --> 00:58:25,226
Goodness.

1530
00:58:25,227 --> 00:58:28,427
- Goodness.
- She's holding back her anger.

1531
00:58:28,757 --> 00:58:31,197
(She takes a deep breath and safely arrives.)

1532
00:58:32,367 --> 00:58:33,696
Hello.

1533
00:58:33,697 --> 00:58:35,067
Hello.

1534
00:58:35,737 --> 00:58:36,896
Nice to meet you.

1535
00:58:36,897 --> 00:58:38,306
(A remodelled modern-style tile-roof house...)

1536
00:58:38,307 --> 00:58:40,636
(inside a single-family housing complex)

1537
00:58:40,637 --> 00:58:42,737
(Where is the heated floor?)

1538
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:47,317
Where is the heated floor?

1539
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:49,347
Are you going to check out the fire pit first?

1540
00:58:49,477 --> 00:58:51,946
You don't even get an overview.

1541
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:53,716
You just need to check the fire pit.

1542
00:58:53,717 --> 00:58:55,857
- The fire pit first.
- The fire pit first.

1543
00:58:56,387 --> 00:58:57,726
She's not that picky.

1544
00:58:57,727 --> 00:58:58,927
She just checks the fire pit.

1545
00:59:01,397 --> 00:59:02,827
Just the fire pit. Nothing else.

1546
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:06,696
Over here. Welcome.

1547
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:08,737
- You have to go down like this.
- That's right.

1548
00:59:08,967 --> 00:59:10,507
It goes down too much.

1549
00:59:10,807 --> 00:59:13,437
- There are too many steps.
- Right. The steps are high.

1550
00:59:13,537 --> 00:59:15,506
You come in from that room.

1551
00:59:15,507 --> 00:59:18,546
Yes. You could also come here from the living room...

1552
00:59:18,547 --> 00:59:20,376
and come in from outside.

1553
00:59:20,377 --> 00:59:22,446
- It's too high.
- It's too deep.

1554
00:59:22,447 --> 00:59:24,217
- It's too deep.
- Right.

1555
00:59:24,987 --> 00:59:26,017
It's here.

1556
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:29,087
(Turning her head)

1557
00:59:29,157 --> 00:59:30,986
You're not looking for...

1558
00:59:30,987 --> 00:59:32,757
- That's right.
- a modern-style fire pit.

1559
00:59:33,227 --> 00:59:34,296
A traditional style.

1560
00:59:34,297 --> 00:59:36,556
(Yong Yeo is looking for a traditional style fire pit.)

1561
00:59:36,557 --> 00:59:37,597
Traditional style.

1562
00:59:38,727 --> 00:59:41,236
I don't think she likes the fire pit.

1563
00:59:41,237 --> 00:59:44,467
The stairs shouldn't be too steep.

1564
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:46,306
(They couldn't find My Star's dream fire pit.)

1565
00:59:46,307 --> 00:59:48,777
It would be nice for young people.

1566
00:59:54,447 --> 00:59:56,577
(Yawning)

1567
00:59:58,517 --> 00:59:59,947
Did you just yawn?

1568
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:01,887
What? I just yawned.

1569
01:00:02,157 --> 01:00:04,487
My yawning isn't the problem.

1570
01:00:05,027 --> 01:00:06,526
You shouldn't yawn.

1571
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,696
I can yawn if I'm tired.

1572
01:00:08,697 --> 01:00:11,627
- You can't...
- That's why I have a secretary.

1573
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:14,337
Why else would I have a secretary? I would move alone.

1574
01:00:15,637 --> 01:00:17,206
You can't yawn in the front seat.

1575
01:00:17,207 --> 01:00:18,307
Why not?

1576
01:00:22,177 --> 01:00:23,206
(They drove along the endless rice-field road.)

1577
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:25,077
- I guess it's this house.
- I guess so.

1578
01:00:27,517 --> 01:00:30,447
(Will she be able to find her dream fire pit this time?)

1579
01:00:31,687 --> 01:00:32,687
Hello.

1580
01:00:32,688 --> 01:00:34,656
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1581
01:00:34,657 --> 01:00:36,587
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

1582
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:39,886
I'm Sunwoo Yong Yeo's manager today.

1583
01:00:39,887 --> 01:00:41,057
He's my manager.

1584
01:00:41,157 --> 01:00:42,897
You can speak with my manager.

1585
01:00:43,527 --> 01:00:44,797
- Nice to meet you.
- Right.

1586
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,596
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you, Kim Kwang Kyu.

1587
01:00:46,597 --> 01:00:47,797
- He's my driver.
- Nice to meet you.

1588
01:00:48,737 --> 01:00:50,706
- A driver?
- My driver for the day...

1589
01:00:50,707 --> 01:00:51,766
- Manager.
- and my manager for the day.

1590
01:00:51,767 --> 01:00:52,936
I'm also your manager.

1591
01:00:52,937 --> 01:00:54,737
You're my manager. Okay. I'm sorry.

1592
01:00:55,137 --> 01:00:57,677
Where should we go?

1593
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:01,616
The house I'll introduce to you...

1594
01:01:01,617 --> 01:01:02,976
- is this house.
- That house.

1595
01:01:02,977 --> 01:01:04,317
How big is it?

1596
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:08,287
The land consists of two separate lots.

1597
01:01:08,717 --> 01:01:10,186
- In total.
- In total...

1598
01:01:10,187 --> 01:01:12,456
This is one lot and that is one lot.

1599
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:14,556
- This...
- I could make a parking lot here.

1600
01:01:14,557 --> 01:01:16,826
Yes. That would be great.

1601
01:01:16,827 --> 01:01:20,227
The lot is 509m² including this.

1602
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,096
The building is 99m².

1603
01:01:23,097 --> 01:01:24,836
The registered floor area is 99m².

1604
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:26,536
Where does the lot start from?

1605
01:01:26,537 --> 01:01:28,007
- This...
- Even this?

1606
01:01:28,377 --> 01:01:30,206
- Up to this point.
- Here?

1607
01:01:30,207 --> 01:01:31,546
- The blue part.
- Like this?

1608
01:01:31,547 --> 01:01:35,176
Do you see the small greenhouse there?

1609
01:01:35,177 --> 01:01:38,347
- Is that included?
- It includes that and this pumpkin.

1610
01:01:38,447 --> 01:01:40,086
It includes the area where the sunchokes are planted.

1611
01:01:40,087 --> 01:01:42,587
- Are these the sunchokes?
- Yes. Up to the road here.

1612
01:01:42,817 --> 01:01:43,987
Even this, right?

1613
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:47,856
(Trying to bring back the vibe from his real-estate assistant days)

1614
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:48,996
Do we go in from here?

1615
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:51,897
Yes. These days,

1616
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:54,266
there aren't many houses with fire pits like this.

1617
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:55,296
Is this the fire pit?

1618
01:01:55,297 --> 01:01:57,237
- On the inside...
- Yes. There are two fire pits.

1619
01:01:58,067 --> 01:02:00,507
- Here.
- Here. When using these fire pits,

1620
01:02:00,707 --> 01:02:02,077
you have to sit here like this.

1621
01:02:02,977 --> 01:02:04,976
- That's right.
- You make the fire there.

1622
01:02:04,977 --> 01:02:06,806
Right. That's where...

1623
01:02:06,807 --> 01:02:09,077
- You make the fire here.
- That's right.

1624
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:17,587
(She finally met her dream fire pit.)

1625
01:02:18,057 --> 01:02:19,587
Come this way.

1626
01:02:20,057 --> 01:02:23,096
This is the men's quarters that's connected...

1627
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:24,297
to the outside of the main gate.

1628
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:26,996
It's connected...

1629
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:27,997
- to the wooden porch.
- This is the wooden porch.

1630
01:02:27,998 --> 01:02:30,866
The flooring was all burned because it was hot.

1631
01:02:30,867 --> 01:02:32,107
(Burned mark)

1632
01:02:33,367 --> 01:02:34,806
The old flooring.

1633
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:36,206
Be careful.

1634
01:02:36,207 --> 01:02:37,746
(The ex-assistant is working hard.)

1635
01:02:37,747 --> 01:02:39,847
Is it there in the master bedroom?

1636
01:02:40,377 --> 01:02:42,076
Even in the master bedroom?

1637
01:02:42,077 --> 01:02:43,917
Yes. That's the master bedroom.

1638
01:02:44,617 --> 01:02:45,987
Where do you make the fire here?

1639
01:02:46,087 --> 01:02:47,656
The fire pit for the master bedroom is over there.

1640
01:02:47,657 --> 01:02:48,757
Let me see.

1641
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,586
(Her steps quicken at the news of another fire pit.)

1642
01:02:51,587 --> 01:02:53,256
- This fire pit?
- Yes.

1643
01:02:53,257 --> 01:02:54,526
This is how fire pits should be.

1644
01:02:54,527 --> 01:02:55,896
You can...

1645
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,697
- You make fire here.
- That's right.

1646
01:02:59,167 --> 01:03:01,936
- Young people can...
- In the heated floor room.

1647
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:04,137
- stay in the heated floor room.
- That's right.

1648
01:03:04,567 --> 01:03:05,806
The lower body of a woman...

1649
01:03:05,807 --> 01:03:07,237
- should be warm.
- That's right.

1650
01:03:07,337 --> 01:03:10,177
Young people sit on random places.

1651
01:03:10,607 --> 01:03:11,846
Isn't that right?

1652
01:03:11,847 --> 01:03:13,607
That's really bad.

1653
01:03:14,147 --> 01:03:16,416
When you sit here, it's really nice.

1654
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,086
Your shin gets warm.

1655
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,116
That's right.

1656
01:03:20,117 --> 01:03:21,316
Instead of going to postnatal care centers...

1657
01:03:21,317 --> 01:03:22,556
after giving birth, she could come here,

1658
01:03:22,557 --> 01:03:23,857
start a fire herself,

1659
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:27,356
make food and feed her child with her husband.

1660
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:29,697
- For that purpose.
- That's what I'm thinking of.

1661
01:03:30,157 --> 01:03:32,096
- This is also a fire pit, right?
- Right.

1662
01:03:32,097 --> 01:03:34,066
It's the room heated by the fire pit earlier.

1663
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:36,437
- The flooring was burned like that.
- Right.

1664
01:03:36,497 --> 01:03:38,566
Still, you have to renovate it, leaving just the frame.

1665
01:03:38,567 --> 01:03:40,166
That's right. You have to renovate it.

1666
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:42,006
Look at the ceiling.

1667
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:43,436
The roof rafter is still there.

1668
01:03:43,437 --> 01:03:45,546
So, except for this,

1669
01:03:45,547 --> 01:03:47,477
- the house needs to be renovated.
- That's right.

1670
01:03:47,847 --> 01:03:50,317
It looks like it's been more than a year since people lived here.

1671
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,347
When I was young...

1672
01:03:52,887 --> 01:03:56,417
It's like my childhood home.

1673
01:03:56,957 --> 01:03:58,156
The fluorescent light.

1674
01:03:58,157 --> 01:03:59,527
(The nostalgic fluorescent light switch)

1675
01:04:00,427 --> 01:04:01,727
This is a starter.

1676
01:04:03,497 --> 01:04:04,527
This is a starter.

1677
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:06,667
I used to go out to buy this a lot.

1678
01:04:07,097 --> 01:04:09,396
You need this for the light to turn on.

1679
01:04:09,397 --> 01:04:11,367
It starts the fluorescent light.

1680
01:04:12,637 --> 01:04:15,236
It's like the old attic. There's an attic.

1681
01:04:15,237 --> 01:04:16,776
You can keep valuables there.

1682
01:04:16,777 --> 01:04:18,176
Seo Jin wouldn't know.

1683
01:04:18,177 --> 01:04:19,776
He lived in an apartment.

1684
01:04:19,777 --> 01:04:22,016
The layout is just like our house.

1685
01:04:22,017 --> 01:04:23,816
It's like my old house too.

1686
01:04:23,817 --> 01:04:26,186
- That's right.
- Yes. In the 1980s.

1687
01:04:26,187 --> 01:04:28,886
Old houses need to be completely renovated, leaving just the frame.

1688
01:04:28,887 --> 01:04:30,086
You have to renovate everything...

1689
01:04:30,087 --> 01:04:31,286
- except the roof rafter.
- That's right.

1690
01:04:31,287 --> 01:04:32,326
Of course.

1691
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:33,927
You have to fix everything.

1692
01:04:34,457 --> 01:04:36,196
You have to fix everything except the frame.

1693
01:04:36,197 --> 01:04:37,827
That's right. It needs to be renovated.

1694
01:04:38,227 --> 01:04:40,097
This place will also look pretty...

1695
01:04:40,227 --> 01:04:42,566
after laying the roof tiles.

1696
01:04:42,567 --> 01:04:43,667
(My Star finally found a house she likes.)

1697
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:45,666
How much is this? Two hundred thousand dollars?

1698
01:04:45,667 --> 01:04:47,236
- Yes. It's 200,000 dollars.
- It's 200,000 dollars.

1699
01:04:47,237 --> 01:04:50,747
Since there is a rice field in front, no houses will be built.

1700
01:04:50,877 --> 01:04:53,106
You'll have an open view.

1701
01:04:53,107 --> 01:04:54,676
- Right.
- Yes.

1702
01:04:54,677 --> 01:04:56,416
- You can't build on farm lands.
- Yes.

1703
01:04:56,417 --> 01:04:57,887
That's a benefit.

1704
01:04:58,087 --> 01:05:00,917
- We'll decide on that.
- Right.

1705
01:05:01,317 --> 01:05:02,816
My secretaries will take care of it.

1706
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:05,286
You two should make a good judgment.

1707
01:05:05,287 --> 01:05:07,757
- Okay, ma'am.
- See what you think about it.

1708
01:05:08,097 --> 01:05:09,157
Kwang Kyu.

1709
01:05:10,157 --> 01:05:12,497
Why don't you turn the car around so we can leave comfortably?

1710
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:15,636
- This is a pumpkin, right?
- It's a pumpkin.

1711
01:05:15,637 --> 01:05:18,066
There are fruits on the tree.

1712
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:20,807
- It's a persimmon tree.
- Persimmon.

1713
01:05:20,977 --> 01:05:22,636
- It's a persimmon tree.
- The Ganghwa persimmons...

1714
01:05:22,637 --> 01:05:23,876
- are tasty.
- Fruits? He didn't know...

1715
01:05:23,877 --> 01:05:25,107
that those were persimmons.

1716
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:28,216
- This is also included, right?
- Yes. It's included.

1717
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:29,277
(A fruit unknown to the people of Seoul?)

1718
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,687
These are perilla leaves.

1719
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:33,586
- These are sweet potatoes.
- Those are sweet potatoes.

1720
01:05:33,587 --> 01:05:34,717
Yes. They're sweet potatoes.

1721
01:05:35,317 --> 01:05:36,986
- I've never seen them like that.
- Really?

1722
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:39,387
I've never seen sweet potatoes in the field.

1723
01:05:39,657 --> 01:05:41,526
- It's my first time seeing this.
- I'll show it to you.

1724
01:05:41,527 --> 01:05:42,827
Show me.

1725
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:44,926
- I've never seen them like that.
- This...

1726
01:05:44,927 --> 01:05:47,697
(The field's owner kindly gave permission.)

1727
01:05:48,867 --> 01:05:50,496
I grew them when I was a child.

1728
01:05:50,497 --> 01:05:52,736
- Really?
- I grew sweet potatoes.

1729
01:05:52,737 --> 01:05:55,077
- It's right here.
- Goodness.

1730
01:05:55,507 --> 01:05:57,306
There's a sweet potato here.

1731
01:05:57,307 --> 01:05:59,377
It's quite big.

1732
01:06:00,677 --> 01:06:02,517
Follow the stem and...

1733
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:04,886
You eat sweet potato stems.

1734
01:06:04,887 --> 01:06:06,316
- Like this.
- They're tasty when seasoned.

1735
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:07,346
(Sweet potato stem?)

1736
01:06:07,347 --> 01:06:09,256
- Sweet potato stem...
- You season them.

1737
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:11,226
- You get them like this.
- You remove the skin.

1738
01:06:11,227 --> 01:06:13,687
You have to remove it like this.

1739
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:17,056
I was born in Seoul, so I've never done this.

1740
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:18,566
Is it your first time seeing sweet potatoes in the field?

1741
01:06:18,567 --> 01:06:20,866
- It's my first time.
- I showed it to you first.

1742
01:06:20,867 --> 01:06:23,237
I remember buying the sweet potato stems...

1743
01:06:23,737 --> 01:06:27,607
and cooking them for my children.

1744
01:06:28,137 --> 01:06:30,237
The sweet potatoes are great here.

1745
01:06:31,607 --> 01:06:34,277
(Poor Kwang Kyu)

1746
01:06:35,047 --> 01:06:36,977
The sweet potatoes from Haenam are the best.

1747
01:06:37,077 --> 01:06:39,286
- The South Jeolla Province...
- Haenam.

1748
01:06:39,287 --> 01:06:41,386
Ganghwa sweet potatoes here are also famous...

1749
01:06:41,387 --> 01:06:43,016
- in the metropolitan area.
- I see.

1750
01:06:43,017 --> 01:06:46,087
(Searching)

1751
01:06:46,557 --> 01:06:48,126
There must be many sweet potatoes here, right?

1752
01:06:48,127 --> 01:06:50,157
- They planted so many.
- There are many of them.

1753
01:06:50,457 --> 01:06:52,427
I think they grow well here.

1754
01:06:53,767 --> 01:06:55,097
These grew well.

1755
01:06:55,437 --> 01:06:58,737
How could you not do this when you're a secretary?

1756
01:06:59,037 --> 01:07:01,006
I was going to give it to you at the end.

1757
01:07:01,007 --> 01:07:04,007
Aunt! Youngest aunt.

1758
01:07:05,007 --> 01:07:06,076
(He slowly steps away.)

1759
01:07:06,077 --> 01:07:08,147
How are you like this?

1760
01:07:08,347 --> 01:07:10,346
You... I'm sorry. It's okay.

1761
01:07:10,347 --> 01:07:13,087
It happened while you dug up the sweet potatoes.

1762
01:07:13,547 --> 01:07:15,186
I'll understand.

1763
01:07:15,187 --> 01:07:16,516
This is nice.

1764
01:07:16,517 --> 01:07:18,757
(I hate you, Aunt.)

1765
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:22,096
Wipe your hands well. You have to drive.

1766
01:07:22,097 --> 01:07:23,556
- What?
- Wipe your hands well.

1767
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:25,466
You have to drive. You'll make her car dirty.

1768
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:27,366
- It's not even my car.
- Take this.

1769
01:07:27,367 --> 01:07:28,597
It's not even my car.

1770
01:07:29,597 --> 01:07:31,437
He has a mean spirit.

1771
01:07:32,237 --> 01:07:33,937
Whether it's my car or yours,

1772
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:36,837
you should cherish everything.

1773
01:07:37,337 --> 01:07:38,907
This is a bad habit.

1774
01:07:39,377 --> 01:07:41,777
Change that habit. It's not nice.

1775
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,116
You should treat everything as if it were yours.

1776
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:45,817
- Right? Of course.
- You're right.

1777
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:48,456
That way, you'll cherish everything.

1778
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:51,427
(You don't like me, do you?)

1779
01:07:54,227 --> 01:07:56,496
I'm glad I came on this show.

1780
01:07:56,497 --> 01:07:58,367
I struggled for a year to get such a house.

1781
01:07:59,527 --> 01:08:01,596
Isn't it nice?

1782
01:08:01,597 --> 01:08:02,996
It's really...

1783
01:08:02,997 --> 01:08:05,636
It was quiet and comfortable.

1784
01:08:05,637 --> 01:08:08,276
It's also not far away from Seoul.

1785
01:08:08,277 --> 01:08:09,877
- That's right.
- Right?

1786
01:08:10,137 --> 01:08:11,707
Also,

1787
01:08:12,377 --> 01:08:13,676
it's nice because there's no slope.

1788
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:15,746
- Right? There's no slope.
- It's flat.

1789
01:08:15,747 --> 01:08:19,046
- You can get there quickly.
- That's right.

1790
01:08:19,047 --> 01:08:20,686
It's near the road too.

1791
01:08:20,687 --> 01:08:22,687
- You can get there soon.
- Yes.

1792
01:08:23,357 --> 01:08:26,527
- This...
- I think I might really buy it.

1793
01:08:28,127 --> 01:08:30,597
There should be a place that makes great marinated crabs.

1794
01:08:32,327 --> 01:08:34,567
- Do you want to eat that?
- Yes.

1795
01:08:34,837 --> 01:08:36,667
Don't you have plans today?

1796
01:08:37,237 --> 01:08:40,206
That's right, I have. What time was it?

1797
01:08:40,207 --> 01:08:41,876
He sure is a secretary.

1798
01:08:41,877 --> 01:08:44,106
- What time is it?
- I also knew that.

1799
01:08:44,107 --> 01:08:46,046
Why didn't you say anything when you knew it?

1800
01:08:46,047 --> 01:08:47,477
(My Star's Schedule: 5pm, dinner with friends)

1801
01:08:48,347 --> 01:08:51,817
You're five years younger than my mother.

1802
01:08:51,987 --> 01:08:54,456
You're exactly 80 this year.

1803
01:08:54,457 --> 01:08:55,757
I'm 80 years old. Why?

1804
01:08:56,557 --> 01:08:58,086
I'm 81 in Korean age.

1805
01:08:58,087 --> 01:08:59,927
- That's right.
- What about your mother?

1806
01:09:00,027 --> 01:09:01,696
My mother was born in 1940.

1807
01:09:01,697 --> 01:09:03,797
- She's five years older than me.
- That's right.

1808
01:09:04,297 --> 01:09:06,296
- How does it feel?
- What?

1809
01:09:06,297 --> 01:09:07,996
How does it feel when you're 80?

1810
01:09:07,997 --> 01:09:09,936
What else?

1811
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,666
You just want to enjoy the rest of your life before dying.

1812
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:15,537
- The rest of your life.
- The rest of your life.

1813
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:18,676
I want to live happily...

1814
01:09:18,677 --> 01:09:20,946
without many worries.

1815
01:09:20,947 --> 01:09:24,346
I feel a bit depressed because I'm almost 60.

1816
01:09:24,347 --> 01:09:25,417
Why do you feel wronged?

1817
01:09:25,947 --> 01:09:29,786
I'm 60, but what have I achieved?

1818
01:09:29,787 --> 01:09:32,486
You achieved all that.

1819
01:09:32,487 --> 01:09:37,057
(You achieved all that.)

1820
01:09:37,767 --> 01:09:40,767
I like being my age now.

1821
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:43,367
Because I'm free.

1822
01:09:44,437 --> 01:09:48,277
(Because I'm free.)

1823
01:09:48,377 --> 01:09:50,676
I guess you weren't so free before.

1824
01:09:50,677 --> 01:09:52,007
That's right.

1825
01:09:52,177 --> 01:09:55,076
Honestly, the family I have to take care of...

1826
01:09:55,077 --> 01:09:57,177
I'm the eldest daughter-in-law of eight siblings.

1827
01:09:57,577 --> 01:10:01,817
I was obsessed with earning money.

1828
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:04,686
I never went sightseeing or anything.

1829
01:10:04,687 --> 01:10:06,026
(Yong Yeo married the eldest son out of 8 siblings when she was 25.)

1830
01:10:06,027 --> 01:10:08,957
I knew nothing when I got married.

1831
01:10:09,097 --> 01:10:12,997
I cried when I was sad and laughed when I was happy.

1832
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:16,136
Even in the US, it was just work, home, work, home...

1833
01:10:16,137 --> 01:10:17,567
for eight years.

1834
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:21,177
I did all kinds of work.

1835
01:10:22,307 --> 01:10:23,806
There's nothing I haven't done.

1836
01:10:23,807 --> 01:10:24,947
In the US?

1837
01:10:25,547 --> 01:10:29,047
I ran at a sewing factory in the US.

1838
01:10:29,617 --> 01:10:33,087
After that, I ran a restaurant. Then, I ran a hair salon.

1839
01:10:33,347 --> 01:10:36,556
I got a cosmetology certificate.

1840
01:10:36,557 --> 01:10:38,757
I worked for so long, and then I came back to Korea.

1841
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:43,557
How old were you when you became free?

1842
01:10:43,757 --> 01:10:46,226
It was after my husband passed away.

1843
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:51,766
(After my husband passed away)

1844
01:10:51,767 --> 01:10:52,767
Right.

1845
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:55,007
After that...

1846
01:10:55,137 --> 01:10:56,576
After my husband passed away,

1847
01:10:56,577 --> 01:10:58,377
- I had a stroke.
- Yes.

1848
01:10:58,577 --> 01:11:00,746
I had a change of heart after that point.

1849
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:03,216
After you were ill.

1850
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,286
- After I was ill.
- Yes.

1851
01:11:06,287 --> 01:11:08,186
"Why did I live like this?"

1852
01:11:08,187 --> 01:11:10,087
"I should live for myself."

1853
01:11:10,317 --> 01:11:12,057
That thought came to me.

1854
01:11:12,627 --> 01:11:14,527
From then onward,

1855
01:11:15,457 --> 01:11:18,467
I even flew to Fukuoka in the morning...

1856
01:11:18,497 --> 01:11:20,626
- to have a meal.
- Goodness.

1857
01:11:20,627 --> 01:11:22,596
I came back on a night flight.

1858
01:11:22,597 --> 01:11:23,836
I don't need to stay the night there...

1859
01:11:23,837 --> 01:11:25,336
- because I'm alone.
- Right.

1860
01:11:25,337 --> 01:11:28,006
I walked around downtown, ate some food,

1861
01:11:28,007 --> 01:11:30,077
and did some sightseeing.

1862
01:11:30,277 --> 01:11:32,306
Then I took a cab to the airport.

1863
01:11:32,307 --> 01:11:35,947
- Alone.
- I'd go, "Airport, please."

1864
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:38,416
You didn't use long sentences.

1865
01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:40,846
- You don't need to.
- If you know "please" in Japanese,

1866
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:43,216
- it works for everything.
- It works for everything.

1867
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:44,656
Onegaishimasi...

1868
01:11:44,657 --> 01:11:46,657
Onegaishimasu.

1869
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:48,926
You can't even say that at once?

1870
01:11:48,927 --> 01:11:50,296
- Onegaishimasu.
- Have you never heard of it?

1871
01:11:50,297 --> 01:11:52,897
I've heard of it many times. Isn't it similar to "irasshaimase?"

1872
01:11:53,397 --> 01:11:54,936
- No.
- Doesn't that mean "come here?"

1873
01:11:54,937 --> 01:11:56,196
I mean, isn't it "welcome?"

1874
01:11:56,197 --> 01:11:57,566
That's right.

1875
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,506
Onegaishimasu. Please.

1876
01:11:59,507 --> 01:12:00,766
Please?

1877
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,977
(He gets nervous speaking any foreign language.)

1878
01:12:02,507 --> 01:12:03,507
You should know...

1879
01:12:03,508 --> 01:12:05,447
- how to have fun alone.
- That's right.

1880
01:12:05,547 --> 01:12:07,946
- I can't have fun alone.
- You should be good at it.

1881
01:12:07,947 --> 01:12:10,916
You'll be leaving alone in the end.

1882
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,687
- Where to?
- Where else? To paradise.

1883
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,156
- Where to?
- To the skies...

1884
01:12:15,157 --> 01:12:16,586
- if you go to church.
- The skies.

1885
01:12:16,587 --> 01:12:19,057
Those who follow Buddhism go to paradise.

1886
01:12:19,387 --> 01:12:22,197
So have fun...

1887
01:12:22,327 --> 01:12:24,866
and live without worrying...

1888
01:12:24,867 --> 01:12:27,097
- Yes.
- about what others think.

1889
01:12:27,627 --> 01:12:28,796
What's the point of worrying about what others think?

1890
01:12:28,797 --> 01:12:29,966
What will that person give me?

1891
01:12:29,967 --> 01:12:32,007
Nothing. Isn't that right?

1892
01:12:32,137 --> 01:12:34,166
Worrying itself is tiresome.

1893
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:35,277
That's right.

1894
01:12:35,937 --> 01:12:37,336
(My Star's Schedule: 5pm, dinner with friends)

1895
01:12:37,337 --> 01:12:39,007
We're here. Todam Town.

1896
01:12:39,377 --> 01:12:40,677
We got here quickly.

1897
01:12:41,147 --> 01:12:42,777
Are they already here?

1898
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,617
There's seasoned raw herring too?

1899
01:12:46,587 --> 01:12:47,647
That must be tasty.

1900
01:12:49,957 --> 01:12:52,386
There are wild vegetables. I'll have that.

1901
01:12:52,387 --> 01:12:54,087
- Wild vegetables?
- Wild vegetables.

1902
01:12:54,627 --> 01:12:56,697
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

1903
01:12:56,957 --> 01:12:58,097
What about you?

1904
01:12:58,827 --> 01:13:00,867
I'll have spicy stir-fried small octopus.

1905
01:13:01,097 --> 01:13:02,366
There's crab stew as well.

1906
01:13:02,367 --> 01:13:03,497
(Who am I talking to?)

1907
01:13:06,307 --> 01:13:07,537
This place is nice.

1908
01:13:09,677 --> 01:13:12,247
- Should we go?
- We should build it here.

1909
01:13:12,747 --> 01:13:13,807
Right?

1910
01:13:14,207 --> 01:13:17,777
(A charming little restaurant at the foot of the mountain)

1911
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:22,957
(They hold hands and head to eat delicious food.)

1912
01:13:23,057 --> 01:13:24,756
I wouldn't run a restaurant, I'd...

1913
01:13:24,757 --> 01:13:27,056
- Congratulations - Congratulations

1914
01:13:27,057 --> 01:13:29,327
(It's an unexpected situation.)

1915
01:13:29,557 --> 01:13:32,096
(Congratulations)

1916
01:13:32,097 --> 01:13:34,497
- Congratulations - Congratulations

1917
01:13:35,197 --> 01:13:37,467
(They're frozen.)

1918
01:13:37,497 --> 01:13:40,636
(Somewhat unfamiliar otherworldly energy)

1919
01:13:40,637 --> 01:13:43,176
(He's confused.)

1920
01:13:43,177 --> 01:13:45,477
(He's confused too.)

1921
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:49,247
(A group of women in hanbok suddenly congratulating her)

1922
01:13:49,277 --> 01:13:52,886
(Lee Kyung Sil, Kim Ji Sun, Cho Hye Lyun)

1923
01:13:52,887 --> 01:13:54,486
What is this?

1924
01:13:54,487 --> 01:13:56,586
- Congratulations.
- What's going on?

1925
01:13:56,587 --> 01:13:58,256
- Welcome.
- It's your 80th birthday party.

1926
01:13:58,257 --> 01:14:00,557
- Congratulations.
- Come quickly.

1927
01:14:00,657 --> 01:14:03,126
- Come up.
- I was shocked.

1928
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:05,066
- We've been waiting for you.
- Yes.

1929
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:07,596
- We waited for quite a while.
- Isn't it his 80th birthday?

1930
01:14:07,597 --> 01:14:09,067
How is it your 80th birthday?

1931
01:14:09,237 --> 01:14:11,097
- Hold her, Seo Jin.
- Hey.

1932
01:14:11,267 --> 01:14:12,336
Hello.

1933
01:14:12,337 --> 01:14:13,436
- Hello.
- Hello.

1934
01:14:13,437 --> 01:14:15,076
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

1935
01:14:15,077 --> 01:14:16,536
- Yong Yeo, come here.
- We waited for a long time.

1936
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:18,046
- Come here.
- Yong Yeo, look over here.

1937
01:14:18,047 --> 01:14:19,476
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

1938
01:14:19,477 --> 01:14:21,207
- You're 80 years old.
- That's right.

1939
01:14:21,347 --> 01:14:23,416
"Your beauty from the age of 3 will continue until the age of 80."

1940
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,887
(They prepared a nice garland for her 80th birthday.)

1941
01:14:25,017 --> 01:14:26,987
"Your beauty from the age of 3 will continue until the age of 80."

1942
01:14:27,957 --> 01:14:30,256
- Thank you.
- Mom.

1943
01:14:30,257 --> 01:14:32,226
(How did you find time to do this amidst your busy schedule?)

1944
01:14:32,227 --> 01:14:33,227
- Thank you.
- Mom.

1945
01:14:33,228 --> 01:14:35,296
- Don't mention it.
- Seriously.

1946
01:14:35,297 --> 01:14:37,596
- Thank you.
- Mom, you need to hurry up.

1947
01:14:37,597 --> 01:14:39,966
- We prepared your outfit.
- We prepared your outfit.

1948
01:14:39,967 --> 01:14:41,196
- Let's go.
- I don't need a new outfit.

1949
01:14:41,197 --> 01:14:42,866
- You need to put it on.
- Mom, you need to put it on.

1950
01:14:42,867 --> 01:14:44,236
I'm already dressed nicely.

1951
01:14:44,237 --> 01:14:45,407
- I can't believe it.
- They need to change too.

1952
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:47,467
The three of them were something else.

1953
01:14:48,607 --> 01:14:50,477
Their energy...

1954
01:14:52,777 --> 01:14:54,676
When Yong Yeo comes...

1955
01:14:54,677 --> 01:14:57,246
She said that she didn't want an 80th birthday party.

1956
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:58,686
Even if she said that...

1957
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:00,546
She probably didn't want to spend money on it.

1958
01:15:00,547 --> 01:15:02,486
Why would she say no to what we've prepared?

1959
01:15:02,487 --> 01:15:04,416
If we welcome her in hanbok,

1960
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,626
- That's right. She'll love it.
- she'll be moved.

1961
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:07,726
We prepared your outfit.

1962
01:15:07,727 --> 01:15:08,796
- Let's go.
- I don't need a new outfit.

1963
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:10,456
- You need to put it on.
- Mom, you need to put it on.

1964
01:15:10,457 --> 01:15:12,096
- We're dressed in hanbok.
- The two of you need to change too.

1965
01:15:12,097 --> 01:15:14,197
- What?
- The secretaries need to get ready.

1966
01:15:14,267 --> 01:15:15,396
The two of you need to change too.

1967
01:15:15,397 --> 01:15:16,736
- What? Why?
- The secretaries need to get ready.

1968
01:15:16,737 --> 01:15:17,897
- The two of you.
- Come this way.

1969
01:15:18,037 --> 01:15:20,307
- The two of you, come this way.
- Follow us.

1970
01:15:21,037 --> 01:15:22,236
It's an honour to meet you.

1971
01:15:22,237 --> 01:15:23,307
Have you been well?

1972
01:15:23,877 --> 01:15:25,507
- Yes, I have. Have you been well?
- Yes.

1973
01:15:25,707 --> 01:15:27,077
Come on in.

1974
01:15:27,407 --> 01:15:29,047
- Ma'am.
- You've made so many preparations.

1975
01:15:29,217 --> 01:15:32,186
Ma'am, Ms. Park Sul Nyeo sent flowers.

1976
01:15:32,187 --> 01:15:33,686
- My goodness.
- I can't believe it.

1977
01:15:33,687 --> 01:15:34,786
She sent blankets as well.

1978
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:37,156
So that you'd be warm this winter,

1979
01:15:37,157 --> 01:15:39,087
- she sent blankets as well.
- I can't believe it.

1980
01:15:39,387 --> 01:15:40,886
Take off your clothes. Hurry up and take them off.

1981
01:15:40,887 --> 01:15:43,097
I was so startled. How did this happen?

1982
01:15:44,057 --> 01:15:45,796
It's good to see you. It has been so long.

1983
01:15:45,797 --> 01:15:47,396
I know. It has been so long.

1984
01:15:47,397 --> 01:15:49,967
Seo Jin, I'm a big fan of yours.

1985
01:15:50,367 --> 01:15:51,536
(An unexpected confession)

1986
01:15:51,537 --> 01:15:53,406
I've watched every show of yours that was filmed abroad.

1987
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:55,336
You confessed your love as soon as you met him.

1988
01:15:55,337 --> 01:15:57,436
I've watched every show by you and Producer Na Yeong Seok.

1989
01:15:57,437 --> 01:15:58,576
She waited for you eagerly.

1990
01:15:58,577 --> 01:16:00,406
I'm a big fan as well.

1991
01:16:00,407 --> 01:16:01,976
- Thank you.
- You're the funniest.

1992
01:16:01,977 --> 01:16:04,176
- Me?
- You're the funniest in my opinion.

1993
01:16:04,177 --> 01:16:05,486
- Stand by Seo Jin's side.
- That's right.

1994
01:16:05,487 --> 01:16:06,786
- She's the absolute best.
- Now is your chance.

1995
01:16:06,787 --> 01:16:09,087
- Now is your chance.
- Why did we meet so belatedly?

1996
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:10,216
- Now is your chance.
- But...

1997
01:16:10,217 --> 01:16:11,626
What would you have done had you met sooner?

1998
01:16:11,627 --> 01:16:13,857
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

1999
01:16:13,887 --> 01:16:15,097
- Hey.
- Do you want to be my manager?

2000
01:16:15,997 --> 01:16:18,296
- Two secretaries.
- She waited for you eagerly.

2001
01:16:18,297 --> 01:16:20,266
Two secretaries. It's time for the two secretaries.

2002
01:16:20,267 --> 01:16:21,697
- Hurry up.
- Go.

2003
01:16:22,067 --> 01:16:23,497
- Ms. Sunwoo...
- It'll be hard, but...

2004
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:25,466
(The secretaries' hanbok)

2005
01:16:25,467 --> 01:16:26,667
These must be for men.

2006
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,006
- You wear the pink one.
- What?

2007
01:16:29,007 --> 01:16:31,977
Wear what you want to wear. I'll let you pick first.

2008
01:16:33,247 --> 01:16:35,946
- Will you put it on yourself?
- I'll change in the restroom.

2009
01:16:35,947 --> 01:16:37,076
- Do you need help?
- I'll help.

2010
01:16:37,077 --> 01:16:38,616
- It's okay.
- Stop it.

2011
01:16:38,617 --> 01:16:40,447
- You can wear it yourself.
- Okay.

2012
01:16:40,647 --> 01:16:42,516
It's so nice to wear hanbok together.

2013
01:16:42,517 --> 01:16:44,687
- I know.
- They look like her sons.

2014
01:16:46,027 --> 01:16:48,156
- My energy is getting sucked out.
- Their energy...

2015
01:16:48,157 --> 01:16:50,196
- My energy is getting sucked out.
- It's on another level.

2016
01:16:50,197 --> 01:16:52,926
I struggled so much when I began starring in variety shows.

2017
01:16:52,927 --> 01:16:54,226
I couldn't say a word.

2018
01:16:54,227 --> 01:16:55,666
All of them were on "Three Wheels."

2019
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:57,637
Yes. That was when they became friends.

2020
01:16:59,037 --> 01:17:01,006
- My goodness.
- Slowly. You must be tired.

2021
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:03,336
- My queen.
- She's a queen.

2022
01:17:03,337 --> 01:17:04,436
Seriously.

2023
01:17:04,437 --> 01:17:06,247
I can't believe she's 80.

2024
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:08,176
- She still looks like...
- Where should I sit?

2025
01:17:08,177 --> 01:17:09,716
- she's in her 60s.
- Over there.

2026
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:10,777
Over there?

2027
01:17:12,417 --> 01:17:14,786
(Lifetime Achievement Award for one person)

2028
01:17:14,787 --> 01:17:17,057
- We can sit down and eat now.
- I'll give it to you.

2029
01:17:17,317 --> 01:17:18,986
I was so startled.

2030
01:17:18,987 --> 01:17:20,586
I thought that I'd simply have a meal.

2031
01:17:20,587 --> 01:17:22,096
- I know.
- You guys showed up in hanbok.

2032
01:17:22,097 --> 01:17:24,796
- You became emotional earlier.
- Men can sit here.

2033
01:17:24,797 --> 01:17:28,567
(I don't know what to say.)

2034
01:17:28,897 --> 01:17:30,496
Hey, I'll have the managers sit on either side.

2035
01:17:30,497 --> 01:17:32,406
- Of course.
- Who do you like better?

2036
01:17:32,407 --> 01:17:33,866
- You know, - Who do you like better?

2037
01:17:33,867 --> 01:17:36,576
- I've never had a manager.
- Right.

2038
01:17:36,577 --> 01:17:39,046
But I felt happy...

2039
01:17:39,047 --> 01:17:42,016
when I thought of having such managers by my side.

2040
01:17:42,017 --> 01:17:44,276
- They have great chemistry.
- That's right.

2041
01:17:44,277 --> 01:17:45,916
- They're kind.
- That's right.

2042
01:17:45,917 --> 01:17:48,916
Seo Jin's kindness makes him special.

2043
01:17:48,917 --> 01:17:50,956
- He's sweet.
- Seo Jin is very kind.

2044
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:53,027
- The other one is a bit...
- He's flippant, right?

2045
01:17:53,387 --> 01:17:54,896
Is he rebellious?

2046
01:17:54,897 --> 01:17:56,356
- Earlier, - Okay.

2047
01:17:56,357 --> 01:17:58,326
I asked Kwang Kyu who the main manager was.

2048
01:17:58,327 --> 01:18:00,466
He said they were on the same level.

2049
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,436
When I said that it looked like Seo Jin was the chief manager...

2050
01:18:02,437 --> 01:18:05,406
and he was the road manager,

2051
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:06,767
he became unhappy.

2052
01:18:07,337 --> 01:18:10,107
Don't be like that. I told him that he was the coachman.

2053
01:18:11,777 --> 01:18:13,706
- Why did you do that? Coachman?
- That explains it.

2054
01:18:13,707 --> 01:18:15,416
I told him that he was the coachman...

2055
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:17,777
- and Seo Jin was the secretary.
- Coachman.

2056
01:18:17,977 --> 01:18:19,687
Kwang Kyu said, "I'm a secretary too."

2057
01:18:20,547 --> 01:18:23,286
"Coachman." I haven't heard that in a long while.

2058
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:25,687
(The man who claims to be a secretary comes out.)

2059
01:18:25,957 --> 01:18:27,386
Here they come.

2060
01:18:27,387 --> 01:18:30,526
Gosh, my ears tickle. Who is talking behind my back?

2061
01:18:30,527 --> 01:18:32,666
(The secretary with dimples comes out as well.)

2062
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:34,496
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

2063
01:18:34,497 --> 01:18:36,166
I said that you guys will sit on either side.

2064
01:18:36,167 --> 01:18:38,096
- Here.
- You can take this seat.

2065
01:18:38,097 --> 01:18:39,506
Kwang Kyu can take that seat.

2066
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:40,967
- "Kwang Kyu can take that seat." - Chief manager.

2067
01:18:41,507 --> 01:18:43,637
You put on hanbok without a complaint.

2068
01:18:43,937 --> 01:18:46,307
I had no choice since the trio was on a mission.

2069
01:18:46,677 --> 01:18:47,806
What if we had requested it?

2070
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,977
Then I wouldn't have worn it.

2071
01:18:49,617 --> 01:18:51,047
The three of them are scary.

2072
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:53,087
They're scary.

2073
01:18:53,517 --> 01:18:55,857
- It suits you.
- The blue hanbok suits you.

2074
01:18:57,457 --> 01:18:58,527
I don't like this.

2075
01:18:59,127 --> 01:19:01,157
I've only worn the king's robe, not this kind of hanbok.

2076
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,026
"I've only worn the king's robe."

2077
01:19:03,027 --> 01:19:06,197
(His dimples show his pride in his past roles as the king.)

2078
01:19:06,527 --> 01:19:08,866
- Seo Jin is the chief manager...
- You look so cool.

2079
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:10,696
- and Kwang Kyu is the coachman.
- The coachman.

2080
01:19:10,697 --> 01:19:11,837
(Being at the center of attention makes him feel faint.)

2081
01:19:11,937 --> 01:19:13,966
- You're the coachman.
- The coachman.

2082
01:19:13,967 --> 01:19:15,436
- Who?
- Hey.

2083
01:19:15,437 --> 01:19:16,906
"Coachman" is an outdated word.

2084
01:19:16,907 --> 01:19:18,906
- Coachman.
- Come on.

2085
01:19:18,907 --> 01:19:20,177
- For goodness' sake.
- Coachman, come here.

2086
01:19:20,747 --> 01:19:21,747
- Aunt.
- Come here.

2087
01:19:21,748 --> 01:19:23,377
- It's so nice.
- Yes.

2088
01:19:24,017 --> 01:19:26,016
It feels like a special episode of "Three Wheels."

2089
01:19:26,017 --> 01:19:27,586
- Right?
- Yes, it's a special episode...

2090
01:19:27,587 --> 01:19:28,656
- of "Three Wheels." - I love it.

2091
01:19:28,657 --> 01:19:32,357
(Seo Jin isn't used to the outfit and the atmosphere.)

2092
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:35,097
Why didn't you want an 80th birthday party?

2093
01:19:35,357 --> 01:19:38,156
I felt like a party was...

2094
01:19:38,157 --> 01:19:41,026
too much for me.

2095
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:42,766
Although I'm 80 years old,

2096
01:19:42,767 --> 01:19:45,007
I don't think of myself as a 80-year-old.

2097
01:19:45,667 --> 01:19:47,736
- If I have a party...
- Let's begin.

2098
01:19:47,737 --> 01:19:51,577
- Happy 80th birthday to you - Happy 80th birthday to you

2099
01:19:53,147 --> 01:19:55,716
(The surprise rice cake appears.)

2100
01:19:55,717 --> 01:19:59,786
- Happy 80th birthday to you - It's so beautiful.

2101
01:19:59,787 --> 01:20:04,317
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Sunwoo - Happy birthday, dear Ms. Sunwoo

2102
01:20:04,457 --> 01:20:07,887
(His mouth twitches.)

2103
01:20:08,627 --> 01:20:09,696
Thank you so much.

2104
01:20:09,697 --> 01:20:11,666
- Make a wish.
- Make a wish.

2105
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:13,196
- What?
- Make a wish first.

2106
01:20:13,197 --> 01:20:16,737
I wish everyone here will be healthy and happy.

2107
01:20:16,997 --> 01:20:19,866
I wish that my children will be healthy and successful.

2108
01:20:19,867 --> 01:20:22,876
I also have a wish for the viewers.

2109
01:20:22,877 --> 01:20:24,236
I wish that they'll be...

2110
01:20:24,237 --> 01:20:25,607
- healthy and happy.
- You have too many wishes.

2111
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:29,476
- Lastly, I wish for my health.
- That's the most important.

2112
01:20:29,477 --> 01:20:30,577
- Blow it out.
- Blow it out.

2113
01:20:32,247 --> 01:20:34,646
She blew it out in one go.

2114
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:36,686
- Her lung capacity is good.
- It's very good.

2115
01:20:36,687 --> 01:20:38,586
- It's rice cake.
- It's rice cake.

2116
01:20:38,587 --> 01:20:40,726
- The flowers?
- Yes, all of them are rice cake.

2117
01:20:40,727 --> 01:20:42,226
Take one.

2118
01:20:42,227 --> 01:20:44,327
I can't believe it. These flowers are rice cake.

2119
01:20:45,567 --> 01:20:46,996
How is rice cake so beautiful?

2120
01:20:46,997 --> 01:20:49,067
(The red rose rice cake symbolizes her everlasting passion.)

2121
01:20:49,437 --> 01:20:52,167
- May I eat it?
- Of course. It's yours to eat.

2122
01:20:52,837 --> 01:20:54,207
- It's a bit sweet.
- Okay.

2123
01:20:54,937 --> 01:20:56,337
- It's a bit sweet.
- Okay.

2124
01:20:56,637 --> 01:20:58,446
- My goodness.
- It's sweet.

2125
01:20:58,447 --> 01:21:01,046
- She doesn't eat sweet food.
- Mom doesn't like sweet food.

2126
01:21:01,047 --> 01:21:02,576
She doesn't eat sweet food.

2127
01:21:02,577 --> 01:21:04,146
- The flowers are beautiful.
- The flowers are beautiful.

2128
01:21:04,147 --> 01:21:05,316
Enjoy them like this.

2129
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:07,286
Aren't you glad that we prepared your 80th birthday party?

2130
01:21:07,287 --> 01:21:08,686
I'm glad. I was so surprised.

2131
01:21:08,687 --> 01:21:10,857
- This isn't the end.
- What's that?

2132
01:21:10,987 --> 01:21:12,386
I wrote a letter.

2133
01:21:12,387 --> 01:21:13,426
You're so sweet.

2134
01:21:13,427 --> 01:21:15,357
I was going to read it normally,

2135
01:21:15,557 --> 01:21:17,397
but they asked me to add the North Korean accent.

2136
01:21:17,857 --> 01:21:19,427
- The North Korean accent.
- I'll do it in that version.

2137
01:21:20,027 --> 01:21:21,766
- The North Korean accent.
- I'll do it in that version.

2138
01:21:21,767 --> 01:21:24,036
- She's good.
- She has done it many times.

2139
01:21:24,037 --> 01:21:25,367
"Ms. Yong Yeo, my mom."

2140
01:21:25,837 --> 01:21:28,437
(Ji Sun becomes a North Korean woman.)

2141
01:21:28,777 --> 01:21:30,077
"Ms. Yong Yeo, my mom."

2142
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:33,476
"We've already known each other..."

2143
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:36,347
"for over 20 years."

2144
01:21:37,317 --> 01:21:41,446
"You've always cherished the comedians."

2145
01:21:41,447 --> 01:21:42,516
That's right.

2146
01:21:42,517 --> 01:21:44,217
"You said that we didn't pretend..."

2147
01:21:44,457 --> 01:21:46,357
"to be coy or pretty."

2148
01:21:46,757 --> 01:21:50,096
"Mom, you've always had girlish charms..."

2149
01:21:50,097 --> 01:21:53,826
"and overflowing energy. I really can't believe..."

2150
01:21:53,827 --> 01:21:55,836
- Look at his facial expression.
- "that you turned 80."

2151
01:21:55,837 --> 01:21:57,497
Laugh if it's funny.

2152
01:21:57,767 --> 01:21:59,506
Are you laughing or crying?

2153
01:21:59,507 --> 01:22:00,566
(Torn)

2154
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:02,807
"You become thankful for the small things..."

2155
01:22:03,077 --> 01:22:06,307
"and give back to the others."

2156
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:10,917
"You make an effort not to show off."

2157
01:22:12,287 --> 01:22:13,916
- "Mom." - It's a great lesson.

2158
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:16,016
"As a senior in life..."

2159
01:22:16,017 --> 01:22:18,187
"and a big sister who buys us meals,"

2160
01:22:18,857 --> 01:22:22,226
"please stay by our side for many years to come."

2161
01:22:22,227 --> 01:22:23,257
Please do that.

2162
01:22:23,857 --> 01:22:27,296
(Is this finally the end of the epic?)

2163
01:22:27,297 --> 01:22:28,397
"In order to do that,"

2164
01:22:29,497 --> 01:22:34,307
"good health is a must!"

2165
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,037
"You know that, right?"

2166
01:22:36,937 --> 01:22:40,507
- "Mom, I love you and respect you." - He's fascinated.

2167
01:22:42,477 --> 01:22:44,476
How is she so good at it?

2168
01:22:44,477 --> 01:22:46,486
- She's so talented.
- How is she so good at it?

2169
01:22:46,487 --> 01:22:48,656
How are you so talented?

2170
01:22:48,657 --> 01:22:51,586
- I have a question. Seo Jin, - Yes?

2171
01:22:51,587 --> 01:22:53,986
what was the meaning of that facial expression?

2172
01:22:53,987 --> 01:22:56,696
- You seemed to be fascinated...
- I know. Was he laughing or...

2173
01:22:56,697 --> 01:22:58,496
- by...
- It was my first time seeing her.

2174
01:22:58,497 --> 01:23:01,396
- Really?
- I had only seen her on TV.

2175
01:23:01,397 --> 01:23:02,397
She's the best, right?

2176
01:23:02,637 --> 01:23:04,397
Her spirit...

2177
01:23:05,207 --> 01:23:06,536
Couldn't you laugh?

2178
01:23:06,537 --> 01:23:09,237
- I was so fascinated.
- You were fascinated.

2179
01:23:09,707 --> 01:23:12,307
I'm not a North Korean defector.

2180
01:23:14,177 --> 01:23:16,846
- She's from Jeolla Province.
- Yes.

2181
01:23:16,847 --> 01:23:18,847
Her energy is stronger in real life.

2182
01:23:22,317 --> 01:23:24,417
When she did the North Korean accent...

2183
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:27,586
The three of them were intense.

2184
01:23:27,587 --> 01:23:29,097
(He keeps saying that throughout the interview.)

2185
01:23:30,027 --> 01:23:31,027
Their energy...

2186
01:23:31,028 --> 01:23:33,666
We have this kind of energy since you're here.

2187
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:35,166
- Of course.
- Is that so?

2188
01:23:35,167 --> 01:23:36,196
Of course.

2189
01:23:36,197 --> 01:23:38,567
Tell Kwang Kyu that he gives you energy as well.

2190
01:23:39,107 --> 01:23:40,966
(Take good care of Kwang Kyu.)

2191
01:23:40,967 --> 01:23:42,106
Kwang Kyu gives us energy as well.

2192
01:23:42,107 --> 01:23:43,436
- They're together.
- Kwang Kyu too.

2193
01:23:43,437 --> 01:23:44,776
- Also, - They're together.

2194
01:23:44,777 --> 01:23:47,246
- as a manager...
- Aunt, I'm okay.

2195
01:23:47,247 --> 01:23:49,546
We said that because he asked...

2196
01:23:49,547 --> 01:23:50,777
- about our energy.
- Yes.

2197
01:23:51,947 --> 01:23:55,216
Mom, you went to different places today...

2198
01:23:55,217 --> 01:23:56,886
because you wanted to run a postnatal center.

2199
01:23:56,887 --> 01:23:58,056
That was the reason.

2200
01:23:58,057 --> 01:23:59,226
What was she looking for?

2201
01:23:59,227 --> 01:24:02,096
She was looking for a fire pit.

2202
01:24:02,097 --> 01:24:03,396
(Only fire pit)

2203
01:24:03,397 --> 01:24:04,426
A traditional one.

2204
01:24:04,427 --> 01:24:07,797
She said that women needed a fire pit to warm the private part.

2205
01:24:08,327 --> 01:24:11,267
She said that women needed a fire pit to warm the private part.

2206
01:24:12,207 --> 01:24:14,036
- Like far-infrared radiation.
- She said...

2207
01:24:14,037 --> 01:24:17,506
women needed to warm the private part.

2208
01:24:17,507 --> 01:24:18,706
- Wouldn't it be too hot?
- So...

2209
01:24:18,707 --> 01:24:19,977
Then...

2210
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:21,806
Women got healed faster back in the day...

2211
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,516
since they built fires in the fire pit.

2212
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,386
We heard this dozens of times...

2213
01:24:25,387 --> 01:24:26,886
in the car.

2214
01:24:26,887 --> 01:24:29,017
Neither one of them is married.

2215
01:24:31,957 --> 01:24:33,987
I'm speaking from my experience.

2216
01:24:34,057 --> 01:24:36,427
When I had my periods in my younger days...

2217
01:24:36,927 --> 01:24:38,296
When I had my periods in my younger days...

2218
01:24:38,297 --> 01:24:41,427
(The topic turns R-rated.)

2219
01:24:41,627 --> 01:24:43,967
(They become embarrassed in her stead.)

2220
01:24:44,067 --> 01:24:45,766
We heard this about 20 times.

2221
01:24:45,767 --> 01:24:47,566
Did you say this to men?

2222
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,906
- Yes. It was because...
- "Wait until you get old."

2223
01:24:49,907 --> 01:24:50,936
"You'll talk about these topics."

2224
01:24:50,937 --> 01:24:52,706
I pressed my belly...

2225
01:24:52,707 --> 01:24:55,676
- against the heated floor.
- Okay.

2226
01:24:55,677 --> 01:24:57,416
(He tries not to lose it.)

2227
01:24:57,417 --> 01:24:58,916
(He fails.)

2228
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:00,517
(Nervous)

2229
01:25:00,687 --> 01:25:03,056
Women these days complain about not getting their periods.

2230
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:05,987
(He feels faint.)

2231
01:25:06,457 --> 01:25:08,896
When you reach a certain age,

2232
01:25:08,897 --> 01:25:10,957
it doesn't come out no matter how much you warm your belly.

2233
01:25:12,567 --> 01:25:16,067
(His yawning skills have been upgraded.)

2234
01:25:16,837 --> 01:25:18,837
(He looks suspicious from the back.)

2235
01:25:18,907 --> 01:25:20,807
Building a fire...

2236
01:25:20,837 --> 01:25:22,777
Excuse me. He yawned ten times.

2237
01:25:23,637 --> 01:25:26,346
Do you have an upset stomach? Why are you yawning so much?

2238
01:25:26,347 --> 01:25:27,746
- Do you have an upset stomach?
- Sorry? No.

2239
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:29,476
I guess I made him drive too much.

2240
01:25:29,477 --> 01:25:30,776
I know.

2241
01:25:30,777 --> 01:25:32,986
As I drove, she kept telling me where to go.

2242
01:25:32,987 --> 01:25:34,286
I see.

2243
01:25:34,287 --> 01:25:37,087
- "Go this way. Go that way." - He's lying again.

2244
01:25:38,787 --> 01:25:40,356
He lies too much.

2245
01:25:40,357 --> 01:25:41,386
(Kwang Kyu is obsessed with white lies these days.)

2246
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:42,696
- He lies too much.
- Really?

2247
01:25:42,697 --> 01:25:45,097
I didn't tell him where to go.

2248
01:25:46,167 --> 01:25:47,667
Here comes the food.

2249
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:49,296
- Here comes the food.
- Here comes the food...

2250
01:25:49,297 --> 01:25:50,767
for the 80th birthday party.

2251
01:25:52,267 --> 01:25:54,637
- Oh, my.
- It looks delicious.

2252
01:25:55,037 --> 01:25:57,506
Look at this. This acorn jelly is made here, right?

2253
01:25:57,507 --> 01:25:58,576
My goodness.

2254
01:25:58,577 --> 01:26:00,446
- There are turnips from the area.
- There's turnip kimchi.

2255
01:26:00,447 --> 01:26:02,547
Gosh, I really wanted to eat it.

2256
01:26:02,817 --> 01:26:04,316
Sesame oil smells so good.

2257
01:26:04,317 --> 01:26:06,187
(The meal has been made with healthy ingredients.)

2258
01:26:06,217 --> 01:26:07,646
Oh, my.

2259
01:26:07,647 --> 01:26:09,456
We'll have a feast thanks to Ms. Sunwoo.

2260
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:10,587
I know.

2261
01:26:10,787 --> 01:26:12,626
- It smells good.
- It looks delicious.

2262
01:26:12,627 --> 01:26:14,087
- All right.
- Will you be okay?

2263
01:26:14,457 --> 01:26:15,626
It smells good.

2264
01:26:15,627 --> 01:26:16,857
(He distributes the plates as if it's the most natural thing.)

2265
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:19,626
There are all the dishes Ms. Sunwoo likes.

2266
01:26:19,627 --> 01:26:22,337
I know. Mom likes mung beans.

2267
01:26:22,437 --> 01:26:24,297
Ms. Sunwoo, have your fill.

2268
01:26:24,397 --> 01:26:27,567
(It's yummy.)

2269
01:26:28,977 --> 01:26:31,807
(She eats with bare hands.)

2270
01:26:33,347 --> 01:26:34,906
- All right.
- Over there.

2271
01:26:34,907 --> 01:26:36,616
- Okay.
- Try it. It's so tasty.

2272
01:26:36,617 --> 01:26:39,017
- Eat up. You must've been hungry.
- Yes.

2273
01:26:39,587 --> 01:26:41,346
- Wipe your hands.
- Ms. Sunwoo, have your fill.

2274
01:26:41,347 --> 01:26:42,356
- Yes.
- Have your fill.

2275
01:26:42,357 --> 01:26:46,286
(He learned Seo Jin's style of quiet care.)

2276
01:26:46,287 --> 01:26:47,787
The acorn jelly is nice.

2277
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:51,297
Ms. Sunwoo, when exactly is your 80th birthday?

2278
01:26:51,857 --> 01:26:53,596
- The day I turn 80...
- Did it pass already?

2279
01:26:53,597 --> 01:26:54,727
- No.
- August 15.

2280
01:26:54,927 --> 01:26:57,266
Ms. Sunwoo's birthday is Chuseok.

2281
01:26:57,267 --> 01:26:59,907
- Chuseok.
- Really?

2282
01:27:00,037 --> 01:27:01,367
When I was young,

2283
01:27:02,237 --> 01:27:04,607
I never got a birthday meal.

2284
01:27:04,977 --> 01:27:06,306
- Why not?
- Since it was Chuseok,

2285
01:27:06,307 --> 01:27:08,276
- the family has ancestral rites.
- It was the same day.

2286
01:27:08,277 --> 01:27:10,846
They just set aside a small bit of food for me.

2287
01:27:10,847 --> 01:27:12,517
You must've been sad.

2288
01:27:12,647 --> 01:27:15,516
When I was young, I didn't even feel sad.

2289
01:27:15,517 --> 01:27:17,457
- Did you just accept it?
- I just accepted it.

2290
01:27:18,857 --> 01:27:21,486
Now that I'm old, people prepare a feast for me.

2291
01:27:21,487 --> 01:27:22,957
- My goodness.
- My goodness.

2292
01:27:23,857 --> 01:27:27,026
Do you guys meet once a year?

2293
01:27:27,027 --> 01:27:28,766
- Once a year, my foot.
- We meet more often.

2294
01:27:28,767 --> 01:27:30,537
- When Ms. Sunwoo launched...
- I met her last week too.

2295
01:27:30,837 --> 01:27:33,266
her YouTube channel,

2296
01:27:33,267 --> 01:27:34,967
there were 11 subscribers.

2297
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:36,107
- In the beginning?
- Yes.

2298
01:27:36,108 --> 01:27:38,106
- Ms. Sunwoo's YouTube channel.
- Yes.

2299
01:27:38,107 --> 01:27:40,646
I didn't know that it'd be so successful.

2300
01:27:40,647 --> 01:27:43,517
Ms. Sunwoo's YouTube channel is the best this year.

2301
01:27:43,817 --> 01:27:45,077
- Seriously.
- Yes.

2302
01:27:45,687 --> 01:27:47,817
- I'm so thankful.
- Yes.

2303
01:27:48,247 --> 01:27:51,286
It's like a TV show with good viewers' ratings.

2304
01:27:51,287 --> 01:27:52,887
- Yes.
- It's the best.

2305
01:27:53,187 --> 01:27:54,457
Kwang Kyu, how many subscribers does your YouTube channel have?

2306
01:27:54,487 --> 01:27:57,357
Mine? Must you ask me at this moment?

2307
01:27:58,157 --> 01:28:00,026
- Do you have a YouTube channel?
- Do you have a YouTube channel?

2308
01:28:00,027 --> 01:28:02,267
- He has a YouTube channel.
- I have 80,000 subscribers.

2309
01:28:02,397 --> 01:28:04,566
- That's a lot.
- Eighty thousand is a lot.

2310
01:28:04,567 --> 01:28:05,906
I run a golf YouTube channel.

2311
01:28:05,907 --> 01:28:09,637
You? You're bad at golf.

2312
01:28:09,777 --> 01:28:11,737
Being bad at golf is the content.

2313
01:28:11,807 --> 01:28:14,277
- That's the content.
- Is being bad at golf a concept?

2314
01:28:14,677 --> 01:28:16,677
It isn't a concept. I'm bad at it.

2315
01:28:17,617 --> 01:28:19,446
It isn't a concept. I'm bad at it.

2316
01:28:19,447 --> 01:28:21,417
(Laughing)

2317
01:28:22,457 --> 01:28:25,957
(My older bestie is pitiful and funny no matter what he does.)

2318
01:28:26,057 --> 01:28:27,086
(He has a clear sense of self.)

2319
01:28:27,087 --> 01:28:29,457
- You want to get better.
- Yes.

2320
01:28:29,957 --> 01:28:33,127
I have a question. How does it feel to be a manager?

2321
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:36,097
How does it feel to be Ms. Sunwoo's secretary?

2322
01:28:38,567 --> 01:28:40,207
- Well...
- It's okay. Be honest.

2323
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:44,537
Ms. Sunwoo isn't someone I feel comfortable around.

2324
01:28:45,177 --> 01:28:48,046
I've been on many shows...

2325
01:28:48,047 --> 01:28:50,046
- with many senior male actors.
- That's right.

2326
01:28:50,047 --> 01:28:51,377
So...

2327
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:54,646
- Since she's quite honest, - Right.

2328
01:28:54,647 --> 01:28:57,756
she's like the female version of Baek Il Seop.

2329
01:28:57,757 --> 01:28:59,527
(She's like the female version of Baek Il Seop.)

2330
01:28:59,587 --> 01:29:02,326
(They understand right away.)

2331
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:04,256
- I know what you mean.
- The female Baek Il Seop.

2332
01:29:04,257 --> 01:29:06,727
- The female Baek Il Seop.
- He's ruthlessly honest.

2333
01:29:07,097 --> 01:29:09,797
Seo Jin likes Baek Il Seop a lot.

2334
01:29:09,997 --> 01:29:11,596
He's honest.

2335
01:29:11,597 --> 01:29:14,106
I love that he speaks his mind with honesty.

2336
01:29:14,107 --> 01:29:15,107
That's right.

2337
01:29:15,237 --> 01:29:17,077
- I understand that feeling.
- How was it?

2338
01:29:17,577 --> 01:29:20,606
Seo Jin, you're quite charming.

2339
01:29:20,607 --> 01:29:21,977
Just looking at him...

2340
01:29:22,547 --> 01:29:25,477
- makes me...
- Yes.

2341
01:29:26,147 --> 01:29:27,617
sit up.

2342
01:29:28,187 --> 01:29:31,157
- Is that his charm?
- I feel nervous...

2343
01:29:31,357 --> 01:29:32,787
because I want to get on his good side.

2344
01:29:33,957 --> 01:29:35,026
Because I want to get on his good side.

2345
01:29:35,027 --> 01:29:37,096
(There's no exit once you fall for his charms.)

2346
01:29:37,097 --> 01:29:38,826
They're so forward.

2347
01:29:38,827 --> 01:29:40,927
I don't know how to talk to him.

2348
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,596
- Let's talk.
- Is there no more food?

2349
01:29:44,597 --> 01:29:45,866
- Yes.
- If there's no more food...

2350
01:29:45,867 --> 01:29:47,367
- Is that a microphone?
- Yes.

2351
01:29:48,067 --> 01:29:49,476
(A liquor bottle microphone appears.)

2352
01:29:49,477 --> 01:29:50,706
Speak up.

2353
01:29:50,707 --> 01:29:52,377
- Is that an actual microphone?
- Is that an actual microphone?

2354
01:29:56,847 --> 01:29:59,487
(She suddenly sings "Wanted, Sexy Music, Hot Stuff.")

2355
01:30:00,517 --> 01:30:04,417
(The best friends' talent show begins to celebrate her birthday.)

2356
01:30:06,057 --> 01:30:10,457
(Speechless)

2357
01:30:12,097 --> 01:30:13,627
(Happy 80th birthday.)

2358
01:30:15,837 --> 01:30:17,636
(Peek-a-boo)

2359
01:30:17,637 --> 01:30:18,796
It's Lee Seo Jin!

2360
01:30:18,797 --> 01:30:22,277
(His energy is getting drained, but it's fun.)

2361
01:30:23,207 --> 01:30:24,876
(My goodness)

2362
01:30:24,877 --> 01:30:27,206
Make some noise for the 80th birthday!

2363
01:30:27,207 --> 01:30:28,917
- Yes!
- One, two, three!

2364
01:30:29,647 --> 01:30:32,887
(Let's bring up the energy.)

2365
01:30:34,587 --> 01:30:35,687
I can't see the lyrics.

2366
01:30:35,817 --> 01:30:39,427
(This is fun.)

2367
01:30:41,787 --> 01:30:44,756
(Singing the lyrics)

2368
01:30:44,757 --> 01:30:47,497
Yong Yeo is the best!

2369
01:30:47,927 --> 01:30:48,997
(The perfect finale)

2370
01:30:49,937 --> 01:30:52,566
("Wanted, Sexy Music, Hot Stuff" heated up the atmosphere.)

2371
01:30:52,567 --> 01:30:55,166
I'll sing "The Hundred-Year Life."

2372
01:30:55,167 --> 01:30:57,436
Mom, I wish you a long life.

2373
01:30:57,437 --> 01:31:00,247
(A congratulatory performance for My Star's long life)

2374
01:31:00,807 --> 01:31:08,017
(When Death comes for me at the age of 80)

2375
01:31:08,587 --> 01:31:14,526
(Tell them that I can't go because my YouTube channel is a hit)

2376
01:31:14,527 --> 01:31:16,227
- That's right.
- That's right.

2377
01:31:16,527 --> 01:31:22,126
(When Death comes for me at the age of 90)

2378
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:23,897
- The age of 90.
- It's 10 years later.

2379
01:31:23,997 --> 01:31:27,636
(Tell them that I can't go)

2380
01:31:27,637 --> 01:31:31,237
(Because Kyung Sil, Hye Lyun, and Ji Sun are begging me to stay)

2381
01:31:32,577 --> 01:31:35,476
- The age of 100.
- It's 20 years later.

2382
01:31:35,477 --> 01:31:36,576
It'll come soon.

2383
01:31:36,577 --> 01:31:38,416
(When Death comes for me at the age of 100)

2384
01:31:38,417 --> 01:31:39,746
She can't go.

2385
01:31:39,747 --> 01:31:43,886
(Tell them that I can't go because Seo Jin is looking after me)

2386
01:31:43,887 --> 01:31:45,857
(I can't go.)

2387
01:31:46,557 --> 01:31:49,727
(He'll film My Grumpy Secretary 20 years later.)

2388
01:31:50,627 --> 01:31:54,027
(It's a day with the friends who love My Star.)

2389
01:31:54,127 --> 01:32:00,207
(Ms. Sunwoo, be healthy for many years to come.)

2390
01:32:00,367 --> 01:32:01,506
Unbelievable.

2391
01:32:01,507 --> 01:32:03,277
(They have a group photo to remember the day.)

2392
01:32:04,777 --> 01:32:06,677
The top of your head smells good, honey.

2393
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:10,817
- Smile, even if it's fake.
- Honey.

2394
01:32:11,047 --> 01:32:12,446
- Smile.
- Okay.

2395
01:32:12,447 --> 01:32:16,087
Mom, stay healthy.

2396
01:32:16,417 --> 01:32:19,227
The surprise 80th birthday party was good, right?

2397
01:32:20,587 --> 01:32:23,397
Mom, I'm Mi Sun.

2398
01:32:25,197 --> 01:32:27,967
Mom, I'm Mi Sun.

2399
01:32:29,037 --> 01:32:31,036
Are you enjoying your party?

2400
01:32:31,037 --> 01:32:32,266
(A voice message)

2401
01:32:32,267 --> 01:32:36,306
I wanted to be there more than anyone.

2402
01:32:36,307 --> 01:32:39,377
I'm so sorry that I couldn't be there.

2403
01:32:40,507 --> 01:32:43,647
It's because of my poor health.

2404
01:32:44,547 --> 01:32:46,747
I'm so sorry. Seriously.

2405
01:32:47,017 --> 01:32:50,286
You've always cherished me...

2406
01:32:50,287 --> 01:32:53,086
and worried about me as if I were your own daughter.

2407
01:32:53,087 --> 01:32:55,086
Thank you so much.

2408
01:32:55,087 --> 01:32:56,927
(Mi Sun couldn't join the 80th birthday party.)

2409
01:32:57,257 --> 01:32:59,366
To be honest,

2410
01:32:59,367 --> 01:33:01,967
I want to continue leading a cool life like you.

2411
01:33:02,227 --> 01:33:05,267
So I'll take good care of my health.

2412
01:33:06,137 --> 01:33:08,036
Be happy always.

2413
01:33:08,037 --> 01:33:11,406
- Thank you.
- I love you a lot, okay?

2414
01:33:11,407 --> 01:33:13,047
Thank you.

2415
01:33:13,447 --> 01:33:16,276
- I love you, Mom. I respect you.
- I love you.

2416
01:33:16,277 --> 01:33:19,086
- Thank you.
- We love you too.

2417
01:33:19,087 --> 01:33:21,286
- We love you, Mom.
- We love you.

2418
01:33:21,287 --> 01:33:22,757
(She had a simple, but happy party with people she loved.)

2419
01:33:23,087 --> 01:33:24,716
(You said that you didn't want an 80th birthday party.)

2420
01:33:24,717 --> 01:33:26,157
I was so happy that it moved me to tears.

2421
01:33:26,787 --> 01:33:31,157
I personally didn't want an 80th birthday party.

2422
01:33:31,757 --> 01:33:34,596
But it was nice to receive it.

2423
01:33:34,597 --> 01:33:37,736
So when your mom says that she doesn't want a party,

2424
01:33:37,737 --> 01:33:40,437
don't believe her words.

2425
01:33:42,407 --> 01:33:45,137
Don't believe her words. Give her an 80th birthday party.

2426
01:33:47,447 --> 01:33:49,917
I've never had a secretary.

2427
01:33:50,117 --> 01:33:51,916
It was my first time having secretaries.

2428
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:56,187
Seo Jin held my hand so that I wouldn't fall down.

2429
01:33:58,217 --> 01:34:01,626
Kwang Kyu came and held my hand...

2430
01:34:01,627 --> 01:34:03,026
upon seeing Seo Jin do it.

2431
01:34:03,027 --> 01:34:04,626
(The secretaries stayed with her throughout the day.)

2432
01:34:04,627 --> 01:34:06,296
I was so thankful.

2433
01:34:06,297 --> 01:34:08,066
Secretaries should be quick-witted.

2434
01:34:08,067 --> 01:34:09,667
They were so quick-witted.

2435
01:34:09,797 --> 01:34:11,137
They were Grade A secretaries.

2436
01:34:13,967 --> 01:34:15,536
I've only known them for a day,

2437
01:34:15,537 --> 01:34:18,476
but both Kwang Kyu and Seo Jin were nice.

2438
01:34:18,477 --> 01:34:20,706
It was an honour to have them act...

2439
01:34:20,707 --> 01:34:22,307
as my secretaries.

2440
01:34:22,447 --> 01:34:23,676
I had so much fun.

2441
01:34:23,677 --> 01:34:25,676
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2442
01:34:25,677 --> 01:34:27,187
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2443
01:34:27,887 --> 01:34:29,687
I can't do it anymore. It's too exhausting.

2444
01:34:30,157 --> 01:34:32,057
We've used up our stamina for a month.

2445
01:34:32,487 --> 01:34:34,087
Let's go outside.

2446
01:34:34,557 --> 01:34:36,197
(My Stars who made the secretaries use up their energy)

2447
01:34:36,827 --> 01:34:38,627
(Ahn Eun Jin and Jang Ki Yong)

2448
01:34:39,027 --> 01:34:41,627
(Look after My Stars as they film a drama.)

2449
01:34:41,897 --> 01:34:43,637
(Please take good care of our actors.)

2450
01:34:43,897 --> 01:34:45,737
(When My Star feels warm, they use a handheld fan.)

2451
01:34:46,037 --> 01:34:48,037
(So that My Star won't get wet, they hold up an umbrella.)

2452
01:34:48,207 --> 01:34:49,177
(You're doing great!)

2453
01:34:49,178 --> 01:34:50,307
(They shower them with words of praise.)

2454
01:34:50,337 --> 01:34:52,307
Please film a video for monitoring.

2455
01:34:53,647 --> 01:34:55,247
(Startled)

2456
01:34:55,377 --> 01:34:57,877
(Nothing comes easy for the half-century-old managers.)

2457
01:34:58,177 --> 01:34:59,586
(They face a huge project.)

2458
01:34:59,587 --> 01:35:01,247
(Making a cameo appearance in My Stars' drama)

2459
01:35:01,647 --> 01:35:03,656
(From being a couple...)

2460
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:05,157
(to having a big fight)

2461
01:35:06,687 --> 01:35:07,957
(They keep having unexpected situations.)

2462
01:35:08,157 --> 01:35:09,797
(Patting)

2463
01:35:10,027 --> 01:35:11,157
Why did you hit me?

2464
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:13,196
(The insane amount of ad-libs...)

2465
01:35:13,197 --> 01:35:14,697
(put them in danger of laughing.)

2466
01:35:15,097 --> 01:35:17,066
(The secretaries' first go at a cameo appearance)

2467
01:35:17,067 --> 01:35:18,836
(What will be the result?)

2468
01:35:18,837 --> 01:35:20,807
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2469
01:35:20,967 --> 01:35:26,777
(My Grumpy Secretary)
