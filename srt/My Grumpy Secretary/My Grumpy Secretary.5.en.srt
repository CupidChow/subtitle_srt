1
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,920
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,620
(My Star is waiting at an agency office in Seongsu-dong.)

3
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,860
(Kwang Kyu arrives first.)

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,760
Hello.

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,299
You're in bad shape again.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,400
(You're in bad shape again.)

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,900
(Groaning)

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,240
What's wrong?

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,940
What is it? Are you unwell?

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,810
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,379
You always say that.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,109
(White lie)

13
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,409
(He means he didn't get to sleep.)

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,550
Kwang Kyu,

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,879
Seo Jin is running late.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,790
Is he? How dare he?

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,989
(He sounds upset but smiles.)

18
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,190
How can a manager run late?

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,430
He should get yelled at.

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,360
(Last time when Kwang Kyu was running late)

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,799
(Upset)

22
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
(He's out of his mind, isn't he?)

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,340
(Today, you are out of your mind, aren't you?)

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,100
We...

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,710
You are all swarming around me because Seo Jin isn't here.

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,379
I didn't realise we had so many cameras.

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,380
(Swarming)

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,279
My goodness.

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,350
(Happy)

30
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,950
(Shortly, Seo Jin's car arrives.)

31
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:24,090
(At last! There he comes!)

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,390
(The older bestie comes to welcome him.)

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,630
(Ready to yell)

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,130
Look at him.

35
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,099
(Blocking with his foot)

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,269
Hey! Do you know what time it is?

37
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,810
You live nearby too!

38
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,239
It takes me two hours to get here from Songdo,

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,540
and I still arrived early.

40
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,979
I got here half an hour ago.

41
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,350
All right. Wait.

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,220
(Closing the door)

43
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,650
What? I'm talking.

44
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,849
Why would you close the door when I am talking?

45
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,190
(He blocks the nag.)

46
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,759
(Flustered)

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,790
He's unbelievable.

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,389
When you were in 3rd grade, I was in 6th grade.

49
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,900
How many times do I have to remind you that?

50
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,900
What is he doing after coming in late?

51
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,639
(In just 3 seconds, his attention shifts.)

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,700
It's cute.

53
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,210
Hey, try to come early, will you?

54
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,680
(He tries to get past the situation with a smile.)

55
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,950
Hey.

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,519
(Looking at him up and down)

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,049
Do you like my outfit?

58
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,150
- Do you?
- Yes.

59
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,959
That's a nice jacket.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,260
(Kwang Kyu loves Seo Jin's outfit.)

61
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:38,400
It's perfect for this weather.

62
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,960
Not too thick.

63
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,229
Before you go in...

64
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,699
- The car is here.
- Right.

65
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,740
I see.

66
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,239
Kwang Kyu,

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,880
it's the car you always drive. So you can drive it easily.

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,479
(It's a special car for My Stars.)

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,920
The back seats are really spacious.

70
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,750
And the ceiling is very high too.

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,590
There are curtains too.

72
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,519
Big monitors too.

73
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,760
(There is a 21.5-inch smart monitor for My Stars.)

74
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,630
(And it's equipped with a 2-row massage function too.)

75
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,699
(Massage mode on)

76
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,830
It's working.

77
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,729
You can control the strength of the massage too.

78
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,530
(For My Star's safety)

79
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,640
That feels nice.

80
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,969
That feels nice.

81
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,839
(Comfortable)

82
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
When the stars feel tired,

83
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,780
they get this massage, and it refreshes them.

84
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,289
(Spotting something)

85
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,150
- Isn't he Ji Chang Wook?
- He is.

86
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,790
- Is he Doh Kyung Soo?
- Yes.

87
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,729
Have you met Chang Wook?

88
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:43,960
I've never met him. Have you?

89
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,160
I've worked with Chang Wook.

90
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,929
I played a cameo role.

91
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,229
(The actor specialising in cameo roles knows a lot of other actors.)

92
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,539
(He's played about 100 cameo roles.)

93
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,670
I've never met Kyung Soo.

94
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,710
Are you excited to meet My Stars?

95
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,480
Not at all.

96
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,680
Why not?

97
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,110
I told you not to cast men, didn't I?

98
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,320
(He's very sensitive about My Star's gender.)

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,750
(His strict taste makes him laugh in vain.)

100
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,120
But half of this world is men.

101
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,819
Do whatever you like.

102
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,889
(Unhappy)

103
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,390
But don't expect anything fun out of this shoot.

104
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,129
(Yawning)

105
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,200
Goodness.

106
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Is it going to be like having a meal with younger actors?

107
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,499
Is it this way?

108
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,709
(While the Grumpy Secretaries show no interest, )

109
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,910
(the male My Star appears.)

110
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,579
It's cold!

111
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,339
(My Star Ji Chang Wook)

112
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,910
Hello.

113
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,680
(Looking around)

114
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,389
Really?

115
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,250
(Meanwhile, not knowing what's happening, they're resting.)

116
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,519
Today,

117
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,559
(A big yawn)

118
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,519
we're serving male actors, so you can drive comfortably.

119
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,559
Of course.

120
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,260
(They are most relaxed.)

121
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,530
Hello. Hello, there.

122
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,970
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

123
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,369
(Peeking)

124
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,100
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

125
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,210
Hey.

126
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,539
Hello.

127
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,339
(As soon as he sees Chang Wook, his dimples activate.)

128
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,710
- Hello, Kwang Kyu.
- Turn off the massage mode.

129
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,749
- Let's turn it off.
- Okay.

130
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,119
We were testing the massage mode,

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,850
so you could get a massage.

132
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,520
I'm okay.

133
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,720
Is this okay?

134
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,359
- To have them as my managers?
- Try it.

135
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,060
If you feel uncomfortable, you can drive, Chang Wook.

136
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,099
I think I will feel more comfortable if I drive.

137
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,030
(My Star is smiling but feels uncomfortable.)

138
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,299
Hello.

139
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,669
I am Ji Chang Wook's manager, Jeong Seong Hyeon.

140
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,100
Hello.

141
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,100
Let's check the schedule first.

142
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,210
Today is a busy day.

143
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,739
(My Star's OTT series, )

144
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,510
("The Manipulated" will soon be released, )

145
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,649
(so today is the YouTube promotion day.)

146
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,979
(My Star's Schedule)

147
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,879
(Starting with picking up My Star)

148
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,949
(11:30am, Mapo-gu, "Cheonggyesan Daengi Records")

149
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,550
(4pm, Gangnam-gu, Na Yeong Seok's YouTube)

150
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,320
(They can't seem to get rid of each other.)

151
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,390
(Director Na Yeong Seok, Specialty: Nagging at Seo Jin)

152
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,200
- Why are you here?
- What do you mean?

153
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,470
(Today, they will meet as a director and a manager.)

154
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,470
(It's not going to be an easy day.)

155
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,270
Let's check the schedule first.

156
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,279
Today is a busy day.

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Jung Suk.

158
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,209
- Yeong Seok.
- Yes.

159
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,749
Their names sound similar.

160
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

161
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,580
He feels more like a CEO.

162
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,619
(It's like reporting his schedule to his boss.)

163
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,720
No.

164
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,860
There's no time to eat.

165
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,059
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

166
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,490
Make sure you prepare food for them.

167
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,230
What? Me?

168
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,400
We are both managers.

169
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,629
Do a good job, will you?

170
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,799
If there's anything you are craving for, tell him anytime.

171
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,069
How dare you treat me like that in front of Chang Wook?

172
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,469
You should learn this from him.

173
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,869
Learn this.

174
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,979
(The Grumpy Secretaries love each other as always.)

175
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,179
I will brief you.

176
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
Briefing.

177
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,079
His new work will be released in a week.

178
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,319
So this is a promotion week.

179
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,980
- It's "The Manipulated," isn't it?
- We've seen the trailer.

180
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,789
- Don't worry.
- And...

181
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,120
Are you wearing makeup too?

182
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,760
I am.

183
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,060
Hey!

184
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,729
I didn't get my makeup and hair done.

185
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,599
- How dare you get them done?
- Gosh.

186
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey.

187
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,169
Since the morning,

188
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,899
he was really nervous about appearing on this show.

189
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,699
- He was?
- He was really nervous.

190
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,039
He got the makeup done.

191
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,239
This is what he needs.

192
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,609
There's a corporate card too.

193
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,479
There's a tumbler, perfume, jelly,

194
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,350
and artificial tears.

195
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,449
- He likes to drink coffee.
- Coffee.

196
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,289
You can get coffee at a nearby cafe.

197
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,120
Please take good care of him.

198
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,189
- There's no coffee now.
- There's no coffee now?

199
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,259
Go fill it up.

200
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,559
Please take good care of him.

201
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,960
- Okay.
- All right.

202
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,429
I'll be leaving.

203
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,460
(He's waving, but he's anxious.)

204
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,729
Is there a cafe nearby?

205
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,729
The cafe we always go to get coffee is nearby.

206
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,999
Can you walk there? Or do you need to drive there?

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,639
You can walk.

208
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,409
- What kind of coffee do you like?
- I'd go for an iced Americano.

209
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,469
- Iced Americano?
- Yes.

210
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,909
Let's go get coffee then.

211
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,340
- What do you think?
- Let's do that.

212
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,209
- I will take that.
- Okay.

213
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,210
- I will be here.
- Okay.

214
00:07:55,211 --> 00:07:56,680
- Come with us.
- I'm coming too?

215
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,049
It's my first time.

216
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,550
(My Star follows them to the cafe too.)

217
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,360
What's the point?

218
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,890
Actually,

219
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,859
I could've just gone there myself.

220
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,890
(Actually, I could've just gone there myself.)

221
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,560
Why are you taking a selfie?

222
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,270
- Why are you taking a selfie?
- To send it to "Radio Star."

223
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,070
You look like the CEO of my agency.

224
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,410
And he...

225
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,809
We are friends.

226
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,640
- We are...
- Every agency has...

227
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,650
some people without a title, you know.

228
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,619
- Like...
- An advisor.

229
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
Yes, an advisor.

230
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,120
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

231
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,449
- Long time no see.
- Did you two work together?

232
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,959
We starred in this drama...

233
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,119
called "If You Wish Upon Me."

234
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,959
- I see.
- That's where we met.

235
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,329
He made a special appearance.

236
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,030
- Right.
- That's when we met.

237
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,370
(Chang Wook appears, driving a nice sports car.)

238
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,069
(And Kwang Kyu is homeless.)

239
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,770
(Dirty)

240
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,980
(Looking around)

241
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,180
Where's this cafe?

242
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,750
- I will guide you there.
- Okay.

243
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,419
(My Star leads them to his favourite cafe.)

244
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,690
Are we going this way?

245
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,519
(He reaches out for the tumbler.)

246
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,090
No, it's okay.

247
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,690
- The tumbler.
- Just think of me...

248
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,359
as your manager...

249
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,860
and treat me like one.

250
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,230
(Looks around to find the cafe)

251
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,539
- Is it here?
- Is it here?

252
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,639
- What?
- Really?

253
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,170
- This is the cafe.
- Is this war zone or what?

254
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,309
(The cafe is at the most unexpected place.)

255
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,810
- This is the cafe.
- Is this war zone or what?

256
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
This is the cafe?

257
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:38,819
- Do we order through this hole?
- Yes. Iced Americano.

258
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,990
- Iced Americano, please.
- Okay.

259
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,149
I will take your order.

260
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,289
(My Star likes hip spots.)

261
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,589
- Please give me a receipt.
- Okay.

262
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,259
(You pay through the hole too.)

263
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,229
Is this a doggy door or what?

264
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,430
Was this always like this?

265
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,270
(Looking around)

266
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,700
(He looks like he's about to get sucked into the hole.)

267
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,070
Are you fascinated by it?

268
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,940
I was just wondering how it looked inside.

269
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,610
Why don't you stick your head inside it?

270
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,350
Did they cover this up on purpose? With concrete?

271
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,349
It's quite spacious inside.

272
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,550
(Seo Jin is still curious.)

273
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,990
Goodness.

274
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,889
(Soon, they become quiet again.)

275
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,959
You seem flustered.

276
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,029
Yes.

277
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,959
Why are you flustered?

278
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,030
- I...
- Here's your coffee.

279
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,930
Rarely look for...

280
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,830
my manager at a shoot.

281
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,869
- That's nice.
- But I think...

282
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,070
I'm going to look for them today.

283
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,210
- For the first time.
- Yes.

284
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,809
- My Star, your coffee.
- Thank you.

285
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,910
Oh, My Star.

286
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,879
First impression.

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,780
You complained about serving two male actors.

288
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,750
I'm still not too pleased about it.

289
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,960
But Chang Wook had a great first impression.

290
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,230
I liked his first impression.

291
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,259
Who usually drives?

292
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,630
Kwang Kyu usually drives.

293
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,930
He used to drive a taxi.

294
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,569
So he drives well.

295
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,670
(He brags about his older bestie.)

296
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,300
I can drive comfortably.

297
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,410
Were you friends with Kyung Soo even before?

298
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,480
- We got a little bit closer...
- Through this work?

299
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,350
Through this work.

300
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,450
We are picking up Kyung Soo at a salon.

301
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,819
Yes. In Gangnam.

302
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,420
(Their first job is to pick up another My Star, Kyung Soo.)

303
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,859
Chang Wook, you've been to the shop already, right?

304
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,329
Yes. I got my hair and makeup done here.

305
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,429
- At the office?
- Yes.

306
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,529
(He cleans the car nicely before My Star gets on it.)

307
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,599
Yes.

308
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,369
Let's get going now.

309
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,769
Let's get going now. Get in.

310
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,899
(My Star still feels awkward about being served by them.)

311
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,200
- I will get in, then.
- Okay.

312
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,170
This is a nice car.

313
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,609
I will start driving.

314
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,780
(They leave to pick up another My Star, Kyung Soo.)

315
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,450
- I saw the trailer.
- Yes.

316
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,349
It's another action movie.

317
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,979
It's a full-on action movie. From start to end.

318
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,820
Recently, most of your works are action, aren't they?

319
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,590
Yes. I've done a lot of action movies and dramas recently.

320
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,660
I actually... Goodness.

321
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,490
(Suddenly stopping)

322
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,430
- I am sorry.
- We will be fine, right?

323
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,270
I bragged to him so much about you being a good driver.

324
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,200
- I...
- As soon as he got in...

325
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,240
(As soon as he got in, he lost trust.)

326
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,909
We're turning left.

327
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:15,910
(Turning left?)

328
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:19,510
I don't like doing action.

329
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,780
- You don't?
- I don't.

330
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,080
But from what I remember,

331
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,349
- I've done a lot of action stuff.
- you've done a lot of it.

332
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,350
Yes. I have done... Goodness. I've done a lot of it.

333
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,619
What's wrong with you?

334
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,689
Hey, why would you yell?

335
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,959
I'm doing my best.

336
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,790
I can't talk to the guest.

337
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,359
I am sorry.

338
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,529
Goodness.

339
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,029
So what happened?

340
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,300
I'm done talking.

341
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,900
Chang Wook, I'm sorry.

342
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,040
Please cut me some slack. We once acted together.

343
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,340
Anyway, it was hard shooting an action movie.

344
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,579
- So you're not a big fan of action.
- No.

345
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,949
There are actors who go crazy about action.

346
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,980
They have to do the stunt themselves.

347
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,690
I always insist...

348
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,919
that whatever my stunt double does better,

349
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
he should do it.

350
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,859
That's my thought exactly.

351
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,459
As actors, there's only so much...

352
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,660
- action we can do.
- Of course.

353
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,969
So a lot of the time, it turns out better...

354
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,840
when my stunt double does the job.

355
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,270
- I'm sure.
- Yes.

356
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,770
I don't like doing action.

357
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,610
- Have you done any?
- I've done it with you.

358
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,210
You only got beaten by me.

359
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,650
(Killer Kyu came to catch Seo Jin.)

360
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
(Goodness.)

361
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,720
(This is why Kwang Kyu came to hate action scenes.)

362
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,730
(Sad ending)

363
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,900
That's why I don't like it.

364
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,330
Aren't you in your thirties now, Chang Wook?

365
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,569
I'm nearly done being in my thirties.

366
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,670
- Really?
- Yes.

367
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,110
- What year were you born?
- I was born in 1987.

368
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,879
- It's the end of your thirties.
- Yes.

369
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,309
- You're in your late thirties now.
- I'm in my late thirties.

370
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,680
Late thirties is a great time.

371
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,850
You are not feeling anxious, are you?

372
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
- Me?
- Yes.

373
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:09,919
I don't feel anxious,

374
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,360
but I feel sorry about it.

375
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,059
- About the passing time?
- Yes.

376
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,959
As time passes, there are fewer things I can do.

377
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,700
- In terms of a role, you mean.
- Yes.

378
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,400
I feel sorry about that.

379
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,499
But it's my first time seeing you, you know.

380
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Yes.

381
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,840
I think...

382
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,610
- you look really nice.
- I know, right?

383
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,580
You don't look too young.

384
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,380
I am the only one affected by the age.

385
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,990
You got affected too early.

386
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,590
(Age)

387
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
(Life hit him straight in the face.)

388
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,930
(Meanwhile, it's the hair and makeup salon where My Star Kyung Soo is.)

389
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,769
(Waiting for the Grumpy Secretaries, My Star is getting glammed up.)

390
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,270
- That's really nice.
- Yes.

391
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,139
You should feel nervous.

392
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,040
(Another My Star, Doh Kyung Soo)

393
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,139
(He's ready to go.)

394
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,779
(But the Grumpy Secretaries are not here yet.)

395
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,480
Are we taking one car?

396
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,549
(He's been waiting for 15 minutes.)

397
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,790
When will they get here?

398
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:22,530
(My Star gets anxious.)

399
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,330
This isn't going to work for me.

400
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,900
I don't like people who are not punctual.

401
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,370
Is Kwang Kyu driving?

402
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,040
I need to bring this up.

403
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,050
I should tell them they can't do this on the first day.

404
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,519
Why are they still not here?

405
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,820
(Doh Kyung Soo's manager)

406
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,490
This is...

407
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,020
They are late.

408
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,029
What do we do?

409
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,230
(They've been waiting for 20 minutes.)

410
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,259
We are late for the next schedule.

411
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,899
Yes, we are late.

412
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,700
By what time are we supposed to get there?

413
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,500
The shoot begins at 11:30am.

414
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,040
(He's going to yell at them.)

415
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,880
They are here.

416
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,880
(Finally, the Grumpy Secretaries arrive.)

417
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,850
(He's ready to yell.)

418
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,660
(My Star walks over to the car with determination.)

419
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,490
(I need to speak to them.)

420
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,860
- Hello.
- Hello.

421
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,129
(Polite Kyung Soo)

422
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,569
It's nice to meet you.

423
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,600
(Now that he's met them, he's gone quiet.)

424
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,140
What's this? Kyung Kyu.

425
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,839
(Laughing)

426
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,079
I will get on the other side.

427
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,879
- You are the manager.
- Yes, I am Kyung Soo's manager.

428
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,579
- Take your time.
- Take my time?

429
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,149
(But we need to get going.)

430
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,219
You have to do something.

431
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,649
I will give you his file.

432
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,990
- Yes.
- So you have to do this.

433
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,319
(My Star's Handbook)

434
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,859
(Fix his clothes.)

435
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,359
(A lip balm is a must-have item.)

436
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,860
(Take photos for his photocard with a cute theme.)

437
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,500
Okay.

438
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,129
"The Manipulated" isn't a drama.

439
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,030
Please phrase it as a "Disney Plus original series."

440
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,400
You should phrase it that way.

441
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,910
Kwang Kyu.

442
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,639
- You need to know this.
- Hi, good morning.

443
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,010
(He meets Kwang Kyu too.)

444
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,110
"The Manipulated" shouldn't be called a drama.

445
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,819
You should phrase it as...

446
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,019
- a "Disney Plus original series." - A "Disney Plus original series."

447
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,249
He's bad at English.

448
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,419
- Hey.
- This is a problem.

449
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,620
Say it again. What is it?

450
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,060
Original drama.

451
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,089
It says here that you shouldn't call it a drama.

452
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,259
(His memory got reset in just 0.1 seconds.)

453
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
- What is it again?
- An original series.

454
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:40,260
Disney Plus original series.

455
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,199
Disney Plus original series.

456
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Yes.

457
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,439
(Anxious)

458
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,069
Are we not supposed to mention its title?

459
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,570
We can mention the title.

460
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,639
Just don't call it a drama.

461
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,979
But it's a drama. Why can't we call it one?

462
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,350
It's like not calling your dad Dad.

463
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,119
It's a drama. Why can't I say it's a drama?

464
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,179
This is what the manager told me.

465
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,490
- What's wrong with it?
- He can't understand it.

466
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,819
(He's fascinated to see the new kind of manager.)

467
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,990
It's loaded with English words.

468
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,719
"Bike action, car chase,"

469
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,559
"action catharsis."

470
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,599
These are very big words.

471
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,429
- Today...
- "Speedy entertaining series."

472
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,370
I hope you will memorize them, though.

473
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,469
- You have to tell me these.
- "An ensemble..."

474
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,800
"of various characters."

475
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,039
"The chemistry they create."

476
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,970
These are all English words. What will you do now?

477
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,510
"Hand-to-hand combat, bike action."

478
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,710
"Car chase..."

479
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,680
What's a car chase?

480
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,579
- That's chasing cars.
- Chasing cars.

481
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,550
How else would you say it?

482
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,250
Isn't it car racing?

483
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,660
No, it means to chase the car.

484
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,459
Car racing is about racing.

485
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,030
"Action catharsis of car chase."

486
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,060
He's already worn out.

487
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,670
"Importantly, you need to take photos for his photocard."

488
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,870
Photocard?

489
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,110
Photocard? Like Poker?

490
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,180
Poker? What's this?

491
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,380
- What's a photocard?
- What's a photocard?

492
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,810
- What's a photocard?
- They don't know it.

493
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,650
- I guess you use a camera.
- I'm sure.

494
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,019
Is it a photo taken in the car?

495
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,450
How is that a photocard?

496
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,350
Wait. That's a car photo.

497
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,159
He doesn't know what it is.

498
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,190
A photocard. What is it?

499
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,959
- What's a photocard?
- It's something...

500
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,330
What does it stand for?

501
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,830
People take a lot of them now.

502
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,569
- It's called a photocard.
- A photocard.

503
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,229
(PC, photocard)

504
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,140
(A photocard is a card-type souvenir made for fans.)

505
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,100
A photocard.

506
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,210
It has nothing to do with a camera.

507
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,510
(Embarrassed)

508
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,909
What do you use to take it?

509
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,409
- With your phone.
- With a phone.

510
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,950
You should be taking a lot of photos today.

511
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,609
(Another task is added to the list.)

512
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,620
(A dog barks.)

513
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,319
This darn dog!

514
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,450
(As soon as he gets a job, a dog barks.)

515
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,290
Here's the corporate card.

516
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,119
You have two corporate cards.

517
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,189
Which one should we...

518
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,189
- use then?
- Why are you so happy?

519
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,429
I will take one.

520
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,930
Are you taking both?

521
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,330
Now that you've lost it once, you take great care of it.

522
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,239
- He lost the corporate card?
- He lost the corporate card?

523
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,839
(Shocked)

524
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,410
I didn't lose it.

525
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,539
I dropped it at the airport.

526
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,309
(Rummaging)

527
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,509
(Shaken)

528
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,110
(Where's the corporate card?)

529
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,019
(Did he lose the corporate card?)

530
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,720
There it is.

531
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,120
No way.

532
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,660
(I found it right away.)

533
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,859
(The corporate card missing incident ended as a happening.)

534
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,560
- I simply dropped it.
- They are shocked to hear it.

535
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,999
- Don't worry about it.
- He just dropped it on the floor.

536
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,800
I dropped it on the floor and picked it up again.

537
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,939
Should we get going now?

538
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,799
(Anxious)

539
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,939
Where are we going next?

540
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,309
I think we should hurry.

541
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,779
We don't have much time.

542
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,880
Let's go.

543
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,550
Let me use the toilet.

544
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,849
You're using the toilet?

545
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,549
I need to use it while we are at the salon.

546
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,649
Gosh, that man.

547
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,879
(11:30am, Mapo-gu, "Cheonggyesan Daengi Records")

548
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,589
I think we are very late.

549
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,720
I don't know.

550
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,060
We have to get there by 11:30am.

551
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,890
(They hurriedly head to the set.)

552
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,400
(Let's see.)

553
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:06,140
(He hurriedly inputs the address.)

554
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,240
You should've done this while I was at the toilet.

555
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,979
(He's worried that they might be late.)

556
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,879
What time are you supposed to be arriving there?

557
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,249
- By 11:30am.
- By 11:30am?

558
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,019
We just need to get there by 11:30am.

559
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
Yes.

560
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:23,450
I think we will arrive at 11:18am.

561
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,820
- We might get there on time.
- We might get there on time.

562
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,160
(But they still feel anxious.)

563
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,960
- Please drive safely.
- Yes.

564
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,999
I will start driving, My Stars.

565
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,099
- Go, driver!
- Let's do this.

566
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,570
(They head to the set in Mapo-gu, for the first schedule.)

567
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,799
How do you memorize it all?

568
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,510
I am fascinated by it.

569
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,410
You have to memorize the dance too.

570
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,980
- Is it there?
- In the front.

571
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,410
It's jammed.

572
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,049
- Are there cars in the front?
- Yes.

573
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,180
There are cars.

574
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,519
- Can't we reverse?
- Reverse.

575
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,820
(The street in front of the salon is jammed.)

576
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,619
(We need to hurry.)

577
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,790
Reverse.

578
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,689
(Getting conscious of them)

579
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,400
(Checking the time)

580
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,400
This should be a one-way road.

581
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,110
(Rolling his eyes in worry that he may be late)

582
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,409
They wouldn't do that.

583
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,780
(They finally managed to get out of the traffic jam.)

584
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,710
(Clunk)

585
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,910
Goodness.

586
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,319
(Feeling embarrassed)

587
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,619
Are we going to be okay?

588
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,890
(Are we going to be okay?)

589
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,919
You're okay.

590
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,160
(He can't hide his anxiety.)

591
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,189
Have you ever watched My Grumpy Secretary?

592
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,260
Yes. I've watched it.

593
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,730
Thank you.

594
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,330
He's My Star.

595
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,570
Who are you talking to?

596
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,840
Who else? D.O.

597
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
What's D.O.?

598
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,310
(Doh Kyung Soo, 33, D.O. of EXO)

599
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,690
You should study about our guests before coming here.

600
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,249
What is it?

601
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,160
Kyung Soo is D.O.

602
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,660
My name in EXO...

603
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,190
That's your artist name?

604
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,199
He's Kyung Soo today. Why are you calling him D.O.?

605
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,260
Hey.

606
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,530
He's D.O. when he's in EXO.

607
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,270
Goodness.

608
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,770
People still call him D.O.

609
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,539
(Looking around)

610
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,480
Is there some water in the car?

611
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,350
(Embarrassed)

612
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,050
We didn't get water.

613
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,249
Check over there.

614
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,290
Is it not there?

615
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,960
Would you like a sip of this?

616
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,760
Some of this, at least?

617
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,229
We didn't get water.

618
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,400
(They failed to get water even today.)

619
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,339
That's why I brought mine.

620
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,770
- Really?
- I brought coffee.

621
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,170
In the morning.

622
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,880
(Then...)

623
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,880
Could I use some lip balm?

624
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,019
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

625
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,120
(Searching)

626
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,689
- This...
- Why?

627
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,320
(Fortunately, they managed to give him lip balm.)

628
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,889
- Do your lips get dry often?
- Yes.

629
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,959
Thank you.

630
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,600
(His lips are moisturized at least.)

631
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,370
How long is the filming here?

632
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,739
You're going to Yeong Seok at 3pm.

633
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
Yes.

634
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:32,239
This will continue until 2pm.

635
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,810
It's going to take around two hours.

636
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:36,910
You'll have to pick up the food...

637
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,889
while we're filming this.

638
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,790
What food? Lunch?

639
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,360
When we film the YouTube video on Channel Fullmoon...

640
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,060
- You have to take food.
- Right.

641
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,960
- We have to take food?
- Goodness.

642
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,469
(A type of manager they've never seen before)

643
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,169
- Hey.
- Should we go?

644
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,940
Why are you acting like that in front of the stars?

645
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,769
Why are you acting like that in front of the stars?

646
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:04,710
Maybe I should call them and tell them to buy food.

647
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,310
(He makes a sneaky move, forgetting the duties of a secretary.)

648
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,779
(My Stars are fascinated by the Grumpy Secretary.)

649
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,880
You have to take food. Goodness.

650
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:17,890
(Seo Jin spoke confidently because he knew the place.)

651
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:20,159
(A moment later, Director Na's YouTube filming set)

652
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,590
(The two managers can go inside.)

653
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,160
(They're turned away at the door.)

654
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,999
(Show him where the restroom is.)

655
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,400
(Yeong Seok scolds Seo Jin.)

656
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,870
(Don't just explain. Show him where it is.)

657
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,909
(He continues to nag.)

658
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,940
(Grumpy Secretary's hardship, coming soon)

659
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,180
Why isn't it working?

660
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,520
(There's an issue with the GPS system.)

661
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,749
You can go like this...

662
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,420
- or like this.
- I know that.

663
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,790
We're a bit late.

664
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,059
That doesn't mean I can cut in.

665
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,600
The estimated time of arrival was 11:18am earlier.

666
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,729
It became 11:37am now.

667
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,039
About 20 minutes were added.

668
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,600
Why did it suddenly increase?

669
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,940
It's rush hour.

670
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,639
We're getting quite late.

671
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,880
(To make matters worse, the road is completely jammed.)

672
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,980
(They're nervous.)

673
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,580
Why is the traffic so bad?

674
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
(Glancing)

675
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,549
(Passing by)

676
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,459
If only the traffic hadn't been bad in that alley earlier.

677
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,190
(The cars are smoothly driving alongside Grumpy Secretary's lane.)

678
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,929
You normally don't change lanes, do you?

679
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,829
(You normally don't change lanes, do you?)

680
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,900
Well...

681
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,769
I mean...

682
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,170
(My Star couldn't hold back and said it.)

683
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,809
Kyung Soo.

684
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,409
We met for the first time today.

685
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,139
- You hold grudges, don't you?
- No.

686
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,240
I mean...

687
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,449
How frustrated would he have been to say that?

688
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,419
He said that after holding back as much as he could.

689
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,479
That would be true.

690
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,820
I should change lanes.

691
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,890
Take a look at the Han River...

692
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,890
and calm your mind.

693
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,729
How frustrated would he have been?

694
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,999
(He changes lanes as requested by My Star.)

695
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,600
I had to say that.

696
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,840
In my opinion, 99 out of 100 people...

697
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,810
would have moved to the first lane.

698
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,979
- So...
- Only Kwang Kyu...

699
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,340
(The only person)

700
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,010
didn't even think of changing lanes.

701
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,380
So,

702
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,850
I had been wanting to tell him for about ten minutes.

703
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,590
I held it in for a while and then told him.

704
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,960
(He doesn't forget and forgive easily.)

705
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,930
It's much quicker after changing lanes.

706
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,630
I should have changed lanes earlier.

707
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,300
Listen to Kyung Soo well.

708
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,869
I listened to him right away.

709
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,040
(I listened to him right away.)

710
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,800
We're going so well.

711
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,439
(Thanks to Kyung Soo, the car finally starts moving, )

712
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,980
(but the scheduled time has long passed.)

713
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,150
We're quite late.

714
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,349
(My Star says a lot with his eyes.)

715
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,490
Actually,

716
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,490
I really hate being late.

717
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,530
But they were older than me.

718
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,330
I should call the PR team.

719
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,200
He's calling them.

720
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,030
He's calling them now.

721
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,900
We had to get there by 11:30am.

722
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,809
It's 11:47am, and now...

723
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,040
(Grumpy Secretary is very late.)

724
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,580
(He's calling the PR team.)

725
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:31,920
- Hello.
- Hello. This is...

726
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,680
Ji Chang Wook and Doh Kyung Soo's manager.

727
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,950
Yes.

728
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:39,120
We're running late because of heavy traffic.

729
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,830
How much longer will it take?

730
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,960
I think we'll get there in five minutes.

731
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,930
- Five minutes.
- Yes.

732
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,169
(Nervous eyes)

733
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,069
We've been waiting so long,

734
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,909
so please come as fast as you can.

735
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,839
Could you come up as soon as you get here?

736
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,140
Yes, all right.

737
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,939
Okay.

738
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,249
(What do we do?)

739
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,450
The PR team is nervous.

740
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,690
They're nervous because we're late.

741
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,020
You normally describe that as being angry.

742
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,190
That's true.

743
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,099
- She tried to be calm.
- Was she holding back?

744
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,659
- Is that what it was?
- Yes.

745
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,730
(Is that what it was?)

746
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,170
Right.

747
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,170
Let's go quickly now.

748
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,709
- Turn right here.
- Here?

749
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,509
- You see that road there?
- Yes.

750
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,640
Go there.

751
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,410
- We're here.
- Is this the place?

752
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,779
- Hello?
- Thank you.

753
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
Thank you.

754
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,179
(A call came in just as they arrived.)

755
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,190
Is this the place?

756
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,889
- Hello?
- Thank you.

757
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,860
Thank you.

758
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,630
Yes. We've just arrived.

759
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,760
- Could you put it in park?
- I put it in park.

760
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,199
(They quickly get out...)

761
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,540
(and head to the filming location.)

762
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,240
She sounds very angry.

763
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,350
(They're nervous.)

764
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,619
I'll quickly get you some water.

765
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,650
(Calm down)

766
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

767
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,659
Let me give them the mics.

768
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,129
Okay. Do we have to go further up?

769
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,200
- Yes. It's on the rooftop. Hold on.
- Okay.

770
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:32,199
(While My Stars are getting ready, )

771
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,169
(Grumpy Secretary goes to the filming location first.)

772
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,270
Hello.

773
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,010
(Reading the room)

774
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,350
I had no idea they'd come on our channel.

775
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,219
(That person...)

776
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,220
Hello.

777
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,360
Hello.

778
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,159
- Hello.
- Hello.

779
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,460
Nice to meet you.

780
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,370
I didn't think I'd get to meet you like this.

781
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,229
- Aren't you Jung Seok?
- Pardon?

782
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,499
Aren't you Jung Seok?

783
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,070
He's mistaking me for someone else.

784
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,399
People do tell me that I look like him.

785
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,510
- Really?
- Yes.

786
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,269
Many people tell me I look like him.

787
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,739
- I'm Cho Jum Seok.
- Really?

788
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,679
I have a beauty spot here, as you can see.

789
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,709
I think you're Jung Seok with a beauty spot.

790
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,010
- No.
- No?

791
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,420
(Before revealing his face, he was Cho Jung Seok's fan.)

792
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,749
(After revealing his face, he became a YouTuber...)

793
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,320
(famous for looking like Cho Jung Seok.)

794
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,889
(I don't know who he is, but he looks like he'd sing "Aloha" well.)

795
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,429
(A YouTuber with a known identity)

796
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,090
(Everyone, pretend like you don't know him. He might show us more.)

797
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,159
(Anyway, he's not Cho Jung Seok.)

798
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,499
(Cho Jum Seok, a YouTuber with a known identity)

799
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,099
- You're not?
- I'm not.

800
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,770
- First...
- They're our...

801
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,569
- Hello, Chang Wook.
- I'm their manager.

802
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,740
Nice to meet you.

803
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,869
Kyung Soo. Nice to meet you.

804
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,579
- Hello.
- Hello.

805
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,509
I didn't think I'd be meeting you like this.

806
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,179
He looks very similar to someone we know.

807
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,750
That's right. He looks like the person who can't hit a driver.

808
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,449
(He fails to hold his laughter.)

809
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,679
He looks similar.

810
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,649
- I hear that a lot.
- Right?

811
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,889
I have a beauty spot here.

812
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,819
- You're their managers, right?
- That's right.

813
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,729
- You could sit over there.
- Okay.

814
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,929
This way.

815
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,829
Kyung Soo and Chang Wook.

816
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,029
Is this where the office is?

817
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,630
- There's no water.
- We have water here.

818
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:12,800
(Meanwhile, Seo Jin gets the water bottle right behind him.)

819
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,169
(He opens the water bottle carefully.)

820
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,809
Here.

821
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,609
- Thank you.
- He has the basic qualities.

822
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,639
Of course.

823
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,450
Actually,

824
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:25,820
- I hear that being on time...
- Yes.

825
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,049
Is really important...

826
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,079
- in this industry.
- I'm sorry.

827
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,789
The managers should be on time.

828
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,890
You know...

829
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,720
(He comes with water bottles.)

830
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,329
- Our road manager...
- Yes.

831
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,730
Isn't good at driving.

832
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,259
- Does he drive?
- Yes. He's not good at driving.

833
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,400
Apologise to him.

834
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,599
- You should be on time.
- I'm sorry.

835
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,269
I could have made it on time,

836
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,539
but Lee Seo Jin came late.

837
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,039
He was 20 minutes late.

838
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,080
- You're blaming each other.
- Yes.

839
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,480
I see.

840
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,049
Goodness.

841
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,050
Why, you...

842
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,350
(Grabbing)

843
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,720
Goodness.

844
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,889
(Saying loving remarks)

845
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,490
Why, you...

846
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,559
Hey!

847
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,159
(The harmonious Grumpy Secretaries with an average age of 55.5)

848
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,630
Yes, you can fight over there.

849
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,160
You can start filming.

850
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,329
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

851
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,330
Hello.

852
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:21,070
I didn't think I'd see you here.

853
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,609
- Why are you laughing so much?
- It's...

854
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:24,640
It's so...

855
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,009
(The shoot goes on while grilling meat.)

856
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,440
Could we eat the tteokbokki?

857
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,249
- Is it okay?
- Yes, you can.

858
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,479
But it's a bit cold because you came late.

859
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,690
You can eat it.

860
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,249
Let me check the audio.

861
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,389
They're going to check the audio.

862
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,819
(The shoot pauses while they're checking the audio.)

863
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,990
Hold on. It went inside.

864
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,699
(Getting up)

865
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,199
You can eat it.

866
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,870
(Standing up)

867
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,140
Would you like some meat?

868
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,569
- No.
- You keep looking at it.

869
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,410
It looks troublesome...

870
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:02,579
- That's what I do.
- to talk...

871
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,579
- while cooking meat.
- Then the manager...

872
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,719
Could you cook the meat for me?

873
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,650
I'm going to call someone to cook the meat.

874
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
I see.

875
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,319
I'd be grateful.

876
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,390
- I'll call him.
- He's very sharp.

877
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,430
(Here comes the person who's going to cook the meat.)

878
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,900
Go and cook the meat. Sit next to him.

879
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,469
What? Can I do that?

880
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,669
I already told them.

881
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,569
He's too busy talking...

882
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,200
while cooking the meat.

883
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,309
You do it. Why me?

884
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,540
You're good at cooking meat.

885
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,740
It would be nice if you cooked it.

886
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,750
(Grumpy Secretary on action)

887
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,649
Slowly go in there with it.

888
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,290
Don't cover the camera.

889
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,319
Go in from the side.

890
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,789
(Carefully go in from the side.)

891
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,160
(Quietly)

892
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,060
(Entering carefully so they don't disturb the shoot)

893
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,769
Yes. You're here.

894
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,269
- The manager will cook the meat.
- Yes.

895
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,339
Here.

896
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,469
- Thank you.
- Okay.

897
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,969
I don't know if it's all right to make you work.

898
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,409
- We're managers.
- We're managers.

899
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,480
Thank you.

900
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,439
- You can continue talking.
- Okay.

901
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,350
Since you're already here,

902
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,380
- you could do it properly.
- Okay.

903
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,959
Please tell us about "The Manipulated."

904
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,120
What is it about?

905
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Yes.

906
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,330
The preview will also be played here.

907
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,960
(His eyes shake after making the loud noise.)

908
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
(Sizzling)

909
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
(Sizzling)

910
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,940
- The audio...
- Yes.

911
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,669
(Feeling embarrassed)

912
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,740
Thank you.

913
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,009
(Moving it to the side)

914
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,510
- "The Manipulated." - Yes.

915
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,649
One man...

916
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,880
While cooking the meat,

917
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,520
I was startled more.

918
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,920
The grill pan made so much noise.

919
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,890
I placed the meat, and it made the sizzling sound.

920
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,459
I placed the meat in the middle...

921
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,460
and quickly moved it to the side.

922
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:00,299
I quickly moved it to the side with low heat...

923
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,270
and also turned the heat down.

924
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,969
(He tried his best not to bother anyone.)

925
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,700
I felt sorry.

926
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,409
This disgruntled man approaches him to get his revenge.

927
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,670
(Looking around)

928
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,810
It's an action series.

929
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,180
(Slowly placing)

930
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,080
(Fortunately, it's quiet.)

931
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,950
(A suspenseful grilling)

932
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,120
He sculpts someone's life and leads them into ruin.

933
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,759
It's quite a catchy name.

934
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,630
It's a title that makes you curious.

935
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:36,930
(Noisy black pepper show)

936
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,139
You also look like sculptures.

937
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,339
(Feeling guilty)

938
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,470
So, it's a 12-episode series.

939
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:48,010
(He's on grill master mode.)

940
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,610
(The golden colour is created by the hands of Royal Chef Eom.)

941
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,420
(Putting his soul into grilling)

942
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,420
(He's serious.)

943
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,060
(The shoot is going well thanks to him.)

944
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,760
He also grills meat.

945
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,499
He's very...

946
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,700
I mean...

947
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,069
(He takes some kimchi.)

948
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,600
He even took kimchi.

949
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,340
- What?
- He even took kimchi.

950
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,610
(He even took kimchi.)

951
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,510
(He cooks them amazingly for My Stars.)

952
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,080
(He eats it with grilled kimchi.)

953
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,619
How is it? Do you like it?

954
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,750
(It's tasty.)

955
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,590
It's really tasty.

956
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,260
Thank you.

957
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,460
Pork neck. It's so good.

958
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,859
(Kwang Kyu even takes care of Seo Genie.)

959
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,559
It's very natural.

960
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,599
It's good.

961
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,070
(Whispering)

962
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,939
(He looks at them.)

963
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,740
How did you end up...

964
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,740
(It's enchanting.)

965
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,779
Give me one more.

966
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,050
The meat.

967
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,020
(He eats one more piece with kimchi.)

968
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,760
(They're almost having a meal.)

969
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,590
(I'm still hungry.)

970
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,830
Could we ask you to make Chapagetti?

971
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,099
Could you cook Chapagetti?

972
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,340
Of course.

973
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,170
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

974
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,840
You can carry on.

975
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,379
We...

976
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,150
(They move away so they don't disturb them.)

977
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,620
One? Two?

978
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,250
(Make it 2.)

979
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,689
- Or make three.
- No.

980
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,620
Three would be too much.

981
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,160
- We could eat as well.
- Really?

982
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,199
Kyung Soo has relatively fewer action scenes.

983
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,930
(Rustling)

984
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:51,600
(Looking around)

985
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
(Rustling)

986
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,110
(Glancing)

987
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,209
You can do it comfortably.

988
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,479
He's opening the package really slowly...

989
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,979
because of the noise.

990
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,250
- It's okay.
- Would that be okay?

991
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,050
It's okay.

992
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
(Then, I'll do it comfortably.)

993
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,890
(He still looks at them.)

994
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,460
(Tearing)

995
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,870
(He's satisfied.)

996
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,970
(Laughing)

997
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,809
I just...

998
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:31,869
(Talking about music they like)

999
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,680
like all kinds of music.

1000
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,810
I really like EXO's music too.

1001
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,949
- I really like "Growl" as well.
- Yes.

1002
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,020
So...

1003
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,749
I just naturally...

1004
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:44,989
(The original singer tries not to laugh.)

1005
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,989
Could you show them?

1006
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,289
(Growl)

1007
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,360
Growl

1008
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,099
(A reinterpretation of the original song)

1009
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,029
Isn't it "growl?"

1010
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,530
- Growl.
- He said "grow."

1011
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,729
That...

1012
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,899
That's the only part I know.

1013
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,710
- That's...
- My gosh.

1014
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,880
(The jjajang ramyeon is ready.)

1015
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,220
(Adding meat topping)

1016
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,389
(Rocket delivery to My Stars)

1017
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,890
(Seo Genie is in charge of delivering.)

1018
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,259
Thank you.

1019
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,960
Thank you.

1020
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,859
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1021
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,030
- Thank you so much.
- Enjoy.

1022
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,659
You could eat as well.

1023
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,600
- We'll eat the rest.
- Okay.

1024
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,569
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1025
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,640
Thank you. They're the best.

1026
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,179
(Eating quickly)

1027
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,240
And...

1028
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,380
(Exclaiming)

1029
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,519
- How is it?
- It's tasty.

1030
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,679
- Is it okay?
- It's good.

1031
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,879
It's really good.

1032
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,220
- That's a relief.
- Thank you.

1033
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:51,789
Would you like some more?

1034
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,120
- You can eat it.
- You're fine?

1035
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,420
Okay.

1036
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,360
(Then...)

1037
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,599
(He gets a plate...)

1038
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,330
(and takes some kimchi.)

1039
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,940
(He leaves with the kimchi.)

1040
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,840
(It's Grumpy Secretary's break time after the cooking work.)

1041
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,479
(They eat...)

1042
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,050
(and eat.)

1043
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,520
(They continue to eat the noodles without talking.)

1044
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,660
- It's good, right?
- It's good.

1045
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,300
Actually, I was hungry.

1046
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,360
I hadn't eaten anything.

1047
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,529
I also heard this information.

1048
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:41,140
I heard that we didn't have time to eat lunch.

1049
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,240
So I thought, "I wouldn't be able to eat if I didn't eat now."

1050
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,209
So...

1051
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:48,240
(He even scrapes the pot clean.)

1052
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,750
(Eating for survival)

1053
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,650
(They're done eating.)

1054
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,860
- Let's go downstairs.
- What?

1055
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,729
(Manager)

1056
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,859
- Do you need anything?
- I'm really sorry.

1057
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,360
- Do you need anything?
- Could I use some lip balm?

1058
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,869
Is there some coffee?

1059
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,369
- Coffee.
- Coffee?

1060
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,969
- It's in the car.
- Yes. Coffee.

1061
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,009
I probably drank all the coffee.

1062
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,870
I'll get you another one.

1063
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,780
- I'm really sorry.
- Yes.

1064
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,049
- Could I also get some coffee?
- What kind?

1065
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,919
- Iced Americano.
- Iced.

1066
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,249
(They also get Cho Jum Seok's order...)

1067
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,519
(and head to get coffee.)

1068
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,220
(Looking for a cafe)

1069
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,390
Is that place with the white signboard a cafe? Do you see it?

1070
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,889
Zoom it.

1071
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,060
What?

1072
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,660
(They check the signboard by zooming in with the camera.)

1073
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,800
What's written?

1074
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,870
Isn't that coffee? Casa...

1075
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,639
Did you zoom it...

1076
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,269
- because you didn't want to walk?
- No.

1077
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,309
- I couldn't see it.
- What?

1078
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,110
I was wondering if that was a cafe.

1079
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,309
(Isn't that a cafe?)

1080
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,310
Coffee?

1081
00:42:56,311 --> 00:42:59,210
You can check it on the map.

1082
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,519
(They're searching on the map.)

1083
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,820
There's a cafe right around the corner.

1084
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,559
On the right.

1085
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,920
(Fortunately, they find a cafe not far away.)

1086
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,230
It's here.

1087
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,330
Hello.

1088
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,969
Could we get two iced Americanos?

1089
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,169
Then...

1090
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,800
(Deciding which of the two corporate cards to use)

1091
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,869
(He purchases it with the corporate card...)

1092
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,200
(of Chang Wook who asked for the coffee.)

1093
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,769
Have a nice day.

1094
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,440
(They get two cups of coffee.)

1095
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,610
(They're waiting outside because they're recording.)

1096
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,649
I guess that's why it's good.

1097
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,579
(They go in during break time to give them the coffee.)

1098
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,449
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

1099
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,820
Jum Seok...

1100
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,220
- Thank you for the nice words.
- Thank you.

1101
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,289
- Thank you so much.
- My Star.

1102
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,290
Seriously.

1103
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,329
Don't I get one?

1104
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,460
I thought you weren't going to drink.

1105
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,470
Do you drink coffee?

1106
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:50,829
Coffee...

1107
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,269
- You can drink this.
- Wait.

1108
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:53,899
- Drink this.
- No.

1109
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,769
Hold on. Here.

1110
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,440
Let's share. I'm sorry.

1111
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,679
- "Let's divide." - That's enough.

1112
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,139
Sharing the coffee is...

1113
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,949
- Here.
- Let's share.

1114
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,249
- Let's share.
- Let's divide.

1115
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,319
That's enough.

1116
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,420
Thank you.

1117
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,789
- This...
- I'll take this.

1118
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,150
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

1119
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,020
- Are you sponging off?
- No.

1120
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,429
(Absurd)

1121
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,189
Hey. Ramyeon...

1122
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,799
- Hey, neatly...
- Anyway, thank you.

1123
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,430
- Thank you.
- Keep up the good work.

1124
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,869
- Cut.
- Thank you for your work.

1125
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,029
- Thank you for your work.
- Thank you.

1126
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,440
Thank you.

1127
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,770
You have to move for your next schedule.

1128
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,469
- Do I have to go?
- For your next schedule.

1129
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,640
- Does he have another one?
- Yes.

1130
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,639
- Hey.
- In Seoul...

1131
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,709
So? Do you want us...

1132
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,779
- to be your managers?
- What?

1133
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,249
Do you want us to be your managers? What do you say?

1134
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,250
But I'm just a YouTuber.

1135
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,950
What are you talking about?

1136
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,749
Ask Jung Seok.

1137
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,759
Jung Seok and I are...

1138
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,529
- You seemed close.
- If I reach him,

1139
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,389
- I'll ask him.
- See if he's interested.

1140
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:52,959
- About having managers.
- I have a beauty spot here.

1141
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,499
- Why don't you ask him?
- Okay.

1142
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,669
- My Star has to get changed.
- Okay.

1143
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,899
Let me take him.

1144
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,539
(Meanwhile, Chang Wook...)

1145
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,740
Where did they go?

1146
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,249
Where is everyone?

1147
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,849
(He doesn't see his secretaries.)

1148
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,490
(Did they leave me?)

1149
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:19,959
Move the car.

1150
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,420
(He then suddenly appears at the alley.)

1151
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,929
Move the car.

1152
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:23,930
(Relieved)

1153
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:25,559
I wondered where they were.

1154
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,100
(Relieved)

1155
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,629
I told him you'd come.

1156
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,069
I'm not going anywhere.

1157
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:33,500
- It's a one-way street.
- There was nobody.

1158
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:39,340
(He feels like he's getting trained.)

1159
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,279
(The diabolic secretaries are a shame...)

1160
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,809
(whether they are close or far.)

1161
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:45,879
Hop in.

1162
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,819
(What is the next schedule of their busy promotion day?)

1163
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,249
(11:30am, Mapo-gu, "Cheonggyesan Daengi Records")

1164
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,490
(4pm, Gangnam-gu, Na Yeong Seok's YouTube)

1165
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,390
(My Stars will film with Director Na.)

1166
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:00,859
(They'll bring dishes of their choices...)

1167
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,530
(and enjoy them while talking.)

1168
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,200
(The necessary item is the food.)

1169
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,440
(Director Na is already ready.)

1170
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,209
(It's time to buy the food.)

1171
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,440
Where is the restaurant?

1172
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,210
It's near Sinsa Station.

1173
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,949
(Looking up the restaurant)

1174
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,579
- Are you buying bread?
- What?

1175
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,490
- What are you buying?
- We're going there anyway.

1176
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,590
- This.
- We shouldn't buy the same thing.

1177
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,919
- Where to?
- What?

1178
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,030
- I...
- Let's go there first.

1179
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,589
It's Sinsa-dong anyway.

1180
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,499
- Right. Off we go.
- There's a lot.

1181
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,559
- Okay.
- Okay.

1182
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,799
So? How did the shoot go today?

1183
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,999
(Moving to the next YouTube set in Sinsa-dong)

1184
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,070
- Today... Yes.
- With Jum Seok?

1185
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,069
(Setting the GPS)

1186
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,440
Are you going to rely on it or what?

1187
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,510
Put it on first.

1188
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,380
- Left turn.
- But it's right.

1189
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,549
- Left turn.
- It's right.

1190
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,179
- Don't count on it.
- No.

1191
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,689
I think it's right.

1192
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,690
Left turn? Okay, I'll go.

1193
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,759
- Sinsa.
- It's saying turn left.

1194
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,859
Left?

1195
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,259
(Kyung Soo, who doesn't want to be late, turned on the GPS.)

1196
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,830
You have to do a U-turn here.

1197
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,960
In the next block.

1198
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,699
- U-turn in the next block?
- Yes.

1199
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,769
- Okay.
- Really?

1200
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,069
That's closer.

1201
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,140
Okay.

1202
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:17,640
At the end of the block.

1203
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,609
Okay. I know.

1204
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:20,780
(Anxious)

1205
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:24,049
- Kyung Soo...
- You don't trust him.

1206
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,909
Kyung Soo... He...

1207
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,150
He's like Sunwoo Yong Yeo.

1208
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:30,550
Turn here.

1209
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:31,689
(Traumatized by commenting on his driving)

1210
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:34,090
He can't just stay still.

1211
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,260
Kyung Soo has the GPS on.

1212
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,200
- Yes.
- Kyung Soo, seriously.

1213
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,929
You don't trust me at all.

1214
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:44,700
- He has the GPS on.
- Just in case.

1215
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,799
How come the guests don't trust you?

1216
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,139
(He's not likely to earn trust with his driving today.)

1217
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:52,710
- I...
- Does the shoot...

1218
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,309
start at 4pm?

1219
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:57,050
Yes. It starts at 4pm.

1220
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,780
- At 4pm?
- We have more than enough time.

1221
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,379
- Yeong Seok is...
- If we buy bread...

1222
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,790
just waiting there.

1223
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:08,119
If we buy bread, we'll be there on time.

1224
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,789
- More than enough.
- If we go to the bakery...

1225
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,689
You have enough time to buy bread.

1226
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,760
Okay.

1227
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:14,599
What should I get?

1228
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,599
First, there is a famous cake place.

1229
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
Okay.

1230
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:21,440
There is a famous bakery that sells salt bread and stuff.

1231
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,240
- On the way to my house, - Yes?

1232
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,710
There is a famous bakery.

1233
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,310
That's where we're going.

1234
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,879
On the hill...

1235
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,049
The office is behind that.

1236
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,719
- Really?
- Yes, behind your old house.

1237
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,949
What do they have? What kind of bread?

1238
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,859
Bread... They sell bread. It's a bakery.

1239
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,220
So what kind of bread? For example...

1240
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,129
(Hesitating)

1241
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,929
- For example...
- That round...

1242
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:47,559
- Croissants and...
- That's right.

1243
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,259
- salt bread and stuff?
- Yes.

1244
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,530
- That's...
- How did you understand that?

1245
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,869
(My Star has a high level of understanding.)

1246
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,440
Yes. It's... Yes.

1247
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,039
See how considerate Chang Wook is?

1248
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,110
Then...

1249
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,939
He barely said a word, and you understood him.

1250
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,639
- Kyung Soo...
- I understand everything.

1251
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,950
- Exactly.
- Yes.

1252
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,249
I'm thankful.

1253
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,219
It's in the alley...

1254
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,879
between Sinsa Station and Hakdong Park.

1255
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,049
- That's right.
- Right?

1256
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,249
- Yes.
- That's right.

1257
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,919
- That's perfect.
- Yes.

1258
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,790
- That's the perfect location.
- That is...

1259
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,059
known for bread.

1260
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,290
Right.

1261
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,499
Croissants and...

1262
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,199
mini ham cheese.

1263
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,529
(Then, let me...)

1264
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,700
There's a lot.

1265
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,739
He barely said a word, and you understood him.

1266
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,169
- Kyung Soo...
- There's...

1267
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,369
- a really good salt bread place.
- and Chang Wook...

1268
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,710
- Where is that?
- Do you want to go there?

1269
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,309
- That sounds good. Salt bread is...
- Where is it?

1270
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,709
- easy to eat.
- Near the Gangnam District Office.

1271
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,979
- That's too far.
- That's too far.

1272
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,079
- What?
- That's too far.

1273
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:39,380
- Easy to eat.
- Near the Gangnam District Office.

1274
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,549
(That's too far.)

1275
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,550
(What?)

1276
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,650
- Get something in Sinsa.
- Salt bread here is...

1277
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:46,220
I think...

1278
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,160
- Kwang Kyu...
- Gangnam District Office.

1279
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,429
- Are you flustered?
- The filming location is...

1280
00:49:51,430 --> 00:49:53,259
about seven minutes away from Gangnam District Office.

1281
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,599
- No. Too far.
- Too far?

1282
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,370
Yes. Going all the way to Gangnam District Office is too far.

1283
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,400
- Too far.
- Get something in Sinsa-dong.

1284
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:01,769
(Embarrassed)

1285
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:04,439
- It's on the way.
- The example...

1286
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,839
(Strict)

1287
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,740
Actually, I'm curious...

1288
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,879
about Seo Jin's area of activity.

1289
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,380
I wonder what is considered...

1290
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:15,420
close to him.

1291
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,859
Actually, Sinsa Station to Gangnam District Office is far...

1292
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,289
(7 minutes by car)

1293
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:24,590
I think you can't go anywhere.

1294
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,829
From Gangnam District Office to Sinsa-dong is...

1295
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,430
full of traffic.

1296
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,440
Besides, we were late for the first shoot.

1297
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,999
I was worried we'd be late for the second shoot too.

1298
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,140
(And he doesn't want to be late for this shoot for some reason.)

1299
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,079
(Searching again)

1300
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,950
Is Garosu-gil okay?

1301
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,149
- Garosu-gil is okay.
- That's Sinsa-dong.

1302
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,420
- That's okay.
- Okay.

1303
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,449
Garosu-gil dessert.

1304
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:51,419
- Garosu-gil...
- Garosu-gil dessert.

1305
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,020
- But not Gangnam District Office.
- Okay.

1306
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:54,589
Garosu-gil dessert.

1307
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,389
(Now, the only option is Garosu-gil.)

1308
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,329
(Garosu-gil)

1309
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:02,659
Garosu-gil dessert.

1310
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,700
(Like a tense scene from "The Manipulated")

1311
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,369
Garosu-gil dessert.

1312
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,510
(Looking for Garosu-gil in the ocean of information)

1313
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,909
Baskin isn't so bad, right?

1314
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,640
What? Yes, that's okay too.

1315
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,049
It's right in front.

1316
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:18,110
Okay.

1317
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,120
How about bread and ice cream?

1318
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,819
We don't care. We're the managers.

1319
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,020
- We're not...
- Of course.

1320
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,930
- Get what you want to eat.
- Okay.

1321
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,489
Is ice cream okay?

1322
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,229
We're not the ones eating.

1323
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:35,630
You two and...

1324
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:38,600
the YouTube team are eating.

1325
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:44,010
(Okay.)

1326
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,539
No, say it with confidence.

1327
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,210
Consider us managers and feel free to say it.

1328
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,709
Let me change the lane.

1329
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,780
Kyung Soo doesn't like the second lane.

1330
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:57,249
(Announcing the lane change without holding grudges)

1331
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,889
- He doesn't like the third lane.
- What?

1332
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:00,220
You have to take the second lane.

1333
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,560
Kyung Soo likes...

1334
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,689
the Han River view.

1335
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,160
I'll drive near the Han River.

1336
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,970
I...

1337
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,169
- I'll drive safely.
- It's...

1338
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,269
(Providing the Han River view for My Star)

1339
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,939
It's best to watch the Han River...

1340
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,969
when you're on Gangbyeonbuk-ro.

1341
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,539
(The Han River stretches wide.)

1342
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,650
The celebrities like this view.

1343
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,080
- Do you like the views?
- I do.

1344
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,289
- What about you, Kyung Soo?
- I...

1345
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,249
I don't look outside at all.

1346
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,320
Really?

1347
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,589
But...

1348
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,429
Didn't you say Kyung Soo likes the Han River view?

1349
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:39,859
- I... Hey.
- You said you studied him.

1350
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,330
No, I didn't study that.

1351
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,470
Normally, people would say they like it.

1352
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,299
Kyung Soo is...

1353
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,799
(My Star seems to be a firm person.)

1354
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,870
I...

1355
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,280
studied D.O.

1356
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,980
It's nice to talk about D.O.

1357
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,680
- D.O.
- Why?

1358
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,320
The name of the implant I promote is DO.

1359
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,919
- You're such a jerk.
- What?

1360
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,289
How can you...

1361
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,619
Why are you bringing up your commercial?

1362
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,019
What can I do? It's the same name.

1363
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,659
His name is Doh Kyung Soo. DO...

1364
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,660
(Implant)

1365
00:53:11,661 --> 00:53:13,799
First of all, I like D.O.

1366
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,400
That's why I keep saying it.

1367
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,569
(Patting)

1368
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,500
I laughed so much that my stomach hurts.

1369
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,970
The company will like it.

1370
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:24,670
Is the contract over yet?

1371
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,639
(The managers are uncomfortable yet comfortable.)

1372
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,880
- You have that.
- Yes.

1373
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,379
- We got here pretty fast.
- There's no traffic.

1374
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,419
(Already near Sinsa-dong)

1375
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,489
It feels like we got here so fast.

1376
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,589
I know.

1377
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,019
It feels different from before, right?

1378
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,320
Yes, earlier was too...

1379
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,829
(Be careful what you say.)

1380
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,230
We got here fast.

1381
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,160
- That's...
- Where do you want to go first?

1382
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,499
We should go to Baskin first.

1383
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
- Where is that? Garosu-gil?
- It's on Garosu-gil.

1384
00:53:49,501 --> 00:53:50,969
- On Garosu-gil.
- Yes.

1385
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,000
Garosu-gil first?

1386
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:55,140
(Arriving at the ice cream place an hour before the shoot)

1387
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,639
It smells good.

1388
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,139
(Behind the excited My Stars, )

1389
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,140
(Seo Jin enters awkwardly.)

1390
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,510
- Get this?
- Yes. This.

1391
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,950
Six.

1392
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,220
- Eight?
- Eight flavours.

1393
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,150
- Two of eight flavours?
- Two?

1394
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,959
That and the flavour of the month.

1395
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,390
(Staring)

1396
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,489
(Blinking)

1397
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:20,530
(He seems to be amazed.)

1398
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:24,229
(Feeling the stare behind them)

1399
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,469
No, nothing.

1400
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,170
- Do you want to pick one?
- No, I'm okay.

1401
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,440
- It's my first time coming here.
- Okay.

1402
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,709
It's my first time choosing the ice cream flavours.

1403
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:32,710
My goodness.

1404
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:34,210
(Amazed to see how everything is done on the kiosk these days)

1405
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,980
Will this do?

1406
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,249
(Quickly filling his shopping cart)

1407
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,749
- The corporate card.
- Are you done?

1408
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,779
Okay.

1409
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,019
(Grabbing the corporate card)

1410
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,649
- That's mine.
- Is this the one?

1411
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,890
(Paying with Kyung Soo's corporate card)

1412
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,519
Insert your credit card.

1413
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,060
(Confused)

1414
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,489
One second.

1415
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,490
(Help)

1416
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:57,030
(Another day of My Star serving the secretaries)

1417
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,670
It's confusing because there are so many.

1418
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,440
(Sliding)

1419
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:07,110
(Off to the restroom)

1420
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,839
(Checking...)

1421
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,050
(Seo Jin's gone)

1422
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,709
(Relieved sigh)

1423
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:14,979
(He seems to have something to say.)

1424
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,520
I tried to pluck up my courage...

1425
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,720
and go to the dessert store in Hannam-dong.

1426
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,559
So when I mentioned the Gangnam District Office,

1427
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,259
- The District Office is too far.
- they said it was too far.

1428
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,099
- The District Office is too far.
- If I mentioned Hannam-dong,

1429
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,429
- then we...
- So...

1430
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,600
I couldn't say anything.

1431
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,070
"The Gangnam District Office is too far?"

1432
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,369
- We...
- No point in saying Hannam-dong.

1433
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:41,280
So I chose somewhere across the street.

1434
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:45,380
Baskin-Robbins wasn't on my list.

1435
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,480
I just found the closest one.

1436
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:52,090
- Here...
- If I mentioned Hannam-dong,

1437
00:55:52,290 --> 00:55:55,620
I thought I might be half dead. I'm serious.

1438
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,890
I was too scared to bring it up.

1439
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,359
There was something I really wanted to buy.

1440
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,869
What? What was it?

1441
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:07,299
It's Passion5. I've only heard about it.

1442
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,940
I heard it's a very cute and delicious dessert place.

1443
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,639
Passion5? That's also in Itaewon.

1444
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,140
- That's the same place.
- Oh, that place.

1445
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,609
(That's where he wanted to go.)

1446
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:20,149
- There's a place you want to go?
- What?

1447
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,350
What?

1448
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,690
Kyung Soo had...

1449
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,089
something he really wanted to buy in Hannam-dong.

1450
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,689
Let's go. We can go now.

1451
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:32,060
- No. But...
- No.

1452
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,289
Just cross the bridge, and it's Hannam-dong.

1453
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,200
- The reason was...
- Yes?

1454
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,730
I mentioned the Gangnam District Office.

1455
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,369
I thought I'd be in trouble for mentioning Hannam-dong.

1456
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,840
No, Hannam-dong was okay because it was on the way.

1457
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:44,240
The Gangnam District Office is far from here.

1458
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,939
Hey, Hannam-dong was on the way here.

1459
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,909
- The District Office is right here.
- No. It is...

1460
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,510
- No.
- It's far.

1461
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,779
Here's the thing.

1462
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,220
- The route...
- From here,

1463
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,249
you can't go around.

1464
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,650
- But you can stop by on the way.
- Yes.

1465
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,159
- Hanam-dong was on the way.
- That's right.

1466
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,219
That's it.

1467
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,890
Hannam-dong is okay.

1468
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,129
You should've told me.

1469
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,329
(Brazen)

1470
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:08,960
- What?
- Hannam-dong...

1471
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,770
We could've stopped by in Hannam-dong.

1472
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,329
- It's a bummer.
- Do you want to stop by...

1473
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:13,369
in Hannam-dong?

1474
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,739
- But is that...
- The place...

1475
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:16,169
- in Hannam-dong is...
- Where is it?

1476
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:17,509
Near Itaewon.

1477
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,970
That's kind of far.

1478
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,239
- No, Itaewon is far.
- Itaewon is far.

1479
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,780
See? Itaewon is...

1480
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:24,580
Not there.

1481
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,580
Even if I asked, I couldn't have gone.

1482
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,150
Here's the thing about them.

1483
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,020
"Do what you want to do."

1484
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:35,219
Later, they say, "No. Not that."

1485
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,090
Here's the thing about them.

1486
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,129
I didn't know the Gangnam District Office was...

1487
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:44,300
that far from Sinsa-dong until today.

1488
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:48,440
Hannam-dong is okay, but not Itaewon.

1489
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,940
Number 713 is ready.

1490
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,710
- Okay.
- Is that ours?

1491
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,380
Number 713.

1492
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,110
Here.

1493
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,549
- Enjoy.
- Let's go.

1494
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:02,950
- Give it to me.
- It's okay.

1495
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,619
Then, let me carry this.

1496
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:06,490
- No. I don't mind.
- Give it to me.

1497
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,019
(A dessert outing in Garosu-gil, the center of traffic)

1498
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,630
Excuse me.

1499
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,260
My Stars are passing through.

1500
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,870
(Smirking)

1501
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,630
This place looks good.

1502
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,370
(Hyping up the mood for My quiet Stars)

1503
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:31,050
(The bakery Kwang Kyu recommended)

1504
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,409
Doesn't this look tasty?

1505
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,449
- Salt bread and cheese salt bread.
- Let's get a few.

1506
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:36,779
- That looks good.
- And this.

1507
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,349
- The mini croissants.
- That looks good.

1508
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,390
(Grabbing everything they see)

1509
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:41,690
What...

1510
00:58:41,691 --> 00:58:43,320
(Approaching)

1511
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:46,090
- Just regular?
- Yes.

1512
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,530
Hey, that's not a dessert. That's a meal.

1513
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,970
(Plenty)

1514
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,969
- I think this will do?
- Yes?

1515
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:55,500
- Is this...
- Get a few?

1516
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,270
- This is not easy to eat.
- Right.

1517
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,110
- So...
- This might be better.

1518
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,980
Sure. Let's get a few.

1519
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:08,979
(Munching in the sample zone)

1520
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,320
(Enjoying the joy of free stuff)

1521
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,390
(Absurd)

1522
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,929
This is my place.

1523
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:19,030
(The regular's vibe)

1524
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,130
(Nom)

1525
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:24,770
Oh, sampling.

1526
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,239
Do you... Do you like...

1527
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,499
(Do you want to try the bread?)

1528
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,310
- I'm good.
- Okay.

1529
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:31,640
- Now...
- Kyung Soo?

1530
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,269
- We eat there.
- Yes.

1531
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,679
We'll eat after that.

1532
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,740
(Taking a big bite)

1533
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,050
This is so good. You have to try it.

1534
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:43,889
(My Star is so thoughtful.)

1535
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:45,289
How is it? Do you like it?

1536
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,159
- Is it just me?
- Is it good?

1537
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,189
(Sharing the bread with the staff)

1538
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,320
This is really good.

1539
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:52,660
(One big bite)

1540
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,460
Isn't it good? It's good.

1541
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,329
This place is good, Kwang Kyu.

1542
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,639
- Yes, it's good.
- It's good.

1543
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,769
(Fortunately, My Star likes it.)

1544
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:02,770
Right.

1545
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,469
Should we get their signature bread?

1546
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:06,239
- No.
- Will that do?

1547
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,079
- There's a lot to eat.
- Yes.

1548
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,279
- You already got so much.
- He's right.

1549
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,880
- I can't do anything I want, can I?
- That's not true.

1550
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,919
I can't do anything I want, can I?

1551
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,119
That's not true. Get it if you want.

1552
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,649
- But...
- Get it if you want.

1553
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,060
Today, was there...

1554
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:24,790
anything I did on my own?

1555
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,299
(Teary)

1556
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,729
- Thank you.
- Sorry.

1557
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:32,829
(Grabbing the bag in embarrassment)

1558
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:35,169
(Sad)

1559
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:37,310
(They ended up buying everything in Garosu-gil.)

1560
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:38,910
Car.

1561
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:43,240
(Escorting them due to guilt)

1562
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:45,109
- Is it near here?
- Yes.

1563
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,419
- It's just on the other side.
- On the other side?

1564
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,619
Yes. It's on that side.

1565
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,950
(The second set is nearby.)

1566
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:53,690
Off we go.

1567
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:56,389
Can you go without the GPS?

1568
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,489
You know it.

1569
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:00,260
I don't know in detail.

1570
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,230
- I'll tell you.
- Then turn the GPS on.

1571
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,900
Go straight.

1572
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,610
You have to go around the apartment.

1573
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,069
- Yes.
- I know.

1574
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,710
Turn left.

1575
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,410
Is it left and then right?

1576
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:18,709
Guide them this way?

1577
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:19,910
Yes.

1578
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:25,850
(Going around in circles while waiting)

1579
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,960
I think it's the next block.

1580
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,859
Do you see the car going in?

1581
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,090
(Already near the set)

1582
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,200
- Here.
- They're all our staff.

1583
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,429
(The eggiscoming staff are busy before the shoot.)

1584
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,369
Isn't Antenna nearby?

1585
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:40,600
That's the next block.

1586
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,439
Is there a shoot?

1587
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,810
(Is there a shoot?)

1588
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,709
(Smirking)

1589
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,279
We're shooting here.

1590
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,480
- Really?
- Yes.

1591
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:52,879
(Laughing)

1592
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,350
We're here to shoot.

1593
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,990
- "Is there a shoot?" - I know.

1594
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,989
- Thank you.
- Wait.

1595
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:02,320
- Let me get closer.
- You can't get out.

1596
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:06,029
Not that many actors have their faces registered.

1597
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:08,629
I think it's me, Seo Jun, and Yu Mi. Only the three of us.

1598
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:09,859
(The face recognition list)

1599
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,969
Thank you.

01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:14,840
(Seo Jin is familiar with this place as much as its employees.)

1601
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,340
(Allowed)

1602
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:20,310
(Seo Jin is here.)

1603
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,080
(Swag)

01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,180
(Guiding his stars with a laid-back smile)

1605
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,319
("Nattering with Nah" promotion shoot)

1606
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
Let's go.

1607
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,249
Where did you have your face recognised?

1608
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,750
- Did you have your face recognised?
- I did.

1609
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,690
You're almost their employee.

1610
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:39,759
We have to take our shoes off.

1611
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,900
Yes.

1612
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:42,800
Where?

1613
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,100
What do you mean by where? On the fourth floor.

1614
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:46,799
We have to take our shoes off.

1615
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,340
It's like a house inside.

1616
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,370
(Curious)

1617
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,310
Hop off.

1618
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:57,549
Aren't you coming?

1619
01:02:57,550 --> 01:02:58,550
(Hands full)

1620
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:01,580
(Seo Jin's first visit as a manager)

1621
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,989
(After taking the shoes off, they look for someone.)

1622
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,649
Are we the first ones to be here?

1623
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,819
(After taking the shoes off, they look for someone.)

1624
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,590
- You're here.
- Hello.

1625
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,629
(Director Na Yeong Seok of "Nattering with Nah")

1626
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,359
You walked in so quietly.

1627
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:15,799
Hello. Nice to meet you.

1628
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,330
(Greeting Chang Wook whom he's never met before)

1629
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:18,770
Oh, my goodness.

1630
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,199
(Slowly)

1631
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,340
- Stop exaggerating.
- My goodness.

1632
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,839
- Really?
- You're so quiet.

1633
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:27,179
- Really?
- What do you mean that we're quiet?

1634
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,739
I had my face recognised.

1635
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,240
- What?
- Over here...

1636
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,149
We have to put it in the fridge, don't we?

1637
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,420
- First, the food...
- The ice cream.

1638
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,849
- Kwang Kyu, open the fridge.
- Ice cream will melt.

1639
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,450
Kwang Kyu, open the fridge.

1640
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:41,420
Where do I press?

1641
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,260
- It's a wine cellar.
- But...

1642
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,689
Keep it in here.

1643
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:46,989
- But for 30 minutes...
- It will...

1644
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,160
stay cool for a while.

1645
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,569
(Live like Kwang Kyu...)

1646
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:53,470
(who doesn't care about the fridge and the freezer.)

1647
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,740
When did you get your hair done?

1648
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,840
I realised my hair was too long this morning.

1649
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:58,810
- I didn't want to let you beat me.
- Did you go?

1650
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,240
What?

1651
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:03,139
What? You can go and talk.

1652
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:05,750
We'll stay out. We're managers.

1653
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,079
- This way.
- Okay.

1654
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,479
(Greeting the guests)

1655
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,450
(Grumpy Secretary back to themselves)

1656
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,060
You're early. It starts at 4pm.

1657
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:16,960
So...

1658
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,060
I was planning to stop by somewhere on the way.

1659
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,570
Seo Jin said the Gangnam District Office was too far.

1660
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,670
But aren't managers...

1661
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,410
supposed to do what their stars say?

1662
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,809
- But...
- All day today,

1663
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,979
even if we had something we wanted to do,

1664
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:39,550
we couldn't do it.

1665
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:41,979
(Tattling)

1666
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:45,490
Why did you hire uncomfortable people...

1667
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,759
as your managers and go through this?

1668
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,890
(Uncomfortable people go around someone else's business.)

1669
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:56,200
Stop walking around and come here. You'll disturb them from working.

1670
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,630
Is the CEO here?

1671
01:04:58,130 --> 01:05:00,070
Why would you look for the CEO?

1672
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,240
Because he's my friend.

1673
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,940
Where did Kwang Kyu go?

1674
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:06,810
- What?
- Have a seat. It starts at 4pm.

1675
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:08,579
This is his first visit.

1676
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,749
- It's my first visit.
- Is this your first visit?

1677
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:11,780
Yes.

1678
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:13,379
You never invited me.

1679
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,750
(Sullen)

1680
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:15,949
(Feeling guilty)

1681
01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:17,020
I'm sorry.

1682
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,350
No.

1683
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,149
(Getting up)

1684
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,489
Do you want some water?

1685
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,589
No. Can you tell me where the restroom is?

1686
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,929
Guide him to the restroom.

1687
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,229
(Guide him to the restroom.)

1688
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,629
- Hey.
- The manager...

1689
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,999
- Hey, you...
- But he's the manager.

1690
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,330
(The famous Seo Jin's trainer)

1691
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:34,739
Go straight and turn right.

1692
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,270
- Turn right?
- Yes.

1693
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,439
Here it is.

1694
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:39,710
Don't just tell him. Show him.

1695
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:43,780
He walks too fast. I can't keep up with him.

1696
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,409
Do you know what he said before you came in?

1697
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:47,450
What?

1698
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:49,880
All day,

1699
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,089
he couldn't do anything he wanted.

1700
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:57,830
(Tattling what he tattled)

1701
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,560
What are you talking about?

1702
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:01,899
No, that's not true.

1703
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,900
(He can only rely on Chang Wook.)

1704
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,330
We're doing everything Kyung Soo said.

1705
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,030
(Right?)

1706
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:11,069
- That's not what Kyung Soo said.
- No, that's not true.

1707
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:12,110
(Turning into Truth or Dare)

1708
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,769
Kyung Soo looks uncomfortable.

1709
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:14,880
No.

1710
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:19,380
(Instead of a brief moment of relief, discomfort is coming.)

1711
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,580
Kyung Soo is talking a lot today.

1712
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,380
"Talking a lot?"

1713
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,720
Kyung Soo becomes quiet when he is comfortable.

1714
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:27,320
He only speaks when he is uncomfortable.

1715
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,859
- But doesn't he speak his mind?
- He does.

1716
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:29,990
That's what I thought.

1717
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,090
(In fact, he has a lot he couldn't say.)

1718
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,900
This is the only thing I can think of.

1719
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:37,470
The Gangnam District Office.

1720
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,729
That was my worst...

1721
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,139
- You must have deep resentment.
- Yes.

1722
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,099
- You should go there tomorrow.
- To be honest,

1723
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,070
I still can't understand it.

1724
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:48,980
(The Gangnam District Office is sweet Kyung Soo's courage button.)

1725
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,750
What I was initially going to do was...

1726
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:55,349
There is a dessert place called Passion5 in Itaewon.

1727
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,049
- The dessert place.
- Yes, there's that dessert place.

1728
01:06:57,050 --> 01:06:59,820
- I was thinking about that place.
- So...

1729
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:04,689
despite the fact that you said you were going to Itaewon...

1730
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,259
- He didn't say.
- I didn't say it.

1731
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,000
But the reason why I couldn't say it was...

1732
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,800
There's a great salt bread place near the Gangnam District Office.

1733
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:13,330
The office is actually not very far from here.

1734
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:17,509
So I asked, "What if we stop by at the place first?"

1735
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,769
That's natural since it's nearby.

1736
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:21,780
"The Gangnam District Office is too far."

1737
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,210
- Did he say it's too far?
- Yes.

1738
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,780
"You can't go to the Gangnam District Office. You can't."

1739
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,780
What do you think if I brought up Itaewon then?

1740
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,349
- You would get scolded.
- But Itaewon was on the way here.

1741
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:33,490
So you could stop by.

1742
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:38,030
But the traffic is bad around the Gangnam District Office.

1743
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,759
You changed so much.

1744
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,029
You treat people differently.

1745
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:44,829
When you were working with Lee Su Ji, you worked so hard.

1746
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,299
You even drank all the soup.

1747
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,869
What does that have to do with this?

1748
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:50,069
But when he said he wanted to go to Itaewon,

1749
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:51,869
- you can't even...
- He didn't say that.

1750
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,039
He only mentioned the Gangnam District Office.

1751
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,639
The Gangnam District Office is right around the corner.

1752
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,179
But there's a traffic jam from there to Sinsa-dong.

1753
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,980
And we were late to the first shoot...

1754
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,680
because there was a traffic jam.

1755
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,489
That's why I said no.

1756
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:07,049
- I did what I had to as a manager.
- Because he might be late?

1757
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,789
Of course. I needed to get him on time as his manager.

1758
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:12,159
You had your own reasoning.

1759
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,860
Of course. Do you think I move without thinking?

1760
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,670
(Let's stop talking about the Gangnam District Office.)

1761
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:20,469
I think I have to explain about the shoot.

1762
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:23,599
Kyung Soo has been here often.

1763
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,710
The theme of the shooting is chatting...

1764
01:08:26,010 --> 01:08:28,579
and talking about your work...

1765
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:31,410
- while eating comfortably.
- Okay.

1766
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:34,619
I haven't seen your work yet but if you bought...

1767
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,180
(Moving in smoothly)

1768
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,490
If you bought...

1769
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,489
Honestly, I feel uneasy.

1770
01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:42,860
Why?

1771
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,989
I mean...

1772
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:47,700
- But you looked like...
- Yes?

1773
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,659
You were nervous in front of Director Na Yeong Seok.

1774
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,029
When Director Na started talking...

1775
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,469
I think you are more nervous in front of Yeong Seok.

1776
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:59,309
(I think you are more nervous in front of Yeong Seok.)

1777
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:02,440
(Just a little bit.)

1778
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:04,749
Why are you nervous?

1779
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:08,280
I don't know. Whenever I see him I get nervous.

1780
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,919
I did nothing wrong against you. So why are you being like this?

1781
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:14,390
He says seeing you reminds him of a bad memory.

1782
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,959
I went to his housewarming party.

1783
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,789
He said you said something harsh to him...

1784
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:22,830
What harsh words did I say?

1785
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:26,000
(Pouting)

1786
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:30,070
And you asked why he put more water when making ramyeon. I don't know.

1787
01:09:30,140 --> 01:09:34,070
(Mentioning about water level in the ramyeon still hurts him)

1788
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,409
(Laughing)

1789
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:40,250
Anyway, don't worry about him.

1790
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,420
See? He's always like this.

1791
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,120
To you, he's...

1792
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,790
(He's watching what he says in front of My Stars.)

1793
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,960
Please take care of My Stars. I'm here as the manager today.

1794
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,800
Gosh. Our...

1795
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,099
So we'll talk while eating.

1796
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,100
(Again, he explains in a serious manner.)

1797
01:09:58,101 --> 01:10:01,039
I will ask you some questions comfortably.

1798
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,399
The first part is about your works,

1799
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:04,869
how it was and such.

1800
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:07,140
And then afterwards, we'll take a break...

1801
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,080
and wrap up.

1802
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,780
I think it will take...

1803
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:14,280
(Click)

1804
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,450
Someone from behind me...

1805
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,889
Some silhouette is moving about.

1806
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:22,320
(There's a shadow behind me that bothers me.)

1807
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:24,960
What... Why are you taking pictures?

1808
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,759
Managers take such pictures.

1809
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,060
Don't you know PC?

1810
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:32,299
I don't think he knows. He doesn't know what PC is.

1811
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:35,240
- Why are you taking PC yourself?
- What is it for you?

1812
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,440
Kwang Kyu, what's PC for you?

1813
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,940
Why are you doing this to someone on the same team?

1814
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,979
Why are you doing this to someone on the same team?

1815
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,879
(Kwang Kyu doesn't know what he is doing again.)

1816
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,179
It's pictures.

1817
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,280
I so understand why you came here all tired.

1818
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,449
It's a bit exhausting today.

1819
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:52,519
(Looking tired)

1820
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,660
On top of this,

1821
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,089
he came after pulling an all-nighter.

1822
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,889
Why weren't you able to sleep when you had the morning schedule?

1823
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:03,400
What's that movie? I heard the movie "Good News" was fun.

1824
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,570
I missed my sleep watching it all night.

1825
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:07,900
Wait.

1826
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,540
That has nothing to do with the schedule.

1827
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:12,970
Why did you watch that movie?

1828
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:15,310
Today's shooting and "Good News..."

1829
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,480
We're even promoting "The Manipulated" today.

1830
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:23,549
Is there any questions you want to be asked about?

1831
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:26,150
Kyung Soo plays a villain...

1832
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,559
and Chang Wook is in charge...

1833
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,060
- of action mostly.
- Yes.

1834
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:31,730
- He did the most action this time.
- Yes.

1835
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:35,729
All types of action, starting with bikes and cars...

1836
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:36,959
- So you want more questions...
- About action scenes.

1837
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:38,200
About the action scenes.

1838
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,869
And since Kyung Soo plays the villain...

1839
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:40,870
Questions related to the change of role in acting.

1840
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:42,839
Ask questions about him playing a villain.

1841
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,610
(Satisfied)

1842
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,040
All right.

1843
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:47,909
Such questions...

1844
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,380
(As expected from the smart manager, Lee Seo Jin)

1845
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:53,250
Are you open to personal questions? Or...

1846
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,879
- You can't.
- We can't?

1847
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:56,179
- We can't ask at all?
- No, you can't.

1848
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,719
- You can't.
- We can't?

1849
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,919
- We can't ask at all?
- No, you can't.

1850
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,519
Please be careful with personal questions.

1851
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,719
(Kwang Kyu, a somewhat strict manager)

1852
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,530
Mainly ask about the series, characters, and bike chase scenes.

1853
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:09,929
Also, about the most difficult part in playing the villain.

1854
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,329
He is not the villain.

1855
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,630
He is.

1856
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,299
(Kwang Kyu's memory is broken in pieces.)

1857
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,970
He is a good guy.

1858
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,970
He is a hardworking type, and he is a free-rider type.

1859
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:21,640
Kyung Soo is a free-rider?

1860
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,849
(He can't believe what he heard.)

1861
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,249
Kwang Kyu, what do you mean by free-riding?

1862
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,750
- You said so earlier.
- But I did my best.

1863
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,319
- You did?
- Of course.

1864
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,519
Then, who did I hear this from?

1865
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,620
(Then, who did I hear this from?)

1866
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:38,429
You know that is the worst wording for an article.

1867
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,389
- Is it?
- "Is it?"

1868
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:42,199
"Doh Kyung Soo, free-riding this time around."

1869
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,400
The title will be made like this straight away.

1870
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,699
This is the worst. Managers should be...

1871
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,539
- controlling such a thing.
- Okay.

1872
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,370
(He is quick to self-reflect.)

1873
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,610
I misunderstood.

1874
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:58,080
Chang Wook was covered in blood, being beaten up,

1875
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:02,479
but Kyung Soo was walking by, looking so neat and clean.

1876
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:06,219
So I thought he was free-riding.

1877
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:07,250
You did?

1878
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:10,319
He made up his mind alone.

1879
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,789
He just made a confession.

1880
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,789
"It was my idea to think he was free-riding."

1881
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:15,759
It was my personal thought. I'm sorry.

1882
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,430
I apologise.

1883
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,970
It was careless of me.

1884
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,570
What time is it, Kyung Soo?

1885
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,439
It's 3:50pm.

1886
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,539
- It's 3:50pm?
- Yes.

1887
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,309
Take a rest for now.

1888
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:33,149
In ten minutes, we'll stand by and start with you walking in.

1889
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,249
Okay.

1890
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:35,420
Please, take your time.

1891
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,219
- What?
- Is this yours?

1892
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,490
No, it's Kwang Kyu's.

1893
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:48,960
I'm sorry, but please don't leave such a thing on set.

1894
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,559
- Whose is it?
- It's mine.

1895
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,069
What is it?

1896
01:13:52,070 --> 01:13:53,599
We are going to shoot there.

1897
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,539
Right. I'm sorry.

1898
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,439
We're shooting over here. If you leave your belongings...

1899
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,909
- He apologised right away.
- This is the set?

1900
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:01,069
I'm sorry. I'll take my jacket as well.

1901
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:03,609
- That jacket's yours too?
- Yes, it's mine.

1902
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,580
(Laughing)

1903
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,719
Over there is the set, so please stay here.

1904
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,989
The tone in which you talk to Kyung Soo and me...

1905
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,149
is totally different.

1906
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:15,319
Of course, it should be different.

1907
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,889
He is a celebrity,

1908
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:18,059
- and you are a manager.
- You are a manager.

1909
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:20,190
Of course. I'm sorry.

1910
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:24,160
He's apologising.

1911
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:28,140
(Kwang Kyu is nervous whenever he sees Director Na Yeong Seok.)

1912
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,839
I think we should start now.

1913
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,940
- Shall we go in?
- Yes.

1914
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,139
Kwang Kyu, please take care of my tumbler.

1915
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:40,009
Of course.

1916
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:42,279
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1917
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,050
- I'll take care of it.
- Please.

1918
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,859
(The shoot starts.)

1919
01:14:47,860 --> 01:14:49,189
Do we start from walking in with the bag?

1920
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:51,689
No, it's okay. You can just leave it over there.

1921
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,629
- Shall I leave the bread over here?
- Sure.

1922
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,559
- Hello.
- Hello, Seo Jin.

1923
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:56,900
Hello.

1924
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:59,529
(He is sweet to the younger actors.)

1925
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:00,770
Go ahead and do your work.

1926
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,769
Kwang Soo just arrived.

1927
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:05,010
- Kwang Soo's here?
- Yes.

1928
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,110
- Say hello.
- Hello.

1929
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:08,380
How have you been?

1930
01:15:08,780 --> 01:15:11,309
(Actor Lee Kwang Soo)

1931
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:12,449
You don't have to worry about us.

1932
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:14,349
We're here as managers, so it's okay.

1933
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:17,079
I'm sorry, managers, please stay inside.

1934
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:18,589
Please stay inside.

1935
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:20,520
- All right.
- We didn't go out.

1936
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:23,790
It's funnier to see him peek like that. Two of them are cute.

1937
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:25,060
I won't go beyond this line.

1938
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,729
This is a gizzard shad.

1939
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:29,929
Yes, it's gizzard shad since it's fall.

1940
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,900
- It's sashimi.
- Then shall we open one by one?

1941
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,499
- Do you eat gizzard shad?
- Gizzard shad is great.

1942
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:36,900
- Do you eat gizzard shad?
- It's in season.

1943
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:40,239
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1944
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,239
- Thank you.
- First, let's taste the food...

1945
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,740
- and talk after.
- Yes.

1946
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:48,449
I heard that four of you filmed an original series called...

1947
01:15:48,450 --> 01:15:50,979
- "The Manipulated." - Yes.

1948
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,619
Why don't you tell us what it's about?

1949
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:55,119
This is a story about vengeance.

1950
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:58,829
- There's a process that I uncover.
- Right.

1951
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:00,329
There's a process...

1952
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:02,500
where I go on a quest to find the character named Yo Han,

1953
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,399
this veiled character.

1954
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,730
And in between that process,

1955
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,040
there’s the character played by Kwang Soo.

1956
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:11,569
He is a character who helps.

1957
01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:14,939
So, we don't encounter each other very often.

1958
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,580
- Right.
- So there's an ultimate figure.

1959
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:21,320
(He's sleeping.)

1960
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:26,089
(He gently has both hands together.)

1961
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,120
(Snoring)

1962
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,090
(Snoring)

1963
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,230
(Snoring)

1964
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:38,800
(He's sleeping with an audio monitor on for good conscience.)

1965
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:41,770
I think he's using the audio as his lullaby.

1966
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,269
(Shaking his head)

1967
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,639
He can't hear it anyway.

1968
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,910
(He can't hear it anyway.)

1969
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:52,750
(He's in his deep sleep like a newborn.)

1970
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:58,150
(They are shooting.)

1971
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:00,690
(Peaking)

1972
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,660
I wanted to go to the restroom.

1973
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,460
Would it matter?

1974
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:10,600
(Examining)

1975
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,699
I should walk out with my face covered like this.

1976
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,430
(I should walk out with my face covered like this.)

1977
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,440
- There were many scenes to care...
- There were scenes he could rest.

1978
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:24,579
He has a lot of scenes. But...

1979
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:26,109
during breaks,

1980
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:29,450
- as he asked earlier, he'd say, - Yes.

1981
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:31,849
"Yoon Su," when we see each other in a long time...

1982
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:34,689
(That was a perfect camouflage.)

1983
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,860
(Confident view from the back.)

1984
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:44,830
He kept moving around.

1985
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,600
You know, when you are shooting, the guys in the neighbourhood...

1986
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:52,169
would come around to disrupt.

1987
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:54,270
It felt like it and startled me at first.

1988
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,509
I tried not to look.

1989
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,209
And I knew if I said something, the conversation would get long.

1990
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:00,910
- So I tried to ignore it.
- All right.

1991
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,080
(A refreshing walk)

1992
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:06,620
On the first day of the shoot, I thought, "He even prepared..."

1993
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:10,890
"this before he came."

1994
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,160
As for Kyung Soo...

1995
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:17,560
(Sneaking)

1996
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:23,400
(Undercover operation that was perfect only for Seo Jin)

1997
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:29,040
(Caretaker Fairy is still asleep.)

1998
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,509
Shall we just take a five-minute break and continue?

1999
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:34,849
- Good.
- Those who need a bathroom break.

2000
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,580
- Yes.
- I think you could do that.

2001
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:40,190
(Slightly opening the door)

2002
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:41,590
Hey.

2003
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:43,890
Why are you shooting for so long?

2004
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:45,959
- It's usually like this.
- Gosh.

2005
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,590
We decided to take a short break.

2006
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:50,199
Did you sleep? Did you?

2007
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,470
- No, I didn't. He did.
- You're a manager.

2008
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:53,699
I'm sorry.

2009
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,470
(He turns himself in.)

2010
01:18:56,370 --> 01:18:58,370
I'm not blaming you.

2011
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:00,810
- But the eyes...
- I didn't sleep for sure.

2012
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,380
I slept.

2013
01:19:03,180 --> 01:19:04,440
- I'm sorry.
- No, you could sleep.

2014
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,850
(Now, he would get nervous just by looking at Director Na's face.)

2015
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,620
(Kwang Soo makes his appearance.)

2016
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:13,749
Kwang Kyu, you look so tired.

2017
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,389
My energy's drained.

2018
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:17,720
Kyung Soo is pickier than I thought.

2019
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,230
Anyone can tell that you slept for three hours here.

2020
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,129
He's so sensitive, and he would not...

2021
01:19:23,130 --> 01:19:24,429
for a second believe in people.

2022
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:26,599
Why would you talk behind...

2023
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,770
young Kyung Soo like that?

2024
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:32,210
Don't you know I'm joking? "J, O, Z, Z."

2025
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,510
What is "J, O, Z, Z?"

2026
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,779
- "J, O, Z, Z?" - It was Kwang Kyu, wasn't it?

2027
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:41,180
- What?
- Yes.

2028
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:43,349
- "J, O, Z, Z?" - It was Kwang Kyu, wasn't it?

2029
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,850
- What?
- Yes.

2030
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,319
- See? Kyung Soo knows right away.
- No, it wasn't me.

2031
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,289
Kwang Kyu, I wasn't sensitive.

2032
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:51,019
- It's a joke.
- Joke?

2033
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,529
(Embarrassed)

2034
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:53,629
I'm not sensitive.

2035
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,160
Can't you make a joke when the president's not around?

2036
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:58,029
Why?

2037
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:59,800
Why would you bring up the president all of a sudden?

2038
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,640
That was so sudden.

2039
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,500
And besides, how is "J, O, Z, Z," joke?

2040
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,140
(Caretaker Fairy is into "JOZZ" these days.)

2041
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,239
I see your girlfriend sometimes...

2042
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,210
- Yes.
- at the hair salon.

2043
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:14,110
- We are doing well.
- It's been a long time, right?

2044
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,820
Yes, around 8 to 9 years.

2045
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,149
- Oh, gosh.
- It's been 8 to 9 years?

2046
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:18,650
If it goes over two years,

2047
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:22,019
couples tend to get married or break up. Seo Jin said that.

2048
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,920
(Couples over 2 years tend to get married or break up. Seo Jin said.)

2049
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,230
Seo Jin's never dated someone over a year.

2050
01:20:26,630 --> 01:20:29,229
I've had relationships for over a year, but not two.

2051
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:30,729
- Right, 2 years.
- Over 2 years...

2052
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:32,670
(I see.)

2053
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,600
If it goes over two years, you should get married.

2054
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:36,940
You've been together for a long time, right?

2055
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,510
What are you going to do about it? Will you or will you break up?

2056
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,070
So suddenly?

2057
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,040
What is this?

2058
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,909
Why so suddenly...

2059
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:46,180
(It feels like meeting your uncle during the holidays.)

2060
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:49,180
All right. You do what you need to. So what if you break up?

2061
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,819
No, that's not it.

2062
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,450
You could always meet new people.

2063
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:56,020
What are you talking about?

2064
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:58,159
- We are not breaking up. Why...
- All right.

2065
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,429
(The uncle only says what he wants to say.)

2066
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:01,190
He broke up with all of them.

2067
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,099
- Excuse me?
- He broke up with everyone.

2068
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,100
- That's why I'm alone.
- Of course he did...

2069
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,699
- This...
- What do you want to talk about?

2070
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,740
No, I'm just saying.

2071
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,969
(Is this a JOZZ as well?)

2072
01:21:13,970 --> 01:21:15,240
What is he talking about?

2073
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,310
Can you give me my lip balm for a second?

2074
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,410
- Yes, of course.
- It'd have been better without it.

2075
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:22,120
I have only one thing I can ask Seo Jin.

2076
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,650
That is asking for lip balm.

2077
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,790
Really?

2078
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:29,990
(That is so small and precious.)

2079
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:32,359
- I'll be back.
- Say it if you want to go anywhere.

2080
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,559
- All right.
- Okay.

2081
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,130
(Tell me if you want to go anywhere. I'll listen, but I'll decide.)

2082
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,400
- We'll finish up quickly.
- Okay.

2083
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,170
(End of break time)

2084
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:49,910
(Shooting)

2085
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,879
- Good job.
- Well done.

2086
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:52,979
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2087
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,950
(Schedule over)

2088
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:56,719
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2089
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,490
Thank you.

2090
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:01,420
Please edit it well so My Stars will look good.

2091
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,920
I think the shoot went well.

2092
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:05,159
- Did it?
- Yes.

2093
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,589
Thank you. Please take good care of them.

2094
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,300
(My Star's face is flushing for some reason.)

2095
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:11,729
- Thank you.
- We'll be off now.

2096
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:12,830
Thank you.

2097
01:22:13,870 --> 01:22:16,740
Please take care of My Stars. The editing.

2098
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:20,010
Well...

2099
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:22,479
You didn't drink, did you?

2100
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,740
Of course not.

2101
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,110
You weren't like this earlier, but why are you suddenly...

2102
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:27,749
I slept.

2103
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,949
You did?

2104
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:30,179
I think it's because I just woke up.

2105
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:31,890
(High energy brought about by deep sleep)

2106
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:33,519
Did you bring the tumbler?

2107
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,820
I gave it to Kwang Kyu earlier.

2108
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:38,330
- You did?
- Yes.

2109
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:41,490
Wait.

2110
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:43,500
Tumbler?

2111
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,600
(Where did the tumbler go?)

2112
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:48,439
Kwang Kyu, please take care of my tumbler.

2113
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:54,470
(My Star's tumbler was put in charge with Caretaker Fairy.)

2114
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:56,909
Tumbler. Did you?

2115
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:58,379
Yes, I gave it to you.

2116
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:00,349
I think I left it upstairs.

2117
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,280
- What did you leave?
- Tumbler.

2118
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,150
(Left all alone.)

2119
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:07,620
Oh, gosh. I forgot about it.

2120
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,990
(Smiling)

2121
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,360
I thought he would do that.

2122
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:20,430
So I thought I might have given him a big burden with the tumbler.

2123
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:21,940
- Big burden?
- Right.

2124
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,740
I should've taken care of it.

2125
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,479
- Kwang Kyu.
- My Star, here's your tumbler.

2126
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,879
- Thank you.
- It slipped my mind.

2127
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,880
Please be careful.

2128
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,979
Please be careful.

2129
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,690
Oh, gosh. I'll be careful next time. Gosh, it's a mosquito.

2130
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:41,689
Mosquito just went in.

2131
01:23:41,690 --> 01:23:44,420
(He does everything he can to get rid of the mosquito for My Stars.)

2132
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,829
- We're taking off.
- Yes.

2133
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:48,460
(Moving to the after-party venue.)

2134
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,360
Kyung Soo, do you drink as well?

2135
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,170
- I enjoy it.
- You do?

2136
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:58,370
(Looking around)

2137
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:00,440
(Scanning for the menu)

2138
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:03,880
- What do you like?
- Order everything you want.

2139
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,380
Order everything you want.

2140
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:08,150
From how I see it...

2141
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,920
I found out your routine.

2142
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:12,220
What is it?

2143
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:13,920
"Do everything you want."

2144
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,419
"Order everything you want."

2145
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:19,330
We say, "Shall we eat this?" And you'd say, "Not that one."

2146
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:22,299
(A man who does not know to say yes)

2147
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:24,059
They figured you out.

2148
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,100
(Figuring out Grumpy Secretary is complete.)

2149
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:27,369
No, from now on,

2150
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:30,040
- order everything you want.
- "From now on." It's all done.

2151
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,669
I'll try the grilled squid with whole garlic.

2152
01:24:33,670 --> 01:24:35,509
- That sounds good.
- That's good.

2153
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:37,210
(It sounds good.)

2154
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:40,979
Then I'll choose the rolled omelet with cheese.

2155
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:43,979
No, I'll get the regular rolled omelet.

2156
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,790
- We'll have regular rolled omelet, - Yes.

2157
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,360
- grilled squid with whole garlic, - Yes.

2158
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,390
- and a fishcake soup, please.
- Yes.

2159
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,929
Yes, we're good for now.

2160
01:24:53,930 --> 01:24:55,260
(Satisfied)

2161
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:57,099
Thank you.

2162
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:59,370
(Before the food comes out, a drink for a hard day's work)

2163
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:03,100
(Taste from above)

2164
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,370
(Bottoms up)

2165
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,380
That's so good.

2166
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:13,949
The drink was just right.

2167
01:25:13,950 --> 01:25:15,520
Would you like another shot of the same one?

2168
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,719
I'll do it.

2169
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,720
Will you?

2170
01:25:17,721 --> 01:25:19,120
(A quick turnover)

2171
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:21,860
If we drink like this with them, we might die.

2172
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,889
- Guys, drink slowly.
- Yes.

2173
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,330
I'll take a break.

2174
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:28,830
I think I need to get drunk quickly.

2175
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,230
(I have a lot to say.)

2176
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:35,299
This looks so good as well.

2177
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,770
(The food has arrived.)

2178
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:43,709
(3 dishes from the snack bar that go well with the cold)

2179
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,010
The food looks good here.

2180
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,079
(Taking a bite of the rolled omelet)

2181
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,519
- Kyung Soo.
- Yes?

2182
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,749
Enjoy.

2183
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:52,890
(Yummy)

2184
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:56,119
You've taken good care of us.

2185
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:59,160
(Giving the soup to My Star)

2186
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:00,889
This is so good.

2187
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,729
The soup is so good.

2188
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:03,800
Is it?

2189
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,100
It's good.

2190
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:06,930
This is so delicious, Seo Jin.

2191
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,069
How long have you known each other?

2192
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,470
- What? How long have we known?
- Yes.

2193
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,339
It's been 20 years.

2194
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,840
That's a long time.

2195
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,580
But we weren't close from the beginning.

2196
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,080
I think we became close...

2197
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,380
about 15 years ago.

2198
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:26,290
But that's not that long, is it?

2199
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:28,120
What's not a long time?

2200
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,460
- Being close for 15 years.
- That's a long time.

2201
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:32,589
I've known Kwang Soo for ten years.

2202
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:34,260
- Ten years?
- Right.

2203
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:35,599
If I think about it that way...

2204
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,070
If it's been ten years with Kwang Soo, have you fought?

2205
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:41,670
- No, I haven't.
- You haven't?

2206
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,670
(Peaking)

2207
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,870
Is that so?

2208
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:50,879
Have you two fought badly before?

2209
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,949
- What?
- Of course.

2210
01:26:51,950 --> 01:26:53,950
At first, I didn't even look at him.

2211
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:58,320
I felt bad afterwards. That's how we became friends.

2212
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,890
When two people last for a long time,

2213
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:06,329
there's always the one who endures.

2214
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:07,589
(He claims that he's the one.)

2215
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:11,970
From how I see it, you are also putting up with Kwang Soo a lot.

2216
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:13,970
- That is correct.
- Of course.

2217
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:16,100
One person always endures.

2218
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:18,199
Then are you talking behind Kwang Soo?

2219
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,610
Of course not. We're talking about you.

2220
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,479
You say Kyung Soo is putting up with Kwang Soo.

2221
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,009
(My Stars are awkward because of the two guys quarrelling.)

2222
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,920
Oh, gosh. You're asking too many questions.

2223
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,319
Why couldn't you just let it go?

2224
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,420
All right.

2225
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,319
I like people like Kwang Kyu.

2226
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:40,659
(I like people like Kwang Kyu.)

2227
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:41,960
I love D.O.

2228
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:45,400
- You've studied a lot about me.
- Of course.

2229
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,900
Me too.

2230
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,600
(Shall we shake hands?)

2231
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,569
- D.O.
- D.O.?

2232
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,069
(I like D.O. as well.)

2233
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:55,809
- I love D.O.
- I love D.O.

2234
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,940
(He's working hard all day long while D.O. is there.)

2235
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:00,650
What are you, a capitalist seal?

2236
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:02,180
What's a seal got to do with it?

2237
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:06,320
- "A capitalist seal?" - I meant slave.

2238
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,550
What was that?

2239
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:10,990
Why would you bring up a seal?

2240
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,290
I'm sorry.

2241
01:28:12,730 --> 01:28:15,500
But I'm really curious.

2242
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,400
Where did the seal come about?

2243
01:28:20,670 --> 01:28:22,599
"A capitalist seal."

2244
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,239
- I...
- Really...

2245
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,909
- It's something I couldn't imagine.
- Right.

2246
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:29,680
(Infinite curiosity)

2247
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,280
Can I speak honestly?

2248
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:34,249
- While you were doing an interview, - Yes.

2249
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,980
- I checked my social media.
- Yes.

2250
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:41,490
A seal was chased by a shark.

2251
01:28:41,790 --> 01:28:44,320
And the seal suddenly went up on the boat.

2252
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:45,889
I know that video.

2253
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:47,060
- You know it too?
- Yes.

2254
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,460
Maybe that's why the seal came out.

2255
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:57,300
(He means he said that in a stream of consciousness.)

2256
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,070
Wasn't it tiring earlier?

2257
01:28:59,170 --> 01:29:00,640
- Excuse me?
- Weren't you tired earlier?

2258
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,679
No, you guys made me feel comfortable.

2259
01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:05,550
- Really?
- It's just...

2260
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,420
(Laughing)

2261
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,549
Didn't Seo Jin make you uncomfortable?

2262
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:13,819
- Me?
- Yes.

2263
01:29:13,820 --> 01:29:14,990
It's just...

2264
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:16,320
- I'm uncomfortable?
- Well...

2265
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,359
It was a time to think about the work and dedication...

2266
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,629
- of our managers.
- Time to reflect.

2267
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,929
- Yes, time to reflect.
- That's it.

2268
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,670
That's the purpose of this show.

2269
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:32,810
(Only after 5 episodes, we get to learn the show's purpose.)

2270
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:36,710
I'm going to give them a hug before I get home.

2271
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:41,010
(Satisfied)

2272
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:42,279
I'm going to thank them.

2273
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,880
(Thank you.)

2274
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:45,419
Kyung Soo perfectly got used...

2275
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:46,850
- to our show.
- He did.

2276
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:48,249
- Didn't he?
- He did.

2277
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:49,820
He finally adapted perfectly.

2278
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,560
That's the intention.

2279
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:54,760
In fact,

2280
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,629
since there were the other actors...

2281
01:29:57,630 --> 01:29:59,530
and the director,

2282
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,570
I wanted to put more thought...

2283
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:03,839
into getting the dessert.

2284
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,639
(I wanted to put more thought into getting the dessert.)

2285
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,209
- I mean...
- He holds grudges.

2286
01:30:11,210 --> 01:30:14,710
If I do this again...

2287
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,250
- If I do this again...
- Yes.

2288
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:18,950
If there's a situation like this again,

2289
01:30:19,290 --> 01:30:21,290
I'm going to try saying my opinion more strongly.

2290
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:23,820
I got a little courage today.

2291
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:26,159
Why don't you just badmouth in front of us?

2292
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:27,630
Just say it directly.

2293
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:28,930
What?

2294
01:30:30,130 --> 01:30:32,800
"What didn't you let me go to the Gangnam District Office?"

2295
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:34,530
Try it.

2296
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,870
Look down, you punk.

2297
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:42,180
(Looking away)

2298
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:49,020
Drink up.

2299
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,580
Gosh, I love you.

2300
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:59,830
Both Kyung Soo and Chang Wook make a good first impression.

2301
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:01,889
(The Grumpy Secretaries loved My Stars today.)

2302
01:31:01,890 --> 01:31:05,969
Kwang Kyu, what I felt differently from myself from before was...

2303
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,870
that they really loved this job.

2304
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,200
You didn't?

2305
01:31:10,370 --> 01:31:14,009
I liked it, but I was very particular.

2306
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:17,840
I didn't do everything. I picked and chose things.

2307
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:21,080
But when I saw Chang Wook, I could tell he liked his job.

2308
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,549
He said this earlier.

2309
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:24,750
Even if there are only few scenes,

2310
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,190
if he likes it, he plays the role.

2311
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:31,420
But as for me, if there were only a few scenes,

2312
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:33,660
I threw the script.

2313
01:31:34,430 --> 01:31:37,530
(Those hot-tempered days)

2314
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,270
But it's nice to drink with youngsters.

2315
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:44,800
That's for sure.

2316
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:46,910
The older you get,

2317
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:50,340
the more you want to hang out with younger people.

2318
01:31:51,610 --> 01:31:52,749
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

2319
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:56,420
When I was younger, I wanted to hang out with older guys.

2320
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:59,549
- But the older I got...
- Right.

2321
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:01,350
I wanted to hang out with younger people.

2322
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:03,790
So I'm very happy today.

2323
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:09,660
There is something I've been curious about these days.

2324
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:13,370
They say the older you get,

2325
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,500
the faster time moves.

2326
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:19,040
The time passing itself.

2327
01:32:19,070 --> 01:32:21,769
But that's something that has been proven by science.

2328
01:32:21,770 --> 01:32:23,409
- How is that scientifically proven?
- Has it?

2329
01:32:23,410 --> 01:32:25,139
- Yes.
- How is it proven?

2330
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,249
That was scientifically proven?

2331
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:30,579
The reason you feel like time flies faster when you're old...

2332
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,979
is proven by science.

2333
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:33,550
- Really?
- Yes.

2334
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,960
I'm curious if it really feels that way.

2335
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,360
- I wanted to ask you that.
- That is because...

2336
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:41,690
when you get older, by the time you get to our age,

2337
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:45,229
we feel like we don't have long left.

2338
01:32:45,230 --> 01:32:46,669
We think the time we've lived is longer than the time we have left.

2339
01:32:46,670 --> 01:32:48,100
- And we become impatient.
- Right.

2340
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:50,339
That's why you think that way.

2341
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,469
(Due to impatience, the time left feels shorter.)

2342
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:53,770
That's why we think time passes faster.

2343
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:56,779
You feel you're getting older physically.

2344
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:57,880
But you don't know it yet.

2345
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:00,380
But you know this after your mid-forties.

2346
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,080
Then...

2347
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:05,080
you only get to think about yourself.

2348
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:07,190
You become more self-centered.

2349
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:09,120
That's why you become old-fashioned.

2350
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:12,189
What's an old-fashioned person? You have self-oriented thoughts.

2351
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:13,390
That's what an old-fashioned person is.

2352
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,660
That's why you think that way.

2353
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:20,269
- That's why.
- You become impatient.

2354
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:21,970
It's quite psychological.

2355
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:26,270
I think I thought about it this way.

2356
01:33:27,210 --> 01:33:30,740
Everything is new when you're younger,

2357
01:33:31,110 --> 01:33:34,050
and every day is fun.

2358
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:37,450
But the older you get, you become insensible.

2359
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:40,690
- But you only become that way.
- Right.

2360
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:42,590
Every time I saw my father,

2361
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:46,830
I thought, "What fun does he have in life?"

2362
01:33:47,630 --> 01:33:49,760
He used to come home late after drinking,

2363
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:52,830
but the older he got, the faster he came home.

2364
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:55,670
Even when he drank, he'd come home early.

2365
01:33:57,140 --> 01:34:00,170
And I thought, "What fun does he have in life?"

2366
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:03,879
But when I think about it, he's similar to me now.

2367
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:06,980
(I'm living just like he did now.)

2368
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:12,589
But what you think is fun changes...

2369
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:14,690
as you get older.

2370
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,920
And you continuously find out new joys in life.

2371
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:19,760
And I think you have to find joys that fit your age.

2372
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:24,029
But is it that as you get older,

2373
01:34:24,030 --> 01:34:25,530
you get to like team dinners more?

2374
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:28,499
(Laughing)

2375
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,569
No...

2376
01:34:29,570 --> 01:34:32,770
- Here's why I'm asking this.
- Yes?

2377
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:37,379
Sometimes there are sets where I'm the oldest.

2378
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,740
- Right.
- Already?

2379
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:40,810
- There is.
- You?

2380
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,850
- Already?
- Yes.

2381
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,949
Even in "The Manipulated," in fact...

2382
01:34:45,950 --> 01:34:48,819
I am older than Kyung Soo and Yoon Su.

2383
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:50,619
Kwang Soo only appears briefly.

2384
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:52,629
So among the people who worked together,

2385
01:34:52,630 --> 01:34:54,190
I was the oldest.

2386
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,359
If there were other older people, after the shoot,

2387
01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,670
as the younger one, I could ask, "Are you going for a drink?"

2388
01:35:01,230 --> 01:35:02,640
But when I'm the older one,

2389
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:05,139
- You can't.
- I can't ask.

2390
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:06,709
- "Shall we go out to eat?" - I can understand.

2391
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:08,969
Or "Shall we go for a drink after work?"

2392
01:35:08,970 --> 01:35:10,939
- If I ask such a thing...
- Right.

2393
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:13,009
- it could...
- It might burden them...

2394
01:35:13,010 --> 01:35:15,449
- They might come unwillingly.
- Yes, I'm uncomfortable...

2395
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:17,349
to make them come unwillingly.

2396
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:19,319
Such a situation makes me uncomfortable.

2397
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,890
- I don't ask at all.
- Right.

2398
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:22,589
- I just can't ask.
- Right.

2399
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:24,890
I don't think that's because you like team dinners.

2400
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,359
Don't you just like having a meal with the people you work with?

2401
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:31,229
But I also...

2402
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:33,430
- Doesn't it grow on you?
- Yes. Team dinners...

2403
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:38,100
But that's because it's nice to eat a meal...

2404
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,939
- with the people you work with.
- Yes. That's right.

2405
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:41,469
- I mean, team dinners...
- And be on good terms with them.

2406
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,110
- I want to have team dinners.
- I know.

2407
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:45,810
(Proud)

2408
01:35:46,110 --> 01:35:48,449
For me...

2409
01:35:48,450 --> 01:35:52,990
I still feel weird having people call me "senior."

2410
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:54,790
- I feel strange now.
- Right.

2411
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:57,490
You'll start to like team dinners, too.

2412
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:02,030
In fact, I go to another team dinner after this.

2413
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,899
(The team dinner fanatic has another after party lined up.)

2414
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,430
- The team dinner fanatic.
- Right. You need to go right after.

2415
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,029
Honestly, I'm looking forward to the dinner.

2416
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:10,470
(The team dinner fanatic is having butterflies already.)

2417
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,409
I'm curious about the turnout of the dinner today.

2418
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:15,769
When I shoot something, I have a team dinner every day.

2419
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,410
(The team dinner night deepened with their honest conversations.)

2420
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,479
(How was today?)

2421
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,880
Did I do anything today...

2422
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,580
that I wanted to do?

2423
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:30,160
(The day's memory passes by.)

2424
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:33,030
(Moist eyes)

2425
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:35,729
About eight percent.

2426
01:36:35,730 --> 01:36:38,130
(About 8 percent)

2427
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:42,130
Right. I think we did around that much.

2428
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,600
It's a little shame to say ten percent.

2429
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:47,869
I only want the elders to come as My Stars.

2430
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:50,010
(I only want the elders to come as My Stars.)

2431
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:53,049
Such as Lee Soon Jae and Shin Gu.

2432
01:36:53,050 --> 01:36:54,150
(The demand to take care of Grandpas and Grandmas)

2433
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:55,779
Well...

2434
01:36:55,780 --> 01:36:56,879
(What would you like to tell the next My Star?)

2435
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:57,920
Be careful.

2436
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:01,950
Be careful. But I'd like to say...

2437
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,520
But I'd like to say...

2438
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,090
that you have to say what you want to say.

2439
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,799
I regret that I couldn't say...

2440
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,100
the things I wanted to say today.

2441
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,669
I'd like you to say what you want to say.

2442
01:37:13,670 --> 01:37:14,730
(Another regretful person)

2443
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:16,640
I'm going to buck up the courage now.

2444
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,970
- Say it towards them over there.
- No, from tomorrow.

2445
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:24,210
Starting from tomorrow.

2446
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,480
Starting from tomorrow,

2447
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,309
I'm going to buck up the courage.

2448
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:30,049
(Look forward to seeing courageous Doh Kyung Soo.)

2449
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:31,449
(From tomorrow)

2450
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:33,789
Starting from tomorrow. I'll be brave from tomorrow.

2451
01:37:33,790 --> 01:37:37,760
I'm growling, growling, growling Is this it?

2452
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,690
Go, Kyung Soo.

2453
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:44,060
Please tell us the title of the drama series you're in.

2454
01:37:44,430 --> 01:37:46,429
- And say you want the viewers to...
- It's not a drama series.

2455
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:47,469
What was it?

2456
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:49,970
It's a Disney Plus original series.

2457
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:53,210
(For promotional caretaking, you have Grumpy Secretary.)

2458
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:55,170
"The Manipulated."

2459
01:37:55,270 --> 01:37:57,409
"The Manipulated," right?

2460
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:59,580
"The Manipulated," yes. It's right.

2461
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:02,450
You know what a PC is?

2462
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,950
- A portrait.
- Oh, gosh.

2463
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:09,390
- Hey.
- Stop it now.

2464
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:11,160
Stop now.

2465
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:16,630
He himself is making me mentally tired.

2466
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,530
I'm really tired.

2467
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:22,429
(Grumpy Secretary...)

2468
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:24,370
(is meeting an inferno.)

2469
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,510
(U-Know Yunho)

2470
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:29,439
Let's show why I'm U-Know Yunho...

2471
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,440
definitely on stage.

2472
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,580
(We'll show why we are the Grumpy Secretary.)

2473
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:36,650
(My Star has started a new regular lesson.)

2474
01:38:37,480 --> 01:38:39,990
(Take care of him.)

2475
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:42,689
(Half-century-old managers' caretaking story for Music Shows)

2476
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:45,820
We usually check drinks and such...

2477
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:49,500
(Endless coffee)

2478
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,860
I think I need to do a challenge.

2479
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,170
(Endless challenges)

2480
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:59,809
(Clumsy and hectic Caretaker Fairy)

2481
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:02,840
(Endless passion)

2482
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,340
(Being drained of energy in real time)

2483
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,580
If there's one thing that is harmful for the body,

2484
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:09,110
it's passion.

2485
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,749
Who is this?

2486
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:12,989
(A lifesaver makes her appearance.)

2487
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:15,990
(Can she save the Grumpy Secretary from endless lessons?)

2488
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:21,390
