(A building in Bucheon where they'll meet My Star)

2
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:21,927
You put effort into your outfit today.

3
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,457
But your outfit looks worse when you put effort into it.

4
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,787
I put effort into it.

5
00:00:24,788 --> 00:00:25,957
It looks worse when you do that.

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,527
Why do you say that? Don't I look nice?

7
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,768
(He put a lot of effort into his fancy outfit of the day.)

8
00:00:28,843 --> 00:00:30,283
Isn't this his building?

9
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,067
- Why are we filming here?
- Hey.

10
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,498
- That'd be nice.
- What?

11
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,237
My mom...

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,138
always praises him.

13
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,408
What does she say?

14
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:42,407
"A man from a rich family sure is different."

15
00:00:42,408 --> 00:00:43,877
(A man from a rich family sure is different.)

16
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,718
"A man from a rich family sure is different."

17
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:48,417
I hear that all the time.

18
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:51,417
"A man from a poor family sure is different."

19
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,688
(A man from a poor family sure is different.)

20
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:56,728
"A man who was raised well sure is different."

21
00:00:56,828 --> 00:00:58,288
- She says that.
- Right.

22
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,227
(Here's the thing about today's My Star.)

23
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,927

24
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:07,297

25
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:11,168
(He debuted in 1965 and became Korea's Eternal Crush.)

26
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:16,007
(He's called Korea's Elvis Presley.)

27
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,377

29
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,047
He's at the top.

00:01:24,048 --> 00:01:25,118
- He's at the top.
- Yes.

31
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:26,258
He's at the top.

32
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,958
He has a great reputation.

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,728
He's well-respected among his juniors.

34
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:35,028
In the music industry,

35
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,467
he's the biggest senior.

36
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:38,738

(The living legend who welcomed his 60th anniversary)

38
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:50,278

I want to keep on singing...

45

as long as I can.

46
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:11,728
(He still has it.)

(Eternal Crush, My Star, Nam Jin)

50
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,117
There's a bit of pain.

51
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:30,187
(My Star is getting his leg treated near the concert venue.)

52
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:31,688
That's refreshing.

53
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,688
It's uncomfortable.

54
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,488
Now that I'm old, it begins to hurt.

55
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:38,228
In a day, I had four shows...

56
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,398
and ran around for eight hours.

57
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,568
So I had to receive a leg massage even in my younger days.

58
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,738
I hurt my left leg back in the day.

59
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,467
I see. Your left leg?

60
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,308
I got stabbed.

61
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:51,637

- Yes.

62
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,938
(You got stabbed?)

63
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,347
A knife entered through here.

64
00:02:55,348 --> 00:02:56,507
- Here?
- Yes.

65
00:02:56,508 --> 00:02:57,977
- It entered through the back...
- The back.

66
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:59,278
and stuck out at the front.

Hello.

76
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:25,067

Hello.

- Okay.
- We'll wait.

86

- Wait a bit longer.
- Okay.

87
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,157
- I'll be out once I'm done. Okay.
- Okay.

92

Hello.

93
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,068
I'll relay the duties before he comes out.

- Okay.

98
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:08,717
(Today is My Star's concert day.)

99
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:10,847
- Thus, please manage the fans...
- What does it mean,

"His driver will change after 50 years?"

101
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:15,557
(Since his driver will change after 50 years, be extra careful.)

102
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:17,027
There's a driver...

103
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:20,057
- he has worked with...
- All his life?

104
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:22,097
- for 48 years.
- Is there such a driver?

105
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:24,327
- They work together.
- His driver never changed.

106
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:26,867
- It has always been him.
- Yes, it has always been him.

107
00:04:26,868 --> 00:04:28,167
Oh, no. Will you be okay?

108
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,367
- I'll be driving.
- Today,

109
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:32,838
he'll ride someone else's car for the very first time.

Welcome.

114
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,718
- Nice to meet you.
- My goodness.

115
00:04:42,788 --> 00:04:44,748
- Seo Jin and Kwang Kyu.
- Nice to meet you.

116
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,758
- Oh, my.
- Yes.

117
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,117
You guys are handsome.

118
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:50,127
(You guys are handsome.)

119
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,657
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

120
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,797
Today,

121
00:04:52,798 --> 00:04:56,398
I got handsome men as secretaries for the first time.

122
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:57,967
I'm flustered.

123
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:00,368
Please don't be. You can treat us with ease.

124
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:03,068
- Think of us as your servants.
- What?

125
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:04,568
It's nothing.

126
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:08,208
I remember seeing you on TV back in the day.

127
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,448
You starred in a comedy show and said,

128
00:05:11,608 --> 00:05:13,318
"What does your dad do for a living?"

129
00:05:13,448 --> 00:05:14,977
"What does your dad do for a living?"

130
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:16,817
I remember watching that.

131
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:19,017
- I see. Thank you.
- It was entertaining.

132
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,217
I'll do my best today.

133
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:23,088
Sir, why did you come to a massage place today?

134
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:25,027
My left leg is in poor shape.

135
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:26,698
It's a long story.

136
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:28,797
- There was an incident.
- Right. I know about it.

137
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:29,967
- So...
- I know about it.

138
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:31,827
- Was it your left leg?
- Now that...

139
00:05:31,828 --> 00:05:32,838
(That's right. There was an incident.)

140
00:05:32,898 --> 00:05:35,807
I'm old and the weather is cold,

141
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:37,637
my circulation isn't the same.

142
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,978
- Your legs cramp and bloat.
- Yes.

143
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:42,007
When I have a concert,

144
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,978
- I need to shake my legs a lot.
- Yes.

145
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:45,647
You came here to stretch the muscles.

146
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:47,877
I stretched the leg muscles to do well today.

147
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:49,548
- It was for circulation.
- Yes.

148
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:52,717
You look so young in real life.

149
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,787
Me?

150
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,258
- I know how old you are.
- Really?

151
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:57,728
Sir,

152
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:00,457
I'm close to Baek Il Seop.

153
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,197
- Il Seop?
- Yes.

154
00:06:02,198 --> 00:06:05,367
I was on multiple traveling shows with him.

155
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:06,897
You were on those shows with him.

156
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,768
I was on 5 to 6 shows with him.

157
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,337
Wasn't it hard?

158
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:13,937
It was a bit hard at first since I didn't know him well.

159
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,807
But as I spent more time with him,

160
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,578
- I learned how caring he was.
- Right.

161
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:18,777
- He's different when you know him.
- Yes.

162
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:19,977
- The more I know him, - When you don't know him...

163
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,017
the more I care about him.

164
00:06:21,018 --> 00:06:24,348
He has a homely and stuffy image.

165
00:06:24,488 --> 00:06:25,817
But he's a bit sensitive.

166
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,057
Isn't he like that at first?

167
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:29,227
He became angry on the first day.

168
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,027
- I know what he's like.
- Yes.

169
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:33,297
- We're very close.
- Yes.

170
00:06:33,298 --> 00:06:35,997
He talks about you a lot...

171
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:36,998
when he drinks. He likes to drink.

172
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,698
- We're very close.
- Yes.

173
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,238
He likes you a lot.

174
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:41,937
He's scary at first.

175
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:43,737
I met him on a movie set.

176
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:45,577
- He was a fighter back in the day.
- Yes.

177
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:47,577
(That's right.)

178
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:49,977
His first comment was strongly worded.

179
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:51,977
- He likes to drink.
- Yes.

180
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,278
He's very affectionate.

181
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:54,618
He often talked about this.

182
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:56,588
- He's only a year older than you.
- Yes.

183
00:06:56,848 --> 00:07:00,258
Because he took CSAT one more time, he was in the same class as you.

184
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,987
But you always treated him as an older brother.

185
00:07:02,988 --> 00:07:05,087
- He's a senior from my hometown.
- Yes. So...

186
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:07,258
Had he come from a different town, I would've talked casually.

187
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:10,198
Il Seop's friends are my friends.

188
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:12,297
- Jo Young Nam.
- That's right.

189
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,398
That punk and Il Seop are from the same class.

190
00:07:14,638 --> 00:07:16,137
- Same class in high school.
- They went to the same high school.

191
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:18,408
- Young Nam and I are close.
- Yes.

192
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,777
- And Young Nam and Il Seop are too.
- Yes.

193
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:23,308
But you shouldn't mistreat a senior from your hometown.

194
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:25,048
It's a rule.

195
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,048
- He praised you a lot.
- I see.

196
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,117
Among the three, you look the healthiest...

197
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,488
- and youngest.
- Really?

198
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:33,387
- I don't drink.
- That must be why.

199
00:07:33,388 --> 00:07:34,787
- That helped me a lot.
- I see.

200
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,088
(He's the healthiest among people in their 80s.)

201
00:07:36,128 --> 00:07:38,258
- It's time to leave.
- Okay.

202
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,958
Grab Mr. Nam Jin's phone and outerwear.

203
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:43,897
(Seo Jin is used to taking care of an elderly.)

204
00:07:43,898 --> 00:07:45,127
My goodness.

205
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:46,968
(Seo Jin is used to taking care of an elderly.)

206
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,467
Don't forget Mr. Nam Jin's phone.

207
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,238
- I'll take his phone.
- Let's go.

208
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:56,007
- I saw you driving on a show.
- As for me,

209
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,178
- I began driving at a young age.
- Right.

210
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:01,878
- It was a white car.
- In 1953, my dad had...

211
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,988
a Ford for work.

212
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:05,958
There were two imported cars in the entire Jeolla Province.

213
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:09,158
The governor had 1, and my dad had 1.

214
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,857
That was when I rode the car.

215
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,998
- Did you drive then?
- Yes. But...

216
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:14,797
I couldn't drive since I was a child.

217
00:08:14,798 --> 00:08:16,998
I sat on the driver's lap...

218
00:08:17,398 --> 00:08:19,397
and put my hands on the wheel.

219
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,597
The driver stepped on the pedals...

220
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:22,198
and I just steered the wheel.

221
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:24,138
I was in elementary school.

222
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:26,007
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

223
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:27,878
(Looking after him in a detailed manner)

224
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:32,277
(Groaning)

225
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,348
(Safety check)

226
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:34,747
Close the other door too.

227
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,187
(After closing the doors,)

228
00:08:36,188 --> 00:08:38,248
(Seo Jin gets in.)

229
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,118
Are we going to the citizens' center?

230
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:41,917
The Grand Hall of Bucheon Citizens' Hall.

231
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:42,958
Okay.

232
00:08:44,588 --> 00:08:47,898
(The new driver turns the wheel carefully.)

233
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:49,597
(Watching carefully)

234
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:50,898
At what age did you begin to drive?

235
00:08:51,768 --> 00:08:53,997
I began late after completing my military service.

236
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,197
Was that when you became a taxi driver?

237
00:08:55,198 --> 00:08:57,768
Yes, I spent six years in the military.

238
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,877
He was Sergeant First Class.

239
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:00,937
You become Sergeant 1st Class after serving for 6 years.

240
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:02,207
- In our time, - He was a career soldier.

241
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,808
we served for three years. Thirty-six months.

242
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:07,777
You even extended your time when you were dispatched to Vietnam.

243
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,588
Yes. You couldn't stay in a war zone for more than a year.

244
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,518
You couldn't do that if you were a low-rank soldier.

245
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:14,817
After completing two years of my military service,

246
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:18,058
I said I'd stay in Vietnam and spend the last year.

247
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:20,828
So I spent 1 year in Korea and 24 months in Vietnam.

248
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:22,528
Then I got discharged.

249
00:09:23,068 --> 00:09:25,267
Why did you do that?

250
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:27,068
I had a year left until discharge.

251
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:29,967
Instead of killing my time in Korea,

252
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,937
I wanted to complete my military service in a war zone,

253
00:09:32,938 --> 00:09:34,078
and go back to being a singer.

254
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,547
I was like that as a youth.

255
00:09:36,548 --> 00:09:37,647
I wouldn't make the same decision now.

256
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:38,648
(My Star was full of spirits in his youth.)

257
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,147
Every night,

258
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:42,388
bullets flew.

259
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:44,888
Many people died.

260
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:47,917
There's a place called Hoi An next to Da Nang.

261
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:50,057
It's a huge vacation spot now.

262
00:09:50,058 --> 00:09:52,287
- That's right. There...
- I was there recently.

263
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:54,597
I went back after 54 years.

264
00:09:54,598 --> 00:09:57,267
- It's a huge vacation spot now.
- Yes.

265
00:09:57,268 --> 00:10:00,297
It's nothing like what I remember. I went to the place I used to be.

266
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:01,998
It became a huge vacation spot.

267
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:04,437
It's the most popular vacation spot among Koreans.

268
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:07,277
Back then, a soldier couldn't go out without a gun.

269
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:08,378
Right.

270
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:11,177
You know that he hurt his leg, right?

271
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,408
- Yes.
- There was...

272
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,177
- a stabbing incident.
- Yes.

273
00:10:15,178 --> 00:10:16,247
That incident...

274
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,848
But he even had a meal with the culprit.

275
00:10:20,088 --> 00:10:21,088
Recently?

276
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:23,727
(Did he have a meal with the person who stabbed him?)

277
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:26,128
It couldn't have been easy to meet someone like that.

278
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:29,197
We meet once every few years.

279
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:30,397
Was he...

280
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:33,037
- a gangster?
- Of course.

281
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:34,337
He was a scary gangster.

282
00:10:34,338 --> 00:10:35,697
(Here's a story of him and the scary gangster.)

283
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,137
- He was like that back then.
- I see.

284
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:40,137
- Aortas run through the body.
- That's right.

285
00:10:40,138 --> 00:10:42,377
Two aortas come from the heart and run through...

286
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:43,507
- the left and right sides.
- Yes.

287
00:10:43,508 --> 00:10:45,378
If a knife touches it, you die in three minutes.

288
00:10:45,448 --> 00:10:47,148
- You lose too much blood.
- So...

289
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,618
had the knife moved by 1mm or 2mm,

290
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:53,188
I wouldn't have been able to star in this show.

291
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:55,758
Still, I'm grateful...

292
00:10:56,358 --> 00:10:57,788
that I didn't become an invalid.

293
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:02,258
It's good for both parties that I lived.

294
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,567
Meeting up and having a meal with someone...

295
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:07,497
who stabbed you is an extraordinary feat.

296
00:11:07,498 --> 00:11:09,337
Of course. It isn't easy to do something like that.

297
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:10,838
But I have my reasons for doing that.

298
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,578
His life has completely changed.

299
00:11:14,478 --> 00:11:17,608
You'd be surprised by his immense faith.

300
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:20,077
- He became a Christian.
- Yes.

301
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:21,218
- How fascinating.
- Yes.

302
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,417
- I guess that's fate.
- Yes.

303
00:11:23,418 --> 00:11:25,858
We had a meal together a few days ago.

304
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,117
(Laughing)

305
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,427
People would laugh.

306
00:11:29,428 --> 00:11:30,487
(Nam Jin forgave him after seeing how much he had changed.)

307
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:32,388
When we were young,

308
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:34,927
there were rumors about...

309
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,268
how you and Na Hoon A fought.

310
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:39,437
- There were many such rumors.
- It was like that back then.

311
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:40,937
That didn't happen.

312
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:43,907
When Na Hoon A got a wound on his face,

313
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:45,437
people talked about how I was behind it.

314
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,508
- I even got investigated.
- Okay.

315
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:49,747
You know how the prosecution has the Special Investigation Unit?

316
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,508
I had to go there.

317
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:56,617
A special prosecutor took me to the Special Investigation Unit.

318
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:57,748
I took a seat.

319
00:11:58,088 --> 00:12:00,417
After 3 to 5 minutes of questioning,

320
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,917
he told me to go.

321
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:02,987
(He wasn't behind the incident, so he was immediately let go.)

322
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,658
There was that misunderstanding.

323
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:08,197
There were many rumors back then.

324
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:10,468
"They fight every time they meet."

325
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:12,998
- There were so many rumors.
- Yes.

326
00:12:13,868 --> 00:12:15,137
We're here.

327
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:16,338
(12pm, Getting ready for the concert in the waiting room)

328
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:18,707
(At which venue...)

329
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,578
(will the 60th Anniversary Concert take place?)

330
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:26,248
(The 29th city of the nationwide tour, Bucheon)

331
00:12:27,148 --> 00:12:31,918
(He began in Jeonju in March, 2025.)

332
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:38,728
("Nam Jin Will Tour 30 Cities to Celebrate His 60th Anniversary")

333
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,527
(He traveled around the nation to meet the fans...)

334
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,298
(for his 60th anniversary.)

335
00:12:46,668 --> 00:12:49,838
(To pay back for Eternal Crush's love,)

336
00:12:50,038 --> 00:12:55,178
(fans fill the venue today as well.)

337
00:12:57,148 --> 00:12:58,747
(60th Anniversary Nationwide Tour Concert, Nam Jin)

338
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:02,318
(Nam Jin is here!)

339
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:04,988
How many concerts have you had during this tour?

340
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,587
I think I've had about 20.

341
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:10,787
The tour has gone on for a year.

342
00:13:10,788 --> 00:13:12,658
That's right. It'll go on until the end of the year.

343
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:14,728
When I perform, I have...

344
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,698
the most amount of fun.

345
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:20,898
I don't know that feeling since I'm not a singer.

346
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,567
- But everyone says that.
- Don't you have fun when you act?

347
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:26,678
I do. But actors usually stand before the cameras,

348
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:29,278
not the audience.

349
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,807
- Right. It's a bit different.
- We don't have a live performance.

350
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:32,948
That's right.

351
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:35,147
We can redo things if we mess up.

352
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,447
- I see. We can't do that.
- Singers can't do that.

353
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,587
I've filmed many movies.

354
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:41,118
- Do you know that?
- Yes. You've filmed so many movies.

355
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:42,588
It has its charms.

356
00:13:42,658 --> 00:13:44,727
- Being a singer, that is.
- I think it has many more charms.

357
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:45,787
- It's realistic.
- Yes.

358
00:13:45,788 --> 00:13:47,328
- I think it has many more charms.
- Yes.

359
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:51,267
(They move to the dark backstage area.)

360
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:52,527
Be careful, sir. There are stairs.

361
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:54,938
- Okay.
- Please go to the right.

362
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,968
- There are stairs.
- There are stairs.

363
00:13:58,038 --> 00:14:01,278
- Why is it so dark?
- We're on the stage.

364
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,878
(He turns on the flashlight to look after My Star.)

365
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:08,648
The waiting room is right next to the stage.

366
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:12,248
- Hello.
- Hello.

367
00:14:13,488 --> 00:14:15,317
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

368
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:16,428
Hello.

369
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:18,887
She must be the makeup artist.

370
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,598
- She does hair and makeup.
- She's my stylist.

371
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,297
- I'm seeing actual celebrities.
- What?

372
00:14:23,298 --> 00:14:26,537
Mr. Nam Jin doesn't seem like one because he's so homely.

373
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:28,467
- He's the biggest celebrity.
- My goodness.

374
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,708
(He's the biggest celebrity among celebrities.)

375
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:31,867
(This singer who has been around for 60 years...)

376
00:14:31,868 --> 00:14:33,478
(doesn't seem like a celebrity.)

377
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:36,548
Secretary Lee,

378
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:39,447
I personally think you look much better...

379
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:40,748
in real life.

380
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:43,717
It's what I personally think.

381
00:14:43,718 --> 00:14:45,517
You look much better in real life.

382
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,188
- And as for Secretary Kim, - Secretary Kim.

383
00:14:50,028 --> 00:14:51,057
I think...

384
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,228
(I look much better in real life too, right?)

385
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:54,057
you have unique charms.

386
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:57,597
(You have unique charms.)

387
00:14:57,598 --> 00:14:58,598
Hold on.

388
00:14:59,128 --> 00:15:00,967
(The celebrity with unique charms)

389
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:01,968
Hold on.

390
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:04,338
(Laughing)

391
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:07,278
You're charming.

392
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:08,508
Thank you.

393
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,207
I guess I don't look better...

394
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,277
or more handsome in real life.

395
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:14,718
- I'm just charming. Thank you.
- When I see you on the screen...

396
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,148
You must've learned new things while being a secretary...

397
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,658
on the show.

398
00:15:19,888 --> 00:15:22,927
- You haven't been one before.
- That's right.

399
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:24,257
Director is here...

400
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,157
- to say hello.
- Come on in.

401
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,728
Director, come on in.

402
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:31,327
- Hello.
- Hello.

403
00:15:31,328 --> 00:15:33,768
- He's the concert director.
- Okay.

404
00:15:34,098 --> 00:15:36,267
Is there anything we need to know?

405
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,608
After you say your introduction,

406
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:43,077
please introduce Mr. Nam Jin.

407
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:45,348
There will be curtains.

408
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,677
Once the curtains go up, Mr. Nam Jin will enter.

409
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,847
Will the 2 of them take the stage 1st...

410
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,487
- and host the show?
- Yes.

411
00:15:51,488 --> 00:15:52,547
Will the 2 of them take the stage 1st...

412
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:53,987
- and host the show?
- Yes.

413
00:15:53,988 --> 00:15:55,418
- Us?
- Us?

414
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:59,288
- Host the show?
- There's a guest for the opening.

415
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,597
- Since you're here...
- That's right.

416
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:03,427
Would you please do that?

417
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:04,467
Okay.

418
00:16:04,468 --> 00:16:06,668
- This is a special concert.
- Okay.

419
00:16:07,238 --> 00:16:10,708
If Secretary Lee and Secretary Kim host the opening,

420
00:16:10,768 --> 00:16:12,167
it'll look cool.

421
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:13,578
- I see.
- Yes.

422
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:15,607
So we'll introduce Mr. Nam Jin...

423
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,078
- during the opening.
- Yes.

424
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,378
(Chuckling)

425
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:21,347
- Then...
- It's nothing big.

426
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,217
(They quickly go over the opening script.)

427
00:16:23,218 --> 00:16:24,848
Is it same? No?

428
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:27,518
What? There are so many lines.

429
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:30,828
But Kwang Kyu and I...

430
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:34,157
aren't good at hosting.

431
00:16:34,158 --> 00:16:36,867
Your very presence will excite the audience.

432
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:39,938
I'd love to introduce Mr. Nam Jin, but...

433
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:42,297
Can you do something like this?

434
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:43,767
- You do it.
- Okay.

435
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:47,077
When you're done with the comments,

436
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:49,877
please have the audience cheer...

437
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:52,977
- and liven up the atmosphere.
- Okay.

438
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,117
Then the curtains will rise...

439
00:16:55,118 --> 00:16:56,817
and Mr. Nam Jin will enter.

440
00:16:56,818 --> 00:16:59,188
I'd be so grateful.

441
00:16:59,248 --> 00:17:02,617
You know what today's concert is for, right?

442
00:17:02,618 --> 00:17:04,327
- The 60th anniversary.
- It's for the 60th anniversary.

443
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:06,157
- It's a meaningful concert, - Okay.

444
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,197
- so please do well.
- Okay.

445
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:09,497
- Please make an effort.
- Okay.

446
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:11,268
(My secretaries, please make an effort.)

447
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:16,508
(We have no experience in hosting. Will we be able to do well?)

448
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,968
(Coming soon)

449
00:17:20,178 --> 00:17:21,637
- Say hello.
- Hello.

450
00:17:21,638 --> 00:17:23,077
Can I get a scream?

451
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:25,048
(Don't say things like that.)

452
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:27,918
(Hosting without a problem)

453
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:29,987
(Poking)

454
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:31,187
(What do you want me to do?)

455
00:17:31,188 --> 00:17:32,747
(Keep going! Do something!)

456
00:17:32,748 --> 00:17:35,357
(Don't just look at the script!)

457
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:36,587
Hey, the comments overlap.

458
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:40,798
(They begin to fight like a couple at My Star's concert venue.)

459
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:44,227
(We don't have much time!)

460
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:45,597
Call for him loudly!

461
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:47,097
(What will happen...)

462
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:51,768
(at Nam Jin's 60th Anniversary Concert?)

463
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,877
(He can't take his eyes off of the script.)

464
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:57,107
Sir, you'll sing "Hound Dog" today as well.

465
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:58,648
Yes. "Houng Dog."

466
00:17:59,248 --> 00:18:00,617
You know the song, "Hound Dog."

467
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:02,877
- It's a song by Elvis.
- Elvis.

468
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:05,548
"Love Me Tender," "Hound Dog..."

469
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,057
- The early albums.
- What?

470
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:09,258
- Elvis' early albums.
- That's right.

471
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,157
Elvis Presley has many cool songs.

472
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:14,227
Did you watch the movie about him that came out a few years ago?

473
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:16,727
- I watched it, of course.
- Really?

474
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,498
- He was my idol.
- I see.

475
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,337
(My Star's jukebox, "One Night" by Elvis Presley)

476
00:18:20,338 --> 00:18:22,137
Dan dan dan dan dan dan dan.

477
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:24,808
One night with you

478
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,508
It drives me crazy.

479
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,337
I love songs like "One Night,"

480
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:30,307
- "Hound Dog," "Jailhouse Rock..."
- "Jailhouse Rock."

481
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,448
"Jailhouse Rock."

482
00:18:31,948 --> 00:18:36,017
Were pop songs popular in your college days?

483
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:37,788
- Of course.
- In my middle school days.

484
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:39,447
- In your middle school days?
- In my middle school days.

485
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,987
After the Korean War, U.S. Eighth Army was stationed in Korea.

486
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,358
Do we need to go back to the Korean War?

487
00:18:43,528 --> 00:18:46,297
- Of course. It was after the war.
- Okay.

488
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:48,157
I was in middle school...

489
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,368
when I listened to a pop song for the first time.

490
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:53,798
I went to school, and my friend sang, "Oh, Carol"

491
00:18:54,638 --> 00:18:57,338
It sounded interesting. It was my very first pop song.

492
00:18:57,438 --> 00:19:00,107
"Hey, what's that song?"

493
00:19:00,108 --> 00:19:02,708
- It was "Oh! Carol" by Neil Sedaka.
- Neil Sedaka.

494
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,847
It was "Oh! Carol."

495
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:06,877
It was my first time listening to that song.

496
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,048
(My Star's jukebox, "Oh! Carol" by Neil Sedaka)

497
00:19:08,178 --> 00:19:11,348
So I went to an LP record store, and bought one for "Oh! Carol."

498
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:13,358
At that LP record store, I found...

499
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:16,657
- "Diana" by Paul Anka.
- "Diana."

500
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:17,927
I'm so young and you're

501
00:19:17,928 --> 00:19:19,158
- That song.
- Yes.

502
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:22,698
I also found "Too Young" by Nat King Cole.

503
00:19:23,398 --> 00:19:27,037
They try to tell us we're too young

504
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:28,138
He sang that song.

505
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:32,237
Nat King Cole was an African American jazz singer.

506
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,607
- He's famous.
- Yes.

507
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,308
"Mona Lisa," "Too Young..."

508
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,007
I listened to those LP records then.

509
00:19:38,008 --> 00:19:41,778
After school, I listened to pop songs until I went to bed.

510
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,417
It was before The Beatles.

511
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:46,557
- Of course.
- That was the era.

512
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,887
- I didn't like The Beatles.
- Right.

513
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,127
- I liked Elvis.
- Elvis.

514
00:19:50,128 --> 00:19:52,728
I liked Elvis' songs like "Love Me Tender..."

515
00:19:52,888 --> 00:19:54,028
and "Hound Dog."

516
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:58,498
It wasn't easy to listen to pop songs back in his time.

517
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:01,638
He could listen to foreign songs since he was from a rich family.

518
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,038
His family had a TV, so he watched AFKN.

519
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,438
I also watched AFKN a lot when I was young.

520
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,878
Although we're from different generations,

521
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,787
we're similar in how...

522
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:19,318
we loved and listened to foreign songs.

523
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,617
Do you know which Korean movie was popular back then?

524
00:20:22,618 --> 00:20:24,027
"Barefooted Youth."

525
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:26,187
"Barefooted Youth" starring Shin Seong Il and Um Aing Ran...

526
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:28,358
became a hit.

527
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,627
The theme song was...

528
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,127
- "Barefooted Youth."
- "Barefooted Youth."

529
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:33,697
That theme song...

530
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:39,778
(My Star's jukebox, "Barefooted Youth" by Choi Hee Joon)

531
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:43,648
Tears and sighs

532
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:47,117
- Tears and sighs - That's "Barefooted Youth."

533
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:48,548
I see.

534
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:53,858
(Full of the jazz vibe)

535
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:04,598
(Trot, rock, disco, and twist)

536
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:08,638
(My Star challenged himself to various genres,)

537
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:17,078
(and became a genre in and of himself.)

538
00:21:17,678 --> 00:21:20,377
I didn't think of Mr. Nam Jin as a trot singer.

539
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:23,018
He doesn't have the singing style of a trot singer.

540
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:27,557
His songs have many pop elements.

541
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:29,518
There are many old pop elements.

542
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:31,088
His singing style reflects that.

543
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:35,428
So I enjoy listening to his songs.

544
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:38,068
Nam Jin, we're here.

545
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:40,098
Nam Jin.

546
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,907
- Nam Jin.
- Nam Jin, we're here.

547
00:21:43,908 --> 00:21:44,968
Hey.

548
00:21:45,808 --> 00:21:47,708
- Nam Jin.
- Nam Jin.

549
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:50,748
Hello.

550
00:21:51,348 --> 00:21:52,947
- Nam Jin.
- Welcome.

551
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:55,117
Have you been well?

552
00:21:55,118 --> 00:21:56,647
When did you come back?

553
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,917
We flew in from Malaysia...

554
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,217
- on Saturday.
- It must've been hard.

555
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,458
(They inquire after each other.)

556
00:22:00,688 --> 00:22:03,527
- It's good to see you.
- You're wearing nice clothes.

557
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:04,828
I dressed up.

558
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:06,857
- Okay.
- Shall we put it here?

559
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,057
Put it there.

560
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:09,197
(Confused)

561
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:11,428
My goodness. You're here.

562
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,338
What's this?

563
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:19,137
(They've remained unchanged for 60 years.)

564
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,607
(They're Korea's first fandom.)

565
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:23,878
I met my fans when they were teenage girls.

566
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:26,278
They've protected me for 60 years.

567
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:29,647
It's a special relationship.

568
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,618
(They began the culture of giving gifts to the celebrity.)

569
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:36,588
(They're the biggest fans who led the fan culture of Korea.)

570
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:39,257
(This fandom boasts of 50 years of tradition.)

571
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,898
(Jin Love)

572
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:46,428
(Jin Love members came to the waiting room.)

573
00:22:48,898 --> 00:22:49,907
All right.

574
00:22:49,908 --> 00:22:52,207
- Welcome.
- They're my secretaries.

575
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,777
- He's Secretary Lee Seo Jin.
- Okay.

576
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:55,937
- He's Secretary Kim Kwang Kyu.
- Hello.

577
00:22:55,938 --> 00:22:57,077
- Hello.
- Hello.

578
00:22:57,078 --> 00:22:58,207
I'm Secretary Kim.

579
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:00,577
- Nice to meet you.
- We're in your care today.

580
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,248
They're the new recruits.

581
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:03,918
Go along with it.

582
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:06,487
(Choi Jin Hee, Age 68)

583
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:09,018
Can we leave things to the secretaries?

584
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:10,557
- To the secretaries?
- Yes.

585
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,457
(Please leave things to us!)

586
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:15,627
Please help us with what we've brought.

587
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,397
- Of course.
- Come on over.

588
00:23:17,398 --> 00:23:19,768
Shall we prepare something?

589
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:22,697
Yes. We need to take these out.

590
00:23:22,698 --> 00:23:23,707
(They brought mysterious luggage.)

591
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:24,767
- Okay.
- Do this?

592
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:25,807
That's right.

593
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:27,078
(What's that luggage?)

594
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:30,277
(Rummaging)

595
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:31,448
- Here.
- Is it mealtime?

596
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,547
It's mealtime.

597
00:23:32,548 --> 00:23:34,577
- It's Nam Jin's lunch.
- He needs to eat.

598
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:36,747
- The concert is at 2pm.
- You eat before the concert.

599
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,217
- Shall I open everything?
- Yes.

600
00:23:38,218 --> 00:23:40,758
Open that one and this one.

601
00:23:41,318 --> 00:23:43,428
What's this?

602
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:48,857
(Food comes out endlessly.)

603
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:51,127
- Here.
- I think you tied it too tightly.

604
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:52,667
(The empty table gets filled up in no time.)

605
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:54,298
We're clumsy.

606
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:57,837
(Impressed by the scale)

607
00:23:57,838 --> 00:23:59,637
- Listen.
- This is Nam Jin's.

608
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,207
Secretary Lee and Secretary Kim.

609
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,707
- Okay.
- My fans...

610
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:07,647
aren't doing anything new today. They've done this for 50 years.

611
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:10,648
- I saw it on TV once.
- For 50 years...

612
00:24:11,418 --> 00:24:12,917
(Every time Nam Jin has a concert,)

613
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:14,218
(they bring so much food.)

614
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:16,488
(The scale is on another level.)

615
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,758
(The meals My Star gets from the fans are well-known.)

616
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,598
(His fandom is still on another level.)

617
00:24:22,658 --> 00:24:24,967
- They make tasty dishes, - I see.

618
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:26,837
and prepare a feast.

619
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:27,937
That's right.

620
00:24:27,938 --> 00:24:30,938
It used to be ten times bigger.

621
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:33,507
This is practically a snack.

622
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:35,138
Auntie does things in bulk.

623
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,707
She usually brings about 40 side dishes.

624
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:41,848
She has made me food in the past 50 years.

625
00:24:41,918 --> 00:24:43,548
She's Mi Ra.

626
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:46,548
- Eat up. I cooked a lot of food.
- Okay.

627
00:24:46,788 --> 00:24:48,357
I've been a fan for 50 years.

628
00:24:48,358 --> 00:24:50,988
My older sister liked him first.

629
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,228
He was insanely cool.

630
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:56,798
I fell in love then, and continued to be a fan.

631
00:24:56,968 --> 00:24:59,068
I think of him whenever I see something nice.

632
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:01,838
My daughter said,

633
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:05,538
"Mom, you love Nam Jin more than your husband."

634
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:07,307
"You give him the best food."

635
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:09,077
When I was single,

636
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:11,678
I asked him, "Would you officiate the wedding..."

637
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:15,578
"if I have a son?" We made a pinky promise.

638
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,818
He actually came, and officiated the wedding...

639
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:20,888
when my son got married last year. And he had a son recently.

640
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,218
We're practically a family.

641
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:25,127
- We're like managers.
- We work as managers.

642
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:26,457
- I see.
- Yes.

643
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,128
For 50 years,

644
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,927
- they've made tasty dishes, - I see.

645
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,697
and prepared a feast.

646
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:33,998
Try it.

647
00:25:34,438 --> 00:25:35,737
Then you'll know the taste.

648
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:37,537
- I can tell from the smell.
- No.

649
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,267
- You wouldn't know that way.
- Hold on.

650
00:25:39,268 --> 00:25:40,937
- Spring rolls.
- He needs his spring rolls.

651
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:42,408
Spring rolls.

652
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:44,507
- I think these are spring rolls.
- Yes.

653
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:46,648
- I love spring rolls.
- This is the sauce.

654
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,678
- Pour the sauce here.
- Okay.

655
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:52,387
- You brought many fruits.
- Yes.

656
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:54,987
That's the secret of his youth. He absolutely loves fruits.

657
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,257
- He likes fruits.
- Yes.

658
00:25:56,258 --> 00:25:57,828
He doesn't really eat meals.

659
00:25:58,228 --> 00:26:00,398
He eats vegetables and fruits.

660
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,698
Nam Jin, eat it with dried laver.

661
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:05,627
(She roasted each sheet of dried laver.)

662
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:06,667
- Thank you.
- It's tasty.

663
00:26:06,668 --> 00:26:07,937
- Take a seat.
- It's your favorite food.

664
00:26:07,938 --> 00:26:09,138
- Take a seat.
- Okay.

665
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:12,408
Thank you for the food.

666
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:13,777
- Let's eat.
- Enjoy your meal.

667
00:26:13,778 --> 00:26:16,008
Nam Jin, eat it with dried laver.

668
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:19,308
(He takes a bite of a spring roll, his favorite dish.)

669
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:24,948
(The dishes that were made with love suit My Star's tastes.)

670
00:26:25,188 --> 00:26:27,357
- The early 40s.
- Those strawberries...

671
00:26:27,358 --> 00:26:28,718
are as big as apples.

672
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,657
(Specialties from around the nation)

673
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,198
- How are they so big?
- Try them.

674
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:36,627
Look at this strawberry.

675
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,898
(He picks up a huge strawberry.)

676
00:26:39,768 --> 00:26:43,068
Secretary Lee, where did you do your military service?

677
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,938
Defense Security Command.

678
00:26:45,368 --> 00:26:46,638
- Defense Security Command?
- Yes.

679
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:48,307
Secretary Kim, how about you?

680
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:50,747
The 50th Infantry Division in Daegu.

681
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:52,208
- In Daegu?
- Yes.

682
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:56,347
Have you engaged in a gunfight?

683
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,517
Of course. It sounds like a lie, right?

684
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:00,088
Yes, it really does.

685
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,658
People who did the military service in Korea find it hard to believe.

686
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:05,428
It was like a scene from a movie.

687
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:08,398
You can't get a sense of it from someone's story.

688
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:13,068
(My Star came back after 2 years in the war zone.)

689
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:15,538
One time, a bomb flew over while I was eating.

690
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,037
- Did a bomb fly over?
- Yes.

691
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,407
- Didn't you get hurt?
- What?

692
00:27:19,408 --> 00:27:20,908
- Didn't you get hurt?
- It didn't go off.

693
00:27:21,878 --> 00:27:22,977
Thanks to that...

694
00:27:22,978 --> 00:27:24,307
(Thank goodness.)

695
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:26,918
Six soldiers were eating together. Everyone else got up,

696
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:28,817
and one soldier and I remained.

697
00:27:28,818 --> 00:27:31,618
I was about to get up...

698
00:27:31,948 --> 00:27:33,757
when I heard a whooshing sound.

699
00:27:33,758 --> 00:27:36,888
I had arrived a few days ago, so I didn't recognize the sound.

700
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:40,728
I was like, "What's that?" Everyone got down on the floor.

701
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:43,897
Something fell to the ground.

702
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:46,667
- On the ground was sand, - Okay.

703
00:27:46,668 --> 00:27:47,938
not soil.

704
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:51,467
It got embedded in the sand and spun.

705
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:52,807
Thank goodness many grenades were faulty back then.

706
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:54,907
I was in my 20s.

707
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:57,478
I was fearless. I was like, "What's this?"

708
00:27:57,748 --> 00:27:58,808
I said that.

709
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,277
- There were many faulty grenades.
- That soldier said,

710
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,518
"Nam Jin, had that grenade gone off,"

711
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:05,388
"we wouldn't be alive now."

712
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:07,487
- It's like a movie.
- It's like a movie.

713
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,887
People nowadays can't imagine it.

714
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,787
It didn't feel real. I felt like I was filming a movie.

715
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:16,457
I heard the story a few times, but he makes it so realistic.

716
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,697
- Did you listen to it a few times?
- Yes. Nevertheless,

717
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:21,937
- he makes it so realistic.
- Yes.

718
00:28:21,938 --> 00:28:24,267
- It's so fascinating.
- Yes.

719
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,737
From what I've gathered,

720
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,778
you should watch out for the left side.

721
00:28:27,938 --> 00:28:28,978
- Yes.
- Why?

722
00:28:29,138 --> 00:28:30,677
I got that from the grenade story and the injury.

723
00:28:30,678 --> 00:28:33,048
- The left side isn't so good.
- Watch out for the left side.

724
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,117
(Easygoing)

725
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:37,748
- The left side.
- The left side.

726
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:40,487
- What do you need?
- The knife...

727
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:41,517
Do you need a knife?

728
00:28:41,518 --> 00:28:43,517
No, I'm talking about the knife that stabbed me.

729
00:28:43,518 --> 00:28:46,188
- That knife?
- I see. That knife.

730
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:49,997
- He's telling us the story.
- It was about this long.

731
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:51,297
- I guess it was a sashimi knife.
- Yes, it was.

732
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:52,867
- That must've been a sashimi knife.
- Correct.

733
00:28:52,868 --> 00:28:53,968
Here...

734
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,998
I was in a standing position, and he stabbed me from behind.

735
00:28:56,238 --> 00:28:57,408
I was standing like this.

736
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:58,737
- At the entrance.
- Then...

737
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,337
- Did it go through your thigh?
- Yes.

738
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,237
- The blade came out forward.
- The blade came out? Oh, gosh.

739
00:29:02,238 --> 00:29:04,248
(His life was in danger in that accident.)

740
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:06,307
You see, I...

741
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:08,517
Not long ago, I met that guy at L hotel.

742
00:29:08,518 --> 00:29:11,887
("Nam Jin Runs into Man Who Stabbed Him?)

743
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:13,287
Did you accidentally run into him?

744
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:14,858
I went there to attend...

745
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:17,188
I went there to attend my junior's wedding.

746
00:29:17,258 --> 00:29:19,887
There's a cafe on the left side of the entrance, you know.

747
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:21,798
- At the hotel. Right.
- Yes, it's very large.

748
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,098
At the cafe,

749
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:25,997
I was sitting there, drinking my coffee...

750
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,398
with some of my juniors.

751
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:29,298
While I was drinking coffee,

752
00:29:29,368 --> 00:29:30,608
someone suddenly came...

753
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:32,968
toward me very quickly.

754
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,378
From a distance,

755
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:38,378
he got down on his knees and slid all the way to me.

756
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:41,017
Everyone there got startled and fell backward.

757
00:29:41,018 --> 00:29:42,947
Surprised, I looked at him.

758
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:44,118
He seemed familiar.

759
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:45,718
Then I realized...

760
00:29:45,948 --> 00:29:47,357
he was that guy.

761
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:48,588
(He was the guy who stabbed me.)

762
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:51,558
He said, "Sir, it's me."

763
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:54,958
I said, "You punk, you startled me."

764
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:59,028
"I thought you were coming with a knife again."

765
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,498
(My Star is so cool that he makes a joke about it.)

766
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,138
He lowered his head and couldn't seem to look at me.

767
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:04,368
He was glad that I was there,

768
00:30:04,508 --> 00:30:05,868
so he came to say hello to me.

769
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:08,807
He was "glad?" That expression doesn't sound...

770
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,107
He was glad to see me.

771
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,608
- I mean, there was a reason.
- I wouldn't...

772
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:13,408
There was a reason for that.

773
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:15,577
When the incident happened...

774
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:17,847
It was considered attempted murder.

775
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:18,917
- Yes.
- Of course.

776
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:20,657
- Also...
- That's a felony.

777
00:30:20,658 --> 00:30:22,717
It caused a controversy.

778
00:30:22,718 --> 00:30:25,828
But I did everything I could to reduce his sentence.

779
00:30:27,198 --> 00:30:28,497
I tried my best...

780
00:30:28,498 --> 00:30:30,368
to help him get the most lenient sentence.

781
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:32,428
- You requested leniency.
- I did my best.

782
00:30:32,568 --> 00:30:34,737
I submitted a petition. I did everything I could do.

783
00:30:34,738 --> 00:30:36,068
And that...

784
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:38,337
touched his heart so deeply.

785
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,268
- He has feelings just like us.
- But it's not easy...

786
00:30:41,108 --> 00:30:42,637
But it's not easy...

787
00:30:42,638 --> 00:30:44,607
to forgive and help someone...

788
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:46,807
who has hurt you.

789
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:49,217
That's how bighearted and generous Jin is.

790
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:50,517
Our dear Jin has such a big heart.

791
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,247
- He's a great man.
- Indeed.

792
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:54,918
Would you forgive a man who has hurt you?

793
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,257
- The rehearsal starts at 1pm.
- It starts at 1pm?

794
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:58,957
We have 30 minutes left.

795
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,597
- Then he'll need his outfits...
- Right. I'll do that.

796
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:02,727
He needs his stage outfits.

797
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,168
- Could you bring his outfits first?
- Sure. I'll do that.

798
00:31:05,268 --> 00:31:07,167
- Sir, we'll go bring your outfits.
- We'll bring your outfits.

799
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:08,237
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

800
00:31:08,238 --> 00:31:09,598
(They'll head to the car to bring his outfits.)

801
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:11,137
- Should we take all of them?
- Sorry?

802
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:12,938
- Should we take all of them?
- I think we should.

803
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,938
- Really?
- Yes. I think he'll need them all.

804
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:17,708
These trousers come with that one, I think.

805
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:20,678
(Grumpy Secretary is skillful at taking care of outfits now.)

806
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:26,817
(The sound check and rehearsal begin.)

807
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,817
(The sound check and rehearsal begin.)

808
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:31,658
- We'll begin now.
- Okay.

809
00:31:31,928 --> 00:31:32,988
All right.

810
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,857
Lower the volume of my in-ear earphones, please.

811
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:35,957
Shall I turn up the volume?

812
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:37,597
- No. Lower it, please.
- Oh, lower it?

813
00:31:37,598 --> 00:31:38,828
It's too loud.

814
00:31:39,668 --> 00:31:42,268
(He does the sound check thoroughly with 60 years of experience.)

815
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:43,837
Yes. Understood.

816
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,507
(Grumpy Secretaries delivered his outfits and are backstage now.)

817
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:47,738
- Please hold your microphones.
- Sure.

818
00:31:48,578 --> 00:31:50,978
(The microphones were delivered to the MCs for the rehearsal.)

819
00:31:52,448 --> 00:31:54,378
Oh, so only the voice?

820
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:57,448
I've never hosted any events before.

821
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:01,317
- I think you'll enjoy doing it.
- You can just relax.

822
00:32:01,318 --> 00:32:02,588
(He's suddenly nervous.)

823
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,258
- Iced Americano?
- We'll begin.

824
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:06,158
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

825
00:32:07,298 --> 00:32:08,958
- You can go now.
- Shall we go now?

826
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,708
(Grumpy Secretary's intro MC rehearsal begins.)

827
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:20,878
Hello.

828
00:32:21,578 --> 00:32:22,738
Hello!

829
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:24,707
- Say hello.
- Hello!

830
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:26,177
Can I get a scream?

831
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,818
- Don't say things like that.
- I shouldn't do it?

832
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:29,278
- Understood.
- Hello.

833
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:32,088
I'm Mr. Nam Jin's one-day secretary,

834
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,488
Lee Seo Jin.

835
00:32:35,158 --> 00:32:38,827
I'm Secretary Kim, Kim Kwang Kyu. It's nice to meet you all.

836
00:32:38,828 --> 00:32:40,497
Thank you so much...

837
00:32:40,498 --> 00:32:42,798
for coming to his concert today out of your busy schedules.

838
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:45,567
(Gibberish?)

839
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,028
- Should I continue right away?
- You should say...

840
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:49,097
You should say things like, "Are you all ready?"

841
00:32:49,098 --> 00:32:51,937
Are you all ready to enjoy the concert?

842
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:53,207
- Yes!
- That's great.

843
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,238
Will you say it or not?

844
00:32:55,738 --> 00:32:58,708
(He's busy checking the script.)

845
00:32:59,248 --> 00:33:00,277
(Glancing)

846
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,648
I bet you have prepared everything to enjoy the concert. Right?

847
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:03,917
Yes!

848
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:05,187
- Right.
- Keep going!

849
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:06,947
- What do you want me to do?
- Do something!

850
00:33:06,948 --> 00:33:08,687
- Should I do this?
- Don't just look at the script!

851
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:09,917
You shouldn't fight on the stage.

852
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:11,358
I mean, what...

853
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:12,887
- Here, it says...
- You can say this line here...

854
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:14,427
Among all of you, who is...

855
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:16,398
You can say this line, for example. "Let us check that out."

856
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:18,067
Hey, the comments overlap.

857
00:33:18,068 --> 00:33:19,267
No, it's not. After I say that, you can say,

858
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:20,897
"Then shall we check that out?"

859
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,638
Say something like that to engage the audience.

860
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,567
Then shall we check that out?

861
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:26,838
(He just repeats what Seo Jin said.)

862
00:33:29,838 --> 00:33:31,748
Whom are you here to see today?

863
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,307
- Nam Jin!
- Nam Jin!

864
00:33:33,308 --> 00:33:34,747
Whom do you love the most?

865
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:35,777
- Nam Jin!
- Nam Jin!

866
00:33:35,778 --> 00:33:37,077
Shout out his name more loudly!

867
00:33:37,078 --> 00:33:38,447
- Nam Jin!
- Nam Jin!

868
00:33:38,448 --> 00:33:40,858
We're supposed to do this much before the concert begins.

869
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:44,587
I'm impressed. Why are you so good at this? Hey.

870
00:33:44,588 --> 00:33:46,787
This is our 15th time shooting a show together.

871
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:48,658
Shouldn't we have good teamwork at this point?

872
00:33:48,858 --> 00:33:50,197
I was talking alone...

873
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,428
while he was reading the script.

874
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,127
He couldn't jump in at the right timing.

875
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:54,368
How could I not be annoyed?

876
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:56,567
I mean, we were supposed to take turns saying lines...

877
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:58,337
and respond to each other.

878
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:01,408
But he was just hesitating and didn't jump in.

879
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,107
- Why are you so nervous?
- Hey.

880
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,277
Gosh, seriously.

881
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,348
This is to celebrate his 60th anniversary.

882
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:10,317
Of course, I'm nervous.

883
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:11,648
Then as you walk onto the stage,

884
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:14,458
sing your song. Sparkling

885
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:16,787
Then I'll just do as I want.

886
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,088
- Go ahead.
- All right.

887
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:19,527
- I don't think...
- I will...

888
00:34:19,528 --> 00:34:21,228
you can pull off formal comments like these anyway.

889
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,598
You brat, you know that precisely.

890
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:28,738
I'll say, "Are you all ready to enjoy the concert?"

891
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:30,497
Then the audience will shout yes.

892
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:33,007
- And then you jump in.
- Okay.

893
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:34,307
When the audience says yes,

894
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,908
you say, "Shall we bring him out now?"

895
00:34:36,078 --> 00:34:37,648
- "Let's..."
- "Shall we bring him out?"

896
00:34:39,648 --> 00:34:40,718
Bring out what?

897
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:43,277
We should bring Mr. Nam Jin out on the stage.

898
00:34:43,278 --> 00:34:45,118
Oh, right. We should bring him out on the stage.

899
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:47,458
"Shall we bring out our superstar Nam Jin?"

900
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,157
Hey, let's just improvise.

901
00:34:49,158 --> 00:34:50,458
Let's just improvise our lines.

902
00:34:50,658 --> 00:34:52,258
Let's improvise. These lines...

903
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:56,057
The audience members will start entering in one minute.

904
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:59,027
- So please be standby in there.
- Understood.

905
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:00,368
Got it.

906
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:01,968
So we should...

907
00:35:02,698 --> 00:35:03,838
Do you get it now?

908
00:35:03,938 --> 00:35:05,338
- Are you ready now?
- Sorry?

909
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:07,208
- Yes.
- Are you?

910
00:35:07,378 --> 00:35:08,807
- I don't think you're ready.
- I'm ready.

911
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:10,677
Take him with you and help him practice.

912
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,278
I don't need to practice.

913
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,817
(1:30pm, 30 minutes before the concert)

914
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:21,088
(The fans start entering 1 by 1.)

915
00:35:21,218 --> 00:35:25,728
(While My Star's concert hall is being filled with the audience...)

916
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,157
Mr. Nam Jin and his secretaries,

917
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:30,558
- please be standby at 1:50pm.
- Okay.

918
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:36,638
(20 minutes before the concert, My Star gets makeup done.)

919
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:39,338
(Spraying)

920
00:35:41,178 --> 00:35:44,977
(Eternal Crush has entered.)

921
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:50,277
(Even the cool, playful My Star is quiet while getting makeup done.)

922
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:53,317
(Staring)

923
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,388
- Who would think I'm 80?
- No one.

924
00:35:55,458 --> 00:35:56,558
No one would think that.

925
00:35:56,918 --> 00:35:59,228
- You wanted to hear that.
- Yes.

926
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:01,228
You look like you're in your mid 60s.

927
00:36:02,028 --> 00:36:04,798
Even to myself, I don't look like I'm 80.

928
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:06,468
That's why we say...

929
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:08,437
- you're blessed.
- Exactly.

930
00:36:08,438 --> 00:36:11,738
You see, Kwang Kyu and...

931
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:13,307
- And Seo Jin?
- Right, Seo Jin. They also...

932
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:14,378
- What are you looking for?
- look better in person.

933
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:16,937
- Something to pick this up.
- A fork? It's over there.

934
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:18,207
- Right in front of you.
- Over there.

935
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,777
(He suddenly looks for a fork?)

936
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,477
Right. They're my secretaries today.

937
00:36:22,478 --> 00:36:23,647
(Approaching)

938
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,517
They should be obedient to be good secretaries.

939
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:27,087
- Here you go.
- They have basic traits.

940
00:36:27,088 --> 00:36:29,087
You need to take care of your voice.

941
00:36:29,088 --> 00:36:30,688
- All right.
- Take care of your voice.

942
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,927
- Your concert will begin...
- So that's why.

943
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:34,427
- I mean, your appearance.
- Yes

944
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:35,797
I understand. But that's enough.

945
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:37,427
(I like chatting.)

946
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:38,428
"That's enough."

947
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,527
I mean it.

948
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:41,637
- It's okay.
- You should prepare your voice.

949
00:36:41,638 --> 00:36:42,697
- I mean it. It's okay.
- Okay.

950
00:36:42,698 --> 00:36:45,508
- You're here as my secretary.
- Yes. I'm Secretary Kim.

951
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:46,907
- Exactly. You look...
- Secretary Kim.

952
00:36:46,908 --> 00:36:48,937
My secretary's face...

953
00:36:48,938 --> 00:36:50,277
- Secretary Kim, - Yes.

954
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:52,078
looking at you alone makes my tiredness go away.

955
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,077
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

956
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,517
- That's a great compliment.
- Thank you.

957
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:56,717
I mean it.

958
00:36:56,718 --> 00:36:58,618
- Please speak more quietly.
- Okay.

959
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:00,217
You should take care of your voice.

960
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,488
(You should take care of your voice.)

961
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:02,887
I'm honored.

962
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,827
(My Star quietly enjoys the massage that Secretary Kim is giving him.)

963
00:37:05,828 --> 00:37:07,458
As for his massage skills,

964
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:09,597
he's not very good at it.

965
00:37:09,598 --> 00:37:11,367
(He's not very good at it.)

966
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:12,467
But...

967
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:13,797
I could feel his sincerity.

968
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:14,897
(But I could feel his sincerity.)

969
00:37:14,898 --> 00:37:17,268
He was doing his best with sincerity.

970
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:19,468
And I felt his sincerity.

971
00:37:19,708 --> 00:37:22,538
If someone who's good at massaging does it in a rude, sloppy way...

972
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,078
while the other does it...

973
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:26,178
with great effort and affection,

974
00:37:26,408 --> 00:37:28,018
you can feel the difference.

975
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,618
So I really liked it.

976
00:37:30,518 --> 00:37:33,718
(Secretary Kim has become confident.)

977
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:38,628
Just a little bit.

978
00:37:38,629 --> 00:37:39,887
(Squeezing out hand cream)

979
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:43,028
(Oh, my. Our dear Jin's hand...)

980
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,328
(Secretary Lee joins him.)

981
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:49,437
He'll demonstrate for you.

982
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:50,668
Apply it like this.

983
00:37:50,698 --> 00:37:52,138
- Only on the back of his hand.
- I see.

984
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,177
- Oh, my. Your hand...
- You're very thoughtful.

985
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:56,837
Your hand looks really nice.

986
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:58,277
- I guess you didn't do farming...
- He has soft hands...

987
00:37:58,278 --> 00:37:59,748
- in Mokpo.
- since he's from a wealthy family.

988
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:02,478
- You didn't do farming, right?
- His hand is so soft for someone...

989
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:05,088
who served in the Vietnam War.

990
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:07,917
I experienced everything when I was in Vietnam.

991
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,918
(His hands are smooth, and he's in a good mood.)

992
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:09,918
In Vietnam...

993
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:11,427
He won't put down his hand.

994
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:13,587
- He wants you to keep doing it.
- Oh, is that right?

995
00:38:13,588 --> 00:38:15,598
- That's why he's holding it up.
- Oh, I see. All right.

996
00:38:15,698 --> 00:38:19,828
(My Star likes to be taken care of by Grumpy Secretary.)

997
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:23,797
(He's writing something down on his palm.)

998
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:25,207
He's writing down...

999
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,837
both of our names.

1000
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,078
I was just like him.

1001
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:32,307
- Really? Our names?
- Not to forget to mention us.

1002
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:33,547
(I will compliment them when I'm on stage.)

1003
00:38:33,548 --> 00:38:34,817
- That's...
- Because it's slippery...

1004
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:38,418
Today, this concert will make...

1005
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,918
the end of the year 2025 memorable.

1006
00:38:42,258 --> 00:38:44,187
(He's finishing writing notes on his hand.)

1007
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:46,187
- All three of you, be on standby.
- Okay.

1008
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:47,357
You two should leave without me.

1009
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,457
I'll go to the restroom first.

1010
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:51,368
(I'll go to the restroom first.)

1011
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:54,297
They'll introduce me first, right?

1012
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:56,537
- You'll come out right after that.
- We need you to be...

1013
00:38:56,538 --> 00:38:58,567
- on standby too.
- It won't take you long, right?

1014
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:00,307
- It'll take 1 to 2 minutes.
- It'll take less than 1 minute.

1015
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:01,308
(My Star felt nature's call abruptly.)

1016
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:03,437
- Where is the restroom?
- It's downstairs.

1017
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:05,607
- We'll see you in a bit. It's...
- Where is it?

1018
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:07,717
(Looks like Nam Jin's concert will begin without Nam Jin.)

1019
00:39:07,718 --> 00:39:09,517
You can buy him some time until...

1020
00:39:09,518 --> 00:39:10,518
- Mr. Nam Jin comes back, right?
- Shall we?

1021
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,447
Then I'll sing my song...

1022
00:39:12,448 --> 00:39:13,488
Thank you!

1023
00:39:13,548 --> 00:39:17,827
(The audience is heated up without knowing backstage situation.)

1024
00:39:17,828 --> 00:39:19,557
- Will we go onto the stage on time?
- Yes, just relax.

1025
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:20,787
- You'll go onto the stage on time.
- Yes.

1026
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:22,157
- Got it.
- You'll go out at 1:59pm.

1027
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,528
- Go onto the stage naturally.
- At 1:59pm.

1028
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:26,198
You should go out on time.

1029
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,497
(They'll have to fill the stage until My Star comes.)

1030
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,568
Should we go out on time?

1031
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:30,798
Why didn't he go to the restroom earlier?

1032
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,637
He went to the restroom when we had to be on standby.

1033
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,338
I was a bit flustered.

1034
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,007
(It'll start shortly, but he hasn't come yet.)

1035
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,448
The assistant director says we should go.

1036
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:40,077
We'll show it to you.

1037
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,517
- Then after we introduce him, - We'll show it to you.

1038
00:39:41,518 --> 00:39:43,747
they will start playing the music, right?

1039
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:45,117
You can introduce him when we give you the sign.

1040
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:46,687
You can see us in front of you. You can really see us.

1041
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,657
- Okay.
- You'll go onto the stage now.

1042
00:39:48,658 --> 00:39:50,758
(Grumpy Secretaries, the intro MCs, enter on time in the end.)

1043
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:54,297
(Sparkling)

1044
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:58,068
(I like your sparkling eyes)

1045
00:39:59,928 --> 00:40:04,837
(Kwang Kyu sings the opening song as he promised.)

1046
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:05,907
Keep singing.

1047
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:07,438
- Keep singing.
- Shall I?

1048
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,338
(Wait. Aren't they actors?)

1049
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:14,148
(Fascinated)

1050
00:40:14,618 --> 00:40:18,617
(Checking if My Star has come)

1051
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:19,618
Keep singing.

1052
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,088
Sing through to the end.

1053
00:40:25,428 --> 00:40:29,498
(For the first time, he realizes the importance of Kwang Kyu's song.)

1054
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:33,497
(Checking My Star's arrival again)

1055
00:40:33,498 --> 00:40:36,338
Hello. I'm Kim Kwang Kyu who released two song albums.

1056
00:40:37,438 --> 00:40:38,438
(Fortunately, the audience members welcome the intro MCs.)

1057
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:39,608
Hello.

1058
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:45,008
Today, I'm here as Mr. Nam Jin's secretary.

1059
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:47,878
(Shouting in awe)

1060
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:49,248
(Shouting in awe)

1061
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,688
I'm Lee Seo Jin, the first secretary.

1062
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,157
- I'm Secretary Kim, Kim Kwang Kyu.
- You're handsome!

1063
00:40:56,158 --> 00:40:57,287
It's nice to meet you all.

1064
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,628
(Secretary Lee is handsome!)

1065
00:40:58,658 --> 00:40:59,927
You're so handsome!

1066
00:40:59,928 --> 00:41:01,557
(Checking My Star's arrival for the 3rd time)

1067
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:04,968
I've been a fan of Mr. Nam Jin's since I was little.

1068
00:41:05,168 --> 00:41:07,428
And I've always wanted to come to his concert.

1069
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:10,668
I got a chance to be here today.

1070
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:14,908
Same goes for me. The first song I've ever sung was...

1071
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:17,137
"With My Love."

1072
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:19,007
(He improvises a line. "It's 'With My Love.'")

1073
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:20,877
That's how I started singing.

1074
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,817
I'm honored to be at his concert, meet him in person,

1075
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:27,417
and meet all of you here. I'm happy to meet you all.

1076
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,957
(I'm happy to meet you all.)

1077
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,758
(Has he come yet?)

1078
00:41:32,358 --> 00:41:36,658
(Fortunately, My Star arrives backstage right then.)

1079
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:42,098
(They're doing great.)

1080
00:41:44,238 --> 00:41:47,138
Before we came onto the stage,

1081
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:50,807
we applied hand cream...

1082
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,408
on the back of Mr. Nam Jin's hands.

1083
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:58,518
I'd like you to remember that when you look at his hands.

1084
00:41:58,748 --> 00:41:59,748
(He chuckles as he finishes the comment hurriedly.)

1085
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:02,657
Are you ready to enjoy the concert?

1086
00:42:02,658 --> 00:42:04,017
- Yes!
- Yes!

1087
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,027
(Finally, he says the line in the script.)

1088
00:42:05,028 --> 00:42:07,488
Let us hear you scream!

1089
00:42:08,028 --> 00:42:11,527
(Make some noise.)

1090
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,467
Whom are you here to see?

1091
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:15,237
- Nam Jin!
- Nam Jin!

1092
00:42:15,238 --> 00:42:17,667
Who is the person you love the most?

1093
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,237
(Nam Jin)

1094
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:20,907
Please shout his name loudly again!

1095
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,777
- Nam Jin!
- Nam Jin!

1096
00:42:22,778 --> 00:42:24,407
Please shout his name loudly again!

1097
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,277
- Nam Jin!
- Nam Jin!

1098
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:29,218
Our dear Nam Jin!

1099
00:42:29,448 --> 00:42:30,478
(Our dear Nam Jin!)

1100
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:37,218
(After struggles, they successfully introduced him.)

1101
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:39,357
Lee Seo Jin!

1102
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:40,988
(As of today, it's Seo Jin's world.)

1103
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:44,967
(They gave their all on their debut as MCs.)

1104
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:46,068
Has he...

1105
00:42:52,408 --> 00:42:53,408
Has he come?

1106
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:54,778
- He's here.
- I see.

1107
00:42:55,278 --> 00:42:56,877
They didn't give us a signal.

1108
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:58,478
I saw the signal. That's why I said those lines.

1109
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:00,748
- Oh, really?
- It was on the teleprompter.

1110
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:01,878
- I didn't see it.
- It said he was on standby.

1111
00:43:01,878 --> 00:43:02,878
I didn't see it.

1112
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:06,147
(He must've been very nervous even though he didn't seem so.)

1113
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:08,958
(The clip on the screen tells My Star will make his entrance.)

1114
00:43:09,058 --> 00:43:14,388
(He won the Top 10 Singers Award for 3 years in a row from 1971.)

1115
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:17,628
(From "The Playboy in Seoul" released in 1965...)

1116
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:20,798
(to "The Breakup Is Mine Too" released in 2023)

1117
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:23,098
(He's released more than 1,000 songs.)

1118
00:43:24,238 --> 00:43:27,208
(Peeking)

1119
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:33,408
(His body reacts as the music starts.)

1120
00:43:35,418 --> 00:43:37,917
(Taking a deep breath)

1121
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:42,388
(Applaud)

1122
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:46,657
(Eternal Crush's 60th anniversary concert...)

1123
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:50,728
(with his fans of 60 years)

1124
00:43:53,028 --> 00:43:54,798
Partner, yes

1125
00:43:59,468 --> 00:44:01,338
Partner, yes

1126
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:07,748
(He makes such charismatic entrance without having gotten rusty at all.)

1127
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:23,658
(Dazzling dance moves)

1128
00:44:24,228 --> 00:44:25,827
(He's simply fascinated.)

1129
00:44:25,828 --> 00:44:27,698
He seems completely different from when he was in the waiting room.

1130
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,968
He seems completely different from when he was in the waiting room.

1131
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:32,238
He's moving so lightly.

1132
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:35,038
He's 80. Can you imagine?

1133
00:44:35,508 --> 00:44:37,708
He's 80. That's right.

1134
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,247
He's incredible.

1135
00:44:39,248 --> 00:44:40,447
He was born in 1945.

1136
00:44:40,448 --> 00:44:41,617
(Nam Jin, who was born in 1945, is still vigorous.)

1137
00:44:41,618 --> 00:44:43,447
He seemed like his body felt heavy.

1138
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,118
But he moved so lightly while singing.

1139
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:47,318
He looked like a swallowtail,

1140
00:44:47,448 --> 00:44:49,458
doing his dance moves.

1141
00:44:50,558 --> 00:44:52,287
I realized he was still very healthy.

1142
00:44:52,288 --> 00:44:53,288
(That's our superstar.)

1143
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:56,098
I was amazed and admired him so much.

1144
00:44:57,658 --> 00:44:59,098
He and my mother have a one-year age gap.

1145
00:44:59,898 --> 00:45:01,568
My mother is one year older than him.

1146
00:45:01,638 --> 00:45:04,067
And it's hard for her even to stand up from a chair.

1147
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,068
(He even dances when he's old enough to struggle to move around.)

1148
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,738
But he even danced so cheerfully.

1149
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:11,478
(That's not all. He'll perform 29 songs live.)

1150
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:12,977
(Part 1: "Oh Carol," "Hound Dog," and many other songs)

1151
00:45:12,978 --> 00:45:14,177
(Part 2: Many songs including a medley and a duet song)

1152
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:15,178
(Part 3: Two medley songs and many other)

1153
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:21,318
("Hound Dog" by Elvis Presley, 1956)

1154
00:45:21,588 --> 00:45:24,287
(He's called Korea's Elvis for a reason.)

1155
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:26,958
(He starts his concert with an exciting rock and roll song.)

1156
00:45:28,558 --> 00:45:33,397
(The fans who are in backstage are also very excited.)

1157
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,798
(When our dear Nam Jin is excited, it makes us excited too.)

1158
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:40,937
(The fan of Elvis' smiles with dimples.)

1159
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:42,908
(Shaking his leg to the rhythm)

1160
00:45:43,538 --> 00:45:46,907
(Even from the beginning,)

1161
00:45:46,908 --> 00:45:49,918
(he rocked the stage.)

1162
00:45:50,378 --> 00:45:51,488
Hello!

1163
00:45:55,288 --> 00:45:56,857
What could be the reason...

1164
00:45:56,858 --> 00:45:59,788
I've been loved for so many years?

1165
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:03,797
It's because I have you.

1166
00:46:03,798 --> 00:46:06,797
(It's because I have you.)

1167
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:07,827
(No star in the sky shines alone.)

1168
00:46:07,828 --> 00:46:08,998
Nam Jin!

1169
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:16,438
("Young Meadow" by Nam Jin, 1972)

1170
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,908
(Glancing)

1171
00:46:19,508 --> 00:46:23,978
(Girls, your crush is here.)

1172
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,558
He looked at us. He looked.

1173
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:35,828
(Until Nam Jin transformed from a hillbilly to a superstar...)

1174
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:39,797
(Even when it rained or snowed...)

1175
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:42,938
(Even when he fought in the war...)

1176
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:47,977
(His fans have been with him, and he sings for them.)

1177
00:46:47,978 --> 00:46:51,808
(His fans have been with him, and he sings for them.)

1178
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:03,957
(You)

1179
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:05,827
(Wouldn't know)

1180
00:47:05,828 --> 00:47:07,227
(My)

1181
00:47:07,228 --> 00:47:09,198
(My)

1182
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:10,858
I don't know if you know my feelings.

1183
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,628
I wonder if you all know my feelings.

1184
00:47:14,128 --> 00:47:15,267
Really?

1185
00:47:15,268 --> 00:47:16,938
(Our dear Nam Jin still tames his fans at the age of 80.)

1186
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,678
(It's already time for him to sing the last song of Part 1.)

1187
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:25,748
("Once Again, Even If I Hate You" by Nam Jin, 1968)

1188
00:47:25,978 --> 00:47:30,618
(The most heart-wrenching song among many of Nam Jin's hit songs)

1189
00:47:34,088 --> 00:47:36,058
He has his own gesture.

1190
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,657
You mean, how he holds his mic?

1191
00:47:38,658 --> 00:47:39,658
No.

1192
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:40,787
(He's impressed by My Star's expressive gestures.)

1193
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:42,358
He gently moves his left hand like this.

1194
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:45,767
And he moves his mic up and down with his other hand.

1195
00:47:45,768 --> 00:47:53,338
(Nam Jin's own unique vibrato and gestures that convey the emotion)

1196
00:48:04,478 --> 00:48:10,458
(The exciting Part 1 ends as the song ends.)

1197
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:15,028
(Being on standby backstage)

1198
00:48:15,398 --> 00:48:16,927
- That was amazing, sir.
- That was amazing.

1199
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:19,298
- Please go back to waiting room.
- Please go back to waiting room.

1200
00:48:19,928 --> 00:48:21,467
Great job, Nam Jin.

1201
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:24,837
(He heads back to his waiting room to refresh himself before Part 2.)

1202
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:26,338
- Can you hold this for me?
- You shouldn't touch it.

1203
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:27,508
Should he change his clothes now?

1204
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:28,738
Sir, let me take your jacket.

1205
00:48:31,848 --> 00:48:34,948
(He takes My Star's jacket before anyone else does.)

1206
00:48:35,678 --> 00:48:39,148
(My Star will change his clothes for Part 2.)

1207
00:48:39,648 --> 00:48:43,488
(He waits for My Star holding his shoes for Part 2.)

1208
00:48:45,888 --> 00:48:47,227
I think he needs to put on the shoes before coming out.

1209
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:48,828
It's for the stage anyway.

1210
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:50,357
You should wear your shoes.

1211
00:48:50,358 --> 00:48:52,698
(He gives him his shoes.)

1212
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,767
(He also helps him with a shoehorn.)

1213
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:58,708
Seo Jin really...

1214
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:01,738
knows all this because he's worn them a lot.

1215
00:49:04,038 --> 00:49:05,047
(My Star is satisfied with Seo Jin's service.)

1216
00:49:05,048 --> 00:49:06,348
He knows because he's done this a lot.

1217
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:08,948
You can sit here.

1218
00:49:09,018 --> 00:49:10,848
(Glancing)

1219
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:14,748
The button...

1220
00:49:15,518 --> 00:49:16,518
The button...

1221
00:49:17,018 --> 00:49:18,988
The buttons are done the other way around.

1222
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:20,788
He's delicate.

1223
00:49:21,998 --> 00:49:24,398
It was done the other way around.

1224
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,027
- The shirt.
- It's the other way around.

1225
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:27,227
(He smoothly buttons up even the different tuxedo buttons.)

1226
00:49:27,228 --> 00:49:31,098
He knows which side the buttons should be.

1227
00:49:31,938 --> 00:49:34,337
He's worn tuxedos many times.

1228
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,837
You have to fasten this at the end, but you don't have to.

1229
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:39,208
(He gets into his outfit smoothly thanks to Seo Genie.)

1230
00:49:39,378 --> 00:49:41,048
You're very useful today.

1231
00:49:41,648 --> 00:49:42,747
- Here.
- All right.

1232
00:49:42,748 --> 00:49:44,148
(He checks even the cuffs with delicate hands.)

1233
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:48,358
Did you take care of other celebrities before?

1234
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,117
It's my first time I've helped someone with the outfit.

1235
00:49:50,118 --> 00:49:51,258
I see.

1236
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,787
Then how are you so good?

1237
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:55,698
- It's because I wear them a lot.
- You wear them...

1238
00:49:56,028 --> 00:49:57,798
- You wear them yourself.
- Yes.

1239
00:49:58,198 --> 00:49:59,827
Please stand by.

1240
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:01,328
- Standby?
- Yes.

1241
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,338
(The performance before part 2 is going on.)

1242
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:07,268
(Singer Hong Jun Bo)

1243
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,877
- You should wear the tie first.
- No.

1244
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:11,648
The jacket first? Won't you wear it?

1245
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:13,378
Just the jacket?

1246
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:17,018
(They quickly get My Star ready to go up the stage.)

1247
00:50:17,478 --> 00:50:20,018
(He organizes the in-ear monitors for him.)

1248
00:50:20,648 --> 00:50:22,387
(Jacket)

1249
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:24,928
(Robe)

1250
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:28,728
(My Star is fully ready for part 2.)

1251
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:33,568
(They escort him back to the stage.)

1252
00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,868
(Let's go.)

1253
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:40,268
(The instrumental music announcing his entrance begins.)

1254
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:42,777
(My Star makes final adjustments.)

1255
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:43,908
You may go.

1256
00:50:44,978 --> 00:50:48,678
(I'm soon coming.)

1257
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:52,518
(Come quickly.)

1258
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:55,618
(Being playful)

1259
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:00,428
(I'll get going.)

1260
00:51:01,998 --> 00:51:02,998
(Exclaiming)

1261
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:05,628
(Nam Jin!)

1262
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:10,198
(Dancing)

1263
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,567
After the medley,

1264
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:14,307
there will be a song called "Resume."

1265
00:51:14,308 --> 00:51:15,438
- "Resume?"
- Yes.

1266
00:51:15,478 --> 00:51:19,208
After that performance, he'll take the robe off on stage.

1267
00:51:19,808 --> 00:51:23,218
(When the "Resume" performance ends, they have to take the outfit.)

1268
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:24,987
This is "Resume."

1269
00:51:24,988 --> 00:51:26,547
- This is "Resume?"
- Yes.

1270
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:29,657
He might just stand there.

1271
00:51:29,658 --> 00:51:31,087
You can just take it then.

1272
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,928
You can just untie the ribbon, and bring it.

1273
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:34,827
- We'll untie the ribbon?
- Yes.

1274
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:36,627
- I'll do it. Don't worry.
- Okay.

1275
00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:37,827
Why are you so worried?

1276
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,427
- Okay.
- You can just bring it.

1277
00:51:39,428 --> 00:51:40,598
(He's worried about the nervous older bestie.)

1278
00:51:42,238 --> 00:51:44,868
Things like this confuse me.

1279
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,338
Why is this confusing?

1280
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:48,977
Does he have to take it off...

1281
00:51:48,978 --> 00:51:50,937
or do we? That's important.

1282
00:51:50,938 --> 00:51:53,078
That should be communicated.

1283
00:51:53,308 --> 00:51:55,217
- Then how do I know this?
- He also...

1284
00:51:55,218 --> 00:51:57,218
tore it up before.

1285
00:51:57,578 --> 00:52:02,618
(The "Resume" performance is nearly ending.)

1286
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:06,928
(They're waiting to take his robe.)

1287
00:52:07,828 --> 00:52:09,497
You can go.

1288
00:52:09,498 --> 00:52:11,867
(Grumpy Secretary...)

1289
00:52:11,868 --> 00:52:13,097
(heads out.)

1290
00:52:13,098 --> 00:52:15,668
That was "Resume."

1291
00:52:16,238 --> 00:52:19,807
Please give Grumpy Secretary a warm round of applause.

1292
00:52:19,808 --> 00:52:21,108
I'll take the mic.

1293
00:52:21,938 --> 00:52:22,977
Anyway...

1294
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:24,808
(In charge of the mic)

1295
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,948
(In charge of the robe)

1296
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:29,578
(They take the robe well in perfect teamwork.)

1297
00:52:29,579 --> 00:52:31,178
Keep it well.

1298
00:52:32,088 --> 00:52:33,718
Please give them a warm round of applause.

1299
00:52:34,348 --> 00:52:35,917
(Grumpy Secretary is the best.)

1300
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:39,427
My Grumpy Secretary is very popular these days.

1301
00:52:39,428 --> 00:52:40,428
(They succeeded in collecting the robe mid-performance.)

1302
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,698
Thank you. Well done.

1303
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:46,767
(Grumpy Secretary return to the waiting room.)

1304
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,198
Eat it.

1305
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:50,298
The hanger collapsed.

1306
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:52,507
What? The hanger collapsed?

1307
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:53,508
Yes.

1308
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:56,178
The dressing room looks bad because it collapsed.

1309
00:52:56,278 --> 00:52:58,107
Why...

1310
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,747
Look at it.

1311
00:52:59,748 --> 00:53:00,778
You know...

1312
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:02,378
You know...

1313
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:05,487
- I watch all your works.
- Yes.

1314
00:53:05,488 --> 00:53:07,287
- Pardon?
- I watch all your works.

1315
00:53:07,288 --> 00:53:09,088
- Thank you.
- I watch them.

1316
00:53:09,158 --> 00:53:11,388
I also watched "Intimate Strangers..."

1317
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,188
and all the variety shows.

1318
00:53:13,688 --> 00:53:15,928
You have very good chemistry.

1319
00:53:17,028 --> 00:53:19,867
Take a picture with them while he's not here.

1320
00:53:19,868 --> 00:53:21,128
- Since he's not here?
- Yes.

1321
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:23,668
Please move aside.

1322
00:53:23,938 --> 00:53:25,467
She'll take a picture with them...

1323
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:26,967
- while Nam Jin isn't here.
- Take one while he's not here.

1324
00:53:26,968 --> 00:53:28,737
Hurry up.

1325
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,138
- All of us.
- While he's not here.

1326
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,608
(The scene of switching fan loyalty)

1327
00:53:34,648 --> 00:53:35,977
You can't take pictures with them when he's around.

1328
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,178
You can't do it around him.

1329
00:53:37,678 --> 00:53:39,218
- You can't.
- Can I take pictures?

1330
00:53:39,488 --> 00:53:40,747
I'm a real fan.

1331
00:53:40,748 --> 00:53:43,718
Quickly take pictures before he comes back.

1332
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:46,588
(Smiling)

1333
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:51,798
It's an honor to take a picture with King Jeongjo.

1334
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:53,527
Were you King Jeongjo?

1335
00:53:53,528 --> 00:53:55,028
- Of course.
- He was...

1336
00:53:55,698 --> 00:53:56,698
(The member of Jin Love knows all the works of Seo Jin.)

1337
00:53:56,699 --> 00:53:57,997
- Of course.
- "Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

1338
00:53:57,998 --> 00:53:59,307
I see. He was Jeongjo in "Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

1339
00:53:59,308 --> 00:54:00,807
I'll do this.

1340
00:54:00,808 --> 00:54:02,137
(Anyway, let's take a picture.)

1341
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:05,077
Let's pretend we didn't take pictures with him.

1342
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:07,308
We shouldn't talk about it when he comes.

1343
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:09,017
We should keep quiet.

1344
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:10,547
Me? I...

1345
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:12,647
I should focus on Nam Jin right now.

1346
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:14,587
- It's okay.
- We...

1347
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:15,657
He's coming.

1348
00:54:15,658 --> 00:54:18,118
(Moving quickly)

1349
00:54:18,928 --> 00:54:20,858
- Does he have more songs?
- He has one song left now.

1350
00:54:22,198 --> 00:54:23,857
There's one song left. Move it.

1351
00:54:23,858 --> 00:54:25,327
There's one song left. We should go.

1352
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,198
We have to go quickly.

1353
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:30,097
Let's pretend we're not even interested in them later.

1354
00:54:30,098 --> 00:54:31,368
- Okay.
- I mean,

1355
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,908
how can you like one person forever?

1356
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:36,708
Don't you think so?

1357
00:54:36,709 --> 00:54:38,477
(An idea befitting an icon of short-term dating)

1358
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:42,478
If you want to form a good relationship with one person,

1359
00:54:42,648 --> 00:54:45,318
you need other little relationships.

1360
00:54:45,918 --> 00:54:49,188
Don't you think so? You can't love one person forever.

1361
00:54:50,658 --> 00:54:54,728
(Meanwhile, the original love...)

1362
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:05,938
(My Star's hit song "Empty Glass")

1363
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,608
"Empty Glass" is the best.

1364
00:55:09,978 --> 00:55:11,478
Of course. "Empty Glass" is the best.

1365
00:55:12,048 --> 00:55:14,507
Even the great musicians approve of "Empty Glass."

1366
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:15,518
Right.

1367
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:18,788
I cry whenever I sing "Empty Glass."

1368
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:22,688
- It calls for alcohol.
- Right.

1369
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:24,958
After a broken heart...

1370
00:55:25,258 --> 00:55:27,388
or after a rental deposit scam,

1371
00:55:28,928 --> 00:55:31,427
I went to a karaoke room, and sang his song ten times...

1372
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,627
with tears.

1373
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:34,368
You held an empty glass in an empty house.

1374
00:55:35,968 --> 00:55:38,668
(It's a song with Kwang Kyu's painful memories.)

1375
00:56:08,968 --> 00:56:12,037
(Fill it)

1376
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:15,308
(In my empty glass)

1377
00:56:16,278 --> 00:56:22,577
(Fill it in my empty glass)

1378
00:56:22,578 --> 00:56:26,817
(Fill it in my empty glass)

1379
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:28,487
It's like going back to square one.

1380
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,218
After the rental deposit scam,

1381
00:56:30,918 --> 00:56:34,758
I didn't have money, and that feeling...

1382
00:56:34,828 --> 00:56:37,828
Life is, after all,

1383
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:40,867
Getting drunk while holding an empty glass

1384
00:56:40,868 --> 00:56:44,967
I thought, "Okay, let's pretend it didn't happen."

1385
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:49,137
"Let's fill in the empty glass again."

1386
00:56:49,138 --> 00:56:52,677
While singing that line,

1387
00:56:52,678 --> 00:56:57,718
I reset it back to the beginning.

1388
00:56:57,918 --> 00:57:00,548
I lost all my money...

1389
00:57:01,988 --> 00:57:03,458
because of a bad decision.

1390
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:07,928
I cried the most when I didn't even have money for hospital bills.

1391
00:57:09,228 --> 00:57:10,528
It makes me teary.

1392
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,298
Anyway.

1393
00:57:16,468 --> 00:57:19,468
Anyway, "Empty Glass."

1394
00:57:20,368 --> 00:57:21,938
There's something that "Empty Glass..."

1395
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,177
He's going to make fun of me again.

1396
00:57:24,178 --> 00:57:27,408
(Anyway, it's Kwang Kyu's favorite song that makes him cry.)

1397
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:31,048
This is a song I want to sing with all of you.

1398
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,117
"With My Love." Shall we sing this together?

1399
00:57:33,118 --> 00:57:35,358
(The final song "With My Love")

1400
00:57:35,688 --> 00:57:37,557
(It's the national immortal song.)

1401
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,428
It feels like yesterday when I sang this song,

1402
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:42,027
but it's been 50 years.

1403
00:57:42,028 --> 00:57:43,328
Let's sing together!

1404
00:57:44,558 --> 00:57:47,197
Okay. Let's go! Come on.

1405
00:57:47,198 --> 00:57:48,598
("With My Love" is still a great song after half a century.)

1406
00:57:49,638 --> 00:57:51,398
It's been 60 years since I started singing.

1407
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:53,107
Time goes by so fast.

1408
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:55,478
There's nothing more fleeting and regretful than time.

1409
00:57:55,578 --> 00:57:57,638
I always thought youth would last forever.

1410
00:57:58,378 --> 00:57:59,548
I regret all of it.

1411
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:02,947
Songs, life, everything.

1412
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:04,218
I regret all of it.

1413
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:10,457
(My Star has been with us continuously...)

1414
00:58:10,458 --> 00:58:14,488
(from 60 years ago until now.)

1415
00:58:16,658 --> 00:58:19,768
(Thank you for singing, Nam Jin.)

1416
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:22,267
(I want to sing...)

1417
00:58:22,268 --> 00:58:24,568
With everyone who came here today.

1418
00:58:24,768 --> 00:58:29,478
(and live with everyone for a hundred years.)

1419
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:31,908
I love you, everyone!

1420
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:40,748
(My Star's 60th anniversary concert ended successfully.)

1421
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:43,417
Well done.

1422
00:58:43,418 --> 00:58:45,257
(My Star finished a 2 hour and half concert.)

1423
00:58:45,258 --> 00:58:46,557
Well done.

1424
00:58:46,558 --> 00:58:47,558
(It had 29 songs in total.)

1425
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:51,697
Well done!

1426
00:58:51,698 --> 00:58:53,268
(Well done!)

1427
00:58:54,898 --> 00:58:57,398
Grumpy Secretary brought the hanbok earlier.

1428
00:58:57,438 --> 00:58:58,767
They were the emcees.

1429
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:00,308
- At first. Before it began.
- The two of them.

1430
00:59:00,438 --> 00:59:02,707
- It was nice.
- Seo Jin came awkwardly.

1431
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:05,307
I think Seo Jin gets very shy.

1432
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,107
I think he does.

1433
00:59:07,108 --> 00:59:09,418
He grumbles, but does everything he needs to do.

1434
00:59:10,478 --> 00:59:13,317
(They arrive at basement level 1, where fans are waiting.)

1435
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:14,517
- He's here.
- Nam Jin!

1436
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:15,557
Goodness.

1437
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:17,618
Nam Jin!

1438
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,957
(Nam Jin is here.)

1439
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,927
- You're here.
- You did a great job.

1440
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:26,067
Nam Jin.

1441
00:59:26,068 --> 00:59:27,767
- When did you come? Today?
- Hello.

1442
00:59:27,768 --> 00:59:29,937
I came yesterday.

1443
00:59:29,938 --> 00:59:31,238
You came yesterday.

1444
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,608
(Another of My Star's fan clubs with a long history)

1445
00:59:35,908 --> 00:59:39,507
(Nam Jin's World)

1446
00:59:39,508 --> 00:59:41,748
- Nam Jin!
- Goodness.

1447
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,917
- You're here.
- You did a great job.

1448
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:45,117
Nam Jin.

1449
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:46,687
- When did you come? Today?
- Hello.

1450
00:59:46,688 --> 00:59:48,817
I came yesterday.

1451
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,188
You came yesterday.

1452
00:59:50,218 --> 00:59:51,988
This color looks good.

1453
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:54,487
(The two men are outside their interest.)

1454
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:55,697
What do I do?

1455
00:59:55,698 --> 00:59:56,858
Hello.

1456
00:59:57,128 --> 00:59:59,998
(He puts on a kind smile.)

1457
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:02,697
- I have my shoes.
- Hello.

1458
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:04,498
- Hello.
- Hello.

1459
01:00:04,538 --> 01:00:05,668
Hello.

1460
01:00:06,038 --> 01:00:07,337
Goodness.

1461
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:08,537
You did a great job.

1462
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,107
Have a seat.

1463
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:11,938
- You look more handsome today.
- Goodness.

1464
01:00:12,448 --> 01:00:14,008
(An invisible wall)

1465
01:00:14,578 --> 01:00:16,347
(Feeling awkward)

1466
01:00:16,348 --> 01:00:17,617
You look so handsome...

1467
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:19,418
even now when I'm seeing you from the side.

1468
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:22,017
- You're just...
- Let me see.

1469
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,457
You're flattering me because we're recording this.

1470
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,327
- I'm not flattering you.
- That's right.

1471
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:28,688
- You're really handsome right now.
- Before...

1472
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,998
(Is that so?)

1473
01:00:31,158 --> 01:00:32,328
This is so funny.

1474
01:00:32,768 --> 01:00:33,927
(She notices Grumpy Secretary now.)

1475
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:36,067
Aren't they here with us? Hello.

1476
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:37,597
- No, you can talk comfortably.
- Talk comfortably.

1477
01:00:37,598 --> 01:00:38,907
- Be comfortable.
- Yes.

1478
01:00:38,908 --> 01:00:41,468
- The two secretaries worked hard.
- Right.

1479
01:00:41,568 --> 01:00:43,177
Secretary Lee and Secretary Kim.

1480
01:00:43,178 --> 01:00:44,777
I never thought I'd meet them.

1481
01:00:44,778 --> 01:00:45,807
This is fate.

1482
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,247
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1483
01:00:47,248 --> 01:00:48,248
Please take care of him well.

1484
01:00:48,249 --> 01:00:49,947
- It was really nice.
- Please take care of him well.

1485
01:00:49,948 --> 01:00:51,517
His face is shining.

1486
01:00:51,518 --> 01:00:52,817
I know, right?

1487
01:00:52,818 --> 01:00:54,988
(It's a little late, but they receive a warm welcome.)

1488
01:00:55,388 --> 01:00:57,257
Let's see the pictures. It's been a while.

1489
01:00:57,258 --> 01:00:58,718
Let's see the pictures.

1490
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:02,158
They brought the old albums.

1491
01:01:03,758 --> 01:01:07,497
(The fans carefully gathered...)

1492
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:14,408
(and brought along 60 years of My Star's history.)

1493
01:01:14,868 --> 01:01:18,807
(Starting from My Star's recording activities...)

1494
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:23,248
(to his TV appearances,)

1495
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:30,658
(his 60-year legacy is still vividly alive.)

1496
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:33,928
This is actor Choi Sang.

1497
01:01:34,488 --> 01:01:35,697
- Choi Sang?
- Sa Mi Ja.

1498
01:01:35,698 --> 01:01:36,828
Sa Mi Ja.

1499
01:01:36,858 --> 01:01:37,958
Who is this?

1500
01:01:38,328 --> 01:01:39,397
How many...

1501
01:01:39,398 --> 01:01:41,198
What year was this?

1502
01:01:41,228 --> 01:01:42,837
- This was 1972.
- The 70s.

1503
01:01:42,838 --> 01:01:44,038
(He's curious.)

1504
01:01:44,638 --> 01:01:46,268
Look at this.

1505
01:01:46,638 --> 01:01:48,837
What year is this?

1506
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:51,077
(Each page brings back memories from the past 60 years.)

1507
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:53,207
These friends were young.

1508
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,277
Right.

1509
01:01:54,278 --> 01:01:55,777
You were young too.

1510
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:56,978
You were young.

1511
01:01:58,078 --> 01:01:59,848
It's when I had just come back from Vietnam.

1512
01:01:59,988 --> 01:02:02,148
You took it when you came back.

1513
01:02:02,258 --> 01:02:03,657
I remember that time when I see this.

1514
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:04,858
(My Star right after he returned from Vietnam in 1971)

1515
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:08,088
They kept all the pictures until now.

1516
01:02:08,428 --> 01:02:11,928
Those efforts carried on until now.

1517
01:02:12,868 --> 01:02:18,138
I can't imagine how meaningful the memories must have been.

1518
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,707
You took this before you went to Vietnam.

1519
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:21,838
That's...

1520
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,938
- in 1967 or 1968.
- Yes. In 1967 or 1968.

1521
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:28,148
These are my movies.

1522
01:02:29,048 --> 01:02:32,147
- They publicized them in the press.
- Right.

1523
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:33,187
There were only newspapers back then.

1524
01:02:33,188 --> 01:02:34,588
- Right.
- There were no TVs.

1525
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:37,658
These are the ads in the newspapers.

1526
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:40,728
- These came before you were born.
- Right.

1527
01:02:41,388 --> 01:02:42,997
They're pictures taken before you were born.

1528
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:45,098
I'd have been born by then.

1529
01:02:45,328 --> 01:02:46,868
- You'd have been born?
- Yes.

1530
01:02:47,028 --> 01:02:49,497
This is the 60s.

1531
01:02:49,498 --> 01:02:51,737
- If it's the 60s, I wasn't born.
- Right. It's the 60s.

1532
01:02:51,738 --> 01:02:54,137
You're not 60 years old yet.

1533
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:55,437
- I'm not.
- You're not.

1534
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,937
- You're not 60 yet?
- He's not.

1535
01:02:56,938 --> 01:02:57,938
- He's not.
- Right.

1536
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:59,047
He's still young.

1537
01:02:59,048 --> 01:03:00,478
I was born in 1971.

1538
01:03:00,648 --> 01:03:02,947
- I was his fan starting in 1971.
- I thought...

1539
01:03:02,948 --> 01:03:04,217
It was when I came back from Vietnam.

1540
01:03:04,218 --> 01:03:05,318
That's right.

1541
01:03:05,418 --> 01:03:07,287
- That's when.
- You were born then.

1542
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:08,917
These are pictures taken before he was born.

1543
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,217
Way before.

1544
01:03:10,218 --> 01:03:11,887
(He's being treated like a baby for the first time in a while.)

1545
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,758
Look at this.

1546
01:03:13,788 --> 01:03:15,028
Fan club membership.

1547
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,397
The application form.

1548
01:03:16,398 --> 01:03:17,528
Look at this.

1549
01:03:17,658 --> 01:03:19,528
The membership fee used to be 50 cents.

1550
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:21,997
There were membership fees back then as well.

1551
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:23,367
Of course.

1552
01:03:23,368 --> 01:03:24,937
It was the first fan club in Korea.

1553
01:03:24,938 --> 01:03:26,537
(It was the first ever in Korea.)

1554
01:03:26,538 --> 01:03:28,907
It's the first fan club that formed...

1555
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:31,907
- after I debuted as a singer.
- It was the first.

1556
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:35,677
We probably were the first to go on a fan club outing.

1557
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:36,877
- We were the first.
- We were the first.

1558
01:03:36,878 --> 01:03:37,947
- Back then...
- We were the first.

1559
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:39,747
In 1971, we went to Heonilleung...

1560
01:03:39,748 --> 01:03:42,047
- after you were discharged.
- We went to Heonilleung...

1561
01:03:42,048 --> 01:03:44,717
- with everyone.
- Yes.

1562
01:03:44,718 --> 01:03:47,228
(Starting with the 1972 fan outing)

1563
01:03:47,588 --> 01:03:49,197
In 1972, we went to Nami Island.

1564
01:03:49,198 --> 01:03:50,757
We went to Nami Island again in 1973.

1565
01:03:50,758 --> 01:03:52,227
We went to Nami Island two times.

1566
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:56,368
(My Star has always connected closely with his fans.)

1567
01:03:57,368 --> 01:04:00,268
I fed him.

1568
01:04:00,738 --> 01:04:02,308
- It's all there.
- In 1972.

1569
01:04:02,608 --> 01:04:04,177
(Kim Yeon Ok, 20 years old at that time)

1570
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,077
- These people...
- This is Lee Su Mi.

1571
01:04:06,078 --> 01:04:08,048
This is Lee Su Mi, and this is Lee Mi Sook.

1572
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,077
- This person?
- Yes.

1573
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:11,317
(Even after 55 years, she looks just the same.)

1574
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:12,647
We didn't even have cars back then.

1575
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,317
- I wonder how we got around.
- I know, right?

1576
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:15,587
We took buses...

1577
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:17,288
to go to places.

1578
01:04:17,388 --> 01:04:19,428
I wonder how we all got there.

1579
01:04:19,928 --> 01:04:21,287
With Yang Na Ra.

1580
01:04:21,288 --> 01:04:22,627
How old were you...

1581
01:04:22,628 --> 01:04:24,457
when you joined the fan club?

1582
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,597
- How old were you?
- We were 16 or 17.

1583
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:28,168
- Really?
- I was in eighth grade.

1584
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:29,938
You were in middle school?

1585
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:32,508
Back then, it wasn't the age of media.

1586
01:04:32,638 --> 01:04:33,707
We would write postcards,

1587
01:04:33,708 --> 01:04:38,107
and we'd get picked on the radio...

1588
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,577
to decide the charts.

1589
01:04:40,578 --> 01:04:42,677
We send song requests like...

1590
01:04:42,678 --> 01:04:46,687
so and so by Nam Jin, requested by so and so.

1591
01:04:46,688 --> 01:04:48,918
They read that on the radio.

1592
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,288
But...

1593
01:04:51,258 --> 01:04:52,727
her name...

1594
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:54,358
kept coming up.

1595
01:04:54,558 --> 01:04:56,427
- On the radio.
- On the radio.

1596
01:04:56,428 --> 01:04:58,527
I thought, "I guess she likes Nam Jin."

1597
01:04:58,528 --> 01:04:59,997
I wrote it down...

1598
01:04:59,998 --> 01:05:01,528
and wrote her a letter.

1599
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:04,497
I asked, "Do you like Nam Jin?"

1600
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:05,667
She said she did.

1601
01:05:05,668 --> 01:05:07,038
That's when we started to meet,

1602
01:05:07,408 --> 01:05:08,408
and it led on to this point.

1603
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,877
- That's how you met.
- Yes.

1604
01:05:09,878 --> 01:05:11,077
What a fate.

1605
01:05:11,078 --> 01:05:13,008
It's been more than 50 years.

1606
01:05:13,508 --> 01:05:14,608
Seriously.

1607
01:05:15,748 --> 01:05:18,278
I used to live in a really remote village.

1608
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:21,117
I really wanted to see him,

1609
01:05:21,118 --> 01:05:22,557
but I couldn't see him...

1610
01:05:22,558 --> 01:05:23,988
- as much as the fans in Seoul.
- That's right.

1611
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:25,517
So I used my brains.

1612
01:05:25,518 --> 01:05:27,828
I should get married to a man in Seoul,

1613
01:05:27,858 --> 01:05:29,527
and I'd be able to see him often.

1614
01:05:29,528 --> 01:05:31,797
That's what I thought.

1615
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:34,367
So I married a man from Seoul,

1616
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:35,837
and came to Seoul.

1617
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:38,138
(Thanks to Nam Jin, he got a man from Seoul.)

1618
01:05:38,538 --> 01:05:41,107
(The devotion of the fans is just as fiery as My Star.)

1619
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:43,038
My first award...

1620
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:45,707
- I returned from Vietnam in 1971.
- Yes.

1621
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:47,947
- I won an award from MBC in 1971.
- Yes.

1622
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:49,117
- The Best Singer Award.
- Yes.

1623
01:05:49,118 --> 01:05:50,747
- The Best Singer Award.
- In 1971.

1624
01:05:50,748 --> 01:05:53,017
I couldn't have received it in 1971.

1625
01:05:53,018 --> 01:05:55,217
- That's why we didn't prepare.
- The MBC Best Singer Award...

1626
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:57,217
- in 1971...
- That's right.

1627
01:05:57,218 --> 01:05:59,658
always considered the contribution to MBC.

1628
01:05:59,728 --> 01:06:01,757
I had just come from Vietnam,

1629
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,897
- so the period didn't match.
- It was short.

1630
01:06:03,898 --> 01:06:06,068
- The timing didn't match.
- Right.

1631
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:09,668
Na Hoon A met the requirements to receive the award.

1632
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:11,938
I still remember this.

1633
01:06:12,038 --> 01:06:13,338
But back then...

1634
01:06:14,908 --> 01:06:16,208
Please give me that.

1635
01:06:17,138 --> 01:06:19,107
There were postcards like this.

1636
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:20,548
- Postcards.
- Yes.

1637
01:06:20,608 --> 01:06:23,247
- The small postcards, right?
- Yes.

1638
01:06:23,248 --> 01:06:24,347
Of this size. A single postcard.

1639
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:25,987
- Right. Postcards.
- Right.

1640
01:06:25,988 --> 01:06:27,788
- Postcards...
- We sent those.

1641
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:29,958
were the number one measure of popularity.

1642
01:06:30,718 --> 01:06:33,258
Contribution came 2nd or 3rd.

1643
01:06:33,528 --> 01:06:35,858
Contribution came after that.

1644
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:36,958
You received many postcards.

1645
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:38,657
Let me tell you.

1646
01:06:38,658 --> 01:06:41,368
It wasn't just more than the other singers.

1647
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:44,038
There was a huge difference in the number of postcards.

1648
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:46,137
- The number.
- We wrote the postcards.

1649
01:06:46,138 --> 01:06:47,337
I stayed up all night writing postcards...

1650
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:48,537
- and sending them.
- That's right.

1651
01:06:48,538 --> 01:06:50,307
That's why...

1652
01:06:50,308 --> 01:06:52,647
I couldn't have gotten that award...

1653
01:06:52,648 --> 01:06:54,648
- in terms of the contribution.
- In 1971.

1654
01:06:54,748 --> 01:06:56,778
But I got the award,

1655
01:06:56,978 --> 01:06:58,948
- and everyone was shocked.
- It was controversial.

1656
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:02,517
Back then, Na Hoon A was...

1657
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,587
- Don't talk about him.
- I mean...

1658
01:07:03,588 --> 01:07:04,957
He wasn't included...

1659
01:07:04,958 --> 01:07:07,027
- among the top ten singers.
- Right.

1660
01:07:07,028 --> 01:07:09,088
- among the top ten singers.
- Right.

1661
01:07:10,228 --> 01:07:11,858
It's true.

1662
01:07:11,928 --> 01:07:14,597
He wasn't included among the top ten singers in MBC.

1663
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:15,827
He was there.

1664
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:17,568
He was listed once, but never again.

1665
01:07:17,698 --> 01:07:20,007
I remember that better.

1666
01:07:20,008 --> 01:07:22,007
I remember that from my childhood as well.

1667
01:07:22,008 --> 01:07:24,207
Whenever I read the newspaper,

1668
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,737
Nam Jin and Na Hoon A were rivals.

1669
01:07:25,738 --> 01:07:28,707
- That's right.
- There were many headlines.

1670
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:30,718
- Right.
- That's right.

1671
01:07:31,018 --> 01:07:33,047
(Nam Jin versus Na Hoon A)

1672
01:07:33,048 --> 01:07:36,358
(The legendary rivals of the Korean pop music)

1673
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:40,987
(Na Hoon A and Nam Jin, lifelong companions)

1674
01:07:40,988 --> 01:07:44,027
(Na Hoon A and Nam Jin, lifelong rivals)

1675
01:07:44,028 --> 01:07:46,097
You had to say Nam Jin and Na Hoon A.

1676
01:07:46,098 --> 01:07:48,897
If someone said Na Hoon A and Nam Jin, it would create chaos.

1677
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,337
You had to put his name first.

1678
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:52,067
(A time when even the order of names caused a stir)

1679
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:54,938
Have you never met Na Hoon A's fans?

1680
01:07:55,238 --> 01:07:56,637
We met.

1681
01:07:56,638 --> 01:07:58,407
They had a fight.

1682
01:07:58,408 --> 01:07:59,408
What happened when the fans met?

1683
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,907
Even on other TV networks,

1684
01:08:01,908 --> 01:08:04,318
they were listed as candidates.

1685
01:08:04,778 --> 01:08:07,617
One of the two had to be the top.

1686
01:08:07,618 --> 01:08:11,388
So we all waited with flowers.

1687
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:14,727
When they said Nam Jin, we went crazy.

1688
01:08:14,728 --> 01:08:15,997
But those fans...

1689
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:18,457
threw things and cursed us.

1690
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:20,397
They thought they would win the award.

1691
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:22,298
We didn't just stand by either.

1692
01:08:22,738 --> 01:08:24,767
We went there...

1693
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,108
and grabbed their hair.

1694
01:08:28,168 --> 01:08:29,378
It's too much, isn't it?

1695
01:08:29,478 --> 01:08:31,478
- I mean...
- We'd fight.

1696
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,877
Because of those fans,

1697
01:08:33,878 --> 01:08:35,507
we had our heyday.

1698
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:36,617
Or else,

1699
01:08:36,618 --> 01:08:38,578
- I wouldn't have made it there.
- Right.

1700
01:08:38,648 --> 01:08:40,488
I wouldn't have made it.

1701
01:08:40,918 --> 01:08:45,518
A little after 2000, I was diagnosed with cancer.

1702
01:08:45,758 --> 01:08:49,528
And he sent me...

1703
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:52,997
an envelope.

1704
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:55,267
It wasn't the money that mattered.

1705
01:08:55,268 --> 01:08:58,237
It was the thought that he cared about me.

1706
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:00,068
I was truly thankful...

1707
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:03,178
and happy. I still am.

1708
01:09:03,908 --> 01:09:06,848
I was running a furniture store. One day it caught fire...

1709
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:09,878
and everything was destroyed.

1710
01:09:09,948 --> 01:09:11,918
Every single piece of furniture was lost.

1711
01:09:13,118 --> 01:09:15,187
I couldn't work for months.

1712
01:09:15,188 --> 01:09:17,658
During that time, he helped me.

1713
01:09:17,988 --> 01:09:20,057
Thanks to him, I was able to rent a larger space,

1714
01:09:20,058 --> 01:09:21,328
and I've been running the store there ever since.

1715
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,198
I'm truly grateful.

1716
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:27,798
I tear up like this whenever I talk about it.

1717
01:09:28,268 --> 01:09:29,737
I can't express how thankful I am.

1718
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:30,838
(I can't express how thankful I am.)

1719
01:09:31,038 --> 01:09:34,337
For 50 or 60 years,

1720
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:38,038
they've been staying by my side like family.

1721
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:42,878
It's a truly special bond.

1722
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:44,778
Our lives are built on relationships,

1723
01:09:45,678 --> 01:09:48,747
and we should repay what we've been given.

1724
01:09:48,748 --> 01:09:50,158
They really gave me a lot.

1725
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:53,527
I wasn't able to repay them as much as I should have,

1726
01:09:53,528 --> 01:09:55,987
but I made a heartfelt promise to myself...

1727
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:59,027
to spend the rest of my life...

1728
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,067
- giving back to my fans.
- Our

1729
01:10:00,068 --> 01:10:01,167
(My Star wants to repay the love he has received for 60 years.)

1730
01:10:01,168 --> 01:10:02,328
- Friendship - I've never heard of it.

1731
01:10:02,628 --> 01:10:05,467
I'm a fan of Nam Jin

1732
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:07,307
(Their time will continue to shine.)

1733
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:11,008
- You're the best.
- I'm a fan of Nam Jin

1734
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:12,408
A large bossam.

1735
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,247
- I'll have pajeon too.
- A large bossam.

1736
01:10:14,248 --> 01:10:15,578
And a pajeon, please.

1737
01:10:15,848 --> 01:10:16,977
- Do we get barley rice first?
- Yes.

1738
01:10:16,978 --> 01:10:18,477
(Today's dinner is bossam and pajeon for My Star.)

1739
01:10:18,478 --> 01:10:20,348
It doesn't come with kalguksu.

1740
01:10:21,218 --> 01:10:22,688
(Eating)

1741
01:10:22,758 --> 01:10:24,288
The rice is good.

1742
01:10:24,918 --> 01:10:27,488
- It's because it's barley.
- It tastes good.

1743
01:10:28,288 --> 01:10:30,127
I wondered why it came with barley rice. I understand now.

1744
01:10:30,128 --> 01:10:34,398
(They satisfy their hunger with healthy barley rice.)

1745
01:10:34,528 --> 01:10:35,867
It's good.

1746
01:10:35,868 --> 01:10:37,038
- It's good.
- Yes.

1747
01:10:38,098 --> 01:10:40,137
Since you tour all over the country,

1748
01:10:40,138 --> 01:10:41,438
you must know all the best places to eat.

1749
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:43,577
Do you know where I'm from?

1750
01:10:43,578 --> 01:10:45,277
Mokpo.

1751
01:10:45,278 --> 01:10:47,077
Do you know which region has the best food?

1752
01:10:47,078 --> 01:10:49,107
(Mokpo is known for its great food.)

1753
01:10:49,108 --> 01:10:51,478
It's hard to compete with the food in Mokpo.

1754
01:10:52,048 --> 01:10:53,888
My father was a gourmet.

1755
01:10:55,048 --> 01:10:58,317
His table was full of dishes.

1756
01:10:58,318 --> 01:10:59,318
(From an early age, he was lucky enough to enjoy great food.)

1757
01:10:59,858 --> 01:11:01,728
- Do you know...
- Yes?

1758
01:11:01,828 --> 01:11:03,558
what a cook is called in Japanese?

1759
01:11:04,398 --> 01:11:06,028
- A cook in Japanese?
- A cook?

1760
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:09,167
- It's called "itamae."
- "Shidabari?"

1761
01:11:09,168 --> 01:11:11,098
- "Itamae."
- "Itamae."

1762
01:11:11,168 --> 01:11:12,598
We had a Japanese chef at home...

1763
01:11:14,768 --> 01:11:16,577
when I was in elementary school.

1764
01:11:16,578 --> 01:11:17,608
(Even Young Master is surprised.)

1765
01:11:17,738 --> 01:11:18,977
The cook was from Japan?

1766
01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:20,947
Yes.

1767
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:22,407
My father was from the generation...

1768
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:23,848
that lived through Korea's liberation from Japanese rule.

1769
01:11:24,078 --> 01:11:26,218
If he were alive today, he would be 130 years old.

1770
01:11:27,348 --> 01:11:30,188
He would be 130. He was 50 when I was born.

1771
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:32,057
- You were a late-born child.
- Sorry?

1772
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:33,087
You were a late-born child.

1773
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,688
Yes. I had six older sisters.

1774
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:38,657
Your parents must've cherished you a lot.

1775
01:11:38,658 --> 01:11:40,297
(He was a cherished late-born son.)

1776
01:11:40,298 --> 01:11:42,627
My father ran Mokpo's most famous...

1777
01:11:42,628 --> 01:11:45,337
opposition paper back then.

1778
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:46,567
(His father was the head of The Mokpo Daily.)

1779
01:11:46,568 --> 01:11:49,537
My homeroom teacher was my tutor when I was in elementary school.

1780
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:50,937
Then...

1781
01:11:50,938 --> 01:11:52,277
- He was a crown prince.
- I'm sorry.

1782
01:11:52,278 --> 01:11:53,777
Earlier, you said...

1783
01:11:53,778 --> 01:11:55,107
you had listened to music on vinyl records at home.

1784
01:11:55,108 --> 01:11:56,647
- Yes.
- Having a turntable at home...

1785
01:11:56,648 --> 01:11:57,817
was uncommon back then.

1786
01:11:57,818 --> 01:11:59,247
- Even in Seoul, - It was rare.

1787
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:01,848
not many people had televisions at home.

1788
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:04,518
Paul Anka was a famous singer at that time.

1789
01:12:05,018 --> 01:12:06,757
There's a song of his...

1790
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:08,857
that I can never forget.

1791
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:09,858
(A song that made young Nam Jin's heart flutter)

1792
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:12,297
It's "Crazy Love."

1793
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:13,828
- "Crazy Love?"
- "Crazy Love."

1794
01:12:14,028 --> 01:12:16,537
(Crazy)

1795
01:12:16,538 --> 01:12:17,538
(Love)

1796
01:12:17,539 --> 01:12:18,568
It goes like this.

1797
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:23,508
("Crazy Love" by Paul Anka)

1798
01:12:23,778 --> 01:12:27,648
(He has a good memory!)

1799
01:12:28,008 --> 01:12:29,748
The song reminds me of my father.

1800
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:33,048
It was when I was in my 10th or 11th grade.

1801
01:12:33,848 --> 01:12:34,848
It was in the 1950s.

1802
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:36,587
We lived in a two-story house.

1803
01:12:36,588 --> 01:12:37,988
My room was upstairs on the second floor,

1804
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,988
and my father's room was downstairs.

1805
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,158
If I shouted from the 2nd floor, you could hear it on the 1st floor.

1806
01:12:45,358 --> 01:12:47,528
When I sang, I sang very loudly.

1807
01:12:48,268 --> 01:12:50,997
(His father heard him sing "Crazy Love.")

1808
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:52,907
So my father's comment about my song was funny.

1809
01:12:52,908 --> 01:12:53,908
I see.

1810
01:12:53,968 --> 01:12:54,968
Then he called out my mother.

1811
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:56,537
"Hey."

1812
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,107
(His father called out his mother in a rush.)

1813
01:12:58,108 --> 01:12:59,338
He called her out.

1814
01:13:00,308 --> 01:13:01,448
He was like, "This is bad."

1815
01:13:02,348 --> 01:13:06,017
He has never heard a song like that.

1816
01:13:06,018 --> 01:13:07,287
(His father was born during the reign of King Gojong of Joseon.)

1817
01:13:07,288 --> 01:13:09,048
He told my mother...

1818
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,588
to take me to the hospital right away.

1819
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:15,687
(His father was shocked by Western culture.)

1820
01:13:15,688 --> 01:13:16,697
Something like that happened once.

1821
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:19,097
I guess your father...

1822
01:13:19,098 --> 01:13:20,627
didn't scold you...

1823
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:21,798
for singing at home.

1824
01:13:21,968 --> 01:13:24,167
He didn't scold me.

1825
01:13:24,168 --> 01:13:26,537
He just thought I was just singing for fun.

1826
01:13:26,538 --> 01:13:29,237
He didn't think I'd become a singer.

1827
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,937
He was the son of a wealthy father,

1828
01:13:31,938 --> 01:13:33,047
born when his father was 50 after having 6 daughters.

1829
01:13:33,048 --> 01:13:34,147
It's a completely different story.

1830
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,178
How would I know? My family wasn't rich.

1831
01:13:40,448 --> 01:13:43,518
Why did he send his precious son to the Vietnam War then?

1832
01:13:45,918 --> 01:13:47,528
It was after he died.

1833
01:13:48,528 --> 01:13:50,157
(Flustered)

1834
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:51,258
I'm sorry.

1835
01:13:53,298 --> 01:13:54,597
(Laughing)

1836
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:57,237
If he had been alive,

1837
01:13:57,238 --> 01:13:58,768
he would've never sent you.

1838
01:13:58,998 --> 01:14:00,767
- Right.
- There was no choice.

1839
01:14:00,768 --> 01:14:02,368
The government sent soldiers. It was unavoidable.

1840
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:09,618
There's a movie about the time when you were young.

1841
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:10,917
- Right.
- "Ode to My Father."

1842
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:15,948
(It's a movie set during the Vietnam War.)

1843
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,957
(U-Know played My Star.)

1844
01:14:18,958 --> 01:14:20,587
What are you doing? We don't have time.

1845
01:14:20,588 --> 01:14:22,027
You're driving me nuts.

1846
01:14:22,028 --> 01:14:23,198
Excuse me.

1847
01:14:23,758 --> 01:14:25,828
(Are you Nam Jin?)

1848
01:14:26,298 --> 01:14:27,367
(We'd love to hear the behind-the-scenes story of a movie...)

1849
01:14:27,368 --> 01:14:28,397
(that attracted 10 million viewers.)

1850
01:14:28,398 --> 01:14:30,238
- I asked the director...
- Yes.

1851
01:14:31,268 --> 01:14:33,307
why he cast a singer to play me.

1852
01:14:33,308 --> 01:14:35,267
He said it was because he was from Jeolla Province.

1853
01:14:35,268 --> 01:14:37,207
I said it was a good choice...

1854
01:14:37,208 --> 01:14:38,778
to cast someone who could speak the dialect.

1855
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,747
The same goes for me.

1856
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:43,277
Unless I play someone from Jeolla Province...

1857
01:14:43,278 --> 01:14:44,377
If I try to speak with a Seoul accent,

1858
01:14:44,378 --> 01:14:45,618
it's obvious I'm not from Seoul.

1859
01:14:47,488 --> 01:14:48,947
(It's been 60 years since he debuted,)

1860
01:14:48,948 --> 01:14:50,417
(but he still can't speak with a Seoul accent.)

1861
01:14:50,418 --> 01:14:52,687
Have you never even had a phone call with U-Know?

1862
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:55,427
I don't think so. Maybe I've seen him once.

1863
01:14:55,428 --> 01:14:57,827
Do you mind if I call him?

1864
01:14:57,828 --> 01:14:58,858
I don't.

1865
01:15:02,068 --> 01:15:04,838
- Hello.
- U-Know, what are you doing?

1866
01:15:05,298 --> 01:15:07,967
I'm at a family year-end gathering.

1867
01:15:07,968 --> 01:15:09,737
- A family year-end gathering?
- He has a nice voice.

1868
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:11,208
You're busy.

1869
01:15:12,438 --> 01:15:13,577
I should do my best.

1870
01:15:13,578 --> 01:15:15,307
(He does his best even at a family gathering.)

1871
01:15:15,308 --> 01:15:17,348
Are you not doing a challenge with your family?

1872
01:15:18,778 --> 01:15:20,087
- U-Know.
- Yes.

1873
01:15:20,088 --> 01:15:23,588
Nam Jin is with us today for a shoot.

1874
01:15:23,658 --> 01:15:25,117
Nam Jin.

1875
01:15:25,118 --> 01:15:26,728
U-Know, how have you been?

1876
01:15:27,058 --> 01:15:29,857
Oh, my gosh. How have you been?

1877
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,128
Is everything all right?

1878
01:15:31,298 --> 01:15:33,527
- Everything is good.
- Okay.

1879
01:15:33,528 --> 01:15:34,528
(They immediately start speaking in their hometown accent.)

1880
01:15:35,728 --> 01:15:37,297
It's been a long time since I saw you.

1881
01:15:37,298 --> 01:15:40,467
But I always remember...

1882
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:42,007
how you portrayed me in the movie.

1883
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:44,137
- It was...
- You flatter me.

1884
01:15:44,138 --> 01:15:47,047
It was an honor to act out your life.

1885
01:15:47,048 --> 01:15:51,117
No. I hope you achieve...

1886
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:53,017
more success than I have.

1887
01:15:53,018 --> 01:15:54,347
- Thank you.
- Okay?

1888
01:15:54,348 --> 01:15:55,448
Passion Guy.

1889
01:15:55,788 --> 01:15:57,457
Kwang Kyu.

1890
01:15:57,458 --> 01:15:58,517
Passion Guy.

1891
01:15:58,518 --> 01:16:00,857
- Since we're talking like this...
- Yes.

1892
01:16:00,858 --> 01:16:02,888
- and Nam Jin is here too, - Yes.

1893
01:16:02,928 --> 01:16:05,858
please say the line in "Ode to My Father."

1894
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,467
- Oh, right.
- What was that?

1895
01:16:07,468 --> 01:16:08,798
Do you remember the line?

1896
01:16:09,268 --> 01:16:11,597
It went like this.

1897
01:16:11,598 --> 01:16:14,467
"Gosh, I'm popular everywhere, from the front lines to the rear."

1898
01:16:14,468 --> 01:16:17,537
Oh, right.

1899
01:16:17,538 --> 01:16:19,877
- I remember now.
- You said something like this?

1900
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:20,978
I remember.

1901
01:16:22,148 --> 01:16:24,777
Gosh, I'm popular everywhere, from the front lines to the rear.

1902
01:16:24,778 --> 01:16:25,917
(He portrayed Nam Jin perfectly.)

1903
01:16:25,918 --> 01:16:28,217
People recognized me even in Vietnam.

1904
01:16:28,218 --> 01:16:29,887
In Vietnam?

1905
01:16:29,888 --> 01:16:31,457
(He's very satisfied.)

1906
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:32,657
Happy New Year.

1907
01:16:32,658 --> 01:16:35,758
- Okay.
- Please say the slogan.

1908
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,927
Show them why we're Grumpy Secretaries.

1909
01:16:37,928 --> 01:16:39,027
(Saying it automatically)

1910
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:40,627
Show them why I'm Lee Seo Jin.

1911
01:16:40,628 --> 01:16:42,627
Show them why I'm Kim Kwang Kyu.

1912
01:16:42,628 --> 01:16:43,697
(They shout the slogan whenever they meet the original creator.)

1913
01:16:43,698 --> 01:16:45,168
Prove them!

1914
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:46,607
Yes, sir!

1915
01:16:46,608 --> 01:16:47,907
Are you going to show them this time?

1916
01:16:47,908 --> 01:16:49,538
- We're going to show them.
- Okay. Thank you.

1917
01:16:49,838 --> 01:16:51,308
- Bye.
- Bye.

1918
01:16:52,178 --> 01:16:53,847
He never hesitates.

1919
01:16:53,848 --> 01:16:56,247
- I feel...
- Okay.

1920
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:58,078
a deep connection with him.

1921
01:16:58,448 --> 01:16:59,448
He seems like a friendly guy.

1922
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:01,147
- He's loyal too. He's nice.
- Yes.

1923
01:17:01,148 --> 01:17:05,987
If I had to pick the most meaningful moment of my life,

1924
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:09,128
-Yes.
- it'd be the Vietnam War.

1925
01:17:10,198 --> 01:17:11,558
- When I was in Marine Corps.
- I see.

1926
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:14,298
That's what made me who I am.

1927
01:17:14,428 --> 01:17:15,668
Even to this day.

1928
01:17:16,968 --> 01:17:17,968
It's important to me.

1929
01:17:17,969 --> 01:17:19,808
Have you ever been beaten so badly that your anus tore?

1930
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,177
(Glancing)

1931
01:17:24,178 --> 01:17:25,808
I have.

1932
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,007
- You have?
- He had hemorrhoids.

1933
01:17:28,008 --> 01:17:30,547
- I had hemorrhoids.
- You had hemorrhoids?

1934
01:17:30,548 --> 01:17:32,277
(Secretary Kim has experienced it in a different way.)

1935
01:17:32,278 --> 01:17:33,947
It was when I was training in the army.

1936
01:17:33,948 --> 01:17:36,787
When I first went to Vietnam,

1937
01:17:36,788 --> 01:17:38,188
the other soldiers beat me harder because I'd had an easy life.

1938
01:17:39,558 --> 01:17:40,588
Well...

1939
01:17:41,058 --> 01:17:43,087
They started beating me on the very first day.

1940
01:17:43,088 --> 01:17:44,097
(Being a celebrity made his military life even harder.)

1941
01:17:44,098 --> 01:17:47,568
I couldn't even sleep because they would beat me if I did.

1942
01:17:47,898 --> 01:17:48,898
- Right.
- My backside hurt so much...

1943
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:49,898
that I couldn't even sit.

1944
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:52,967
In war, it doesn't matter if you're rich or an actor.

1945
01:17:52,968 --> 01:17:55,267
Education and fame mean nothing.

1946
01:17:55,268 --> 01:17:57,737
In fact, those things work against you.

1947
01:17:57,738 --> 01:17:59,608
They give others more reason to pick on you.

1948
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,777
I was lucky to have good parents.

1949
01:18:01,778 --> 01:18:03,578
I grew up carefree and fearless.

1950
01:18:03,848 --> 01:18:06,217
Then I became famous, so nothing could stop me.

1951
01:18:06,218 --> 01:18:08,987
Imagine going to war at the height of your popularity.

1952
01:18:08,988 --> 01:18:10,017
(At 24, in the prime of his youth, he went to Vietnam.)

1953
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,187
Imagine what it'd be like.

1954
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,988
"Am I shooting a movie? Am I really in the military?"

1955
01:18:16,228 --> 01:18:18,227
It didn't feel real at night...

1956
01:18:18,228 --> 01:18:20,298
when bullets were flying back and forth.

1957
01:18:20,598 --> 01:18:23,097
We went out on night ambushes,

1958
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:25,337
and each morning we returned, some of us were gone.

1959
01:18:25,338 --> 01:18:26,368
(Facing death every day made him appreciate life.)

1960
01:18:26,768 --> 01:18:29,307
That's the most valuable experience I have.

1961
01:18:29,308 --> 01:18:31,777
No matter what happens, when I think about those times,

1962
01:18:31,778 --> 01:18:33,947
everything seems okay, and it gives me courage to go on.

1963
01:18:33,948 --> 01:18:35,077
That's what keeps me going.

1964
01:18:35,078 --> 01:18:38,118
- You become fearless.
- Yes.

1965
01:18:38,348 --> 01:18:40,287
He didn't fight in a war,

1966
01:18:40,288 --> 01:18:43,017
but Elvis Presley joined the army during the peak of his fame.

1967
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:46,887
- He went to Germany.
- Yes, he served in Germany.

1968
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:47,987
He didn't go to war.

1969
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:49,927
- During the peak of his fame.
- Right.

1970
01:18:49,928 --> 01:18:51,457
You have something...

1971
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,857
- We have similar experience.
- in common.

1972
01:18:52,858 --> 01:18:55,967
Among American singers, Elvis Presley...

1973
01:18:55,968 --> 01:18:57,797
unusually starred in films.

1974
01:18:57,798 --> 01:18:59,497
He appeared in many movies.

1975
01:18:59,498 --> 01:19:01,737
- We have many things...
- Yes, you do.

1976
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:04,508
- in common.
- Yes.

1977
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:07,508
Do you know what he had done before he became a singer?

1978
01:19:08,348 --> 01:19:10,078
- He was a truck driver.
- Yes.

1979
01:19:10,618 --> 01:19:12,878
Seo Jin.

1980
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:15,417
You're a celebrity indeed.

1981
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:16,717
(I love Secretary Lee.)

1982
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:17,987
You're a celebrity,

1983
01:19:17,988 --> 01:19:19,257
- not just an actor.
- He's...

1984
01:19:19,258 --> 01:19:20,687
like a Hollywood music commentator.

1985
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:24,257
Not many actors have that much knowledge.

1986
01:19:24,258 --> 01:19:26,927
Just as you liked American music when you were young,

1987
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:29,267
I loved it as well.

1988
01:19:29,268 --> 01:19:30,968
- I can tell.
- Yes.

1989
01:19:31,368 --> 01:19:35,267
In our time, The Beatles...

1990
01:19:35,268 --> 01:19:36,907
- Right.
- took the world by storm,

1991
01:19:36,908 --> 01:19:38,237
but they were also influenced...

1992
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:40,077
- by Elvis.
- True.

1993
01:19:40,078 --> 01:19:43,277
They started out imitating his music and became the Beatles.

1994
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:44,348
Yes.

1995
01:19:44,448 --> 01:19:46,278
I think Elvis is the best.

1996
01:19:47,588 --> 01:19:48,718
He's annoying.

1997
01:19:51,118 --> 01:19:53,117
He knows a lot of random facts.

1998
01:19:53,118 --> 01:19:54,488
When did he study?

1999
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,958
I can't get along with rich kids.

2000
01:19:59,458 --> 01:20:01,727
- I love American music.
- Me too.

2001
01:20:01,728 --> 01:20:04,238
I saw you singing earlier.

2002
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:07,038
You don't use the trot singing technique.

2003
01:20:07,368 --> 01:20:09,707
I've never done trot as I said earlier.

2004
01:20:09,708 --> 01:20:11,337
I kept telling Kwang Kyu about it too.

2005
01:20:11,338 --> 01:20:13,378
"With My Love" isn't a trot song.

2006
01:20:14,778 --> 01:20:17,778
(They were watching his performance of "With My Love.")

2007
01:20:18,578 --> 01:20:21,888
It's not a trot song.

2008
01:20:22,748 --> 01:20:24,887
It's like "Suzie Q" by Lee Ju Il.

2009
01:20:24,888 --> 01:20:26,018
It goes like...

2010
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,488
(It has a blues rhythm.)

2011
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,458
Yes. It goes like that.

2012
01:20:29,628 --> 01:20:31,198
Soul, blues.

2013
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:34,527
It's soul.

2014
01:20:34,528 --> 01:20:35,927
- It's soul.
- It's soul music.

2015
01:20:35,928 --> 01:20:37,998
It has a soul rhythm.

2016
01:20:38,068 --> 01:20:41,008
This is trot.

2017
01:20:41,068 --> 01:20:42,907
(Tapping)

2018
01:20:42,908 --> 01:20:44,607
This is a trot rhythm.

2019
01:20:44,608 --> 01:20:46,107
- It's "enka" in Japanese.
- "Enka."

2020
01:20:46,108 --> 01:20:47,708
This is trot.

2021
01:20:47,978 --> 01:20:50,447
Trot refers to the rhythm.

2022
01:20:50,448 --> 01:20:51,878
The rhythm.

2023
01:20:52,118 --> 01:20:55,947
Mambo, dodomba, tango, jitterbug,

2024
01:20:55,948 --> 01:20:58,588
rock and roll, jazz, and trot.

2025
01:20:59,058 --> 01:21:00,527
- It's all about rhythm.
- The word "trot..."

2026
01:21:00,528 --> 01:21:02,187
exist in English?

2027
01:21:02,188 --> 01:21:04,597
T-R-O-T. The trot rhythm...

2028
01:21:04,598 --> 01:21:05,927
originated in American music.

2029
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:07,197
(Trot is a music genre that originated from foxtrot.)

2030
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:09,398
Let me tell you something. Do you know Sophia Loren?

2031
01:21:09,568 --> 01:21:11,067
- I do.
- She's an Italian actor.

2032
01:21:11,068 --> 01:21:15,137
What's her most famous...

2033
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:16,638
Italian movie?

2034
01:21:16,808 --> 01:21:17,877
"Bebo's Girl."

2035
01:21:17,878 --> 01:21:19,708
("Bebo's Girl")

2036
01:21:19,778 --> 01:21:21,308
Do you know the theme song of that movie?

2037
01:21:23,178 --> 01:21:25,218
The music has the original trot rhythm.

2038
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:26,548
Is that so?

2039
01:21:27,418 --> 01:21:29,548
(Tapping)

2040
01:21:34,058 --> 01:21:35,127
"Bebo's Girl."

2041
01:21:35,128 --> 01:21:36,657
(The rhythm sounds familiar.)

2042
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:38,958
This is the theme song of the movie.

2043
01:21:38,998 --> 01:21:40,297
That's "Come Back To Busan Harbor."

2044
01:21:40,298 --> 01:21:41,368
That's what I'm saying.

2045
01:21:41,968 --> 01:21:44,697
This is the theme song of "Bebo's Girl."

2046
01:21:44,698 --> 01:21:47,168
Give it a listen.

2047
01:21:47,608 --> 01:21:49,967
"Bebo's Girl." Listen to the rhythm.

2048
01:21:49,968 --> 01:21:51,908
(Focused)

2049
01:21:53,948 --> 01:21:56,047
(Thump, tap-tap, thump-tap)

2050
01:21:56,048 --> 01:21:58,048
(Thump, tap-tap, thump-tap)

2051
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:00,618
- It's nice.
- It's the trot rhythm.

2052
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:04,458
This is what I'm talking about. Do you know now?

2053
01:22:04,858 --> 01:22:06,258
This is trot.

2054
01:22:08,128 --> 01:22:10,828
Many foreign songs have a trot vibe.

2055
01:22:11,128 --> 01:22:14,327
Can you share the secret of singing well?

2056
01:22:14,328 --> 01:22:17,398
(Since you started the lecture, tell us the secret of singing well.)

2057
01:22:17,698 --> 01:22:19,498
Rhythm is the most important.

2058
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:21,638
Rhythm?

2059
01:22:21,768 --> 01:22:23,578
It's rhythm, the beat.

2060
01:22:23,708 --> 01:22:26,578
He struggles even more when there's an accompaniment.

2061
01:22:27,508 --> 01:22:28,577
He's right.

2062
01:22:28,578 --> 01:22:30,008
(He agrees on that.)

2063
01:22:30,118 --> 01:22:32,378
Secretary Kim, why don't you sing?

2064
01:22:32,978 --> 01:22:35,147
I might tear up singing "Empty Glass."

2065
01:22:35,148 --> 01:22:36,247
- "Empty Glass."
- Can you sing it, though?

2066
01:22:36,248 --> 01:22:37,718
- It's a tough song to sing.
- Make me cry.

2067
01:22:38,118 --> 01:22:39,688
I want to cry.

2068
01:22:41,388 --> 01:22:43,027
(He feels nervous about singing in front of the original singer.)

2069
01:22:43,028 --> 01:22:45,898
I'm so nervous that I can't sing. Nam Jin is in front of me.

2070
01:22:45,998 --> 01:22:47,668
- Sing it comfortably.
- Okay.

2071
01:22:47,728 --> 01:22:50,138
He looks nervous. He stood up.

2072
01:22:50,838 --> 01:22:53,368
(Looking for a mic)

2073
01:22:56,108 --> 01:22:59,307
(The dew gathering at the corners of your cold eyes)

2074
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:02,208
(Is beautiful)

2075
01:23:02,808 --> 01:23:05,248
(His voice became quieter.)

2076
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:07,118
(Teary-eyed)

2077
01:23:07,888 --> 01:23:11,318
(Immersed)

2078
01:23:11,888 --> 01:23:13,688
(Trying not to laugh)

2079
01:23:15,888 --> 01:23:17,627
I was so nervous.

2080
01:23:17,628 --> 01:23:18,927
- No.
- I was so nervous.

2081
01:23:18,928 --> 01:23:21,197
- You said you released an album.
- Yes.

2082
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:22,898
I understand why.

2083
01:23:23,368 --> 01:23:24,938
I understand why.

2084
01:23:25,338 --> 01:23:28,008
(Did the original singer approve it?)

2085
01:23:28,308 --> 01:23:30,478
You have a gentle voice.

2086
01:23:30,738 --> 01:23:32,608
Thank you.

2087
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:35,108
(No more compliments)

2088
01:23:35,478 --> 01:23:37,847
(He understands the context.)

2089
01:23:37,848 --> 01:23:40,517
I was going to set the mood, but you...

2090
01:23:40,518 --> 01:23:42,887
- No.
- You stopped me in the middle.

2091
01:23:42,888 --> 01:23:43,988
No.

2092
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:46,288
When Nam Jin sings the intro...

2093
01:23:46,858 --> 01:23:48,657
The dew gathering at the corners of your cold eyes

2094
01:23:48,658 --> 01:23:50,428
This is how he sings it.

2095
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,297
But you sang like this.

2096
01:23:53,298 --> 01:23:54,768
- Hey.
- Nam Jin sang it like this.

2097
01:23:55,298 --> 01:23:58,767
(A powerful voice)

2098
01:23:58,768 --> 01:24:00,567
- This is how he sang it.
- You try it then.

2099
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,767
- I just sang it for a moment.
- Do you think you can sing...

2100
01:24:02,768 --> 01:24:03,938
- in front of him?
- No.

2101
01:24:04,178 --> 01:24:06,437
- I just did. I sang one line.
- Hey.

2102
01:24:06,438 --> 01:24:07,608
(Laughing)

2103
01:24:08,078 --> 01:24:09,648
He won't make it if he sings like that.

2104
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:13,888
The competition is fierce these days. It's different from our time.

2105
01:24:14,088 --> 01:24:15,817
He's an actor,

2106
01:24:15,818 --> 01:24:17,788
so he just sang for fun.

2107
01:24:18,018 --> 01:24:20,328
I'm sure he has never worked extremely hard on it.

2108
01:24:20,658 --> 01:24:23,557
Since we got to know each other,

2109
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:25,728
I want to meet him and give him advice.

2110
01:24:26,558 --> 01:24:28,768
If he's willing to put in grueling effort,

2111
01:24:28,898 --> 01:24:30,367
I'll teach him and even beat him if necessary.

2112
01:24:30,368 --> 01:24:31,437
(He'll guide him with affection.)

2113
01:24:31,438 --> 01:24:33,398
(Nodding)

2114
01:24:33,438 --> 01:24:34,908
What genre do you think...

2115
01:24:35,538 --> 01:24:37,478
"Empty Glass" is? Is it trot?

2116
01:24:38,038 --> 01:24:39,478
- It's so sudden.
- I told you earlier.

2117
01:24:39,838 --> 01:24:41,378
I'll put it simply.

2118
01:24:41,548 --> 01:24:44,247
It's canzone. Chanson.

2119
01:24:44,248 --> 01:24:45,477
(It's an Italian canzone or a French chanson.)

2120
01:24:45,478 --> 01:24:49,188
Io son sicuro che per ogni goccia

2121
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:53,088
("L'immensita" by Don Backy)

2122
01:24:53,458 --> 01:24:56,888
(Singing)

2123
01:24:57,658 --> 01:25:00,798
(A canzone is a song like this.)

2124
01:25:02,298 --> 01:25:03,668
This is an Italian canzone.

2125
01:25:04,468 --> 01:25:05,898
It has this kind of melody.

2126
01:25:06,538 --> 01:25:08,137
- Is that French?
- I said it's Italian.

2127
01:25:08,138 --> 01:25:09,367
- It's Italian.
- Is it an Italian song?

2128
01:25:09,368 --> 01:25:11,907
A canzone is Italian, and a chanson is French.

2129
01:25:11,908 --> 01:25:13,578
A chanson goes like this.

2130
01:25:14,148 --> 01:25:17,478
(The human jukebox is in action.)

2131
01:25:17,848 --> 01:25:23,148
("Les Feuilles mortes" by Yves Montand)

2132
01:25:23,548 --> 01:25:27,188
(He's a walking turntable.)

2133
01:25:27,728 --> 01:25:30,358
Mais la vie separe

2134
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,828
(Smiling in admiration)

2135
01:25:33,098 --> 01:25:35,328
(Immersed)

2136
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:38,368
(Focused)

2137
01:25:39,368 --> 01:25:41,967
(He's a master.)

2138
01:25:41,968 --> 01:25:43,337
(He's a cult leader.)

2139
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:45,238
- You're like a cult leader.
- Yes.

2140
01:25:46,278 --> 01:25:47,847
- I also liked...
- I'm mesmerized.

2141
01:25:47,848 --> 01:25:50,107
- foreign music.
- I can tell.

2142
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:51,348
It's...

2143
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:52,818
Yes.

2144
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:57,358
I've been around a lot of older people.

2145
01:25:58,788 --> 01:25:59,988
I can tell he's sophisticated.

2146
01:26:01,758 --> 01:26:04,298
His thoughts, mindset,

2147
01:26:04,698 --> 01:26:06,798
and his style.

2148
01:26:07,168 --> 01:26:08,527
Everything is sophisticated.

2149
01:26:08,528 --> 01:26:09,798
(My Star is very sophisticated.)

2150
01:26:10,668 --> 01:26:13,938
Don't do this when your fans are around.

2151
01:26:16,168 --> 01:26:18,478
They won't be able to sleep.

2152
01:26:18,838 --> 01:26:20,078
Nam Jin!

2153
01:26:21,048 --> 01:26:22,477
The ladies won't be able to sleep.

2154
01:26:22,478 --> 01:26:24,547
- It was a special occasion.
- Right.

2155
01:26:24,548 --> 01:26:27,888
I did it because you guys were with me today.

2156
01:26:27,948 --> 01:26:30,088
- I've never done this before.
- Right.

2157
01:26:30,688 --> 01:26:33,387
I've never heard you said something like this on a show.

2158
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,858
I've never done it. I had no reason to.

2159
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:38,197
This is wonderful.

2160
01:26:38,198 --> 01:26:39,998
(It's an honor, sir.)

2161
01:26:40,401 --> 01:26:41,346
I was about to say a swear word.

2162
01:26:41,347 --> 01:26:42,845
In Jeolla Province, people swear when they love something.

2163
01:26:42,846 --> 01:26:44,456
- Yes.
- When they love it so much.

2164
01:26:44,716 --> 01:26:46,855
Today is crazy.

2165
01:26:46,856 --> 01:26:48,626
It's crazy.

2166
01:26:48,686 --> 01:26:49,956
It means it's wonderful.

2167
01:26:51,756 --> 01:26:54,126
How should I put it? I feel very comfortable,

2168
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:56,496
and I'm glad to meet you.

2169
01:26:56,696 --> 01:26:59,966
As secretaries,

2170
01:27:00,336 --> 01:27:02,266
they did their best to assist me.

2171
01:27:03,876 --> 01:27:07,706
(They accompanied him in every little moment today.)

2172
01:27:08,476 --> 01:27:10,946
There's a difference between doing something because you have to...

2173
01:27:11,216 --> 01:27:13,375
and doing it with warmth and care.

2174
01:27:13,376 --> 01:27:14,986
Everyone can tell.

2175
01:27:15,286 --> 01:27:17,486
I could see their sincerity,

2176
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:20,785
so I felt happy and content,

2177
01:27:20,786 --> 01:27:23,026
regardless of whether they were perfect or not.

2178
01:27:23,756 --> 01:27:27,166
I hope they can come again when they have time.

2179
01:27:30,196 --> 01:27:32,766
I'm glad he was satisfied,

2180
01:27:33,466 --> 01:27:35,736
but we did too well today...

2181
01:27:36,066 --> 01:27:39,406
which doesn't fit the theme of our show.

2182
01:27:41,806 --> 01:27:45,015
If only Mr. Nam Jin knew...

2183
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:48,315
how important managers really are.

2184
01:27:48,316 --> 01:27:51,256
Still, he trusted us completely.

2185
01:27:51,886 --> 01:27:55,226
Either way, as the host of this show,

2186
01:27:55,326 --> 01:27:56,955
I don't think I did a great job.

2187
01:27:56,956 --> 01:27:59,526
(Self-reflection?)

2188
01:28:00,196 --> 01:28:03,266
I kept thinking about how poorly I handled things.

2189
01:28:03,996 --> 01:28:06,266
I didn't give the show enough thought.

2190
01:28:07,136 --> 01:28:09,205
In the final episode, I'll make sure My Star realizes it.

2191
01:28:09,206 --> 01:28:11,876
(Next time, I'll make sure My Star realizes it.)

2192
01:28:12,536 --> 01:28:14,346
I'll prove why I'm called...

2193
01:28:14,606 --> 01:28:16,576
the Grumpy Secretary.

2194
01:28:17,676 --> 01:28:20,012
(Who's the next My Star getting the full treatment?)

2195
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:22,399
- Where is she?
- Over there.

2196
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,670
(My Star is waiting in the studio.)

2197
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:25,739
(She says to wait until her base makeup is done.)

2198
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:27,439
- Wait?
- Yes, wait.

2199
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,379
(Whatever. Come with me.)

2200
01:28:29,380 --> 01:28:31,050
- Come.
- Really?

2201
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:32,679
(Doing it my way despite My Star's request)

2202
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,850
Where is she?

2203
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:35,880
(Knocking)

2204
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,519
(Laughing)

2205
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,759
(You look fine even without makeup.)

2206
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,819
(Who's today's My Star that they'll prove themselves...)

2207
01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:44,030
(as Grumpy Secretaries to?)

2208
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:47,500
(My Star, Park Shin Hye)

2209
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,030
(Seo Jin teases you like crazy, you know?)

2210
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:51,600
(That you're just a powerhouse.)

2211
01:28:51,970 --> 01:28:54,470
(Teasing the close My Star is normal.)

2212
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:57,940
(You're old now. Too bad.)

2213
01:28:58,010 --> 01:29:00,209
(Don't tell me you're still here.)

2214
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:01,509
(Dissing again)

2215
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:02,879
(Taking care comes second.)

2216
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,679
(Fueling themselves comes first.)

2217
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,980
(A selective service, only doing things they want)

2218
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:10,220
(Still cheerful despite all the playful teasing)

2219
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:12,720
(Coughing)

2220
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:14,290
(Wasn't that Shin Hye coughing?)

2221
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,290
(Suddenly, My Star isn't feeling well.)

2222
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,400
Shin Hye has a fever.

2223
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,069
This is bad.

2224
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:26,370
(Take care of the sick My Star.)

2225
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:28,100
(What's good for the throat?)

2226
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,010
(How will the Grumpy Secretaries' first nursing go?)

2227
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:34,280
(I must have a doormat mentality.)

2228
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:39,110
(Little did I know what she was going through at work.)

2229
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,249
(My Star's childhood stories,)

2230
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,719
(straight from her mother)

2231
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,690
Shin Hye's the one hitting people now.

2232
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:48,687
(My Grumpy Secretary at 11:10pm on Friday nights)
