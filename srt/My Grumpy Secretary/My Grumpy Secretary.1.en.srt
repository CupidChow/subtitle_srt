1
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:13,543
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:15,944
(My Grumpy Secretary)

3
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:19,953
(Stars can't shine on their own.)

4
00:00:19,954 --> 00:00:23,423
(Stars reflect the light they receive.)

5
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:26,324
(From the movie, "Radio Star")

6
00:00:26,794 --> 00:00:28,923
Hello. I'm Rapper HAMBUGGY.

7
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:30,533
(On a grand stage, under dazzling lights, )

8
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:33,504
(our stars shine their brightest.)

9
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:37,233
(Behind every shining star...)

10
00:00:37,234 --> 00:00:42,504
(stands a manager who helps them shine even brighter)

11
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,773
(These 2 men with the average age of 55.5...)

12
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:48,244
(will take on a challenge of becoming managers.)

13
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:53,553
(The beginning and the end of My Star's day)

14
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,853
(I know this phase will end at some point.)

15
00:00:55,854 --> 00:00:58,954
(So I'm doing my best to make the most out of it.)

16
00:00:59,754 --> 00:01:01,093
(They catch a glimpse...)

17
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,334
(of their stars' never-revealed, genuine feelings.)

18
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:08,804
My Grumpy Secretary.

19
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,844
My gosh. Come on.

20
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:18,644
This is just ridiculous.

21
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:19,844
Hey.

22
00:01:20,444 --> 00:01:22,643
You were only in 3rd grade when I was in 6th grade.

23
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:25,013
(My Grumpy Secretary)

24
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:26,284
I will be your secretary.

25
00:01:27,284 --> 00:01:30,824
People say I'm a grouchy silver spooner without a heart.

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,493
They must be clueless because...

27
00:01:32,494 --> 00:01:33,964
I specialise in taking care of people.

28
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,693
I go to them when they call for me or even when they don't.

29
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:37,963
I'm always on alert and watch them closely.

30
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:38,993
I ask questions all the time.

31
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:40,804
Isn't that what makes a good manager?

32
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:43,063
Up close.

33
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:44,473
I just need to take care of them up close.

34
00:01:44,474 --> 00:01:45,774
(Check armpit sweat, white tongue, bad breath, nose hair, foot odour.)

35
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:47,044
My gosh.

36
00:01:47,344 --> 00:01:49,244
So you don't think I can pull this off?

37
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:50,973
(Could you wipe my back?)

38
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:52,774
(Your back?)

39
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:54,344
(Su Ji...)

40
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:56,784
(Come on, Su Ji. Don't be like that.)

41
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:59,954
(Could you drink the broth?)

42
00:02:00,684 --> 00:02:01,684
(Slurping)

43
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:03,953
(Laughing)

44
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:04,954
(It's tasty.)

45
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,294
(Slurping)

46
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:13,293
(Holding an umbrella over My Star)

47
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:18,773
(Escorting My Star to the red carpet)

48
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:25,544
(Flashing my dimples to My Star)

49
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,144
You're driving me crazy.

50
00:02:28,684 --> 00:02:29,743
(In a great mood)

51
00:02:29,744 --> 00:02:31,384
(Yes, that's me. I'm HAMBUGGY.)

52
00:02:32,554 --> 00:02:35,253
(Oh, I see.)

53
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:37,254
(I'm not going to do this.)

54
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,923
(The half-century-old manager is still learning the ropes.)

55
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,864
I will be your secretary.

56
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:45,434
I have 1.5 eyesight in both eyes.

57
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:47,364
I worked as a realtor for three years.

58
00:02:48,164 --> 00:02:51,134
I worked as a waiter for 1 year and a salesman for 3.5 years.

59
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,273
On top of that, I worked as a taxi driver for five years.

60
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:57,844
I've been building my career for this. For today.

61
00:02:59,374 --> 00:03:00,914
What's that in the front?

62
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:03,414
You rear-ended it.

63
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,153
(A premium driving service for My Star?)

64
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,583
I asked for a decaffeinated latte.

65
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:12,023
(When driving gets a little hard, )

66
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,164
(he takes care of them on foot.)

67
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,394
(He also comes with dance moves.)

68
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:23,534
(The soon-to-be 60-year-old can even jump into the water.)

69
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:25,474
I'll give My Star the best care possible...

70
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:27,604
as the manager.

71
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:30,544
I'll give My Star the best care possible...

72
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,573
as the best star.

73
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:35,244
(As the best manager)

74
00:03:37,814 --> 00:03:40,213
You have to say, "as the best manager."

75
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:41,584
Why did you say, "star?"

76
00:03:41,684 --> 00:03:43,383
I don't know. Really?

77
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,394
(Revealing his sincere feelings)

78
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,723
I see. I'm their manager.

79
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,193
(Chuckling)

80
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,194
Let me try that again.

81
00:03:51,194 --> 00:03:54,464
It's been a while since I last came to a TV station.

82
00:03:55,964 --> 00:03:59,074
(A man loiters around the lobby.)

83
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:02,143
I should take my blood pressure since I'm here.

84
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:03,574
(Laughing)

85
00:04:03,974 --> 00:04:05,043
What? My gosh.

86
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:06,143
An opening segment with a blood pressure machine...

87
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,244
is quite original.

88
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,484
I guess you often take your blood pressure.

89
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:13,514
I don't, actually.

90
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:14,754
- You don't?
- No.

91
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:17,024
My blood pressure is always in the normal range.

92
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:18,924
My blood pressure is elevated.

93
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:21,494
- Because this is your first day?
- What?

94
00:04:21,624 --> 00:04:23,594
I'm at the upper limit of high blood pressure.

95
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,463
- It's way too high.
- When...

96
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:26,693
(He pretends not to be nervous.)

97
00:04:26,694 --> 00:04:28,163
The bottom number is 70, so that's good.

98
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,604
(But he must be quite nervous as it's his first day.)

99
00:04:33,944 --> 00:04:35,974
Filming has gotten so easy these days.

100
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,613
- Things have gotten easy now.
- Right.

101
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:39,814
(The main camera seems small.)

102
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:42,744
But the weight of the camera has nothing to do with its performance.

103
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:43,983
- Right?
- That's right.

104
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,854
Small cameras perform better these days. Right.

105
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:47,453
- I think...
- You don't know...

106
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,024
the camera model, 5D, has the best quality.

107
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,253
- Oh, that one?
- Don't you agree?

108
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:53,094
I feel small in front of Seo Jin.

109
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:58,393
- Where have you been?
- Hey, you're in a meeting too.

110
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,293
- Why did you ask me to hurry?
- I'm waiting for you.

111
00:05:00,294 --> 00:05:01,603
This isn't a meeting.

112
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:02,833
People have meetings before shooting,

113
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,203
not on the day of the shoot.

114
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:07,074
I had a meeting when you were in the US.

115
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:09,203
We couldn't have one together because you were in the US.

116
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:11,513
If you already had a meeting, what were you doing just now?

117
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:12,543
- Just now.
- What?

118
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:14,144
Our outfits have similar colours.

119
00:05:14,844 --> 00:05:16,414
That's annoying.

120
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,183
- Should I go and get changed?
- It's too short.

121
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:20,554
- Should I...
- You know?

122
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:23,524
- The colours kind of look similar.
- Hey.

123
00:05:24,194 --> 00:05:26,223
- Kwang Kyu.
- We're both managers.

124
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:28,224
They won't recognise us. Managers can't stand out.

125
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,364
- We're managers.
- Did you wash your face?

126
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,593
- I did.
- There's sleep in your eyes.

127
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:34,364
(There's sleep in your eyes.)

128
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:35,904
It's in your eyes.

129
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,234
I...

130
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:40,643
- Gosh.
- What?

131
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,203
- Here?
- Yes, under your eye.

132
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:43,374
My goodness.

133
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,443
I often get eye discharge.

134
00:05:45,444 --> 00:05:46,444
(Hesitant)

135
00:05:46,445 --> 00:05:47,613
There's something in your eye.

136
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,583
- It's dirty, so I can't remove it.
- Why don't you help him?

137
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:51,284
- It's disgusting. I can't.
- My gosh.

138
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:53,413
- Where is it?
- Under your eye.

139
00:05:53,414 --> 00:05:55,183
- Be sweet and remove it.
- Right here?

140
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:56,454
- Did I get it?
- Let me see.

141
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:58,954
- Yes, it's gone.
- Are you doing that?

142
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:01,394
(Removing dust)

143
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:04,563
(Seo Jin takes care of his older bestie attentively.)

144
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,964
This is why I like Seo Jin.

145
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:09,833
(It's impossible to escape his tough-on-the-outside charm.)

146
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,534
- Didn't you get a tooth taken out?
- Today...

147
00:06:13,804 --> 00:06:15,074
Who told you?

148
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,244
(He wanted to hide his toothache.)

149
00:06:17,245 --> 00:06:18,873
- I...
- Anaesthesia wore off just now.

150
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:20,144
Why did you get it taken out?

151
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,383
I was supposed to get it removed a long time ago.

152
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:24,384
My molar had been torturing me for a year.

153
00:06:24,714 --> 00:06:26,184
- Did you not bring it?
- Let me see.

154
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:27,424
Where?

155
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:35,063
Take good care of me. I'm like a patient today.

156
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:36,763
He got his tooth removed on our first day.

157
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,033
(Tearing up at the thought of Kwang Kyu)

158
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,563
What do you have then?

159
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:41,534
You have no hair or teeth.

160
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,933
You got nothing.

161
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:46,003
(Seo Jin is the only one Kwang Kyu can rely on.)

162
00:06:46,004 --> 00:06:48,273
- Seriously.
- Help me out today.

163
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,443
- Help you? How?
- I'm not well.

164
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,444
Kwang Kyu.

165
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:53,914
There's no way we'd do a good job today.

166
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:56,213
(These two lacking men are the secretaries...)

167
00:06:56,214 --> 00:06:58,213
(who must take care of their stars.)

168
00:06:58,214 --> 00:07:00,453
Why don't we head out, so you can start your first day?

169
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:01,454
Okay.

170
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:05,224
- Did you bring your car?
- Yes, I brought my car.

171
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:06,953
- Your car?
- Let's go.

172
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:08,764
- What did you say? Your what?
- Your car.

173
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,833
You can't even hear well now.

174
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:11,863
- We're in big trouble.
- Yes.

175
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,334
(A cloud of worry hangs over their first day.)

176
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:15,163
Shouldn't you take off your hat?

177
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:16,234
Come on!

178
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,334
If you wear a hat, no one will notice you.

179
00:07:20,904 --> 00:07:23,074
- Do you want to drive?
- You should drive.

180
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:24,514
I should?

181
00:07:25,074 --> 00:07:26,574
I put you on my insurance, though.

182
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:29,113
(For his first day, )

183
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,483
(Kwang Kyu drove his favourite car.)

184
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:32,383
The symbol of success, Grandeur.

185
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:34,754
- Grandeur.
- Yes. This one is quite old.

186
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,383
(The symbol of success, the 2002 Grandeur XG)

187
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:38,794
This is 23 years old.

188
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:40,554
I got it in 2002.

189
00:07:41,364 --> 00:07:42,724
It came out in 2002.

190
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:44,594
- In 2002?
- Yes.

191
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:47,563
(The traces...)

192
00:07:47,564 --> 00:07:50,104
(of the owner's everyday life are a bonus.)

193
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,074
Since this is your first day, we'll join you in the car.

194
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:56,273
Kwang Kyu.

195
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,043
- What?
- This cassette deck is crazy.

196
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,444
- What?
- There's a cassette deck.

197
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:02,784
- Does it even work?
- Of course, it does.

198
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,814
You listen to aerobic disco pop.

199
00:08:05,954 --> 00:08:08,053
- Hey.
- Seriously. Why do you have...

200
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,883
- I don't have any other tapes.
- My goodness.

201
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:10,954
The cassette tapes...

202
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,224
What do you say? Should I play it?

203
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:18,434
(Inserting the tape)

204
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:22,333
(An upbeat work song comes out.)

205
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:23,764
You listen to this kind of music?

206
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:27,944
(Bobbing and grooving)

207
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,843
(Showing his dimples out of satisfaction)

208
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,314
Do you know the title of this song?

209
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:36,284
- "Twilight Zone." - What?

210
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:38,114
"Twilight Zone."

211
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:40,754
- Really?
- Yes.

212
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,654
- You didn't know, did you?
- I didn't.

213
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:44,453
(Heading to the agency to pick up My Star)

214
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:46,423
- Here we go.
- Let's start our first day.

215
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:47,664
Here we go.

216
00:08:52,134 --> 00:08:54,434
What's the identity of our program?

217
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:57,904
We already started filming.

218
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,973
You don't even know the agenda of our show?

219
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:02,173
- Then do you know what it is?
- And you don't?

220
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,803
(Missed aim)

221
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:05,714
You almost put the straw into your nose.

222
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,284
Come on.

223
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,214
What's wrong with you?

224
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:12,383
- Are you nervous?
- This is our first day.

225
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:15,424
Hey. I'm always nervous on my first day.

226
00:09:15,954 --> 00:09:17,793
You almost put the straw into your nose.

227
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,394
(Feeling proud after teasing his older bestie)

228
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:22,124
As the best manager!

229
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:26,093
There's only one thing I want from my manager.

230
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:27,134
What is it?

231
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,934
It's the ability to locate restrooms quickly.

232
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,933
- That's very important.
- I see. That's important.

233
00:09:31,934 --> 00:09:33,073
- It's so important.
- We spend...

234
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:34,504
a lot of time on the street.

235
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,944
We film a lot outdoors.

236
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:38,943
I'm so grateful when they find restrooms fast.

237
00:09:38,944 --> 00:09:40,374
I should know where restrooms are.

238
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:43,514
Here's the thing about restrooms.

239
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:46,254
The ones at government buildings are the best.

240
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:47,824
- Right.
- Yes.

241
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,153
My tip is find government buildings nearby.

242
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:52,354
(A useful tip in everyday life from his firsthand experience)

243
00:09:53,624 --> 00:09:55,894
Restrooms are clean and neat.

244
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,564
What do you know about today's guest?

245
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,864
- Lee Su Ji?
- Yes.

246
00:10:02,004 --> 00:10:03,303
I've been a huge fan...

247
00:10:03,304 --> 00:10:04,304
- after I saw her on "Gag Concert." - Really?

248
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,904
She's Lin Zhaoming. You know?

249
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,344
(Lin Zhaoming from "Gag Concert")

250
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,574
(Getting possessed by her alter ego)

251
00:10:12,744 --> 00:10:15,814
(Infinitely creating alter egos with perfect execution)

252
00:10:16,684 --> 00:10:19,053
(The master of alter egos, Lee Su Ji)

253
00:10:19,054 --> 00:10:21,183
You know what? I've been her fan for a long time.

254
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:22,923
She's so funny. It's entertaining to watch her.

255
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:24,954
Have you watched what she's been doing lately?

256
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,494
I watched one of her trending videos.

257
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:29,994
She impersonates PSY a lot.

258
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:32,133
(Source: YouTube, officialpsy)

259
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:36,933
(Try to guess which one of them is real PSY.)

260
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,703
- She won an award at Baeksang.
- Didn't she win...

261
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,004
- a lot of entertainment awards?
- She did.

262
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,274
(She won the Best Female Entertainer at the Blue Dragon Series Awards...)

263
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:45,543
(and the Best Female Variety Performer...)

264
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,013
(at the Baeksang Arts Awards.)

265
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,544
(She was the first entertainer to win an award at both awards.)

266
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:54,084
- She's that popular?
- I've seen her a lot...

267
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:56,424
- in commercials.
- She films a lot of commercials.

268
00:10:56,624 --> 00:10:57,794
The one for the online retail service.

269
00:10:58,054 --> 00:10:59,054
Darn.

270
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:02,794
(Meanwhile, today's star is waiting for them at her agency.)

271
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:06,333
Whenever I do...

272
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:09,063
(She's trying to memorize the script for the YouTube shoot.)

273
00:11:09,064 --> 00:11:12,273
That's the nickname for my fans.

274
00:11:12,274 --> 00:11:13,533
Mealies from three meals a day.

275
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,574
They're so precious like every meal.

276
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,574
I see a Carnival over there. Is that her car?

277
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,473
Are we here?

278
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:22,514
(They arrive at the meeting point.)

279
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:29,424
(Looking around)

280
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:34,263
- Hello.
- Hello.

281
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:36,193
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Lee Su Ji's manager.

282
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,294
Hello.

283
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,294
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

284
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,003
- Today...
- So you're always with her?

285
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:43,004
Yes. I go to all of her shoots.

286
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:45,433
I wrote down the schedule and a few reminders.

287
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:46,973
Please go over them.

288
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,373
(Handing over My Star's Handbook)

289
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,973
(My Star's Handbook: She likes to eat often...)

290
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,343
(in small amounts and prefers finger food.)

291
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:52,913
(She needs a fully-charged handheld fan since she sweats a lot.)

292
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:54,344
(Check on her when she's quiet or has no facial expression.)

293
00:11:55,244 --> 00:11:56,343
And...

294
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:58,154
(Chuckling)

295
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,884
- Can you see?
- I mean...

296
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,923
The first thing on this says,

297
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:05,393
"She likes to eat often in small amounts."

298
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:06,653
(She prefers finger food.)

299
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,763
The most important task will probably be...

300
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,594
getting her food.

301
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:13,263
Please look after her, so she doesn't get hungry.

302
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:14,333
It says "white tongue."

303
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,063
Do you mean the white coating on her tongue?

304
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:17,064
Yes, that's right.

305
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:18,303
Does she get that often?

306
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,834
No, not often.

307
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:22,949
(Held back a laugh at the subtle checklist)

308
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:24,774
He wants us to check if she has that.

309
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,643
- Here's a lollipop for her.
- I see.

310
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:28,843
Why does she need a lollipop?

311
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:31,284
I wrote everything down in the file. Please look it over.

312
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:36,253
This is for today's expenses.

313
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,493
- Pay with this corporate card.
- Okay.

314
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,524
- Make sure to get the receipts.
- Okay.

315
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,323
When you exit the parking lot, please use this ticket.

316
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:45,463
(Passing the parking ticket without even looking at it)

317
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,664
You naturally gave it to him.

318
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:47,963
(Fidgeting with it)

319
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:50,304
You took the card. But you're giving me this ticket?

320
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,833
You're going to drive.

321
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:52,974
- Really?
- Yes.

322
00:12:53,604 --> 00:12:56,074
(Handing over the parking ticket to the experienced driver)

323
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:58,074
And one more thing. Could you come over here?

324
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,914
You must always carry this handheld fan.

325
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,383
- Why is it so big?
- Gosh, that's huge.

326
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:09,453
You must always carry it with you.

327
00:13:09,454 --> 00:13:10,853
Make sure it's fully charged.

328
00:13:10,854 --> 00:13:12,953
There's the charger and the stand for it.

329
00:13:12,954 --> 00:13:14,823
- Please take this.
- Oh, this?

330
00:13:14,824 --> 00:13:17,023
- You can put in the stand yourself.
- I see. Like that?

331
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,193
Take this, please.

332
00:13:18,194 --> 00:13:19,594
Why are you giving me everything?

333
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,903
- Like this?
- Yes, take this.

334
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,464
(Smirking)

335
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,703
Take your time to look it over.

336
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,573
- I'll get off work then.
- Okay.

337
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,574
- Please take good care of her.
- We'll see you later.

338
00:13:33,574 --> 00:13:34,743
What a nice car.

339
00:13:34,744 --> 00:13:36,583
(Peeking inside the car to examine the inside)

340
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,383
(A quick break to see what's in Su Ji's car)

341
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,254
Busy celebrities spend a lot of their time in the car.

342
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,183
So I see a lot of stuff inside.

343
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:45,494
(Colourful and fancy costumes for her various alter egos)

344
00:13:45,594 --> 00:13:47,864
(A book for the mind is placed on the seat.)

345
00:13:48,264 --> 00:13:49,793
She has an entire box of snacks.

346
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:51,933
- She also has ramyeon.
- She has ramyeon?

347
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,934
The setup inside the car is definitely cute and useful.

348
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,704
Should we get going?

349
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,873
- No.
- We can't leave yet.

350
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,074
Our guest isn't here yet. Why would we get going?

351
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:10,443
(Their day already looks interesting.)

352
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:11,454
Gosh, seriously.

353
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:20,594
- Hello.
- Kwang Kyu.

354
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:23,064
She's here.

355
00:14:23,065 --> 00:14:24,794
- Hello.
- Hello.

356
00:14:24,934 --> 00:14:27,594
(My Grumpy Secretary's First Star: Lee Su Ji)

357
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,464
Kwang Kyu.

358
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:32,034
(She's here.)

359
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:36,043
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Gosh, our guest is here.

360
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,173
(Assuming the role of a secretary)

361
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:38,773
(Flashing his dimples)

362
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:39,774
Hello.

363
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:42,084
(Giving a warm welcome to My Star)

364
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,684
Nice to meet you.

365
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:47,283
(Clapping nonstop)

366
00:14:47,284 --> 00:14:49,883
(He's also clapping nonstop.)

367
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:51,693
We've met before, right?

368
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:54,824
(We've met before, right?)

369
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,564
Pardon?

370
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,234
I'm sorry.

371
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,194
Weren't you on "Talents for Sale?"

372
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:02,063
- Pardon?
- I was an MC on "Talents for Sale."

373
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:03,064
I'm sorry.

374
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:04,204
- You were never on it?
- No.

375
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,804
- No. We filmed it at KBS.
- Okay.

376
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,444
The cast of "Gag Concert" came onto my show.

377
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:12,844
Everyone came onto the show. Ji Min and Min Kyoung.

378
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:15,084
Yoo Min Sang too.

379
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:17,913
- I don't remember.
- Park Hwi Soon too.

380
00:15:17,914 --> 00:15:19,254
- Really?
- The entire cast was on the show.

381
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:21,154
Oh, right.

382
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:22,654
- I'm sorry.
- You were there too.

383
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:23,953
- Yes.
- You were on the show, right?

384
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,394
Yes. I was.

385
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:29,023
Gosh, she remembered.

386
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:30,523
- I'm sorry.
- Why couldn't you remember him?

387
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,064
I...

388
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:35,204
I thought you meant if we dated before.

389
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,204
That's how it sounded to me.

390
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:39,804
- That's possible.
- I see.

391
00:15:39,874 --> 00:15:41,943
- This is for you, Seo Jin.
- Don't do stuff like that.

392
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:43,043
Oh, please.

393
00:15:43,044 --> 00:15:44,274
- Stop that.
- Okay.

394
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,643
(Her first impression was quite intense on his mind.)

395
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:50,444
Gosh, you haven't changed.

396
00:15:50,884 --> 00:15:51,913
(Shy)

397
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:53,713
- Gosh, no.
- Nice to meet you.

398
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:54,784
- What's this?
- Gosh.

399
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:57,993
(Handing over a lollipop indifferently)

400
00:15:57,994 --> 00:15:59,194
(Laughing)

401
00:15:59,354 --> 00:16:00,953
This was in my car.

402
00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:02,623
- Your manager gave it to us.
- Really?

403
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:04,563
(Did his trick to bond with her work?)

404
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:07,233
Thank you. I only eat this when I'm shooting commercials.

405
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,863
- I don't usually eat lollipops.
- You don't?

406
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,333
No. It's only for commercial shoots.

407
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,773
I must make sure my tongue isn't white in the photos.

408
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,573
The file said we had to watch out for that.

409
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:15,843
Let me explain.

410
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,344
Does your tongue turn white often?

411
00:16:17,604 --> 00:16:18,613
(Politely asking a rude question)

412
00:16:18,614 --> 00:16:22,083
Here's the thing. I drink a lot of lattes.

413
00:16:22,084 --> 00:16:24,314
(Clenching her teeth)

414
00:16:24,954 --> 00:16:25,954
- So...
- Then that can happen a lot.

415
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,013
(Then that can happen a lot.)

416
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:28,723
(Studying her tongue)

417
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,883
But I drank an Americano today.

418
00:16:30,884 --> 00:16:32,953
If you talk about this, the viewers will only look at my tongue.

419
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:34,693
So don't bring that up.

420
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:36,323
Then I have to stick my tongue in...

421
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:37,663
- when I talk.
- So your manager...

422
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,263
asked us to check that regularly.

423
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,833
Why would you check if my tongue is white?

424
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,403
- I'll do that.
- What?

425
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,703
- Why would you do that?
- Your manager wrote that down.

426
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,373
It said we had to check your tongue and armpit sweat.

427
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:49,243
It's not the armpit sweat. My back gets sweaty a lot.

428
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:51,274
You have to keep drying my back all the time.

429
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:54,984
When I heard that you'd be my managers for the day,

430
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,454
I'm quite concerned.

431
00:16:58,714 --> 00:16:59,753
Concerned about what?

432
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,523
You're here as my managers.

433
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:02,853
- You know?
- Yes.

434
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:06,124
So I'd like to ask you how old you are.

435
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:08,094
(Our age?)

436
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:10,063
We're in our 50s.

437
00:17:10,064 --> 00:17:11,064
- Really?
- Yes.

438
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,893
- Should I just call you...
- He'll turn 60 soon.

439
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:14,364
He'll turn 60 soon.

440
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,133
- I'm sorry.
- No.

441
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:17,903
- I'll drive then.
- Gosh, as for him...

442
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,174
(She feels bad to have a manager who will soon be 60.)

443
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,804
- I'll drive then.
- Gosh, as for him... Here.

444
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:22,844
Here.

445
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,874
Hey.

446
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,884
(She doesn't know how to react.)

447
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,313
You're scaring Su Ji.

448
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:35,723
- No, I'm fine.
- Everyone in Korea knows that...

449
00:17:35,724 --> 00:17:37,083
- you're losing hair.
- That's right.

450
00:17:37,084 --> 00:17:38,393
- Right.
- It's okay.

451
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:39,653
He got his tooth removed yesterday.

452
00:17:39,654 --> 00:17:40,923
- He's missing a tooth now.
- Why?

453
00:17:40,924 --> 00:17:43,023
I got my molar taken out.

454
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:44,423
- So I'm not feeling well.
- Right.

455
00:17:44,424 --> 00:17:45,894
- Why did you do that?
- Yes.

456
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:47,834
I'm sorry.

457
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:50,664
- So...
- We'll be okay, right?

458
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:54,234
- Let me say this in advance.
- Okay.

459
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,973
What could he and I possibly do to help you?

460
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,173
- Right.
- We don't know anything.

461
00:17:58,174 --> 00:18:00,174
- Right.
- You have to lead us today.

462
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,613
- I'm doomed.
- You're on the rise.

463
00:18:03,614 --> 00:18:05,913
- That's why you're our first guest.
- No. I can't.

464
00:18:05,914 --> 00:18:07,014
- Seriously.
- You know?

465
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:09,253
I'll try to take good care of you two.

466
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,623
- So...
- We're not that bad.

467
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:11,753
That will probably happen.

468
00:18:11,754 --> 00:18:12,894
- Right?
- Yes.

469
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:14,394
- I see.
- Yes.

470
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:16,924
- All right. So...
- What should we do?

471
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,593
- Will today be busy?
- Okay.

472
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:19,893
No, today won't be busy.

473
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:21,333
I saw that we had to go to two places.

474
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,103
- Yes. The salon for the makeup.
- Get the makeup done at the salon.

475
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:24,203
But aren't you already wearing makeup?

476
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,674
I need to dress up for my character today.

477
00:18:27,074 --> 00:18:29,544
- For the shoot.
- It's for my character. Yes.

478
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:30,773
Should we get going? It's hot.

479
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,073
- Yes. I'm sweating.
- It's hot.

480
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:34,013
- You're sweating?
- I'll sit in the passenger seat.

481
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,043
No.

482
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:36,144
And...

483
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:38,853
- I brought a present.
- What's that blanket?

484
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:42,183
You're supposed to use wool blankets during summer.

485
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:43,854
My gosh. My back is sweating.

486
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,023
You're getting sweaty?

487
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,324
(My Star's back is sweating.)

488
00:18:48,764 --> 00:18:51,764
This set has blankets for both summer and winter.

489
00:18:52,134 --> 00:18:53,363
- Really?
- This is for summer.

490
00:18:53,364 --> 00:18:55,203
It's for summer. It's nice and cool.

491
00:18:55,204 --> 00:18:56,464
- It's for summer.
- Yes.

492
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,503
(Thin summer blanket)

493
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:01,573
- This is...
- Is this a rug?

494
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,073
You can use it as a rug or a blanket.

495
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:04,743
- This is nice.
- It comes with slippers too.

496
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:06,273
- Really? Thank you.
- Yes.

497
00:19:06,274 --> 00:19:07,543
I'll use them in the car.

498
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:09,483
- Right. Use them in the car.
- Yes.

499
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:10,614
- Thank you.
- Sure.

500
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,984
(Pressing)

501
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,523
Let me help you with that.

502
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:21,293
- You've never done it yourself.
- Come here.

503
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,724
How do you turn this on?

504
00:19:23,764 --> 00:19:26,763
- Oh, no.
- How do you turn this on?

505
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,363
I'm so sorry, but could you guys leave?

506
00:19:28,364 --> 00:19:30,163
- Wait.
- I'm...

507
00:19:30,164 --> 00:19:31,804
- How do you turn it on?
- Just press it and hold it down.

508
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,103
It's working now. You can pick the numbers.

509
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:36,204
I see.

510
00:19:36,774 --> 00:19:39,574
(Drying the sweat on My Star's back)

511
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:41,113
(Her hair is fluttering.)

512
00:19:41,114 --> 00:19:43,513
If you blow it on my hair...

513
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:46,083
When I get my hair done later,

514
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,224
you shouldn't do this. My hairstylist will yell at you.

515
00:19:48,384 --> 00:19:49,854
- I won't do that later.
- Okay.

516
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:52,994
- Get in.
- Should I get in?

517
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:54,293
- I'll hold that.
- No.

518
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,364
Okay.

519
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:56,964
- It's cool inside.
- Thank you.

520
00:19:57,694 --> 00:19:59,093
- Get in, Kwang Kyu. Let's go.
- Okay.

521
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:00,464
(My Star finally gets in the car.)

522
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,604
(The managers sit in the front side by side.)

523
00:20:06,034 --> 00:20:08,304
- Kwang Kyu, give me the address.
- Okay.

524
00:20:09,044 --> 00:20:10,473
- We need to put it on the GPS.
- Okay.

525
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:11,944
(They must arrive at the hair salon in Cheongdam-dong by noon.)

526
00:20:13,514 --> 00:20:16,014
(He can't see well.)

527
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:21,084
(Pressing with his finger)

528
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,424
Are you typing it on the screen?

529
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:25,323
What?

530
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,453
(Chuckling)

531
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:28,494
You can connect it with your phone.

532
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:30,923
- Do you not know how to do that?
- With my phone...

533
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:32,833
I don't know how to do that.

534
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:33,863
I see.

535
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:35,604
(His Grandeur doesn't support Bluetooth.)

536
00:20:37,364 --> 00:20:38,903
- Right here.
- I'll just drive.

537
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,374
- No.
- I'm serious.

538
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,573
- He's a good driver, actually.
- Really?

539
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,274
- He used to be a taxi driver.
- Really?

540
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:45,773
Don't worry.

541
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:46,973
(He manages to look it up on the GPS.)

542
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:48,714
- I'm doomed.
- No.

543
00:20:48,884 --> 00:20:50,313
- Don't give up already.
- Okay.

544
00:20:50,314 --> 00:20:51,314
- This car...
- Okay.

545
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:52,383
This car...

546
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,414
- It looks just like my car.
- Really?

547
00:20:55,084 --> 00:20:56,184
It's not the same car.

548
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:57,754
Is it slightly different?

549
00:20:58,694 --> 00:20:59,753
Her car is much better.

550
00:20:59,754 --> 00:21:01,624
I'm sorry, but when are we going to leave?

551
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,063
Did they tell us to go?

552
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:05,293
- You need a green light from them?
- Just drive.

553
00:21:05,294 --> 00:21:09,004
(Heading to their first stop, the hair salon in Cheongdam-dong)

554
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,663
We can exit this way.

555
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:12,203
- Why are you going that way?
- Really?

556
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,404
- The brake...
- It says the exit is this way.

557
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,103
- Just do what's comfortable.
- You can turn over there.

558
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:17,944
Really? Then why don't you drive?

559
00:21:19,114 --> 00:21:22,384
(This might be an uncomfortable ride.)

560
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:25,283
How should I call you guys?

561
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,413
Just call us by our names.

562
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:27,953
I can't seem to do that.

563
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,053
- Then...
- Add mister in front of names.

564
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:31,323
- I'll do that.
- You're already doing it well.

565
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,593
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

566
00:21:32,594 --> 00:21:33,924
Addressing you as sir is too much, right?

567
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:36,424
Well...

568
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,023
- Su Ji.
- Yes?

569
00:21:38,024 --> 00:21:39,663
- That's...
- It's too much, right?

570
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:40,863
- Of course.
- I'll just add mister.

571
00:21:40,864 --> 00:21:41,864
Yes.

572
00:21:43,864 --> 00:21:45,334
Put in the parking ticket.

573
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:49,304
The space is tight here, but you're good.

574
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:51,643
I have the Class One License for large vehicles.

575
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,474
(I have the Class 1 License for large vehicles.)

576
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:55,543
(Changing lanes)

577
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:56,643
(Honking)

578
00:21:56,644 --> 00:21:59,514
Sir, there's a car coming.

579
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:01,414
Sir!

580
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:03,153
- I saw it.
- Sir.

581
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:05,124
- Make sure to check the back.
- Of course.

582
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:06,823
He used to be a taxi driver.

583
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:08,823
But how did that car honk at us?

584
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:11,194
I think I might be late to my appointment.

585
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:13,994
Since you mentioned that we are running late,

586
00:22:14,364 --> 00:22:18,334
I'm going to pick up the speed now.

587
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,374
Sir, let me blow the fan.

588
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:27,474
Don't do that. It's not hot in the back?

589
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:29,884
- I'm fine.
- You are?

590
00:22:30,414 --> 00:22:33,254
My mom taught me to show my respect to the elders.

591
00:22:34,884 --> 00:22:36,084
I mean it.

592
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:38,853
I feel so bad. I can't do anything.

593
00:22:38,854 --> 00:22:40,253
No. It's okay.

594
00:22:40,254 --> 00:22:41,423
- Are you sure?
- It's okay.

595
00:22:41,424 --> 00:22:42,623
- Of course.
- Of course.

596
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:43,964
Don't worry about us.

597
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:46,034
- Get some sleep.
- Yes.

598
00:22:46,594 --> 00:22:48,464
- It's so...
- Then...

599
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,603
I don't like the GPS in this car.

600
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,433
It's nice and big. What do you mean?

601
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:57,844
The screen keeps changing on its own.

602
00:22:58,214 --> 00:22:59,814
By the way, it's an honour.

603
00:23:00,444 --> 00:23:02,684
- What do you mean?
- That I'm filming with you two.

604
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:05,783
We met through a TV show.

605
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,983
- Do I have to go this way?
- You have to go straight.

606
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:09,453
What? We're heading to Anyang.

607
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:10,823
Right. Shouldn't we go this way?

608
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,453
- You took the wrong path.
- Take the Olympic Expressway.

609
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:13,593
- Go straight first. Yes.
- Go straight?

610
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:15,024
- It's for the Olympic Expressway?
- Yes.

611
00:23:16,064 --> 00:23:17,493
Gosh, don't worry.

612
00:23:17,494 --> 00:23:19,493
Hold on. This isn't the right way.

613
00:23:19,494 --> 00:23:20,633
I guess we must go this way since there's traffic.

614
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:22,763
- No. This is heading to Mok-dong.
- What?

615
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:24,363
- No.
- No, I'm right.

616
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:26,133
- It's okay.
- Let me get out.

617
00:23:26,134 --> 00:23:27,533
No. It's fine.

618
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:29,403
We'll just get on the Olympic Expressway from here.

619
00:23:29,404 --> 00:23:30,644
Why are we taking a detour?

620
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:32,743
- The GPS...
- Gangbyeon Expressway is congested.

621
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,513
- So we're taking this expressway.
- That must be it.

622
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:36,784
(They're going the right way.)

623
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:41,314
You should reduce the speed.

624
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:43,723
(Feigned laughter)

625
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:45,054
The road is curved here.

626
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:49,324
When Su Ji was being a backseat driver today,

627
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:52,364
I realised that...

628
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,933
I shouldn't bother people while driving...

629
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,304
and I should just let them be.

630
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:57,863
It's the same thing...

631
00:23:57,864 --> 00:23:59,934
as asking someone to study when they were about to.

632
00:24:00,174 --> 00:24:03,444
I nagged my manager this morning.

633
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:06,144
Today,

634
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:08,513
you're filming...

635
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,043
the YouTube channel as your alter ego, right?

636
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:12,053
That's right.

637
00:24:12,054 --> 00:24:14,254
Do you know what my YouTube channel is?

638
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:17,254
Of course.

639
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:19,354
- I know about it.
- Tell me then.

640
00:24:19,654 --> 00:24:21,253
You're HAMBUGGY.

641
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:22,464
What's the name of my channel?

642
00:24:22,924 --> 00:24:24,664
The name of your channel?

643
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:26,594
What's the name of my channel?

644
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:29,264
(Sensing a crisis)

645
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:31,104
(Chuckling)

646
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,503
- Hey.
- What?

647
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,804
(Look it up.)

648
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:38,143
(Reaching in)

649
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,443
(Using his phone to look it up)

650
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:41,444
(She can't see his phone.)

651
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:43,414
- Hold on. Let me think about it.
- Okay.

652
00:24:44,044 --> 00:24:46,154
(Ironclad security)

653
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,754
I'm sure we know what it is. Right?

654
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:54,454
(Quickly typing without letting My Star know)

655
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:56,993
(Hurry up.)

656
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:59,234
(Find it already.)

657
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,334
Isn't it Hot Issue Ji?

658
00:25:01,664 --> 00:25:02,664
(That's it, right?)

659
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,703
Yes. That's right. Show me that you're a subscriber.

660
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:09,074
(Show me that you're a subscriber.)

661
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:10,973
What? A subscriber?

662
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,044
(A subscriber?)

663
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:14,514
(Trailing off)

664
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:17,084
Let me see if you subscribed.

665
00:25:18,014 --> 00:25:19,654
(Quickly subscribing to it)

666
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:21,184
I'm a subscriber.

667
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,454
Let me see.

668
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:25,593
(Confidently showing it to her)

669
00:25:25,594 --> 00:25:27,024
You subscribed to it just now.

670
00:25:27,154 --> 00:25:29,064
(Bullseye)

671
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:30,964
No.

672
00:25:31,524 --> 00:25:33,594
I was a subscriber, but I didn't know about it.

673
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,004
- Really?
- Yes.

674
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:38,804
(Being quick on their feet is a must-have skill for secretaries.)

675
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:43,344
(It's all good. I made My Star laugh.)

676
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:46,274
Do you not watch "Saturday Night Live Korea" anymore?

677
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:49,014
I stopped once it moved to the Coupang platform.

678
00:25:49,284 --> 00:25:50,513
- You didn't watch it?
- I stopped then.

679
00:25:50,514 --> 00:25:52,513
I joined the show after it moved to that platform.

680
00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:53,953
- Right.
- I'll get some sleep.

681
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:55,023
What?

682
00:25:55,024 --> 00:25:57,054
But I'm friends with Dong Yeob.

683
00:25:57,584 --> 00:25:59,053
- You must watch your friend's show.
- What?

684
00:25:59,054 --> 00:26:01,354
So he asked me to be on the show too.

685
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:03,194
Is the show still airing?

686
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:04,663
We're on a break now.

687
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,734
- This is the off-season?
- That's right.

688
00:26:07,064 --> 00:26:09,234
- We're doing "Office Workers" now.
- Okay.

689
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:11,873
It's a show about office workers.

690
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,734
You guys didn't watch it, right?

691
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:17,004
(Trying to hold back their laughter)

692
00:26:17,574 --> 00:26:19,614
Have you watched...

693
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:22,044
any of my recent characters?

694
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,313
Recently, your performance with PSY went viral.

695
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:25,914
- Oh, the one at PSY's concert?
- Yes.

696
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,814
- Then how about Jamie Mom?
- Okay.

697
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:29,824
I watched that one.

698
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:30,824
- Really?
- Of course.

699
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:33,754
- Everyone watched that.
- I don't think he did.

700
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:35,394
You didn't?

701
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:37,694
You don't know Jamie Mom?

702
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:39,394
Don't do that.

703
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:41,934
- Seo Jin, you shouldn't hurry.
- My gosh.

704
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,964
- That's...
- You don't know this skit?

705
00:26:44,564 --> 00:26:46,403
At least one of us knows. That's good.

706
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,634
- I don't have to...
- Then how about this one?

707
00:26:48,004 --> 00:26:49,404
BUGGY, BUGGY, HAM

708
00:26:50,004 --> 00:26:51,814
(Yummy)

709
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:53,544
(Yummy)

710
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:57,614
(Chuckling)

711
00:26:57,714 --> 00:26:59,953
(It looks they've never heard of it before.)

712
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:00,983
Sexy food...

713
00:27:00,984 --> 00:27:02,584
(Scratching)

714
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:05,523
Sexy food...

715
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,553
(Trailing off)

716
00:27:07,554 --> 00:27:08,724
What else?

717
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:12,134
It's tiring now.

718
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,563
You sounded like you knew a lot about her. That's all?

719
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:17,363
I only watched short clips.

720
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:19,173
- I watched all of her clips.
- Drop me off on the side.

721
00:27:19,174 --> 00:27:20,703
- I'll take a cab.
- No.

722
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,733
- I'm serious.
- What?

723
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,644
I might have better luck interacting with the taxi driver.

724
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:25,004
I'm serious.

725
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:28,213
- I mean... The two of you...
- I'm focused on driving.

726
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,914
- I watched everything.
- Did you really?

727
00:27:31,244 --> 00:27:33,314
Then play one of HAMBUGGY's songs.

728
00:27:33,914 --> 00:27:35,224
- HAMBUGGY?
- Play it in the car.

729
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,183
- Mr. Seo Jin.
- Hold on.

730
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:39,494
Play "Sexy food" by HAMBUGGY.

731
00:27:40,154 --> 00:27:41,154
(BUGGY, BUGGY, HAM)

732
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,233
(Looking it up on YouTube)

733
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:49,004
- What...
- HAMBUGGY's livestream?

734
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:51,734
Yes?

735
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:53,073
- Hey.
- What?

736
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:55,404
Hey. We sound so old.

737
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:57,343
No, not that. Play the song.

738
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,973
- You studied abroad.
- Stream the song.

739
00:27:58,974 --> 00:28:01,274
Stream the song? I don't have a streaming app.

740
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:04,913
Go to the search engine.

741
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:06,813
Type in, "Sexy Food."

742
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:09,223
- On where? On YouTube?
- Just any search engine.

743
00:28:09,224 --> 00:28:10,423
Just go to the streaming website.

744
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:12,954
- I don't have an ID on there.
- Go to Genie.

745
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:14,323
Really?

746
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:16,023
- Then go to YouTube.
- What?

747
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:17,593
Do you still listen to music...

748
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:19,063
- through the vinyl records?
- What?

749
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,064
What?

750
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,263
- Cassette tapes.
- Do you listen to tapes and CDs?

751
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:24,164
- I sometimes listen to tapes.
- Cassette tapes.

752
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:26,133
Hello. I'm Rapper HAMBUGGY.

753
00:28:26,134 --> 00:28:27,134
- Is this it?
- What's this now?

754
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:29,474
- There it is.
- I see. Is it from that time?

755
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,203
Great. We can listen to that.

756
00:28:31,204 --> 00:28:33,514
I'll sing it live. You can listen to it.

757
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:34,874
Check it out.

758
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,143
(Surprised)

759
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:39,314
I like the melody.

760
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,384
(Turning into HAMBUGGY right away)

761
00:28:43,554 --> 00:28:45,753
Bibimbap, sushi, mulhoe, tteokbokki

762
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:47,924
- Pad thai, curry, tacos, it's good - I've heard of it.

763
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:50,523
(Ice cream, chocolate, malatang, hamburger)

764
00:28:50,524 --> 00:28:52,163
(Pizza, gimbap, bubble tea)

765
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:53,963
(Okonomiyaki)

766
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:55,934
(Yummy)

767
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:59,404
(The oldies listen to a trendy song for the first time.)

768
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:02,404
(Confused)

769
00:29:03,504 --> 00:29:06,473
(He doesn't know where to look.)

770
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:08,374
Who makes this?

771
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:09,914
(Sexy food)

772
00:29:12,154 --> 00:29:13,553
(Star Su Ji sings "Sexy Food" just for them)

773
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:14,984
Everyone, sing it.

774
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,053
Sexy food

775
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,454
(Nodding)

776
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:20,893
- Everyone, sing it. Sexy food - Sexy poo

777
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:22,194
(Sexy poo)

778
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,394
- Sexy food - Sexy poo

779
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:27,594
(Absorbed in the song)

780
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,834
(Flinching)

781
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:33,274
Sexy food

782
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:35,674
What did you think?

783
00:29:36,544 --> 00:29:38,304
- This is impressive.
- This is amazing.

784
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,984
I didn't know she had alter egos or that she even created them.

785
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:45,684
Dealing with energetic guests is hard on us.

786
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,083
- We listened to HAMBOGGY.
- It's HAMBUGGY.

787
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:49,883
What? It's HAMBUGGY? Which one is it?

788
00:29:49,884 --> 00:29:51,383
- HAMBOGGY.
- What? It's HAMBUGGY?

789
00:29:51,384 --> 00:29:52,893
- It's not HAMBOGGY.
- He had it wrong the whole time.

790
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:53,954
I don't know.

791
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:56,523
- You're not sleepy, right?
- Gosh, no.

792
00:29:56,524 --> 00:29:58,763
Do you want to have coffee later? What would you like?

793
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:01,663
Then there's a cafe around the hair salon.

794
00:30:01,664 --> 00:30:03,433
It's called Stripe Coffee.

795
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:06,273
Could you go and get a decaffeinated latte?

796
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:08,704
- Of course.
- Do you know what it is?

797
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:11,704
Did you hear the name of the cafe?

798
00:30:12,074 --> 00:30:13,144
Where?

799
00:30:15,784 --> 00:30:18,143
- I'll just drink instant coffee.
- No.

800
00:30:18,144 --> 00:30:19,813
- I'll get it at the salon.
- We can get you the latte.

801
00:30:19,814 --> 00:30:21,183
- Really?
- Yes.

802
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,853
Was it Strike?

803
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,223
- Strike?
- What was it?

804
00:30:24,224 --> 00:30:25,453
Let's forget about it.

805
00:30:25,454 --> 00:30:26,723
- I won't tell you what it is.
- Su Ji. No.

806
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,663
- No lattes. I'm really fine.
- This guy...

807
00:30:28,664 --> 00:30:30,363
He's not good with English. That's all.

808
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:31,623
I just won't drink any latte.

809
00:30:31,624 --> 00:30:33,393
- No.
- He gets anxious about English.

810
00:30:33,394 --> 00:30:34,593
Does Strite Cafe have that?

811
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:36,863
- It's Stripe.
- I won't ask for any coffee.

812
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:38,203
- You know what it means, right?
- No coffee.

813
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,704
Like the stripe pattern. Okay?

814
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:41,674
We need to have lunch, right?

815
00:30:41,774 --> 00:30:43,244
- Oh, lunch?
- Yes.

816
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:46,543
Should we eat sundae soup on our way to the shoot?

817
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:47,644
That sounds great.

818
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:49,713
Seo Jin's favourite food is sundae soup.

819
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,213
- Really? Then...
- Yes.

820
00:30:51,214 --> 00:30:54,083
let's pick up some sundae soup from a restaurant nearby.

821
00:30:54,084 --> 00:30:56,354
We can eat it in the car on our way there.

822
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:58,283
(She'll eat sundae soup in the car?)

823
00:30:58,284 --> 00:31:00,154
- You'll eat sundae soup here?
- Yes.

824
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:01,654
But how?

825
00:31:01,924 --> 00:31:03,564
I often do that.

826
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,963
I've never heard of anyone having sundae soup in the car.

827
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,363
- Right. That's...
- Eating sundae soup...

828
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:10,404
It's hot. How can you eat sundae soup in the car?

829
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,704
To be honest,

830
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:15,034
I thought it was really dangerous.

831
00:31:15,234 --> 00:31:17,173
Just the thought of having sundae soup in the car...

832
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:20,374
made me worry in case she got hurt. So...

833
00:31:20,774 --> 00:31:22,244
With not so much broth.

834
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:23,884
Sundae soup...

835
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:25,583
I'll get sundae soup for you.

836
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:26,814
- Thank you.
- Sure.

837
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:29,054
What's the name of the cafe again?

838
00:31:29,424 --> 00:31:30,784
Stripe.

839
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:32,754
- Where is it?
- Right here on the right.

840
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,254
- It's here.
- Where?

841
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:37,194
- Where is it?
- Right here on the right.

842
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:41,334
(Do you want me to hold your hand?)

843
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:42,633
- No.
- You're good?

844
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:43,664
Yes.

845
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:48,533
(Shaking off the crumbs before going into the salon)

846
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:49,704
This way.

847
00:31:51,004 --> 00:31:52,874
Should I get valet parking?

848
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,974
(Caretaker Fairy wants to park first.)

849
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,484
- Where is it?
- It's on the fifth floor.

850
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:58,954
- Fifth floor?
- Yes.

851
00:31:59,914 --> 00:32:01,214
The entire building...

852
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:03,684
- is just hair salons.
- Yes.

853
00:32:04,654 --> 00:32:06,153
(Today's destination)

854
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:07,654
I go to the salon right in front of this place.

855
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:09,863
Just across the street.

856
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:11,923
What was the name? I've been there for a trial once.

857
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:13,463
- It's called Eva's Spring.
- Right.

858
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,333
- Director Kim Tae Ho's wife.
- Ye Eun used to go there.

859
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,963
(Ye Eun used to go there too.)

860
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:19,174
- Ye Eun?
- Ji Ye Eun.

861
00:32:21,734 --> 00:32:23,503
You don't know anyone on TV these days.

862
00:32:23,504 --> 00:32:25,174
It's hard to talk with you.

863
00:32:25,474 --> 00:32:27,574
Is she an actress? Who is it?

864
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,283
- She's an actress.
- Is she a singer? She's an actress?

865
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,614
She's part of the "Saturday Night Live Korea" crew.

866
00:32:33,714 --> 00:32:35,383
She's 31.

867
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:38,053
(Born in 1994)

868
00:32:38,054 --> 00:32:39,724
What does he actually know?

869
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:43,064
It's okay.

870
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,193
They're under construction right now.

871
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:48,164
(I couldn't relate to My Star.)

872
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,343
(Thinking hard)

873
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:58,643
- Aren't you hungry?
- No, I'm fine.

874
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,013
- Are you hungry?
- Come again?

875
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,244
- Are you hungry?
- No.

876
00:33:02,644 --> 00:33:04,344
It was one of the instructions.

877
00:33:04,884 --> 00:33:06,884
It mentioned that I should keep asking.

878
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:09,423
Does it say you should keep asking if I'm hungry?

879
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:10,453
What?

880
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,053
Does the instruction say you should keep asking...

881
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:13,893
- if I'm hungry?
- Yes. I was told to keep asking.

882
00:33:13,894 --> 00:33:15,194
(She tends to eat small portions often and enjoys finger foods.)

883
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,193
Hello.

884
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:26,374
(This place is where Su Ji becomes her alter ego.)

885
00:33:27,374 --> 00:33:28,803
How long do you think it will take?

886
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:30,703
It'll take around 40 minutes.

887
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,973
- Would you like to take a seat?
- It takes quite a long time.

888
00:33:32,974 --> 00:33:35,143
Yes, but this is actually fast.

889
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:36,514
(Today, it's faster than usual.)

890
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:40,853
(After some small talk, )

891
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:44,024
(silence fell.)

892
00:33:52,634 --> 00:33:54,433
(Seo Jin took something out among the makeup tools.)

893
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:55,903
- Please don't touch it.
- Why not?

894
00:33:55,904 --> 00:33:57,234
- I guess it's okay to touch it.
- What?

895
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:58,663
Shall we eat it?

896
00:33:58,664 --> 00:33:59,804
- Do you want to eat it?
- Yes.

897
00:34:00,074 --> 00:34:01,333
What if they scold us?

898
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,273
- Who?
- The owner.

899
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,344
What?

900
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:06,314
No one will scold you for eating this.

901
00:34:06,574 --> 00:34:07,613
Thank you.

902
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:08,743
(He secretly hands her finger food.)

903
00:34:08,744 --> 00:34:09,984
They have treats too.

904
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:13,414
- Is it good?
- Yes.

905
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:16,853
(Worried she might get caught, he's peeking to the right.)

906
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:19,254
(Worried she might get caught, he's peeking to the left.)

907
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:23,964
(Getting a sugar boost)

908
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:25,893
Always keep an eye on her.

909
00:34:25,894 --> 00:34:26,993
Keep checking on her.

910
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:28,633
That's what managers are supposed to do, isn't it?

911
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,034
(He's doing what managers are supposed to do.)

912
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:31,933
(Meanwhile, Caretaker Fairy parked the car.)

913
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:33,134
Stripe.

914
00:34:34,634 --> 00:34:38,914
My Star had me run an errand for coffee...

915
00:34:39,374 --> 00:34:41,144
to recharge.

916
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:42,743
Hazelnut?

917
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:44,313
No. It was decaf.

918
00:34:44,314 --> 00:34:45,414
(This stupid memory of mine)

919
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,054
I should get decaf coffee.

920
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:49,423
Stripe.

921
00:34:49,424 --> 00:34:53,254
(He shouts the name every 3 steps so he won't forget it.)

922
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:57,064
Decaf coffee doesn't taste good.

923
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,063
(After walking for quite a while, he reached the cafe.)

924
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,094
"Stripe."

925
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:05,303
(He feels a little uncomfortable because English makes him nervous.)

926
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,074
Nothing here is written in Korean.

927
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:12,543
This place is Stripe Coffee, right?

928
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,244
- Yes, it is.
- Okay.

929
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:15,474
Well...

930
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,244
I'll have a latte,

931
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,214
- but please make it decaf.
- Sure.

932
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:23,223
A cup of iced latte, please.

933
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:24,723
- For takeout?
- Yes.

934
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:26,323
Insert your card, please.

935
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,853
(He ordered an iced decaf latte without a problem.)

936
00:35:27,854 --> 00:35:30,394
(The manager's rule is to handle the corporate card with utmost care.)

937
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:33,034
What kind of sundae do you want?

938
00:35:33,894 --> 00:35:34,963
Are you okay with Cheongdam Sundae?

939
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:36,203
- Yes.
- Or do you prefer Sinuiju?

940
00:35:36,204 --> 00:35:37,504
- Or...
- Anything is good.

941
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:39,404
I like every kind of sundae soup.

942
00:35:39,934 --> 00:35:42,743
But it won't be easy to park...

943
00:35:42,744 --> 00:35:44,604
near Cheongdam Sundae Soup, right?

944
00:35:44,804 --> 00:35:45,973
But it won't be easy to park...

945
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:47,844
near Cheongdam Sundae Soup, right?

946
00:35:48,044 --> 00:35:53,353
(A leading question)

947
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:55,313
I'm going to call them in advance and pick it up later.

948
00:35:55,314 --> 00:35:57,153
So I think it'll be fine,

949
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:59,223
- The market would be...
- but...

950
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:00,554
(He needs good crisis management skills in this situation.)

951
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:02,764
- Have you tried Sinuiju sundae?
- Yes.

952
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,493
If their packaging makes it easy...

953
00:36:04,494 --> 00:36:06,833
to eat in the car, we should go for it.

954
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,863
But I don't know how Cheongdam Sundae Soup pack theirs.

955
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:12,804
You can just ask them to pack only a little soup.

956
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:15,074
Meat with a little bit of soup.

957
00:36:16,404 --> 00:36:17,973
It already sounds so tasty.

958
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,313
(Su Ji's sundae soup order: Everything is okay, )

959
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:20,714
(but just a little broth and lots of meat.)

960
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:22,914
It's sundae soup, and you want meat?

961
00:36:23,084 --> 00:36:24,243
Yes. Just meat.

962
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:26,284
Leave out the head meat.

963
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:28,984
So just sundae and meat?

964
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,684
I don't need sundae. I just want meat.

965
00:36:31,784 --> 00:36:33,293
So sundae soup without sundae?

966
00:36:33,294 --> 00:36:34,324
Yes.

967
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:35,963
- Okay.
- Yes.

968
00:36:35,964 --> 00:36:38,164
(Sundae soup without sundae)

969
00:36:38,424 --> 00:36:40,463
It's what you do at home, right?

970
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,493
Yes.

971
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:42,864
(Su Ji is transforming into HAMBUGGY after finishing her order.)

972
00:36:43,564 --> 00:36:45,363
(Step 1 of the HAMBUGGY transformation: Eye makeup)

973
00:36:45,364 --> 00:36:48,174
(Going for a smokey eye look)

974
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:53,044
(Turning into HAMBUGGY)

975
00:36:53,914 --> 00:36:56,714
(She spends the most time on her eyeliner.)

976
00:36:57,484 --> 00:37:00,054
(She gives off completely different vibes.)

977
00:37:00,814 --> 00:37:04,124
(Step 2 of the HAMBUGGY transformation: Brightening)

978
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:07,793
(Bright, poreless skin)

979
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:08,954
(Lee Su Ji?)

980
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:12,594
(HAMBUGGY)

981
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:18,264
(HAMBUGGY will wake up soon!)

982
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,233
(Seo Jin in the meantime)

983
00:37:20,234 --> 00:37:21,374
(Tilting his head)

984
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,403
Eating sundae soup in the car.

985
00:37:24,404 --> 00:37:25,814
Isn't that a stunt or something?

986
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:32,144
(His lips are twitching.)

987
00:37:32,344 --> 00:37:35,054
It's hard enough to eat sundae soup while sitting here.

988
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,384
You'd spill everything even if you eat here.

989
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,993
How can she eat sundae soup in the car?

990
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:43,393
(He's whispering what he truly feels so she won't hear.)

991
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,563
I can hear you.

992
00:37:44,564 --> 00:37:49,134
(I can hear you.)

993
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,003
It's because you have to work.

994
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,733
(He mumbles a few words out of embarrassment.)

995
00:37:54,734 --> 00:37:57,174
(Then he closes his mouth.)

996
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:59,073
Kwang Kyu walked instead of taking the car.

997
00:37:59,074 --> 00:38:01,144
He walked? He walked there?

998
00:38:01,544 --> 00:38:02,784
It's quite far, though.

999
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:04,443
What?

1000
00:38:04,444 --> 00:38:05,714
(Surprised)

1001
00:38:05,854 --> 00:38:07,253
(He has a toothache and a poor sense of direction.)

1002
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:08,513
I'm sure he hasn't arrived yet.

1003
00:38:08,514 --> 00:38:09,654
(Worried about his older bestie)

1004
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:12,353
(The caller tune makes him lose all sympathy.)

1005
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:14,223
(Turning down)

1006
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:18,794
(I'm drinking again today, thinking of you)

1007
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:21,834
Hello?

1008
00:38:22,064 --> 00:38:23,533
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes.

1009
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:24,704
Did you walk there?

1010
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,504
- I did.
- Isn't it far?

1011
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:30,974
It's a bit far, but I'm bringing the coffee.

1012
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:34,074
- Okay. Hurry up.
- Okay.

1013
00:38:35,444 --> 00:38:37,943
I feel so sorry.

1014
00:38:37,944 --> 00:38:39,583
How old is he?

1015
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,914
He's older.

1016
00:38:41,514 --> 00:38:44,724
He's 58. He's almost 60 now.

1017
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:46,623
Please hold it.

1018
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:48,754
He insisted on going himself.

1019
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,464
He's like a new employee.

1020
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:52,993
Regardless of his age.

1021
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:54,293
(Su Ji feels sorry, )

1022
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:55,764
(thinking she might have made an unnecessary request.)

1023
00:38:58,104 --> 00:39:00,073
(And there's a man who needs to walk back 600m...)

1024
00:39:00,074 --> 00:39:02,844
(along the same path.)

1025
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:07,044
My Star might be waiting.

1026
00:39:07,644 --> 00:39:10,984
As a manager, speed is essential.

1027
00:39:11,814 --> 00:39:12,854
Yes.

1028
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:18,554
(Caretaker Fairy is running to My Star who is waiting.)

1029
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,824
(Innocent steps toward Su Ji)

1030
00:39:23,064 --> 00:39:28,234
(For Su Ji, My Star, who must be thirsty and tired)

1031
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:35,574
(Wait for me, Su Ji.)

1032
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:38,543
- Done?
- Kwang Kyu.

1033
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:39,544
Hey.

1034
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,544
- Decaf?
- Yes.

1035
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,014
- Decaf?
- It's decaf.

1036
00:39:43,944 --> 00:39:45,714
Hey, I ran...

1037
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:48,214
Hey, I ran...

1038
00:39:48,584 --> 00:39:50,183
Hey, I ran and got the coffee myself.

1039
00:39:50,184 --> 00:39:51,383
How can you just take it?

1040
00:39:51,384 --> 00:39:52,894
(He likes to tease his older bestie.)

1041
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,623
Thank you.

1042
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,793
(Su Ji's request: Iced decaf latte)

1043
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:57,524
Thank you for the coffee.

1044
00:39:59,894 --> 00:40:01,893
Hey, I'm the one who ran and got the coffee.

1045
00:40:01,894 --> 00:40:03,603
And you just handed it to her.

1046
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:05,534
Thank you.

1047
00:40:06,074 --> 00:40:08,003
It's hot.

1048
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:09,174
(Sweating)

1049
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:13,143
(After giving Su Ji coffee, he drinks water to comfort himself.)

1050
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,514
- Warm.
- Warm.

1051
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:18,414
It feels like I had my parents run an errand for me.

1052
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:20,513
(It feels like she's disrespectful to her parents.)

1053
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:22,154
- Hey.
- Seriously.

1054
00:40:25,424 --> 00:40:27,193
Why did you come out?

1055
00:40:27,194 --> 00:40:28,353
- Are you done?
- Yes, I'm done.

1056
00:40:28,354 --> 00:40:29,724
- Already? It didn't take long.
- Yes.

1057
00:40:29,924 --> 00:40:31,323
I need to get changed now.

1058
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:32,493
- This is the outfit.
- Then...

1059
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,193
- You just have to change?
- Yes.

1060
00:40:34,194 --> 00:40:36,633
- Should I order sundae soup then?
- Sundae soup?

1061
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,133
(He should order sundae soup while she's getting changed.)

1062
00:40:38,134 --> 00:40:39,504
Let me get changed.

1063
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:42,304
I don't like the idea of eating soup in the car.

1064
00:40:43,844 --> 00:40:45,303
Aren't you going to have lunch?

1065
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:47,343
- What?
- Do you want to grab something?

1066
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:49,484
Okay. Let's have some sundae.

1067
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,914
- Do you want sundae?
- Yes.

1068
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:52,143
(Seo Jin nonchalantly takes care of his older bestie.)

1069
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:53,283
I'll have...

1070
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,654
(Seo Jin nonchalantly takes care of his older bestie.)

1071
00:40:57,654 --> 00:40:59,853
(Calling Cheongdam Sundae Soup)

1072
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:02,023
- The broth...
- Your call is being connected.

1073
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:04,323
- Just half the soup?
- This is Cheongdam Sundae Soup.

1074
00:41:04,324 --> 00:41:05,933
- Hello?
- Yes?

1075
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:07,364
Is takeout available?

1076
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:08,894
Sure, go ahead.

1077
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:11,563
- Cheongdam sundae soup...
- Okay.

1078
00:41:11,564 --> 00:41:13,034
- with meat only.
- Cheongdam sundae soup?

1079
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:16,004
With just a little bit of broth.

1080
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:18,803
Cheongdam sundae soup with lots of meat and a bit of broth?

1081
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:20,613
Yes. And one traditional sundae, please.

1082
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:21,943
- One?
- Yes.

1083
00:41:21,944 --> 00:41:23,513
- Okay.
- All right.

1084
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,543
- Okay.
- Yes.

1085
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:26,384
(He ordered sundae soup for Su Ji and traditional sundae for himself.)

1086
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,324
I'm worried about eating soup in the car.

1087
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:31,484
She's done it many times.

1088
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:34,124
You drive. But why do you drive like that these days?

1089
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:36,894
- You're not as good as before.
- Hey.

1090
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:39,294
- Hey.
- Why are you so careful?

1091
00:41:39,894 --> 00:41:42,464
How can I drive recklessly with a superstar in the car?

1092
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:44,963
- I should drive calmly.
- When I was in the car,

1093
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:46,473
were you reckless because you wanted to kill me?

1094
00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:48,173
We're men.

1095
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:49,443
It's fine when it's just men.

1096
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:51,943
- But she's a lady.
- Earlier when you drove...

1097
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:53,744
- What?
- You can't drive like you used to.

1098
00:41:56,444 --> 00:41:58,613
(What's this?)

1099
00:41:58,614 --> 00:42:00,814
(A mysterious piece of paper)

1100
00:42:00,954 --> 00:42:02,554
Here are HAMBUGGY's 10 questions and answers.

1101
00:42:03,184 --> 00:42:04,554
Where did you get it?

1102
00:42:04,854 --> 00:42:06,123
Su Ji left it.

1103
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,294
(HAMBUGGY's 10 questions and answers?)

1104
00:42:09,024 --> 00:42:11,594
Creating self-made content is trending these days.

1105
00:42:11,694 --> 00:42:14,594
(Self-made content?)

1106
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:18,903
(Self-made content refers to videos that idols or actors create...)

1107
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:22,973
(for their fans, often filmed or featuring the manager.)

1108
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:26,144
(Star, Manager)

1109
00:42:26,714 --> 00:42:28,973
- Okay. Ten questions and answers.
- Okay.

1110
00:42:28,974 --> 00:42:30,113
You enter the address it.

1111
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,313
(Grumpy Secretary will create self-made content for her fans.)

1112
00:42:31,314 --> 00:42:32,783
(He picks up the camera without realising it.)

1113
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:33,813
So...

1114
00:42:33,814 --> 00:42:34,953
I didn't get it.

1115
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:36,724
What is self-made content?

1116
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:37,854
Self-produced content.

1117
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,354
Self-produced content.

1118
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:42,894
- I always look good.
- Does this look better?

1119
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:44,863
Can I have a look?

1120
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:47,033
It looks like a sofa commercial now.

1121
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,063
It does?

1122
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:49,863
- Yes. I think it looks fine.
- Is that so?

1123
00:42:49,864 --> 00:42:51,004
Yes.

1124
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,133
Okay. Ten questions and answers.

1125
00:42:53,134 --> 00:42:54,574
BUGGYHAM

1126
00:42:57,774 --> 00:42:58,774
Okay.

1127
00:42:58,904 --> 00:43:01,774
How did you come up with the name, HAMBUGGY?

1128
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,654
My favourite food is hamburger.

1129
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:10,353
A hamburger is made by putting together...

1130
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:13,954
two buns and a patty.

1131
00:43:14,354 --> 00:43:18,223
In the same way, I combined rap and hip-hop into one,

1132
00:43:18,224 --> 00:43:20,063
creating HAMBUGGY.

1133
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:22,733
That's why I'm BUGGYHAM

1134
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,064
(That's why I'm BUGGYHAM)

1135
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:28,133
(Flustered)

1136
00:43:28,134 --> 00:43:29,644
- He's shocked.
- Well...

1137
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,504
I see.

1138
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:34,744
Well... I see.

1139
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:39,854
- I don't want to do this.
- Why?

1140
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,754
- Why?
- I can't do this.

1141
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:46,723
Other people laugh when I do this.

1142
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,823
No.

1143
00:43:47,824 --> 00:43:50,163
- I can't do this.
- It just took some time to get it.

1144
00:43:50,164 --> 00:43:51,723
- I couldn't really understand it.
- Why will you get it?

1145
00:43:51,724 --> 00:43:52,933
I got it now.

1146
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,693
I don't understand the question either.

1147
00:43:54,694 --> 00:43:57,104
I don't even know what she's talking about.

1148
00:43:57,164 --> 00:43:59,004
What reaction do you expect from me?

1149
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,274
So that's the meaning behind it.

1150
00:44:01,674 --> 00:44:05,074
Your fans are curious about your secret place the most.

1151
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:07,674
Are you going to share a house tour video for them?

1152
00:44:08,344 --> 00:44:09,614
That's exactly...

1153
00:44:10,684 --> 00:44:12,613
- what I'm going to do today.
- Today?

1154
00:44:12,614 --> 00:44:15,183
I'm going to show my living space...

1155
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:17,354
and workspace.

1156
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:19,854
Do you own the house?

1157
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:24,293
I'm going to reveal it later in the video.

1158
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:25,324
Okay.

1159
00:44:25,524 --> 00:44:26,663
Then...

1160
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,363
I don't know why you make such a fuss

1161
00:44:29,364 --> 00:44:31,003
About whether I own it

1162
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,433
- Or rent it - Right.

1163
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:35,374
All I need is a sanctuary

1164
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:39,913
Someone was scammed while renting a house.

1165
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:41,274
- Me too.
- You too?

1166
00:44:42,244 --> 00:44:43,314
I see.

1167
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:45,914
Rental scam

1168
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,653
They don't know. These guys don't know.

1169
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:49,883
- Yes, these guys don't know - They don't know.

1170
00:44:49,884 --> 00:44:51,653
I'm looking for the scammer

1171
00:44:51,654 --> 00:44:52,754
Yes.

1172
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,453
Those jerks.

1173
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:56,223
(An unexpected situation)

1174
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:57,324
Okay.

1175
00:44:57,464 --> 00:45:00,363
What's your secret for keeping a confident silhouette on stage?

1176
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,793
How do you keep your figure?

1177
00:45:01,794 --> 00:45:03,764
(Getting up)

1178
00:45:05,234 --> 00:45:07,474
(Startled)

1179
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:12,043
(There aren't many with a body as sexy as mine in Korea)

1180
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:15,143
(But I'm revealing it just for you)

1181
00:45:15,144 --> 00:45:17,383
(To dominate Korea)

1182
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:19,953
(My sexy body)

1183
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:24,623
(My weapon is my body)

1184
00:45:24,624 --> 00:45:27,394
Your weapon is your body?

1185
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,524
- Well...
- Okay.

1186
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:36,234
What's your comfort food?

1187
00:45:36,304 --> 00:45:39,833
(I love French fries, chicken, halal food, bibimbap)

1188
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:41,173
Sushi, mulhoe, tteokbokki

1189
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:42,974
Pad thai, curry, tacos

1190
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,203
A lot of favourite foods.

1191
00:45:45,204 --> 00:45:48,114
(A lot of favourite foods.)

1192
00:45:48,774 --> 00:45:50,543
- You like a lot of foods.
- I just...

1193
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:51,983
Hold on. I can't do this.

1194
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:53,753
- Because...
- Too many favourite foods.

1195
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:55,113
It doesn't feel like I'm filming content.

1196
00:45:55,114 --> 00:45:56,223
It feels like I'm scolded...

1197
00:45:56,224 --> 00:45:57,923
- by a teacher.
- No.

1198
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:00,053
It feels like I'm scolded.

1199
00:46:00,054 --> 00:46:01,823
- No.
- "Why are your grades so low?"

1200
00:46:01,824 --> 00:46:03,864
- That's how it feels.
- No.

1201
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:06,064
I thought you'd pick one,

1202
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:07,763
- but the list kept going.
- Okay.

1203
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,063
- I'm just saying it's a lot.
- Okay.

1204
00:46:09,064 --> 00:46:10,133
(What's the matter with this man?)

1205
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,433
It's good to like many kinds of food.

1206
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:14,003
The director had a tooth pulled.

1207
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,773
He's struggling with a toothache.

1208
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:17,873
It hurts a little...

1209
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:18,973
- after having instant coffee.
- Are you okay? Feeling sensitive?

1210
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:20,373
- It hurts a little.
- A little? Oh, really?

1211
00:46:20,374 --> 00:46:21,643
I'm sorry. If your arm hurts, I'll hold it for you.

1212
00:46:21,644 --> 00:46:23,183
No.

1213
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:25,143
- I feel so sorry.
- No, it's fine.

1214
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:26,213
It's fine?

1215
00:46:26,214 --> 00:46:27,654
BUGGYHAM

1216
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:29,724
Let's go.

1217
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:33,294
Okay. Lastly, send a video letter.

1218
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:36,394
Okay. Mealies. You guys...

1219
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:38,893
(Mealies)

1220
00:46:38,894 --> 00:46:41,464
- That's what I call my fans.
- No, it's fine.

1221
00:46:41,794 --> 00:46:43,663
That's what I refer to my fans as. Mealies.

1222
00:46:43,664 --> 00:46:45,934
It means three meals a day. Every meal is precious to me.

1223
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,704
(Moving the camera diligently)

1224
00:46:51,204 --> 00:46:52,804
Please stay still.

1225
00:46:54,114 --> 00:46:56,844
That's so outdated.

1226
00:46:57,644 --> 00:46:58,713
(Embarrassed)

1227
00:46:58,714 --> 00:46:59,783
I got it.

1228
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:00,784
Mealies.

1229
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:03,783
You keep nagging me to drop a song fast,

1230
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:05,283
but wait. I'll be back soon...

1231
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:07,823
with a hit.

1232
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:09,424
BUGGYHAM

1233
00:47:10,664 --> 00:47:12,494
(Moving)

1234
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:18,564
That's outdated too. Holding the camera up.

1235
00:47:19,064 --> 00:47:20,103
Okay. I got it. Let's go now.

1236
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,134
Okay.

1237
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:24,004
Our generation...

1238
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:26,414
isn't used to that yet.

1239
00:47:26,614 --> 00:47:27,974
I think both Seo Jin and I...

1240
00:47:28,674 --> 00:47:33,584
are behind the times.

1241
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,453
Let's go now.

1242
00:47:35,454 --> 00:47:37,153
(1:30pm, leaving the beauty salon)

1243
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:39,424
(Nonchalantly opening the door)

1244
00:47:39,694 --> 00:47:41,223
(Checking the inside of the car before getting in)

1245
00:47:41,224 --> 00:47:42,394
Thank you.

1246
00:47:45,024 --> 00:47:47,833
(Thanks to him, My Star got in the car safely.)

1247
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:50,003
(He checks on the star until the end.)

1248
00:47:50,004 --> 00:47:52,303
(He's the last one to get in the car.)

1249
00:47:52,304 --> 00:47:55,173
(He's sweet even though he acts nonchalant.)

1250
00:47:55,174 --> 00:47:57,544
(Kwang Kyu checks the destination.)

1251
00:47:57,804 --> 00:48:01,144
(Seo Jin is checking on the restaurant's to-go orders.)

1252
00:48:01,474 --> 00:48:03,113
- I think I ordered something wrong.
- What?

1253
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:05,483
(I think I ordered something wrong.)

1254
00:48:05,484 --> 00:48:06,714
Where did you order from?

1255
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:08,984
- What?
- Where did you order from?

1256
00:48:10,324 --> 00:48:12,084
It's Seongdong-gu.

1257
00:48:12,524 --> 00:48:15,094
- What?
- Gosh, I'm in trouble.

1258
00:48:15,254 --> 00:48:16,964
(Glancing)

1259
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:18,824
Sorry?

1260
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,764
Cheongdam Sundae Soup is in Seongdong-gu.

1261
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:26,834
(All they can do is just laugh.)

1262
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,533
- It's not in this area.
- What are you going to do?

1263
00:48:29,534 --> 00:48:30,673
- The road over there.
- Did you call a restaurant...

1264
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:31,773
in Seongdong-gu?

1265
00:48:31,774 --> 00:48:32,874
I guess so.

1266
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:34,474
My goodness.

1267
00:48:34,475 --> 00:48:35,573
- Hey.
- Yes?

1268
00:48:35,574 --> 00:48:36,814
Do you want to order now?

1269
00:48:37,344 --> 00:48:38,843
- It's driving me crazy.
- You should've checked...

1270
00:48:38,844 --> 00:48:40,553
the address of Cheongdam Sundae Soup.

1271
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:42,453
Cheongdam Sundae Soup. So of course, I thought it was in Cheongdam.

1272
00:48:42,454 --> 00:48:45,383
I haven't been this hungry until today.

1273
00:48:45,384 --> 00:48:46,724
The restaurant is near Ttukseom Island.

1274
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:48,653
Hello?

1275
00:48:48,654 --> 00:48:50,093
- Hello?
- Yes?

1276
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,163
I ordered sundae soup...

1277
00:48:52,164 --> 00:48:54,233
- and traditional sundae earlier.
- Okay.

1278
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:56,834
I misread the address and ordered from the wrong place.

1279
00:48:58,064 --> 00:48:59,203
- Your order?
- Yes.

1280
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:00,473
- Takeaway?
- Yes.

1281
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:01,474
(Feeling sorry)

1282
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:03,574
- I got it.
- I'm sorry.

1283
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:04,774
No worries.

1284
00:49:05,574 --> 00:49:06,914
- We should go for Sinuiju.
- What?

1285
00:49:07,014 --> 00:49:08,674
- Sinuiju Sundae is the only way.
- Do you want to go there?

1286
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:11,883
Then please call the restaurant and order for me.

1287
00:49:11,884 --> 00:49:13,513
I'll turn the car that way.

1288
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:16,284
Do you want me to give you the address?

1289
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,753
- Yeongdongdaero...
- I know.

1290
00:49:18,754 --> 00:49:20,853
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

1291
00:49:20,854 --> 00:49:21,893
Hold on.

1292
00:49:21,894 --> 00:49:23,393
(He quickly orders again for the hungry star.)

1293
00:49:23,394 --> 00:49:24,864
Hello.

1294
00:49:25,064 --> 00:49:26,894
Hello, I'd like to order for takeout.

1295
00:49:27,294 --> 00:49:28,363
Go ahead.

1296
00:49:28,364 --> 00:49:30,733
- One sundae soup...
- Okay.

1297
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,234
just with lean meat.

1298
00:49:32,664 --> 00:49:35,534
- Okay.
- With just a bit of broth.

1299
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:37,843
- All right.
- Okay. Thank you.

1300
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:41,273
(Setting off for the restaurant to find real sundae soup)

1301
00:49:41,274 --> 00:49:42,814
Cheongdam Sundae Soup? Why there?

1302
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:44,983
I do feel sorry, though.

1303
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:46,883
(Feeling sorry for the restaurant owner in Seongdong-gu)

1304
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:48,554
Let me check the script.

1305
00:49:49,514 --> 00:49:50,784
The one I'm going to do this later.

1306
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,294
- Make yourself at home.
- Okay.

1307
00:49:55,924 --> 00:50:00,294
(Feeling sorry for no reason)

1308
00:50:00,594 --> 00:50:02,263
(Looking around)

1309
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:03,304
Kwang Kyu.

1310
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,203
I'll go inside and bring the sundae soup.

1311
00:50:06,204 --> 00:50:08,233
You enter the address of the next place.

1312
00:50:08,234 --> 00:50:09,274
Okay.

1313
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:11,843
Hold this.

1314
00:50:11,844 --> 00:50:14,314
(He wants to try anything to make up for his mistake.)

1315
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:16,644
That's Sinuiju Sundae over there, isn't it?

1316
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:18,783
Yes. I was startled...

1317
00:50:18,784 --> 00:50:20,083
because it's a blowfish restaurant now.

1318
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:22,554
- Yes. I was surprised too.
- It's near the restaurant.

1319
00:50:22,884 --> 00:50:24,123
Yes. I was shocked.

1320
00:50:24,124 --> 00:50:25,283
(They arrive at the sundae soup restaurant...)

1321
00:50:25,284 --> 00:50:26,953
(next to the blowfish restaurant.)

1322
00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:28,324
I thought the restaurant had disappeared.

1323
00:50:30,624 --> 00:50:32,064
We came to pick up the food.

1324
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:37,204
(Walking into the restaurant)

1325
00:50:38,764 --> 00:50:40,473
- Takeout.
- Did you order takeout?

1326
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:41,674
I did.

1327
00:50:41,874 --> 00:50:43,573
Boiled soup in a plastic bag?

1328
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:45,273
- Yes. With a bit of broth.
- Yes.

1329
00:50:45,274 --> 00:50:46,514
Just a moment, please.

1330
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:49,173
(The sundae soup is here.)

1331
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:50,414
Thank you.

1332
00:50:52,384 --> 00:50:55,854
(Checking what's inside)

1333
00:50:57,584 --> 00:50:58,924
Is this the one?

1334
00:51:00,024 --> 00:51:01,294
- Yes. The boiled soup.
- Yes.

1335
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:06,094
(Paying with the corporate card)

1336
00:51:06,324 --> 00:51:08,494
- Do you need anything else?
- It's all good.

1337
00:51:10,104 --> 00:51:11,733
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1338
00:51:11,734 --> 00:51:12,934
(He got sundae soup.)

1339
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,604
Kwang Kyu, did you get the receipt for the coffee earlier?

1340
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:19,074
No.

1341
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:22,513
- Do I have to?
- Yes. You need to get a receipt.

1342
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:23,584
I do?

1343
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:26,044
(Perplexed)

1344
00:51:26,684 --> 00:51:28,884
He made a big mistake.

1345
00:51:29,784 --> 00:51:31,683
The manager told us to get a receipt.

1346
00:51:31,684 --> 00:51:32,954
But he didn't take a receipt.

1347
00:51:34,354 --> 00:51:36,253
(He doesn't understand why he forgot the basics.)

1348
00:51:36,254 --> 00:51:37,824
He always makes mistakes.

1349
00:51:38,724 --> 00:51:40,234
I'm going to wear an apron.

1350
00:51:41,594 --> 00:51:43,363
(Star Su Ji is ready to eat in the car.)

1351
00:51:43,364 --> 00:51:45,864
(A bib, a car table)

1352
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,604
There's not enough space over there.

1353
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:52,003
It's okay.

1354
00:51:52,004 --> 00:51:53,073
(Sitting next to the star)

1355
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:54,944
- Did you film it?
- No, I didn't.

1356
00:51:55,914 --> 00:51:59,484
(He's going to take care of her closely.)

1357
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:01,284
Will you be okay with this?

1358
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:03,054
Yes.

1359
00:52:03,214 --> 00:52:04,424
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1360
00:52:04,984 --> 00:52:06,823
She's going to eat sundae soup in the car.

1361
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,954
I'm worried that she might get hurt.

1362
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:10,893
- Salted shrimp and spicy sauce.
- I'm fine.

1363
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,164
- You don't need them?
- No.

1364
00:52:13,534 --> 00:52:15,364
Su Ji, is it really safe to eat this?

1365
00:52:16,294 --> 00:52:18,264
The owner gave us a lot of broth.

1366
00:52:18,804 --> 00:52:21,774
(Is it too soupy?)

1367
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:24,974
(But I ordered it correctly.)

1368
00:52:39,054 --> 00:52:40,323
The soup is about to spill.

1369
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,954
Why did they give me this much soup?

1370
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:43,763
- Should I pour a bit away?
- Can you drink some of the soup?

1371
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:46,194
(Can you drink some of the soup?)

1372
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,733
- Should I pour a bit away?
- Just take a sip.

1373
00:52:49,734 --> 00:52:51,033
But it's hard to...

1374
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,903
(My Star has requested me to drink the soup.)

1375
00:52:52,904 --> 00:52:54,674
Drink it from the edge.

1376
00:52:56,074 --> 00:52:57,104
The soup?

1377
00:53:00,274 --> 00:53:01,744
You can do it, Seo Jin.

1378
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:05,914
It's hot.

1379
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:11,554
(Will Young Master Seo Jin drink the soup?)

1380
00:53:15,194 --> 00:53:16,194
That's it.

1381
00:53:16,554 --> 00:53:18,423
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

1382
00:53:18,424 --> 00:53:21,064
Right? I find it really delicious.

1383
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:26,933
(Laughing)

1384
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:29,504
Right? I find it really delicious.

1385
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:33,874
Su Ji, all I'm getting are the green onions.

1386
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:36,313
It's okay.

1387
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:37,844
(Disappointed, he takes another sip.)

1388
00:53:38,944 --> 00:53:41,584
All I got were green onions and not one piece of meat.

1389
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:45,324
Even though I sipped really hard,

1390
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:47,153
and it had a lot of meat in it.

1391
00:53:47,154 --> 00:53:49,593
(Honestly, Seo Jin wanted some meat.)

1392
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:52,224
But I had the three pieces of leftover sundae.

1393
00:53:56,164 --> 00:53:57,164
It's okay.

1394
00:53:57,165 --> 00:54:00,073
I heard it has an anti-inflammatory effect.

1395
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:01,074
How is it now?

1396
00:54:01,075 --> 00:54:02,133
- Good.
- Okay?

1397
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:03,203
- Yes.
- It keeps leaning to one side.

1398
00:54:03,204 --> 00:54:04,303
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

1399
00:54:04,304 --> 00:54:05,673
- It requires skills.
- Should I open it?

1400
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:07,143
Shouldn't you drink a bit more soup?

1401
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:08,214
I'll drink it.

1402
00:54:08,514 --> 00:54:10,744
Speak one at a time, okay?

1403
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,413
(Dispirited)

1404
00:54:13,414 --> 00:54:16,183
(He stops talking immediately.)

1405
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:17,383
It's so good.

1406
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:19,153
- Kwang Kyu, we can leave now.
- Okay.

1407
00:54:19,154 --> 00:54:20,323
I'm on cloud nine now.

1408
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:21,353
- Are you?
- Yes.

1409
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:23,223
- That's a relief.
- I'm filled with happiness.

1410
00:54:23,224 --> 00:54:25,623
- Great.
- Thank you. I'm digging in.

1411
00:54:25,624 --> 00:54:27,933
All right. I'll drive really slowly.

1412
00:54:27,934 --> 00:54:28,934
(As long as My Star is happy)

1413
00:54:29,064 --> 00:54:31,434
(Fidgeting)

1414
00:54:31,504 --> 00:54:32,564
Do you need some wet wipes?

1415
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:35,373
(Place them here, please.)

1416
00:54:35,374 --> 00:54:36,434
Thank you.

1417
00:54:36,504 --> 00:54:38,073
(Smiling)

1418
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,074
It's unbelievable.

1419
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,473
(For My Star's happiness)

1420
00:54:40,474 --> 00:54:41,514
This is...

1421
00:54:43,544 --> 00:54:48,454
(Off to the studio while eating sundae soup)

1422
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:51,284
Oh, dear.

1423
00:54:51,954 --> 00:54:53,023
Drive carefully.

1424
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:56,054
Seo Jin, I'm driving really carefully right now.

1425
00:54:56,424 --> 00:54:58,893
Go more slowly, and we'll be going at 20 km per hour.

1426
00:54:58,894 --> 00:55:00,164
It's okay.

1427
00:55:00,264 --> 00:55:01,763
We can't be late.

1428
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:02,864
True.

1429
00:55:03,604 --> 00:55:04,734
How far away are we?

1430
00:55:05,564 --> 00:55:07,633
It'll take us 38 minutes.

1431
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:09,004
(Estimated to arrive in 38 minutes)

1432
00:55:10,604 --> 00:55:14,413
(Let's do a proper eating show in the car.)

1433
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:16,074
(Sipping)

1434
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:18,514
(Entering a curved road)

1435
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:21,454
(Comfort that doesn't sway at all)

1436
00:55:21,914 --> 00:55:23,314
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

1437
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:24,884
Drive on flat roads.

1438
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:28,893
(The car shakes to prevent overeating.)

1439
00:55:28,894 --> 00:55:31,564
(But she immediately finds stability.)

1440
00:55:32,594 --> 00:55:34,863
(This is the class of the Sexy Food Master.)

1441
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,164
(Staring)

1442
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:39,864
(Staring)

1443
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:43,804
(Everyone's eyes are set on one place.)

1444
00:55:44,704 --> 00:55:45,704
(Turning)

1445
00:55:45,705 --> 00:55:46,973
- What is it?
- Do you want some?

1446
00:55:46,974 --> 00:55:49,614
No, I was watching to see if you were enjoying it.

1447
00:55:50,384 --> 00:55:52,444
And if you were eating it without spilling.

1448
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,483
I think eating sundae soup in the car...

1449
00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:57,154
is like a trick show.

1450
00:55:58,954 --> 00:56:00,993
Eating sundae soup in the car...

1451
00:56:00,994 --> 00:56:02,623
goes beyond my imagination.

1452
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:03,894
(The first sundae soup eating show in the car)

1453
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:05,394
True.

1454
00:56:05,924 --> 00:56:07,794
- You need the experience.
- You're right.

1455
00:56:08,534 --> 00:56:10,094
How long is the shoot today?

1456
00:56:11,904 --> 00:56:13,063
- Three hours?
- Yes.

1457
00:56:13,064 --> 00:56:14,234
Goodness.

1458
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,844
That's long. How long is the actual show?

1459
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:18,874
Nine minutes.

1460
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,474
A 3-hour shoot for 9 minutes of showtime?

1461
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:23,844
Gosh, a hearty meal is necessary.

1462
00:56:24,784 --> 00:56:28,314
But a three-hour shoot is considered really short.

1463
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:31,554
(The more he knows My Star, the more interesting it gets.)

1464
00:56:33,554 --> 00:56:35,324
You eat really well in the car.

1465
00:56:37,424 --> 00:56:38,594
You even have a bib.

1466
00:56:40,694 --> 00:56:43,494
(Zooming in and out from the GPS)

1467
00:56:44,064 --> 00:56:49,974
(His expression and behaviour show something's wrong.)

1468
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,743
(Reading the room)

1469
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,644
I apologise while you're eating, but I need to turn the car around.

1470
00:56:58,344 --> 00:56:59,543
- How come?
- Why?

1471
00:56:59,544 --> 00:57:01,353
Turning... The Seongsu Bridge...

1472
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:04,624
It is now telling me it's faster to take the Yeongdong Bridge.

1473
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,454
- The GPS?
- Yes.

1474
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:07,824
Got it.

1475
00:57:08,454 --> 00:57:09,454
Make a big turn.

1476
00:57:10,924 --> 00:57:14,294
(A big turn for My Star's stable mealtime)

1477
00:57:14,694 --> 00:57:16,564
What's your favourite food?

1478
00:57:17,264 --> 00:57:18,464
- Me?
- Yes.

1479
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:19,664
Bossam.

1480
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,204
And sundae.

1481
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:25,204
Braised mackerel for me.

1482
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:26,504
Braised mackerel?

1483
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,614
Both of you seem to like Korean food.

1484
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:32,384
There's bad traffic.

1485
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:35,354
(Looking down)

1486
00:57:35,984 --> 00:57:37,954
(Fidgeting)

1487
00:57:39,424 --> 00:57:40,554
(Glancing)

1488
00:57:40,594 --> 00:57:43,554
(After reading the room)

1489
00:57:46,594 --> 00:57:49,164
(Discreetly opening the gimbap he had kept secret)

1490
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:53,404
(Getting a pair of chopsticks)

1491
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:57,474
(Since we're still stuck in traffic.)

1492
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:00,743
(Eating at the chance he gets)

1493
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,143
What are you eating, Kwang Kyu?

1494
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:03,783
- Gimbap.
- Do you want some?

1495
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:05,343
- For real?
- Do you want a piece?

1496
00:58:05,344 --> 00:58:06,713
Really, Kwang Kyu.

1497
00:58:06,714 --> 00:58:09,053
I told you to focus on driving, but you're eating gimbap?

1498
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:10,423
The traffic is terrible,

1499
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:11,824
and it's time for me to take my medicine.

1500
00:58:12,124 --> 00:58:13,254
What medicine?

1501
00:58:13,424 --> 00:58:15,453
- What do you take?
- For your teeth?

1502
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:16,624
- Yes.
- I see.

1503
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:18,293
No wonder my teeth hurt.

1504
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,764
- I missed my medicine.
- No, you should take it.

1505
00:58:20,794 --> 00:58:23,063
(What do I do with my older bestie?)

1506
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:24,504
Seriously.

1507
00:58:25,664 --> 00:58:27,373
And it's nice to eat when Su Ji does.

1508
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:28,533
- True.
- Right?

1509
00:58:28,534 --> 00:58:29,534
Yes.

1510
00:58:31,004 --> 00:58:32,474
The problem is...

1511
00:58:32,774 --> 00:58:34,244
after you're done with the meal.

1512
00:58:34,914 --> 00:58:36,014
How come?

1513
00:58:36,844 --> 00:58:39,284
The leftovers must be taken care of.

1514
00:58:40,354 --> 00:58:41,554
We can just eat it all.

1515
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,824
That's for the best.

1516
00:58:45,784 --> 00:58:46,953
- Are you done?
- Yes.

1517
00:58:46,954 --> 00:58:48,893
- Hold on. Is there no leftover?
- Like this.

1518
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:51,324
- No, I emptied it.
- Nice.

1519
00:58:51,564 --> 00:58:52,863
(Nice.)

1520
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:55,393
We can dump it out when we get out of the car.

1521
00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:56,594
(Her meal attitude doesn't disappoint.)

1522
00:58:57,264 --> 00:58:59,004
- Here.
- I'm sleepy now.

1523
00:58:59,464 --> 00:59:00,574
Get some sleep.

1524
00:59:02,534 --> 00:59:05,074
The coffee is great, Kwang Kyu. I appreciate it.

1525
00:59:05,374 --> 00:59:07,714
That's the least I can do.

1526
00:59:08,174 --> 00:59:11,213
I feel like we're stuck in Cheongdam-dong,

1527
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,514
but am I mistaken?

1528
00:59:12,744 --> 00:59:14,414
- No, earlier...
- It's like...

1529
00:59:14,514 --> 00:59:15,983
At first, it told me to take the Seongsu Bridge.

1530
00:59:15,984 --> 00:59:17,353
That's where we got...

1531
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:18,354
- the sundae soup.
- Correct.

1532
00:59:18,954 --> 00:59:20,894
- But...
- We keep driving in circles.

1533
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,723
It's fun.

1534
00:59:22,724 --> 00:59:24,194
(Back to the original spot)

1535
00:59:25,294 --> 00:59:28,564
We're back at the sundae soup place, but I finished mine.

1536
00:59:29,464 --> 00:59:30,963
(Embarrassed)

1537
00:59:30,964 --> 00:59:33,704
We should've just parked the car for food.

1538
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:35,933
- We could've just dined in.
- Right?

1539
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:37,603
The GPS isn't working again.

1540
00:59:37,604 --> 00:59:39,543
- Hey!
- Is the GPS not working?

1541
00:59:39,544 --> 00:59:40,743
The GPS stopped again.

1542
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,043
Should I turn mine on?

1543
00:59:42,044 --> 00:59:43,544
No, it's...

1544
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:46,713
I wanted to get some sleep.

1545
00:59:46,714 --> 00:59:48,013
- Go ahead.
- It's okay.

1546
00:59:48,014 --> 00:59:49,254
It'll work.

1547
00:59:51,524 --> 00:59:52,654
It's time for my medicine.

1548
00:59:54,254 --> 00:59:56,724
- Why not...
- Take it once we get there.

1549
00:59:57,894 --> 00:59:59,464
My teeth hurt.

1550
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:02,934
Please open it.

1551
01:00:03,064 --> 01:00:04,664
- I'll do it.
- No.

1552
01:00:05,504 --> 01:00:07,873
(I must take care of my older bestie.)

1553
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:10,173
If you park on the right for a bit, I'll take the wheel.

1554
01:00:10,174 --> 01:00:11,843
- No.
- I'm serious.

1555
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:13,774
(Take your medicine.)

1556
01:00:16,174 --> 01:00:20,584
(Fidgeting)

1557
01:00:21,354 --> 01:00:23,783
If you're just going to touch your medicine,

1558
01:00:23,784 --> 01:00:25,383
- how about I put it in your mouth?
- Did you not take it yet?

1559
01:00:25,384 --> 01:00:27,124
The pill... Can you...

1560
01:00:27,254 --> 01:00:28,823
- place it in my hand?
- Put it on his palm.

1561
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:31,064
- Stay like that. Yes, that's it.
- Okay.

1562
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,464
Seriously.

1563
01:00:33,264 --> 01:00:34,493
- All set.
- Thanks.

1564
01:00:34,494 --> 01:00:36,034
(The nearly 60-year-old needs to be taken care of.)

1565
01:00:36,364 --> 01:00:37,863
- You two need a manager, - Here.

1566
01:00:37,864 --> 01:00:39,234
not to be one.

1567
01:00:41,074 --> 01:00:42,534
This is all so fun.

1568
01:00:43,334 --> 01:00:45,404
(Shaking the water inside his mouth)

1569
01:00:46,704 --> 01:00:48,144
I miss my family.

1570
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:50,173
All of a sudden?

1571
01:00:50,174 --> 01:00:52,043
I miss them when things are hard.

1572
01:00:52,044 --> 01:00:53,583
(Grumpy Secretary makes her miss her family.)

1573
01:00:53,584 --> 01:00:54,584
(Arrived at the studio)

1574
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:56,914
- We're almost there.
- That's great news.

1575
01:00:57,054 --> 01:00:59,984
It only took as long as we were circling Cheongdam-dong.

1576
01:01:00,954 --> 01:01:02,324
Aren't I right?

1577
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:03,824
Really.

1578
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:06,164
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1579
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:08,463
At least we got here in one piece.

1580
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:09,994
The GPS is still in Seongdong-gu.

1581
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:13,364
What do I do with this GPS?

1582
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:15,474
Do you need something from the car?

1583
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:16,973
My fan.

1584
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:18,304
Let's take her fan.

1585
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:19,673
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

1586
01:01:19,674 --> 01:01:21,643
Get me the blanket from behind.

1587
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,073
- Blanket?
- The one on the seat.

1588
01:01:23,074 --> 01:01:24,084
Okay.

1589
01:01:26,484 --> 01:01:28,653
The fan legs, Kwang Kyu.

1590
01:01:28,654 --> 01:01:29,714
Got it.

1591
01:01:31,384 --> 01:01:35,394
(Su Ji's 2 fans, water, and blanket)

1592
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:37,463
Where is it?

1593
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:39,263
- Over there. No, this way.
- That way?

1594
01:01:39,264 --> 01:01:43,064
(My Star's Schedule: 2:30pm, YouTube studio in Yeonhui-dong)

1595
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:44,964
Is this the place?

1596
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:46,563
- Is this the place?
- Is it?

1597
01:01:46,564 --> 01:01:48,503
- Yes, hi.
- Hi.

1598
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,834
(Taking the lead to find the studio)

1599
01:01:50,134 --> 01:01:52,073
- Hi.
- Hi.

1600
01:01:52,074 --> 01:01:55,674
(Entering My Star's studio with the fan legs)

1601
01:01:58,014 --> 01:01:59,443
Do I sleep in this room?

1602
01:01:59,444 --> 01:02:02,053
Yes, but we'll do the interview first.

1603
01:02:02,054 --> 01:02:03,883
The scene of you waking up in the morning...

1604
01:02:03,884 --> 01:02:05,854
- I see.
- will be shot separately.

1605
01:02:06,754 --> 01:02:08,323
So you have to act.

1606
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,823
(HAMBUGGY's daily life vlog)

1607
01:02:09,824 --> 01:02:12,164
- Let's do a short rehearsal.
- Okay.

1608
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:14,363
This is the script.

1609
01:02:14,364 --> 01:02:15,894
- Can we start?
- Yes.

1610
01:02:20,604 --> 01:02:23,004
(Moving around)

1611
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:28,573
(The Grumpy Secretary can't really see the letters.)

1612
01:02:28,574 --> 01:02:29,714
(Producer, Writer)

1613
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:33,714
(Turning the flash on)

1614
01:02:35,514 --> 01:02:38,754
(Blurry)

1615
01:02:39,354 --> 01:02:46,524
(Reading it carefully despite not being able to see well)

1616
01:02:51,004 --> 01:02:52,803
- The Mangwon Market scene.
- Yes?

1617
01:02:52,804 --> 01:02:56,173
Does "elderly" actually mean old men and women?

1618
01:02:56,174 --> 01:02:58,843
- Yes.
- Rather than that, how about...

1619
01:02:58,844 --> 01:03:01,674
we say that everything at Mangwon Market becomes my thing?

1620
01:03:01,814 --> 01:03:04,613
Like everything becomes my material.

1621
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,713
- Nice.
- Twisted donuts,

1622
01:03:05,714 --> 01:03:07,553
- chicken feet, jokbal.
- I like that.

1623
01:03:07,554 --> 01:03:09,554
- Let's have a list of those.
- Okay.

1624
01:03:09,584 --> 01:03:11,284
That fits HAMBUGGY more.

1625
01:03:11,324 --> 01:03:13,023
Harder than basic arithmetic

1626
01:03:13,024 --> 01:03:15,153
Earlier, I had this idea.

1627
01:03:15,154 --> 01:03:16,993
(The meeting continues.)

1628
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:20,494
Madam Park Jang Mi who said I'd fail

1629
01:03:20,794 --> 01:03:25,363
(As the meeting drags on, )

1630
01:03:25,364 --> 01:03:30,474
(they start to lose focus.)

1631
01:03:31,744 --> 01:03:36,313
(The side effect of the medicine is kicking in.)

1632
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:37,614
Starting from "eating fried chicken."

1633
01:03:38,844 --> 01:03:41,254
(Moving)

1634
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,114
I'm sleepy.

1635
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:45,354
Something about the key being one key.

1636
01:03:45,684 --> 01:03:47,353
What is it that they say these days?

1637
01:03:47,354 --> 01:03:49,794
(Being self-conscious)

1638
01:03:50,964 --> 01:03:55,394
(Producer, Writer)

1639
01:03:56,694 --> 01:03:57,734
(Groaning)

1640
01:03:59,064 --> 01:04:03,634
(The life of a Grumpy Secretary isn't easy.)

1641
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,673
(Looking around)

1642
01:04:05,674 --> 01:04:06,944
A pillow...

1643
01:04:08,374 --> 01:04:10,044
What are you looking for? A pillow?

1644
01:04:10,474 --> 01:04:12,814
Are you looking for a pillow? Good grief.

1645
01:04:14,814 --> 01:04:19,483
(The Star is working while the managers take a break.)

1646
01:04:19,484 --> 01:04:25,064
(Along with a toothache)

1647
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:30,334
Su Ji must also have it tough.

1648
01:04:31,164 --> 01:04:32,364
- Right?
- What?

1649
01:04:32,964 --> 01:04:34,374
She must also be tired.

1650
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:37,844
Having to change her voice must be tiresome.

1651
01:04:39,174 --> 01:04:41,243
- She has good stamina.
- Sorry?

1652
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,773
- She's got good energy.
- I know, right?

1653
01:04:42,774 --> 01:04:44,214
But she must be tired.

1654
01:04:47,044 --> 01:04:48,384
Why did you scan me from top to bottom?

1655
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:52,654
You're old now too.

1656
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:54,154
(Groaning)

1657
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:57,194
Goodness.

1658
01:04:57,564 --> 01:04:59,564
We don't have that big of an age gap, you know?

1659
01:05:00,794 --> 01:05:03,234
Your skin used to be firm. Have you stopped your treatments?

1660
01:05:03,364 --> 01:05:05,534
No matter how many treatments I get,

1661
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:07,164
I still age.

1662
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:11,674
That's true.

1663
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:13,804
(Cruel passage of time)

1664
01:05:14,174 --> 01:05:17,613
There's nothing we can do while Su Ji is working.

1665
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:18,614
(Snacks)

1666
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:20,314
The snacks in your car have gone bad.

1667
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:21,714
Was that in my car?

1668
01:05:24,784 --> 01:05:26,253
No.

1669
01:05:26,254 --> 01:05:27,423
They've gone bad already.

1670
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,253
Earlier, they were bright yellow.

1671
01:05:29,254 --> 01:05:30,294
(The bananas changed in just 4 hours.)

1672
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,024
It's like looking at you.

1673
01:05:33,324 --> 01:05:36,034
- It's the two of us.
- What?

1674
01:05:36,164 --> 01:05:37,464
It's you and me.

1675
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:39,964
Just look at them.

1676
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,633
We'll start with the hip-hop scene.

1677
01:05:43,634 --> 01:05:44,704
Okay.

1678
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,374
Where did the audio director go?

1679
01:05:46,844 --> 01:05:48,244
Manager.

1680
01:05:49,374 --> 01:05:50,784
- The people...
- Manager.

1681
01:05:51,884 --> 01:05:53,183
- She's asking for you.
- What?

1682
01:05:53,184 --> 01:05:54,313
- Manager.
- She's asking for a manager.

1683
01:05:54,314 --> 01:05:55,753
- Over here.
- Hold on.

1684
01:05:55,754 --> 01:05:58,354
Manager, are you sleeping?

1685
01:05:59,654 --> 01:06:02,324
- Manager.
- Yes?

1686
01:06:02,654 --> 01:06:05,193
- Manager.
- What?

1687
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:07,063
- You shouldn't be sleeping.
- This is the manager's room.

1688
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:08,493
What are you eating?

1689
01:06:08,494 --> 01:06:10,133
You shouldn't eat the props.

1690
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:12,063
- I was eating bananas.
- Oh, bananas.

1691
01:06:12,064 --> 01:06:13,903
- Rotten bananas.
- I wouldn't eat the props.

1692
01:06:13,904 --> 01:06:16,073
- My stylist...
- Yes?

1693
01:06:16,074 --> 01:06:18,773
Please call over my hairstylist and makeup artist.

1694
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:19,804
Okay.

1695
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:21,473
Manager, are you sleeping?

1696
01:06:21,474 --> 01:06:23,313
- No.
- No, I'll call them from there.

1697
01:06:23,314 --> 01:06:25,683
It's time for my shoot now.

1698
01:06:25,684 --> 01:06:27,143
Your stylist?

1699
01:06:27,144 --> 01:06:28,554
She's here.

1700
01:06:29,254 --> 01:06:30,614
I see.

1701
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,024
She's here.

1702
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:37,764
(He was a step behind.)

1703
01:06:38,664 --> 01:06:42,694
(HAMBUGGY Time)

1704
01:06:43,134 --> 01:06:45,563
Hi, it's rapper HAMBUGGY.

1705
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:47,633
(The shoot for YouTube begins.)

1706
01:06:47,634 --> 01:06:49,674
It's Mealies from "Three Meals a Day."

1707
01:06:49,834 --> 01:06:52,873
Kimchi dumplings, meat dumplings, jokbal, chicken feet

1708
01:06:52,874 --> 01:06:54,674
BUGGY, BUGGY, HAM

1709
01:06:54,814 --> 01:06:56,444
Okay, cut. Cut here.

1710
01:06:56,944 --> 01:06:58,414
Cut here.

1711
01:06:59,514 --> 01:07:00,783
Mr. Seo Jin.

1712
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:02,454
We have ten minutes to spare.

1713
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:04,113
(Mr. Seo Jin.)

1714
01:07:04,114 --> 01:07:05,854
We have ten minutes to spare.

1715
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:07,653
Can you pass me the blanket?

1716
01:07:07,654 --> 01:07:09,623
- Blanket?
- Yes, I'll be sleeping here.

1717
01:07:09,624 --> 01:07:11,793
Is that so? Then the wool blanket is a must.

1718
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,464
(My Star has requested the blanket as a prop.)

1719
01:07:13,924 --> 01:07:17,394
(Grumpy Secretary is at work.)

1720
01:07:18,904 --> 01:07:21,234
Here you go. How about covering yourself with it?

1721
01:07:21,534 --> 01:07:23,004
- Let's lay it out.
- Okay.

1722
01:07:23,304 --> 01:07:25,144
- It's nice. I mean it.
- I'm telling you it's nice.

1723
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,944
Wool blankets are warm in winter and cool in summer.

1724
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,173
- Really?
- Yes.

1725
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:31,043
That's why it cools you down when used as a sheet.

1726
01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:32,544
- And it's light.
- Yes.

1727
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:33,944
Nice.

1728
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:36,783
No way there's only six dollars left.

1729
01:07:36,784 --> 01:07:39,584
(The shoot resumes.)

1730
01:07:40,484 --> 01:07:43,794
(Bopping)

1731
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:49,893
(Shooting)

1732
01:07:49,894 --> 01:07:51,004
Seriously?

1733
01:07:51,304 --> 01:07:54,873
For real? I shook it like crazy, but all I got was 0.3 cents.

1734
01:07:54,874 --> 01:07:58,103
(Shooting)

1735
01:07:58,104 --> 01:07:59,144
Good.

1736
01:07:59,444 --> 01:08:03,843
(The fan is on standby.)

1737
01:08:03,844 --> 01:08:05,684
Can you fix my bandana?

1738
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:07,314
Okay.

1739
01:08:07,514 --> 01:08:08,854
Stylist.

1740
01:08:10,014 --> 01:08:11,224
Come over here, please.

1741
01:08:11,724 --> 01:08:14,754
(I did it this time!)

1742
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:17,324
They want you to move the car.

1743
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:19,323
The car? Okay.

1744
01:08:19,324 --> 01:08:22,594
(Caretaker Fairy is off to move the car.)

1745
01:08:23,894 --> 01:08:26,734
Can you wipe the sweat off my neck, please?

1746
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,304
Me?

1747
01:08:30,734 --> 01:08:31,804
Your sweat?

1748
01:08:31,844 --> 01:08:33,274
Yes, hurry up, please.

1749
01:08:33,804 --> 01:08:35,213
Won't it look weird if I do it?

1750
01:08:35,214 --> 01:08:36,774
(Worried)

1751
01:08:37,144 --> 01:08:38,284
Why are you sweating so much?

1752
01:08:39,014 --> 01:08:40,414
Because I'm working.

1753
01:08:43,654 --> 01:08:44,984
But that's a wet wipe.

1754
01:08:45,084 --> 01:08:46,353
I was given wet wipes.

1755
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:48,923
- You can't use wet wipes.
- Wet wipes for sweat?

1756
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:51,263
For now, let's use this for your neck.

1757
01:08:51,264 --> 01:08:53,394
It's the back of my neck, not the front.

1758
01:08:53,694 --> 01:08:55,193
- The wig is in the way.
- Is that so?

1759
01:08:55,194 --> 01:08:58,004
(The back of her neck is sweaty from the wig.)

1760
01:08:59,704 --> 01:09:00,934
I don't think I can do it.

1761
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,804
- What?
- Here?

1762
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:05,304
Please wipe my back.

1763
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:09,513
Your back? How? Do I put my hand inside your top?

1764
01:09:09,514 --> 01:09:10,913
It's weird, so no.

1765
01:09:10,914 --> 01:09:12,313
(It's too private a place for the Grumpy Secretary.)

1766
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:13,713
The sweat on my back.

1767
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,254
- I can't wipe it for you.
- Is that so?

1768
01:09:16,754 --> 01:09:18,283
It's weird if I wipe your back.

1769
01:09:18,284 --> 01:09:20,624
Then wipe the back of my neck with a tissue.

1770
01:09:23,554 --> 01:09:25,564
I can't wipe it off.

1771
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:27,124
Lift the wig up.

1772
01:09:30,064 --> 01:09:31,734
The wig is so thick.

1773
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,964
- The wig is thick, isn't it?
- Gosh.

1774
01:09:34,534 --> 01:09:35,833
It's for youngsters.

1775
01:09:35,834 --> 01:09:37,944
(Dabbing)

1776
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:39,773
(Grumpy Secretary grumbles but does his job.)

1777
01:09:39,774 --> 01:09:41,543
- All set, right?
- Yes.

1778
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:42,573
- Good.
- Thank you.

1779
01:09:42,574 --> 01:09:44,584
- Place your neck near the AC.
- What?

1780
01:09:44,884 --> 01:09:46,114
Stand like this.

1781
01:09:49,054 --> 01:09:50,054
(Sighing)

1782
01:09:50,654 --> 01:09:52,184
Please wipe my armpits.

1783
01:09:52,724 --> 01:09:54,724
(Opening her armpit)

1784
01:09:54,894 --> 01:09:56,754
Su Ji, stop it.

1785
01:09:57,924 --> 01:09:59,964
Don't ask for such a thing.

1786
01:10:00,794 --> 01:10:01,894
Okay?

1787
01:10:02,694 --> 01:10:04,333
(Opening her armpit again)

1788
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:06,264
Can you use the fan on me?

1789
01:10:07,534 --> 01:10:11,074
(If the Star asks, he does it, except for the back and armpits.)

1790
01:10:11,204 --> 01:10:13,344
Where did Kim Kwang Kyu go?

1791
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:20,584
(Grumpy Secretary is taking a short break before the next drive.)

1792
01:10:23,714 --> 01:10:25,783
- What were you doing?
- I was in the car.

1793
01:10:25,784 --> 01:10:27,724
Why were you in the car and not here?

1794
01:10:27,954 --> 01:10:29,824
You should be here.

1795
01:10:31,194 --> 01:10:32,464
They said it was crowded inside.

1796
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:34,394
Stop lying.

1797
01:10:36,664 --> 01:10:38,163
Isn't it really hot in here?

1798
01:10:38,164 --> 01:10:39,634
It's fine if you don't move.

1799
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:43,474
Does Su Ji need her fan?

1800
01:10:43,974 --> 01:10:45,743
I wiped all her sweat.

1801
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:46,804
Really?

1802
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:50,473
(Filming the final scene)

1803
01:10:50,474 --> 01:10:52,883
Su Ji works so hard.

1804
01:10:52,884 --> 01:10:56,054
She really keeps pushing herself and growing.

1805
01:10:56,154 --> 01:10:57,884
To create those characters...

1806
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,683
She's not imitating anyone. She's making them from scratch.

1807
01:11:00,684 --> 01:11:03,154
You need real creativity for that.

1808
01:11:03,524 --> 01:11:04,624
That's impressive.

1809
01:11:04,824 --> 01:11:07,423
I'm sure she's always thinking about work,

1810
01:11:07,424 --> 01:11:08,734
no matter what she sees.

1811
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:11,464
She'd be like, "How can I make use of it?"

1812
01:11:13,204 --> 01:11:15,303
(Waiting outside after the shoot wrapped up)

1813
01:11:15,304 --> 01:11:18,244
To walk up this street is...

1814
01:11:18,604 --> 01:11:19,974
It's basically like hiking.

1815
01:11:20,704 --> 01:11:24,014
This hill alone would make you sweat buckets.

1816
01:11:24,814 --> 01:11:26,314
You've never lived somewhere like this, right?

1817
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:28,284
- A hill?
- Yes.

1818
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:30,714
My school used to be in a place like this.

1819
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,184
- High school?
- Middle school.

1820
01:11:33,754 --> 01:11:35,224
It sat on top of a mountain.

1821
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:38,923
That steep hill in Sindang-dong and Geumho-dong.

1822
01:11:38,924 --> 01:11:41,064
The one on that side?

1823
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:43,794
I threw up on the first day of school because I couldn't breathe.

1824
01:11:45,104 --> 01:11:46,733
You grew up sheltered.

1825
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:49,703
It was the hill from Cheonggu Station...

1826
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:51,004
- up to Geumho-dong.
- I see.

1827
01:11:52,644 --> 01:11:54,303
I used to be like a flying squirrel when I was a kid,

1828
01:11:54,304 --> 01:11:55,473
just zooming around everywhere.

1829
01:11:55,474 --> 01:11:57,244
(Time flies.)

1830
01:11:59,744 --> 01:12:00,744
Sergeant Kim.

1831
01:12:01,954 --> 01:12:03,184
What about your knees?

1832
01:12:03,554 --> 01:12:05,383
You can't go down this hill, can you?

1833
01:12:05,384 --> 01:12:06,484
I can't.

1834
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:08,423
- This is how I have to go down.
- What?

1835
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:10,994
(He can only go down sideways like a crab.)

1836
01:12:11,054 --> 01:12:13,364
When I used to dig up kudzu as a kid,

1837
01:12:13,524 --> 01:12:16,233
I'd sprint like lightning whenever there was a crackdown.

1838
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:18,504
- When you did what?
- When I went to dig up kudzu.

1839
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:20,133
You go kudzu digging in the mountains.

1840
01:12:20,134 --> 01:12:21,374
(Kudzu digging in the mountains?)

1841
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,033
Wasn't that during the Korean War?

1842
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:25,673
You little... We're from the same generation.

1843
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,544
- Kudzu digging?
- Didn't you go kudzu digging?

1844
01:12:27,704 --> 01:12:29,013
- Kudzu digging?
- Of course.

1845
01:12:29,014 --> 01:12:30,673
People went kudzu digging.

1846
01:12:30,674 --> 01:12:32,414
We'd pick the fruit of the manggae tree to eat too.

1847
01:12:33,344 --> 01:12:36,514
(My Star is done with her shoot.)

1848
01:12:36,854 --> 01:12:40,924
(Looking around)

1849
01:12:42,354 --> 01:12:45,324
(Greeting the neighbourhood resident)

1850
01:12:46,064 --> 01:12:48,134
Have you seen my manager?

1851
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:50,964
- We wouldn't know.
- I see.

1852
01:12:53,204 --> 01:12:56,504
(Where did they disappear to this time?)

1853
01:12:56,674 --> 01:13:00,174
(Searching desperately for her managers)

1854
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:02,874
Have you seen my manager?

1855
01:13:03,774 --> 01:13:05,114
- Down there?
- The car.

1856
01:13:05,444 --> 01:13:07,213
(Running)

1857
01:13:07,214 --> 01:13:08,553
(Kwang Kyu runs carefully with his bad knees.)

1858
01:13:08,554 --> 01:13:09,653
- Gosh.
- Wait.

1859
01:13:09,654 --> 01:13:10,753
I only see one person running.

1860
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:12,154
Goodness.

1861
01:13:13,324 --> 01:13:15,253
- Run, will you?
- Let's get going, Su Ji.

1862
01:13:15,254 --> 01:13:16,294
We have to go, Su Ji.

1863
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:18,524
- Come up.
- Why?

1864
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,363
- She wants you up here.
- Sir,

1865
01:13:20,364 --> 01:13:21,793
this is...

1866
01:13:21,794 --> 01:13:23,893
This is Kwang Kyu's responsibility, not mine.

1867
01:13:23,894 --> 01:13:25,133
I was responsible for all your clothes.

1868
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,533
This is my most cherished treasure. How could you...

1869
01:13:27,534 --> 01:13:29,533
- leave this...
- But that's...

1870
01:13:29,534 --> 01:13:31,804
- as my manager?
- He was supposed to carry that.

1871
01:13:31,944 --> 01:13:33,943
You should have helped me.

1872
01:13:33,944 --> 01:13:35,343
Help each other out.

1873
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:36,773
- Okay. Let's go.
- All right.

1874
01:13:36,774 --> 01:13:37,774
Come on.

1875
01:13:39,084 --> 01:13:40,384
(He eventually picked up the fan.)

1876
01:13:43,954 --> 01:13:45,624
Kwang Kyu, open the door.

1877
01:13:47,054 --> 01:13:48,224
Don't you have the keys?

1878
01:13:48,494 --> 01:13:50,623
- What?
- You lost the car keys now?

1879
01:13:50,624 --> 01:13:52,023
No, I have them.

1880
01:13:52,024 --> 01:13:53,194
(Anxious)

1881
01:13:53,364 --> 01:13:55,894
You two are very dramatic.

1882
01:13:59,464 --> 01:14:00,464
Oh, it opens.

1883
01:14:02,274 --> 01:14:04,474
- It opens!
- Does it open?

1884
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:06,044
Get in.

1885
01:14:06,644 --> 01:14:09,243
(They finally get off work after 8 hours.)

1886
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:10,814
Thank you.

1887
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:13,243
- The schedule for the day...
- The schedule for the day.

1888
01:14:13,244 --> 01:14:14,583
is over!

1889
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:17,784
We're having a team dinner. Is there anything you want?

1890
01:14:17,814 --> 01:14:19,383
I want Korean food.

1891
01:14:19,384 --> 01:14:21,024
- Me too.
- Korean food?

1892
01:14:21,084 --> 01:14:23,023
I'll take you to a Korean restaurant that I know.

1893
01:14:23,024 --> 01:14:24,054
Really?

1894
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:26,894
I'm a regular there. I'll give you the address.

1895
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:30,034
This must be the rich part of Yeonhui-dong.

1896
01:14:30,864 --> 01:14:32,033
This is...

1897
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,063
Yes, it's the road to Hongdae.

1898
01:14:34,064 --> 01:14:36,173
- This must be Yeonhui-dong.
- This is...

1899
01:14:36,174 --> 01:14:37,633
where I filmed "Phoenix."

1900
01:14:37,634 --> 01:14:39,273
- It was this gas station.
- This one right here?

1901
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,544
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1902
01:14:41,274 --> 01:14:42,613
- "Phoenix." - I played...

1903
01:14:42,614 --> 01:14:44,174
the part-timer.

1904
01:14:44,544 --> 01:14:47,344
- No way.
- A part-timer at this gas station.

1905
01:14:47,614 --> 01:14:50,084
I feel like I'm on a time travel!

1906
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:53,053
Every time I talk to the two of you,

1907
01:14:53,054 --> 01:14:56,354
I'm travelling back through time!

1908
01:14:59,994 --> 01:15:03,134
Isn't it difficult altering your voice?

1909
01:15:03,264 --> 01:15:05,033
- It is difficult.
- Right?

1910
01:15:05,034 --> 01:15:07,063
- It is.
- It looks tough.

1911
01:15:07,064 --> 01:15:09,804
It's different from how we speak in our normal voices.

1912
01:15:10,374 --> 01:15:13,143
The toughest part today is that my arms hurt so much.

1913
01:15:13,144 --> 01:15:14,503
- From shaking the bottle?
- Yes.

1914
01:15:14,504 --> 01:15:15,873
(From moving too hard)

1915
01:15:15,874 --> 01:15:18,684
Maybe I need to exercise. Right?

1916
01:15:19,184 --> 01:15:21,354
- You know, lift some weights.
- No, that's not it.

1917
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:24,053
It gets tough when you're not used to it.

1918
01:15:24,054 --> 01:15:27,084
You rarely have to shake something with your hands.

1919
01:15:27,654 --> 01:15:29,454
Would you like me to get you a pain relief patch?

1920
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:31,624
Yes.

1921
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,424
I see.

1922
01:15:33,664 --> 01:15:37,664
You asked her, expecting her to say, "It's fine," didn't you?

1923
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:39,003
- You seem flustered.
- Yes.

1924
01:15:39,004 --> 01:15:40,533
- Yes, please.
- Yes.

1925
01:15:40,534 --> 01:15:41,733
- Please do.
- Did you notice that?

1926
01:15:41,734 --> 01:15:42,873
He was flustered instantly.

1927
01:15:42,874 --> 01:15:44,104
- Please get them.
- No, I wasn't.

1928
01:15:44,304 --> 01:15:46,373
He was so surprised when you said, "Yes."

1929
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:47,944
(Laughing awkwardly)

1930
01:15:48,574 --> 01:15:49,773
I think we're supposed to park here.

1931
01:15:49,774 --> 01:15:52,143
(They arrived at the restaurant for the team dinner.)

1932
01:15:52,144 --> 01:15:53,283
Shouldn't you park it closer?

1933
01:15:53,284 --> 01:15:54,584
Should I?

1934
01:15:57,284 --> 01:15:58,854
What's that in front of us?

1935
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:01,184
You bumped into it!

1936
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:02,753
(Thudding)

1937
01:16:02,754 --> 01:16:03,794
You bumped into it!

1938
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:06,394
You bumped into it!

1939
01:16:07,164 --> 01:16:10,394
(Did you just scratch the van?)

1940
01:16:10,694 --> 01:16:12,403
No, it was the automatic brake.

1941
01:16:12,404 --> 01:16:13,433
- It stopped on its own?
- Really?

1942
01:16:13,434 --> 01:16:14,504
It braked on its own.

1943
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,973
(Relieved)

1944
01:16:17,974 --> 01:16:19,804
My heart is racing.

1945
01:16:20,404 --> 01:16:21,844
Go forward a bit.

1946
01:16:22,014 --> 01:16:23,274
I was so scared.

1947
01:16:26,984 --> 01:16:28,083
Good work today.

1948
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,513
- Good work.
- Great work.

1949
01:16:29,514 --> 01:16:30,854
Thank you for driving.

1950
01:16:31,014 --> 01:16:32,384
Hold on.

1951
01:16:33,024 --> 01:16:34,923
I'll go and get a pain relief patch. I found it.

1952
01:16:34,924 --> 01:16:36,193
- Is there a pharmacy nearby?
- Yes, it's close.

1953
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:37,653
What if the heat gets to you?

1954
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:38,993
No, it's not that hot anymore.

1955
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:40,263
(Kwang Kyu goes to buy a pain relief patch for her.)

1956
01:16:40,264 --> 01:16:41,994
Please get my hair rollers.

1957
01:16:43,194 --> 01:16:45,063
How do my lips look?

1958
01:16:45,064 --> 01:16:46,904
(Resetting her beauty in the meantime)

1959
01:16:48,074 --> 01:16:50,134
(Looking blankly)

1960
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:52,704
I look far cuter, don't I?

1961
01:16:54,504 --> 01:16:57,643
(Still no?)

1962
01:16:57,644 --> 01:17:00,414
(He only shows his dimples.)

1963
01:17:01,954 --> 01:17:03,184
You know,

1964
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:05,523
when you spend a day together,

1965
01:17:05,524 --> 01:17:07,684
you're supposed to get familiar.

1966
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:10,324
But he keeps doing that, so I'm a little tired.

1967
01:17:10,824 --> 01:17:12,694
We should be helping each other out.

1968
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:14,494
I'm only getting tired of him.

1969
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:17,093
Oh, this is a cultivator.

1970
01:17:17,094 --> 01:17:18,663
One of them still lives in the 1900s,

1971
01:17:18,664 --> 01:17:21,264
and the other lives in the 1980s.

1972
01:17:22,674 --> 01:17:26,644
(The distance won't get any closer.)

1973
01:17:30,544 --> 01:17:33,414
Where do you want the patch?

1974
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,413
(Going next to her)

1975
01:17:37,414 --> 01:17:38,854
Okay. Let's see.

1976
01:17:41,594 --> 01:17:46,063
(I'll look after My Star's arm.)

1977
01:17:46,064 --> 01:17:47,264
That's it.

1978
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:50,163
This part. It hurts the most.

1979
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:51,333
- Here?
- Yes.

1980
01:17:51,334 --> 01:17:54,204
(Giving her a massage)

1981
01:17:54,334 --> 01:17:55,634
- Here?
- Yes.

1982
01:17:55,734 --> 01:17:56,804
Go harder.

1983
01:17:57,534 --> 01:18:00,344
(Rubbing it hard)

1984
01:18:00,444 --> 01:18:02,473
Your arm is so strong.

1985
01:18:02,474 --> 01:18:04,473
Right? It's the type of fat you can never lose.

1986
01:18:04,474 --> 01:18:05,643
- It's solid.
- I've been this way...

1987
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:06,644
since I was little.

1988
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:08,484
It's so resilient.

1989
01:18:10,254 --> 01:18:12,224
My fingers won't even go in.

1990
01:18:13,424 --> 01:18:16,723
Hold on. What do you mean, "My fingers won't go in?"

1991
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:18,624
It's very solid.

1992
01:18:22,234 --> 01:18:24,034
It's fine. It doesn't really help.

1993
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:25,304
I'd rather do it myself.

1994
01:18:25,564 --> 01:18:26,564
My fingers won't go in.

1995
01:18:26,564 --> 01:18:27,564
(He starts running right before he sees My Star.)

1996
01:18:27,565 --> 01:18:28,774
- There he is.
- There he is.

1997
01:18:28,974 --> 01:18:30,774
Kwang Kyu!

1998
01:18:31,844 --> 01:18:33,404
Thank you so much.

1999
01:18:33,944 --> 01:18:35,013
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

2000
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:36,673
What did you wipe, by the way?

2001
01:18:36,674 --> 01:18:38,513
(Laughing)

2002
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:39,584
Was it too obvious?

2003
01:18:40,314 --> 01:18:44,154
(He's only focused on the pain relief patch.)

2004
01:18:45,384 --> 01:18:47,753
(Kwang Kyu does all the work, )

2005
01:18:47,754 --> 01:18:50,124
(and the patch goes into Seo Jin's hands.)

2006
01:18:53,224 --> 01:18:55,363
- Which part?
- It hurts here...

2007
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:56,863
- Yes, that part.
- Right?

2008
01:18:56,864 --> 01:18:58,434
- This is the center.
- The center.

2009
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,463
Can you put it on this side too?

2010
01:19:00,464 --> 01:19:02,404
- Sure.
- Here.

2011
01:19:04,904 --> 01:19:07,004
Here? How come your arm is so strong?

2012
01:19:07,274 --> 01:19:09,513
I told you, didn't I? My fingers won't go in.

2013
01:19:09,514 --> 01:19:11,744
I mean... Okay.

2014
01:19:12,084 --> 01:19:14,884
- What should we do?
- What do you mean?

2015
01:19:15,514 --> 01:19:17,484
I've been like this my whole life.

2016
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,323
I thought it was from the shaking today.

2017
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:23,524
- No, I'm usually solid.
- It's her whole body.

2018
01:19:25,164 --> 01:19:27,223
- How are your shoulders?
- They're fine.

2019
01:19:27,224 --> 01:19:28,893
(They put the patches meticulously.)

2020
01:19:28,894 --> 01:19:30,164
Thank you.

2021
01:19:30,534 --> 01:19:32,363
- We have to go now.
- Hello.

2022
01:19:32,364 --> 01:19:33,503
- Hi.
- I'll show you to your table.

2023
01:19:33,504 --> 01:19:34,764
- Thanks.
- Hi.

2024
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:36,433
I'm so excited.

2025
01:19:36,434 --> 01:19:37,834
(They enter Su Ji's frequented restaurant.)

2026
01:19:38,204 --> 01:19:40,103
Su Ji, can you order for us?

2027
01:19:40,104 --> 01:19:41,343
You're a regular here, so...

2028
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:43,913
My day is over, so I'll be your manager now.

2029
01:19:43,914 --> 01:19:44,984
No, that's okay.

2030
01:19:46,484 --> 01:19:48,483
(They can't hide their smiles.)

2031
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:49,913
I'll order.

2032
01:19:49,914 --> 01:19:51,983
We must start with two assorted platters.

2033
01:19:51,984 --> 01:19:54,124
- Let's just get one platter.
- Two platters.

2034
01:19:54,184 --> 01:19:55,524
- What?
- But it's 1,000g.

2035
01:19:56,094 --> 01:19:57,194
Come on!

2036
01:19:58,094 --> 01:20:00,663
It's 500g per platter.

2037
01:20:00,664 --> 01:20:02,633
- It'll be gone in a second.
- Really?

2038
01:20:02,634 --> 01:20:04,293
Are you sure you can eat that with other dishes?

2039
01:20:04,294 --> 01:20:05,803
- Yes, I am.
- Really?

2040
01:20:05,804 --> 01:20:07,363
- And how about this? It's good.
- Which one?

2041
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:09,433
- Original Doenjang Stew.
- Original Doenjang Stew...

2042
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:10,634
and rice.

2043
01:20:11,434 --> 01:20:13,573
- Can we get steamed eggs too?
- I'd like that.

2044
01:20:13,574 --> 01:20:14,843
I need drinks.

2045
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:15,914
Drinks?

2046
01:20:16,014 --> 01:20:17,913
- I can't drink.
- Oh, you can't drink.

2047
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:19,943
- No.
- Oh, right.

2048
01:20:19,944 --> 01:20:22,914
You barely get to drink these days.

2049
01:20:23,484 --> 01:20:24,554
Why?

2050
01:20:24,614 --> 01:20:26,284
You couldn't drink last time because of the surgery.

2051
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:30,923
- Great work today.
- Good work, everyone.

2052
01:20:30,924 --> 01:20:33,124
- Great work.
- Good job.

2053
01:20:33,424 --> 01:20:35,394
(Sipping on soda)

2054
01:20:37,594 --> 01:20:40,334
(Turning away and drinking)

2055
01:20:41,874 --> 01:20:42,874
(Exclaiming)

2056
01:20:43,234 --> 01:20:44,873
Su Ji, just drink while facing us.

2057
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,273
Why would you look away?

2058
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,803
My mom told me to keep drinkers' etiquette...

2059
01:20:47,804 --> 01:20:49,213
in front of the elderly.

2060
01:20:49,214 --> 01:20:50,573
We're friends.

2061
01:20:50,574 --> 01:20:51,983
- We're friends?
- Yes.

2062
01:20:51,984 --> 01:20:53,013
(Friends with an average age of 55.5)

2063
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,154
(Drinking comfortably in front of her friends)

2064
01:20:55,354 --> 01:20:58,153
- I tend to drink fast.
- So do I.

2065
01:20:58,154 --> 01:21:00,683
I first learned how to drink in Daehangno.

2066
01:21:00,684 --> 01:21:04,053
We had to drink fast before the last bus,

2067
01:21:04,054 --> 01:21:06,064
so I tend to drink fast.

2068
01:21:06,764 --> 01:21:08,124
How long were you in Daehangno?

2069
01:21:08,534 --> 01:21:11,234
Two years? Two or three years.

2070
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:14,103
I was a rookie on "People Looking for a Laugh."

2071
01:21:14,104 --> 01:21:15,133
Right.

2072
01:21:15,134 --> 01:21:17,174
- You must have given out flyers.
- I did.

2073
01:21:17,474 --> 01:21:21,273
But I'm shyer around strangers than people think,

2074
01:21:21,274 --> 01:21:24,214
so giving out flyers was such a difficult task for me.

2075
01:21:24,344 --> 01:21:25,713
- I see.
- And...

2076
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,413
we had to fill the quota on weekends,

2077
01:21:28,414 --> 01:21:31,453
but I hesitated in front of strangers,

2078
01:21:31,454 --> 01:21:33,223
so I asked my boyfriend at the time...

2079
01:21:33,224 --> 01:21:37,693
to fill the seats for me.

2080
01:21:37,694 --> 01:21:39,463
- Then, - Like, "Lee Su Ji, three people."

2081
01:21:39,464 --> 01:21:41,794
is your boyfriend at the time someone we might know?

2082
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,264
It should be!

2083
01:21:47,364 --> 01:21:49,203
If they were on the show together.

2084
01:21:49,204 --> 01:21:51,373
(A sharp question came out of nowhere.)

2085
01:21:51,374 --> 01:21:53,803
No, I'm not asking you to tell us his name.

2086
01:21:53,804 --> 01:21:55,743
I just want to know if I'm right.

2087
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,074
No comment.

2088
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,344
I'm a veteran.

2089
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:02,884
(Sizzling)

2090
01:22:03,054 --> 01:22:04,054
(Sizzling)

2091
01:22:04,814 --> 01:22:08,053
(The pork belly is being cooked nicely.)

2092
01:22:08,054 --> 01:22:09,724
Beautiful!

2093
01:22:10,394 --> 01:22:12,824
(Pork belly looks beautiful in Su Ji's eyes.)

2094
01:22:13,924 --> 01:22:16,694
(Carefully biting it with his front teeth)

2095
01:22:17,994 --> 01:22:19,064
It's good.

2096
01:22:19,604 --> 01:22:20,634
Right?

2097
01:22:21,664 --> 01:22:24,474
(Making a wrap)

2098
01:22:30,344 --> 01:22:34,183
(Yummy)

2099
01:22:34,184 --> 01:22:35,214
(Moaning)

2100
01:22:35,614 --> 01:22:37,354
(Smiling)

2101
01:22:37,854 --> 01:22:40,724
(HAMBUGGY refuses to starve.)

2102
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,993
(Moaning)

2103
01:22:42,994 --> 01:22:44,293
So good, right?

2104
01:22:44,294 --> 01:22:45,764
You didn't even eat it yet.

2105
01:22:46,994 --> 01:22:48,994
It's so delicious.

2106
01:22:49,534 --> 01:22:51,294
Seo Jin, how much can you drink?

2107
01:22:51,694 --> 01:22:54,334
I'm not sure, but I know I'm not a heavy drinker.

2108
01:22:54,564 --> 01:22:57,404
As you get older, you tend to sleep less.

2109
01:22:57,874 --> 01:22:59,903
So, you can't fall asleep that easily.

2110
01:22:59,904 --> 01:23:01,943
That's why I drink. To go to sleep.

2111
01:23:01,944 --> 01:23:03,673
When you have a glass of wine before bed...

2112
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:05,074
A bottle of wine.

2113
01:23:05,184 --> 01:23:06,283
- A bottle?
- Yes.

2114
01:23:06,284 --> 01:23:07,644
You drink a whole bottle before bed?

2115
01:23:07,844 --> 01:23:09,184
Then, you'll be smashed.

2116
01:23:09,914 --> 01:23:11,384
No, I drink a bottle during dinner.

2117
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:15,824
But you know a lot of doctors, right?

2118
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:17,323
Don't they tell you...

2119
01:23:17,324 --> 01:23:19,793
that drinking alcohol with meals is a major cause of colon cancer...

2120
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,664
and that you should stop?

2121
01:23:22,494 --> 01:23:25,934
What doctors tell me is important,

2122
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:29,703
but I'd be even more stressed out and fall ill...

2123
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:31,533
if I can't enjoy what I like.

2124
01:23:31,534 --> 01:23:33,374
I asked because I've been conscious of that.

2125
01:23:33,774 --> 01:23:35,713
They say drinking alcohol leads to colon cancer.

2126
01:23:35,714 --> 01:23:38,444
My father passed away due to colon cancer,

2127
01:23:38,614 --> 01:23:40,413
- so it even runs in the family.
- Okay.

2128
01:23:40,414 --> 01:23:42,513
But at the time he passed away,

2129
01:23:42,514 --> 01:23:44,314
not many people got checked for colon cancer.

2130
01:23:44,584 --> 01:23:46,823
But we often get checked for it nowadays,

2131
01:23:46,824 --> 01:23:48,223
- Really?
- so it's okay.

2132
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:50,024
You only have to get a checkup every year, right?

2133
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:53,793
No, you just need a colonoscopy every 4 to 5 years.

2134
01:23:53,794 --> 01:23:55,464
- That long?
- Yes. But...

2135
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:57,533
it's after you get it checked once.

2136
01:23:57,534 --> 01:23:59,133
(He turns from an awkward manager to a close friend.)

2137
01:23:59,134 --> 01:24:00,563
So, don't mind that...

2138
01:24:00,564 --> 01:24:02,504
and just visit the hospital often. Then, you're good to go.

2139
01:24:02,634 --> 01:24:03,904
Okay.

2140
01:24:04,074 --> 01:24:06,973
But you're always coming up with new characters.

2141
01:24:06,974 --> 01:24:09,413
- Yes.
- Are there times...

2142
01:24:09,414 --> 01:24:12,143
when you can't fall asleep because you're thinking so hard?

2143
01:24:12,144 --> 01:24:14,044
- No.
- That's good.

2144
01:24:14,284 --> 01:24:15,754
That happens when you get older.

2145
01:24:15,814 --> 01:24:17,783
As you get older...

2146
01:24:17,784 --> 01:24:20,324
How many times are you saying, "As you get older?"

2147
01:24:20,354 --> 01:24:22,094
Is the name of the show "As You Get Older?"

2148
01:24:22,824 --> 01:24:26,324
("As You Get Older by Lee Seo Jin?")

2149
01:24:26,524 --> 01:24:27,794
It was fun, though.

2150
01:24:28,664 --> 01:24:31,694
The best part of the day was...

2151
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:33,763
when you called Cheongdam Sundae Soup...

2152
01:24:33,764 --> 01:24:35,134
in Seongdong-gu.

2153
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:37,104
(He fiddles with his chopsticks as he's embarrassed.)

2154
01:24:38,704 --> 01:24:40,773
Who knew Cheongdam Sundae Soup would be...

2155
01:24:40,774 --> 01:24:42,614
on Ttukseom Island?

2156
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:47,013
That was so new and funny.

2157
01:24:47,014 --> 01:24:48,784
I feel bad for them,

2158
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,783
so keep this part in to promote the restaurant.

2159
01:24:51,784 --> 01:24:53,953
- Don't edit it out.
- Okay.

2160
01:24:53,954 --> 01:24:55,553
I'll be criticized, so make sure...

2161
01:24:55,554 --> 01:24:57,194
the name of the place is on TV, at least.

2162
01:24:59,194 --> 01:25:00,693
(We apologise once again to the people...)

2163
01:25:00,694 --> 01:25:02,164
(of Cheongdam Sundae Soup in Seongdong-gu.)

2164
01:25:02,434 --> 01:25:04,594
Anyway, Su Ji, congratulations.

2165
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:07,033
You've been winning a lot of awards...

2166
01:25:07,034 --> 01:25:08,703
and getting commercial gigs.

2167
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:09,933
Thank you so much.

2168
01:25:09,934 --> 01:25:12,044
You're literally the best right now.

2169
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:14,844
- No, I'm not.
- I agree with him.

2170
01:25:15,044 --> 01:25:16,744
Are you piling on my compliment?

2171
01:25:17,044 --> 01:25:18,273
Gosh.

2172
01:25:18,274 --> 01:25:21,713
But I know that it will eventually come to an end,

2173
01:25:21,714 --> 01:25:24,583
so I try to fully appreciate this moment.

2174
01:25:24,584 --> 01:25:25,884
Yes, that's good.

2175
01:25:26,254 --> 01:25:28,453
I know that it has an expiration date.

2176
01:25:28,454 --> 01:25:31,424
How long will it last, considering her current popularity?

2177
01:25:32,064 --> 01:25:35,123
But she's achieved so much until now.

2178
01:25:35,124 --> 01:25:36,663
That's the reason she can keep going.

2179
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:40,163
When your best days come...

2180
01:25:40,164 --> 01:25:43,074
after you've built so much over the years,

2181
01:25:43,274 --> 01:25:46,073
you can last longer if you manage yourself well.

2182
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,204
Thank you.

2183
01:25:47,774 --> 01:25:49,173
When people who haven't built anything up...

2184
01:25:49,174 --> 01:25:50,443
suddenly become successful,

2185
01:25:50,444 --> 01:25:52,544
a lot of problems arise.

2186
01:25:52,844 --> 01:25:56,253
Developing a celebrity complex...

2187
01:25:56,254 --> 01:25:57,384
Tell me more about that.

2188
01:25:57,714 --> 01:25:58,823
Celebrity complex?

2189
01:25:58,824 --> 01:26:01,083
Yes. I'll check myself.

2190
01:26:01,084 --> 01:26:03,024
(Seo Jin's celebrity complex checklist)

2191
01:26:03,124 --> 01:26:06,263
They look up their names every morning.

2192
01:26:06,264 --> 01:26:07,323
(She folds a finger immediately.)

2193
01:26:07,324 --> 01:26:08,933
- That's the number-one symptom.
- I folded it.

2194
01:26:08,934 --> 01:26:11,793
- Do you still do it?
- Now, I wish...

2195
01:26:11,794 --> 01:26:14,264
my name wouldn't be in the media.

2196
01:26:15,404 --> 01:26:18,573
Whenever my name pops up, I get anxious.

2197
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:19,874
That's the stage I'm in.

2198
01:26:20,374 --> 01:26:24,414
But at first, I got anxious if my name didn't come up.

2199
01:26:25,044 --> 01:26:26,283
Did you feel that way too?

2200
01:26:26,284 --> 01:26:27,313
When I had just become a celebrity.

2201
01:26:27,314 --> 01:26:28,344
That's surprising.

2202
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:31,413
Now, I get scared when my name comes up.

2203
01:26:31,414 --> 01:26:32,853
Like, "Did I cause trouble?"

2204
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:35,184
(He quietly folds a finger.)

2205
01:26:35,994 --> 01:26:37,154
Tell me more.

2206
01:26:37,524 --> 01:26:38,924
What else?

2207
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,294
Back in the day, we had this thought.

2208
01:26:42,634 --> 01:26:45,134
When your drama is successful, you move on to the movies.

2209
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:47,004
- To the movies?
- Movies.

2210
01:26:47,164 --> 01:26:49,103
You move on to movies if your drama does well.

2211
01:26:49,104 --> 01:26:50,434
Like, "I'm done with dramas."

2212
01:26:50,804 --> 01:26:52,573
- "I have to be in movies now." - To be a movie star.

2213
01:26:52,574 --> 01:26:54,744
We had that idea at the time.

2214
01:26:55,474 --> 01:26:56,973
I don't think I fit in that. I accept all types of work.

2215
01:26:56,974 --> 01:26:59,144
People with celebrity complex did that.

2216
01:27:00,044 --> 01:27:01,943
What else?

2217
01:27:01,944 --> 01:27:03,514
(He quietly folds another finger.)

2218
01:27:03,584 --> 01:27:06,023
(Was this a self-diagnosis for Kwang Kyu?)

2219
01:27:06,024 --> 01:27:08,523
Wait. There was one sitting right next to you.

2220
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:09,524
(Embarrassed)

2221
01:27:09,525 --> 01:27:10,854
You still have a celebrity complex?

2222
01:27:11,354 --> 01:27:12,823
- I meant back in the day.
- It's a bigger problem...

2223
01:27:12,824 --> 01:27:14,864
when you shouldn't have it in the first place.

2224
01:27:17,034 --> 01:27:18,063
Tell me more.

2225
01:27:18,064 --> 01:27:19,804
They only want private rooms at restaurants.

2226
01:27:20,264 --> 01:27:22,003
- Where?
- Private rooms.

2227
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:23,674
- Private rooms in restaurants.
- Not me.

2228
01:27:25,274 --> 01:27:26,874
(Shaking)

2229
01:27:29,774 --> 01:27:30,813
Oh, no.

2230
01:27:30,814 --> 01:27:32,544
(He folded it!)

2231
01:27:33,214 --> 01:27:35,383
Oh, jeez.

2232
01:27:35,384 --> 01:27:36,454
Are you for real?

2233
01:27:37,054 --> 01:27:38,213
But I'm not so sure about him.

2234
01:27:38,214 --> 01:27:40,054
Why does he have a celebrity complex?

2235
01:27:40,724 --> 01:27:42,453
He shouldn't have had it in the first place.

2236
01:27:42,454 --> 01:27:44,954
He probably folded it because he thought it was a trend.

2237
01:27:45,154 --> 01:27:47,164
- No, it's...
- He checked out all of them.

2238
01:27:51,494 --> 01:27:55,204
(Su Ji gets a phone call.)

2239
01:27:55,704 --> 01:27:57,273
I'm sorry, my son is calling.

2240
01:27:57,274 --> 01:27:59,974
- Oh, go ahead.
- What are you sorry about?

2241
01:28:00,404 --> 01:28:02,574
- Mom!
- Ji Su!

2242
01:28:03,274 --> 01:28:05,273
(Saying hi to the uncles)

2243
01:28:05,274 --> 01:28:06,513
Hi!

2244
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:08,244
You look just like your mother.

2245
01:28:08,854 --> 01:28:10,653
- Is he holding scissors?
- What?

2246
01:28:10,654 --> 01:28:11,954
That's dangerous.

2247
01:28:12,624 --> 01:28:14,184
Be careful with those scissors.

2248
01:28:14,324 --> 01:28:15,853
That worries me.

2249
01:28:15,854 --> 01:28:17,893
Say hi to them, Ji Su.

2250
01:28:17,894 --> 01:28:19,564
Do you want to show them your party trick?

2251
01:28:20,764 --> 01:28:23,094
Try your pilot impression.

2252
01:28:23,694 --> 01:28:24,733
Okay.

2253
01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:26,634
Good evening, passengers.

2254
01:28:27,404 --> 01:28:28,433
What's he saying?

2255
01:28:28,434 --> 01:28:30,274
Good evening, passengers.

2256
01:28:30,804 --> 01:28:32,544
- Oh, a pilot.
- Please fasten...

2257
01:28:33,344 --> 01:28:35,874
Try your flight attendant impression.

2258
01:28:37,244 --> 01:28:39,614
Which...

2259
01:28:39,784 --> 01:28:41,014
He's so good, right?

2260
01:28:41,684 --> 01:28:43,853
- What's he saying?
- "Which juice would you like?"

2261
01:28:43,854 --> 01:28:44,984
- I see.
- I see.

2262
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:47,554
Ji Su, don't do it.

2263
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:49,854
They're not even excited.

2264
01:28:50,924 --> 01:28:52,794
Say, "Hi, Uncle."

2265
01:28:53,294 --> 01:28:54,363
Hi!

2266
01:28:54,364 --> 01:28:55,834
They look different.

2267
01:28:56,234 --> 01:28:57,294
- What?
- He's so cute.

2268
01:28:57,934 --> 01:28:59,333
They look different.

2269
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,734
Do they look different?

2270
01:29:01,664 --> 01:29:03,433
- He's...
- We're totally different.

2271
01:29:03,434 --> 01:29:04,874
- Bye.
- "Totally different?"

2272
01:29:05,074 --> 01:29:07,674
- Okay. See you soon.
- He's honest.

2273
01:29:08,104 --> 01:29:09,244
So cute, right?

2274
01:29:10,414 --> 01:29:11,473
Daughters are cute.

2275
01:29:11,474 --> 01:29:12,544
It's a boy.

2276
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:14,644
It's a boy.

2277
01:29:16,954 --> 01:29:18,414
You're lying.

2278
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,383
- It's a boy.
- It's a boy?

2279
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,384
Yes.

2280
01:29:21,385 --> 01:29:23,094
(I'm serious.)

2281
01:29:23,624 --> 01:29:25,793
- I also thought it was a girl.
- Really?

2282
01:29:25,794 --> 01:29:27,163
Because of the hair.

2283
01:29:27,164 --> 01:29:29,834
- Oh, the hair. He got a perm.
- I see.

2284
01:29:30,934 --> 01:29:32,064
Are you planning on getting married?

2285
01:29:34,664 --> 01:29:36,034
I'm always planning on it.

2286
01:29:37,634 --> 01:29:38,904
How many kids do you want?

2287
01:29:39,174 --> 01:29:41,304
Me? For the country,

2288
01:29:41,604 --> 01:29:42,844
I wish I could have a bunch.

2289
01:29:43,874 --> 01:29:45,513
- And kids are cute.
- Right.

2290
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:47,344
What's the age gap between you and your husband?

2291
01:29:47,484 --> 01:29:48,983
- Three years?
- Is he older?

2292
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:50,513
No, he's three years younger.

2293
01:29:50,514 --> 01:29:52,383
- Oh, he's younger?
- Yes.

2294
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:54,324
But I rarely see him.

2295
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:57,223
- Well, if you're both busy...
- Right.

2296
01:29:57,224 --> 01:29:58,993
And you have to rarely see each other...

2297
01:29:58,994 --> 01:30:00,524
- Right.
- to stay on good terms.

2298
01:30:00,864 --> 01:30:02,963
- Things are still good between us.
- You fight more otherwise.

2299
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:04,364
(Peeking)

2300
01:30:04,494 --> 01:30:06,064
You're not even married. How would you know?

2301
01:30:06,304 --> 01:30:09,604
I've had lots of love scandals.

2302
01:30:10,604 --> 01:30:13,704
Wait. Have you dated 20 people or more so far?

2303
01:30:13,804 --> 01:30:15,003
- What?
- Only in college, you mean?

2304
01:30:15,004 --> 01:30:16,274
No, so far in your life.

2305
01:30:16,344 --> 01:30:17,574
No way.

2306
01:30:18,144 --> 01:30:19,383
So far in your life.

2307
01:30:19,384 --> 01:30:21,343
I probably dated over 20 girls in college only.

2308
01:30:21,344 --> 01:30:23,453
(I probably dated over 20 girls in college only.)

2309
01:30:23,454 --> 01:30:24,484
(Screaming)

2310
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:27,184
(A standing ovation)

2311
01:30:27,254 --> 01:30:28,923
That's so cool.

2312
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:32,194
In college? That's when...

2313
01:30:32,324 --> 01:30:33,494
you were in the US.

2314
01:30:34,194 --> 01:30:36,663
- I mean...
- Sophia, Lauren, and Madeleine.

2315
01:30:36,664 --> 01:30:37,664
No.

2316
01:30:41,034 --> 01:30:42,533
(The man of magical charms)

2317
01:30:42,534 --> 01:30:44,074
That was so cool.

2318
01:30:44,504 --> 01:30:47,143
(Jealous)

2319
01:30:47,144 --> 01:30:48,273
- Gosh.
- So cool.

2320
01:30:48,274 --> 01:30:50,174
They'll edit it out, anyway.

2321
01:30:51,214 --> 01:30:52,813
Give Kwang Kyu some pointers.

2322
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:55,414
How to make girlfriends. He wants to get married.

2323
01:30:55,714 --> 01:30:59,583
You only have to look in their eyes for three seconds.

2324
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,254
But you can't lose your focus.

2325
01:31:01,654 --> 01:31:05,353
He had such a blank look just now.

2326
01:31:05,354 --> 01:31:06,593
(He should find his focus first.)

2327
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:09,264
You can't just look at her like this.

2328
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:10,563
You need to look with clarity.

2329
01:31:10,564 --> 01:31:12,093
He has a hard time making eye contact.

2330
01:31:12,094 --> 01:31:15,003
- Really? I do too!
- I do.

2331
01:31:15,004 --> 01:31:16,773
Look in her eyes for three seconds,

2332
01:31:16,774 --> 01:31:20,504
and you smile with a wink at the end.

2333
01:31:20,774 --> 01:31:22,613
That will be your way to win her over.

2334
01:31:22,614 --> 01:31:25,114
(Frowning)

2335
01:31:26,084 --> 01:31:27,143
Is that the best you can do?

2336
01:31:27,144 --> 01:31:28,513
You try it.

2337
01:31:28,514 --> 01:31:30,053
- Looking in her eyes...
- Show us.

2338
01:31:30,054 --> 01:31:31,514
Well,

2339
01:31:31,684 --> 01:31:34,223
I only look into their eyes when I act in romance movies.

2340
01:31:34,224 --> 01:31:35,653
Can you say a line?

2341
01:31:35,654 --> 01:31:38,424
"Su Ji, don't go home tonight."

2342
01:31:38,654 --> 01:31:41,964
Let's do it. Ready. Roll cameras.

2343
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:43,394
Action!

2344
01:31:49,434 --> 01:31:51,634
(Watching from the front-row seat)

2345
01:31:52,204 --> 01:31:54,074
You know what? Just go home.

2346
01:31:55,504 --> 01:31:58,314
(He can't lie.)

2347
01:32:00,484 --> 01:32:02,354
You can't say, "Just go home."

2348
01:32:02,784 --> 01:32:04,154
Do what she wants.

2349
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:06,054
You have to do what the guest wants.

2350
01:32:06,224 --> 01:32:07,524
I don't think I can do this.

2351
01:32:08,684 --> 01:32:10,593
(A video message for My Grump Secretary)

2352
01:32:10,594 --> 01:32:12,363
Kwang Kyu and Seo Jin.

2353
01:32:12,364 --> 01:32:15,494
Thank you for your hard work under the heat.

2354
01:32:15,794 --> 01:32:18,463
Thank you, Kwang Kyu, for driving me around,

2355
01:32:18,464 --> 01:32:20,434
buying coffee for me,

2356
01:32:20,564 --> 01:32:23,274
and buying pain relief patches for me.

2357
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:26,073
I felt bad and thankful.

2358
01:32:26,074 --> 01:32:29,873
And I won't forget how Seo Jin wiped my sweat...

2359
01:32:29,874 --> 01:32:32,343
and dried my armpits.

2360
01:32:32,344 --> 01:32:35,684
I'll keep working hard on shows.

2361
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:37,083
First off...

2362
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:38,153
(What do you want to say to the next Star?)

2363
01:32:38,154 --> 01:32:41,724
Just think that you don't have a manager that day.

2364
01:32:43,994 --> 01:32:46,763
I hope you're on this show...

2365
01:32:46,764 --> 01:32:48,893
on a day when you're the least busy.

2366
01:32:48,894 --> 01:32:50,763
And the most important part.

2367
01:32:50,764 --> 01:32:54,533
I realised how helpful my manager actually is.

2368
01:32:54,534 --> 01:32:56,574
Thank you, Lee Min Han, my manager.

2369
01:32:58,474 --> 01:33:00,544
- Great shoot today.
- Thank you.

2370
01:33:00,974 --> 01:33:02,344
("Busan International Film Festival Emerges as a Global Hub of Cinema")

2371
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:05,274
(BIFF graced by a dazzling lineup of stars)

2372
01:33:05,374 --> 01:33:07,883
(Today's My Star is here!)

2373
01:33:07,884 --> 01:33:10,614
Busan International Movie...

2374
01:33:11,214 --> 01:33:13,554
- No, it's Film.
- Film.

2375
01:33:14,484 --> 01:33:17,124
(Which Star will the secretaries take care of?)

2376
01:33:17,294 --> 01:33:19,793
(The second My Star, Eom Ji Won)

2377
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:22,063
You should have been out here early to pull the car around.

2378
01:33:22,064 --> 01:33:23,694
You can't be the last one out.

2379
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,434
(Kwang Kyu feels that it's unfair.)

2380
01:33:25,494 --> 01:33:27,034
You should have gotten the elevator before me.

2381
01:33:28,204 --> 01:33:30,174
(Caretaker Fairy is still clumsy.)

2382
01:33:30,904 --> 01:33:32,234
You're not supposed to go in!

2383
01:33:33,544 --> 01:33:35,704
(And Seo Jin is unstoppable.)

2384
01:33:36,114 --> 01:33:38,374
But you're the manager. You can't ask me.

2385
01:33:38,444 --> 01:33:40,344
I asked, but the employees will never tell me.

2386
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:42,383
Are we late? Why isn't anyone here?

2387
01:33:42,384 --> 01:33:43,814
(Seo Jin tries to read the room.)

2388
01:33:44,784 --> 01:33:48,524
(Personalized, close-care support for My Star in Busan)

2389
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:53,464
(How will the secretaries' first business trip go?)

2390
01:33:54,324 --> 01:33:55,564
It's so humiliating.

2391
01:33:56,534 --> 01:33:58,294
We'll be doomed.

2392
01:34:00,534 --> 01:34:04,934
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2393
01:34:05,174 --> 01:34:11,174
(My Grumpy Secretary)
