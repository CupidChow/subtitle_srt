1
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:13,382
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:15,853
(My Grumpy Secretary)

3
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:18,745
(I will become the greatest manager of all time!)

4
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:20,814
(I mean to...)

5
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:22,575
(wait on a star.)

6
00:00:23,215 --> 00:00:24,215
(Let's see what it entails.)

7
00:00:25,485 --> 00:00:26,915
(I will make the star...)

8
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:29,855
(shine brightly.)

9
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:35,055
(The half-century-old managers waited on a star.)

10
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:37,294
(First day on the job, )

11
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:39,725
(they ran around just for their star.)

12
00:00:40,225 --> 00:00:41,495
(Getting up)

13
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:43,965
My sexy body

14
00:00:44,535 --> 00:00:45,865
(Your weapon is your body.)

15
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:48,005
(I don't want to do this.)

16
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:50,875
(They nearly got laid off on the first day.)

17
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,645
(Which star will Grumpy Secretary serve today?)

18
00:00:55,115 --> 00:00:58,185
(Busan)

19
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:03,185
(This year celebrates the 30th anniversary of BIFF.)

20
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:07,555
(An epic lineup packed with stars)

21
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:10,324
(And right there in all that glamour...)

22
00:01:10,325 --> 00:01:12,865
(is My Star.)

23
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,465
This is humiliating.

24
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,365
We will be ruined.

25
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:24,445
(7 days ago)

26
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:28,875
(My Star is waiting at a hair salon in Cheongdam-dong.)

27
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:32,244
(At 8:30am, Seo Jin shows up at work.)

28
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,854
You look like you're in great shape today.

29
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:35,915
I am not.

30
00:01:36,355 --> 00:01:38,284
(Starting the morning with a cheerful greeting)

31
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:40,085
Kwang Kyu is running late.

32
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:42,455
- Running late?
- Yes.

33
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:43,665
How late?

34
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,124
I don't know. So we came straight here.

35
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:47,195
(His older bestie is late due to a traffic jam.)

36
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:48,495
He's not in his right mind, is he?

37
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,964
(Thanks to Kwang Kyu being late, he trudges to meet the manager.)

38
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,605
- Hello.
- Hello.

39
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:56,504
I am Jeon Yu Chan, Um Ji Won's manager.

40
00:01:56,505 --> 00:01:59,745
Ji Won is preparing to attend the award ceremony at BIFF.

41
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:02,114
But my brother's getting married, so I can't be there.

42
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:04,315
He must've memorized the script.

43
00:02:05,115 --> 00:02:06,584
- Please take good care of her.
- I will.

44
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,014
(My Star's Handbook is delivered to him.)

45
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:09,214
He sounded like an AI.

46
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:10,654
(Stiff)

47
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,325
- And the corporate card?
- I will give it to you.

48
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:15,725
- And the corporate card?
- I will give it to you.

49
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:19,065
- We...
- Right.

50
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,164
- It's in the car.
- Go get it.

51
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:23,564
- He needs to go to the car.
- He was too busy memorizing.

52
00:02:23,565 --> 00:02:25,105
(He kindly follows him to get the card.)

53
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,435
- Here.
- That's a nice car.

54
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,575
Goodness.

55
00:02:31,245 --> 00:02:34,145
(Happy to drive a nice car, his dimples bloom.)

56
00:02:34,615 --> 00:02:36,145
So this was her car.

57
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:37,814
I saw the expensive bottled water...

58
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:39,645
and knew it couldn't be the crew's car.

59
00:02:40,915 --> 00:02:43,155
She usually drinks that bottled water,

60
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:46,084
and she likes to drink coconut water.

61
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,294
Coconut water. Right.

62
00:02:47,295 --> 00:02:48,555
She's like an American.

63
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,865
It's a luxurious car. Right?

64
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,094
- This car...
- I will get going then.

65
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:56,095
- Sure.
- Okay.

66
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:57,464
- Okay.
- Please take good care of her.

67
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,534
I will.

68
00:02:58,535 --> 00:02:59,735
(He never spoke so loudly and cheerfully.)

69
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:02,575
I wonder if Kwang Kyu will be able to drive such a nice car.

70
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:06,904
(He goes to meet My Star alone without his older bestie.)

71
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:09,275
This is a fancy salon, isn't it?

72
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:12,144
Hello.

73
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:14,785
(He feels timid to enter without Kwang Kyu.)

74
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,755
(Peeking)

75
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:22,855
(My Star is getting dolled up.)

76
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:25,695
(He sees her.)

77
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:29,165
(His dimples pop out.)

78
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:32,464
The makeup isn't done yet, so we shouldn't film her.

79
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:33,605
It's okay.

80
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:36,434
- Have you been well?
- Yes. Have you been well?

81
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:37,905
Do I need full glam?

82
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:39,605
- No, only lightly.
- Are you sure?

83
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,645
(From topping the global non-English OTT charts, )

84
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:46,944
(to hitting a record 21.9 percent, )

85
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:48,685
(the highest rating across all channels in 2025)

86
00:03:48,955 --> 00:03:52,585
(My Star is in her 2nd golden era.)

87
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,754
It's okay to film me without the makeup on.

88
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:57,024
(Laughing)

89
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:58,624
I don't change much anyway.

90
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,025
No, you change completely.

91
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:02,365
- She changes completely?
- After the makeup?

92
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:05,035
- Right?
- Have you seen me with makeup?

93
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:06,964
- You haven't seen me.
- I haven't?

94
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:08,605
Did you not wear any makeup then?

95
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:09,905
- I didn't wear any then.
- I see.

96
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,645
- Have a seat.
- What?

97
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:14,515
- Kwang Kyu is unbelievable.
- Where is Kwang Kyu?

98
00:04:15,145 --> 00:04:16,615
He's running late. He must be out of his mind.

99
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:18,285
Is he really?

100
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:24,125
Hello.

101
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:27,425
- Where's Ms. Um Ji Won?
- She's over there.

102
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:28,755
Here?

103
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,465
This way?

104
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:34,664
(Afraid of getting yelled at on the first day, )

105
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:39,435
(he runs as he nears her.)

106
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,534
(Running up to her)

107
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:43,674
Hello, there.

108
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:46,005
- My Star. Long time no see.
- Kwang Kyu.

109
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:48,944
(She's happy to see him.)

110
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:51,245
- My Star. Long time no see.
- Kwang Kyu.

111
00:04:51,445 --> 00:04:53,785
- Have you been well?
- Yes, I've been well.

112
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,214
It's been five years.

113
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,224
(They starred in the same drama series 5 years ago.)

114
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:59,324
- Ma Kwang Sook.
- Ma Kwang Sook?

115
00:04:59,325 --> 00:05:01,424
- I'm Kwang Sook, you know.
- You're Ma Kwang Sook.

116
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:02,694
I'm Kwang Sook.

117
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,295
I enjoyed the drama.

118
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,625
Did you watch "For Eagle Brothers?"

119
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:11,135
I watched the first episode and the last episode.

120
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:13,664
- You're lying.
- It's true.

121
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,175
She got pregnant in the last episode.

122
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:17,605
- I gave birth.
- You gave birth.

123
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:19,305
I stopped watching when she got pregnant.

124
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,715
- I didn't know you gave birth.
- I gave birth too.

125
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:24,615
(Thinking)

126
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:28,154
- Did you prepare things for her?
- Not much.

127
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:29,954
Do you know what you're supposed to...

128
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,084
Why did you bring a fan when it's fall?

129
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:33,525
- I'm cold.
- It's cold today.

130
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,925
- You're cold?
- She's cold.

131
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:38,325
- Yesterday...
- You should bring a hand warmer.

132
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:42,234
Are you going through menopause? Use it on yourself.

133
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,335
I don't need it.

134
00:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,934
We reunited after a long time, you know.

135
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:47,005
(The word proves that they are good friends.)

136
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:49,174
- But last time...
- I'm wearing long sleeves.

137
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,775
- Is that right?
- I am cold.

138
00:05:51,705 --> 00:05:53,405
(Staring)

139
00:05:54,015 --> 00:05:56,775
Kwang Kyu, did you just wake up?

140
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:58,444
- What?
- Did you just wake up?

141
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,145
- Yes.
- You still have pillow marks.

142
00:06:01,855 --> 00:06:02,915
Where?

143
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,824
- Gosh.
- I have it too.

144
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,084
- I get those when I wake up.
- Hey.

145
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:10,595
Did you wake up an hour or two ago?

146
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:12,725
- It's been two hours.
- And they are still there?

147
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:14,065
They almost look like scars.

148
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:17,135
Now that I'm older, they last for the whole morning.

149
00:06:17,505 --> 00:06:20,165
When I get those, they stay for a long time.

150
00:06:20,535 --> 00:06:23,335
And I use those good old hard pillows.

151
00:06:24,275 --> 00:06:25,774
- The rice-stuffed pillow?
- The rice-stuffed pillow.

152
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:27,575
Replace it with a goose down pillow.

153
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:28,974
(Laughing)

154
00:06:28,975 --> 00:06:30,915
This is...

155
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,344
Here. Read it.

156
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:33,744
- You should sit together.
- What?

157
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:35,255
(He finally reads My Star's Handbook.)

158
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:40,894
(My Star's Handbook, special notes)

159
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,024
(Attending the BIFF as an awards presenter, the glam prep week)

160
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:43,294
(Razor-sharp time management, mid-task updates, prompt feedback)

161
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:44,664
(She tends to drop her phone, so keep an eye on it.)

162
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:45,995
(Quite sensitive about meal choices)

163
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:49,565
Wait.

164
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:53,704
"She's attending the BIFF as an awards presenter."

165
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,075
"It's a glam prep week, so act with good sense."

166
00:06:56,235 --> 00:06:58,675
What's the glam prep week?

167
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:01,945
- BIFF opened yesterday, you know.
- Right.

168
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:05,415
Until next week's ceremony, it's the glam prep week.

169
00:07:06,415 --> 00:07:08,785
He's never needed any glamming up. So how would he know this?

170
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,685
(It upsets him, but he was late, so he will hold the anger.)

171
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:16,355
- The actors who glam up know this.
- Is that right?

172
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,165
Actresses try to stay in shape to get into a dress, I think.

173
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:22,435
My Star, is there anything...

174
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:24,805
I should know about the glam prep week?

175
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:27,905
During the glam prep week, I don't drink alcohol.

176
00:07:28,605 --> 00:07:29,875
You eat everything.

177
00:07:30,235 --> 00:07:33,645
I always eat little anyway.

178
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:34,845
You do?

179
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:38,244
I work out a lot, and I go alcohol-free.

180
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:39,344
(My Star's Glam Prep Week Know-how)

181
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,855
Because of the dress.

182
00:07:40,955 --> 00:07:42,484
- Because of the dress.
- Yes.

183
00:07:42,485 --> 00:07:44,625
- "Dress." - "Dress."

184
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:46,025
Dress.

185
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:49,925
(An actress's dress is the highlight of the ceremony.)

186
00:07:50,025 --> 00:07:51,764
(At 11am, dress fitting at a dress shop)

187
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:54,535
(Today, My Star has a dress fitting scheduled.)

188
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:59,864
(Which dress will My Star wear to the BIFF, which is in 1 week?)

189
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:01,775
She wants razor-sharp feedback,

190
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,445
razor-sharp mid-task updates,

191
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:05,905
and razor-sharp time management.

192
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:08,775
- There's something I really hate.
- What is it?

193
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,415
Not being punctual.

194
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,145
Not being punctual.

195
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:14,485
Managers running late.

196
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,215
But you came late today.

197
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,425
Day one, and he's already in trouble.

198
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:20,525
That's what I can't tolerate.

199
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:23,155
- The traffic jam was terrible.
- Enough with the excuses.

200
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:25,924
- Everyone has an excuse.
- The manager shouldn't give one.

201
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,634
I can't say to the crew...

202
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:29,164
that I'm late to the shoot because of bad traffic.

203
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:30,695
I'm lost for words.

204
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,265
That's not it.

205
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:37,135
(I should do something.)

206
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:40,605
Where are you going?

207
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:41,815
Where are you going?

208
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,815
My Star, did you have coffee?

209
00:08:45,445 --> 00:08:47,144
- I have coffee.
- You do?

210
00:08:47,145 --> 00:08:49,454
- Thank you.
- Too late to get her coffee.

211
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:50,515
- I want it.
- Right.

212
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:52,085
You want coffee?

213
00:08:52,655 --> 00:08:54,224
They will give you coffee.

214
00:08:54,225 --> 00:08:55,324
- Yes, coffee, please.
- Yes.

215
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:57,595
- Iced Americano. Want one?
- They will give you coffee.

216
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:59,225
Iced Americano.

217
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,265
Can you do without the hair tie?

218
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,035
- Hair tie?
- Yes.

219
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:05,405
Let me have one.

220
00:09:05,835 --> 00:09:07,935
- I will keep one.
- Do you want the loose one?

221
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:11,144
Give it to the manager. The hair tie.

222
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,704
- Give it to me.
- Kwang Kyu.

223
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:14,314
- Here you go.
- Yes.

224
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:15,715
- When she needs it...
- Don't lose it.

225
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,374
You have to return it to them.

226
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,314
- It belongs to the salon.
- Okay.

227
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:21,155
- You have to give it back to me.
- I will.

228
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:26,655
(It's going to be a tiring day for him.)

229
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:28,394
- He seems very tired.
- Yes.

230
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,395
(He seems very tired.)

231
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:33,165
Now that he's up, I can see that he sat on Ji Won's hat.

232
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:35,764
Did you sit on my hat?

233
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:37,805
- Goodness.
- Hey!

234
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:39,904
I didn't sit on it. It was just next to me.

235
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,834
- It was right here.
- Goodness.

236
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:43,175
He sat on it.

237
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:45,104
It was right here. I didn't sit on it.

238
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:47,105
Seo Jin is ridiculous.

239
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,015
- Bye.
- Bye.

240
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,085
You're carrying my bag too.

241
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:54,255
- Of course.
- You don't need to do that.

242
00:09:55,755 --> 00:09:57,385
Kwang Kyu, move the car, will you?

243
00:09:58,285 --> 00:09:59,525
Gosh.

244
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:02,724
- It's too nice, isn't it?
- It's too nice for me to drive.

245
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,564
Kwang Kyu, when I come out,

246
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:06,524
the car should be there waiting.

247
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:07,894
I should've gotten on it right away.

248
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:10,365
Why are you so mean to me? There's Seo Jin too.

249
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:12,734
- You're supposed to...
- You are the one driving.

250
00:10:12,735 --> 00:10:14,535
- I will do it.
- Move the car to...

251
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:16,435
(Falling back)

252
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:19,045
The car's tilted.

253
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,515
I'm worried.

254
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:24,284
He's unbelievable.

255
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,284
These days, he can't...

256
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,955
- drive like he used to.
- He can't drive?

257
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:30,014
He's so distracted.

258
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,155
- Is he?
- Yes.

259
00:10:33,185 --> 00:10:34,425
He can't start the car.

260
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:38,425
(Let's see.)

261
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:39,965
(Banging his head)

262
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:41,995
Kwang Kyu.

263
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:43,965
- Wait.
- Kwang Kyu.

264
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:45,135
Gosh.

265
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:46,934
- Kwang Kyu.
- Why can't I change the gear?

266
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:48,204
- Did you step on the brake?
- Why wouldn't it move?

267
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:50,234
Put it on D, step on the brake,

268
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,505
- and move the car.
- Lower it.

269
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:52,844
You have to press that.

270
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,514
- Which one?
- The one above that.

271
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:56,044
- I think it's on hold.
- What's below P?

272
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,514
- P and N.
- Did you step on the brake?

273
00:10:58,515 --> 00:10:59,844
- I did.
- You did?

274
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:01,885
- Did you not start the engine?
- I did.

275
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:04,425
You did? Then why can't you drive?

276
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:06,124
(Touching)

277
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,185
What's this?

278
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:08,655
- Should I give it a try?
- Is it not there?

279
00:11:08,825 --> 00:11:09,995
No.

280
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,465
There you go.

281
00:11:14,595 --> 00:11:16,234
- There you go.
- I got it.

282
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,764
- Did you get it? What was it?
- You're supposed to pull.

283
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:18,865
Be careful.

284
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:20,104
Move there and then turn.

285
00:11:20,105 --> 00:11:21,105
(Finally, he starts driving.)

286
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:25,175
(Stopping)

287
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,745
Let's get in the car. Let's go straight.

288
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,584
- Is it automatic?
- Yes.

289
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,585
(He gives My Star her bag.)

290
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:34,314
I don't know. He somehow opened it.

291
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,155
- Where will you sit?
- I will sit in the front.

292
00:11:36,485 --> 00:11:37,485
What?

293
00:11:37,486 --> 00:11:39,024
(After taking care of My Star sweetly, he gets in the car too.)

294
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,125
- By the way...
- Move forward.

295
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,154
(Kyu's GPS navigation)

296
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,294
In 300m, turn left.

297
00:11:46,295 --> 00:11:48,535
(Clumsy)

298
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:50,035
Let's go.

299
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:55,004
You could use the GPS navigation system in the car.

300
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,004
Do you have to use your phone?

301
00:11:57,005 --> 00:11:59,245
- First, we...
- The in-car GPS navigation is...

302
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:01,215
He's bad at reading the in-car GPS navigation.

303
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,644
Okay. Let's use his phone then.

304
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:03,875
I'm just worried it might fall.

305
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:05,945
- I'm worried. It won't fall?
- It won't fall.

306
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,615
You don't need to worry so much.

307
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:11,055
- You...
- He will be fine.

308
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:13,954
This car is...

309
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:17,595
- Do you need something to hold it?
- No, it's okay.

310
00:12:18,365 --> 00:12:19,395
You're okay?

311
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:21,335
Why is it directing me this way?

312
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:22,765
Go straight.

313
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:24,964
- Go straight...
- Go out to the big street.

314
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:26,565
and turn left in 120m.

315
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:30,105
- You don't need to be anxious.
- I got it.

316
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:31,674
I'm looking at it.

317
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:35,675
Everyone gets anxious whenever they get in our car.

318
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,144
(Laughing)

319
00:12:38,145 --> 00:12:39,315
(Embarrassed)

320
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,284
Look at the traffic light.

321
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:43,514
- He saw it.
- Did he see it?

322
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:45,725
I saw it.

323
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:49,024
- I saw it, Ji Won.
- Don't just go wherever you like.

324
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:50,254
(Thanks to My Star, they are on the right way to the shop.)

325
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:52,225
Everyone gets anxious whenever they get in our car.

326
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,735
You shouldn't go wherever you like.

327
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:58,165
You have to turn left here.

328
00:12:58,465 --> 00:12:59,705
The destination is nearby.

329
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:02,775
But it's a very sharp turn. Can you manage it?

330
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:06,474
Isn't it tricky? It is, isn't it?

331
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,144
- It is tricky.
- The telephone pole makes it hard.

332
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:09,815
- He can manage it.
- Can he really?

333
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:11,414
But there's a car coming this way.

334
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:12,614
(To make matters worse, there's a car approaching.)

335
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:13,744
The car's coming this way.

336
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:15,155
(To make matters worse, there's a car approaching.)

337
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:17,855
You have to reverse because there's a car coming.

338
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:19,084
I've never reserved it.

339
00:13:19,085 --> 00:13:20,155
- Reversing it?
- Reverse.

340
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:21,625
You got it.

341
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:22,825
Be careful.

342
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:25,094
It's reversing.

343
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,765
(She looks very anxious.)

344
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:31,505
There you go.

345
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,935
- I need to make a big turn.
- Yes, make a big turn.

346
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:38,945
(Focused)

347
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:41,614
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's okay.

348
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:43,115
(Second attempt to enter the narrow street)

349
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:46,585
- Oh, my gosh.
- It's okay.

350
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:50,355
(Extremely anxious)

351
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:52,855
Ji Won, are you a novice driver?

352
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,854
Gosh, that was so close!

353
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,595
I think I can drive as well as Kwang Kyu.

354
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:01,994
- You drive well, then.
- Wait.

355
00:14:01,995 --> 00:14:05,464
- I can drive as well as he does.
- It's because it's not my car.

356
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:07,235
- Is that it?
- It's here.

357
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:08,435
It's here, isn't it?

358
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,405
- It's here.
- It must be here.

359
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,144
I think there must be a valet attendant.

360
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:13,405
- It says "valet" there.
- Yes.

361
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:15,374
- Let's get out of the car.
- Okay.

362
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,344
The door opens differently.

363
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:20,115
- Really?
- You just pull it once.

364
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:22,415
- Did you not get the door?
- Did it open?

365
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:25,224
You can't get off?

366
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:26,454
- I can get off.
- Can you?

367
00:14:26,455 --> 00:14:27,525
- I can.
- I don't think he can get off.

368
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:29,155
I am 100 percent certain that he can't get off.

369
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:30,824
How did you get off?

370
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:31,994
(Seo Jin was right.)

371
00:14:31,995 --> 00:14:34,434
- There's something I hate.
- What is it?

372
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:40,605
(Things aren't going well for me today.)

373
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,634
- My goodness.
- Did it open?

374
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:45,375
My gosh, this car.

375
00:14:45,805 --> 00:14:47,274
Do you want to take the bottled water?

376
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:49,774
I can take the bottled water.

377
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,075
Let's put that here.

378
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:54,315
- And not the juice.
- Not the juice.

379
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,984
Maybe we have to press something.

380
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,155
(The door is tightly shut.)

381
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:02,725
Is it booked?

382
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:04,195
Why is nobody around?

383
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:06,165
Kwang Kyu, give them a call.

384
00:15:06,765 --> 00:15:08,395
- Is it booked for today?
- Do you have the number?

385
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:11,304
This is the BIFF team.

386
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:12,965
I mean, search for the number of this shop.

387
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:15,105
- Why is nobody answering the door?
- Search it on the web.

388
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:17,875
Are we not supposed to visit today?

389
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:19,775
Did you find the number?

390
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,015
- Right.
- New York.

391
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,575
- The number.
- Call this number.

392
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:26,645
Right.

393
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:30,554
Ji Won is impatient.

394
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,855
(My Star is very impatient.)

395
00:15:31,955 --> 00:15:33,625
- Hello?
- Hello.

396
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,154
- Hello?
- Yes?

397
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:38,164
We are in front of the shop, and we can't get in.

398
00:15:38,165 --> 00:15:39,595
- We...
- Right.

399
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:41,395
- There's a bell here.
- It's open.

400
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,794
There you go.

401
00:15:42,795 --> 00:15:44,034
It's open.

402
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:45,704
We pressed the bell, and they didn't open the door.

403
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:46,835
Hello.

404
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:49,105
Hello.

405
00:15:49,805 --> 00:15:51,645
They've got these too.

406
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:53,574
Goodness, look at these dresses.

407
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:55,175
I guess they usually do weddings.

408
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:56,575
Yes.

409
00:15:57,575 --> 00:15:58,815
- They do.
- Weddings?

410
00:15:59,885 --> 00:16:00,985
Hello.

411
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:04,415
How do you wear this?

412
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:06,924
(The ornately embellished dresses are new even to My Star.)

413
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,355
It's too much to wear.

414
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:11,264
When you drop one gemstone...

415
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:13,325
- Right. What if you do?
- Right?

416
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:15,995
What happens if you drop one gemstone?

417
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:17,135
I know.

418
00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:19,365
How did they put these on?

419
00:16:20,135 --> 00:16:22,375
They must've stitched them by hand one by one.

420
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:24,505
- Hello.
- Hello. Please come on down.

421
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:26,305
- Hello.
- Shall we go down?

422
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:27,504
(Dress fitting schedule: On)

423
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:28,915
Are they here too?

424
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:32,685
There are a lot of dresses on the hanger.

425
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:34,584
- What was that?
- There are a lot of dresses.

426
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:36,554
(There is a lavish line-up of dresses on display.)

427
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:37,614
They are beautiful.

428
00:16:37,615 --> 00:16:38,684
(There is a lavish line-up of dresses on display.)

429
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:40,425
I guess people wear these dresses now.

430
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:48,565
(Standing awkwardly)

431
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,174
(Following her quietly)

432
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:57,605
It's my first visit to a dress shop.

433
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,104
- Is it really?
- Yes.

434
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,245
It's my first time too.

435
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,275
Goodness, look at those dresses.

436
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,974
(It's a new world.)

437
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:05,084
Goodness.

438
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:07,954
Among these, choose one you think I should...

439
00:17:07,955 --> 00:17:10,755
wear to the closing ceremony of the BIFF.

440
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,925
- Choose one.
- Right.

441
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,855
- Then I will try some of them.
- I see.

442
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:19,164
I am not receiving an award. I am presenting an award.

443
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:21,795
- You are the presenter.
- Yes.

444
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:24,865
So it shouldn't be over-the-top.

445
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:26,405
It should be simple and stylish.

446
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:28,575
It should be simple and stylish.

447
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:35,275
It's heavy. Goodness.

448
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:38,445
I had no idea that a dress was so heavy.

449
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:40,345
- Right. It's heavy.
- It's super heavy.

450
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:41,815
It's so long that it drags on my feet.

451
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:43,284
This is really heavy.

452
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:44,824
But the other ones are heavy too.

453
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:46,625
(Culture-shocked)

454
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:48,825
How can you wear a dress that's this heavy?

455
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:49,994
Seriously.

456
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,425
- I think it weighs at least 5kg.
- It must weigh 5kg.

457
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,165
It's like an armour, isn't it?

458
00:17:56,935 --> 00:17:58,334
You could exercise with it.

459
00:17:58,335 --> 00:17:59,335
(Moving up and down)

460
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,105
- It's really heavy.
- It's really heavy.

461
00:18:03,305 --> 00:18:05,644
(Shaking)

462
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:07,075
- Can you see my hand shaking?
- I can.

463
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:12,115
(Holding up the dress is hard enough for Kwang Kyu.)

464
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:14,785
It was heavier than a 5kg dumbbell.

465
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:18,525
- What?
- You exercise with a 5kg dumbbell?

466
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:20,225
You think I can't?

467
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:24,125
Well, I would say...

468
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:26,494
Well, I would say...

469
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:29,965
(Kwang Kyu suddenly approaches the dress as if he's possessed.)

470
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,265
I think this is a no.

471
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:37,105
(He must've picked one that's light.)

472
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:40,345
(Laughing)

473
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:43,475
(Returning it quietly)

474
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:47,085
If we were to go for something with colour...

475
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:49,984
(Smiling)

476
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:53,125
You like something with glitter, don't you?

477
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:54,384
(He goes for glitter.)

478
00:18:54,385 --> 00:18:55,555
You like something glittery.

479
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:58,725
- Dazzling city - Right? Dazzling city

480
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:00,994
You know that my agency has to pay for it...

481
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:03,364
if I lose the gemstone, right?

482
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:04,905
(You know you have to pay for the gemstone, right?)

483
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:08,235
Shall we go with the one without?

484
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,034
No.

485
00:19:10,035 --> 00:19:12,074
- Let's go with the one without.
- I won't lose any.

486
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,575
(Even when she teases him, it's like she's method-acting.)

487
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:18,945
Simple.

488
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:21,214
Everything I like is heavy.

489
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,185
- This is on the light side.
- I can't wear that. It's too heavy.

490
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:24,585
I know. It's too heavy.

491
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,925
- Something simple like this.
- Okay.

492
00:19:27,485 --> 00:19:28,925
- I like that.
- Simple.

493
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,525
- That one?
- Yes.

494
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,264
Like a black swan.

495
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,464
- A black swan.
- A black swan.

496
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:34,625
That's really long, though.

497
00:19:36,795 --> 00:19:37,935
I like something like this one.

498
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:42,475
Is this too much?

499
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:43,975
That's a little...

500
00:19:44,075 --> 00:19:45,245
Something short.

501
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,775
I think you should try on something short.

502
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:49,345
A short one is fine, but...

503
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,415
If you want, I will try it on.

504
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,645
A short one and...

505
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:56,154
The heavy one?

506
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,155
(Bright, sparkling eyes)

507
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:58,925
I like this one too.

508
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,525
This is too long.

509
00:20:01,725 --> 00:20:03,355
Doesn't it look too much like a nightgown?

510
00:20:04,255 --> 00:20:05,694
(How about a bling-bling pearl dress then?)

511
00:20:05,695 --> 00:20:06,995
This is long too.

512
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,865
A pearl dress is a little...

513
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:10,894
That's velvet, isn't it?

514
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,134
(He touches the velvet dress too.)

515
00:20:12,135 --> 00:20:13,804
(He might just pick every dress that's hanging.)

516
00:20:13,805 --> 00:20:15,074
How many are you choosing?

517
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:16,605
(He might just pick every dress that's hanging.)

518
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:18,705
We will keep that as an option.

519
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:20,374
- As an option.
- This one?

520
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,774
- This one.
- There are so many pretty ones.

521
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:24,345
(Seeing how indecisive they are, she gets up.)

522
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:27,715
Why don't you pick one, Ji Won? What's your favourite?

523
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:29,155
This one.

524
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:31,085
I like this one.

525
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:34,484
Her taste is completely different from men's.

526
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:35,924
I like that one too, but...

527
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:37,125
I think this one would be nice too.

528
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:38,694
I will go check it out in front of the mirror.

529
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,695
(Carrying two dresses at once)

530
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:41,535
I think the right one would look better.

531
00:20:43,565 --> 00:20:44,594
I got it.

532
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:45,665
(Caretaker Fairy quickly runs to assist her.)

533
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:47,704
(Thanks to Kwang Kyu, she compares the two dresses at once.)

534
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,774
Don't you think this would look nice on me?

535
00:20:49,775 --> 00:20:51,404
- This one is better, though.
- This one?

536
00:20:51,405 --> 00:20:54,375
Don't I look like I'm the one receiving the award?

537
00:20:54,645 --> 00:20:57,775
I am presenting an award, but I look like an award winner.

538
00:20:58,145 --> 00:21:00,615
- But this is prettier.
- I will try it on.

539
00:21:00,685 --> 00:21:02,485
I can put them on quickly.

540
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,515
- Can you try them on in no time?
- Of course.

541
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:07,154
- It won't take long to try them on.
- Okay. Let's try them on.

542
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:09,495
I'll try on the dresses you guys picked first.

543
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:14,764
(They rest as soon as Ji Won goes inside.)

544
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:17,665
Unlike me, who has never had that experience,

545
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:21,675
you must've visited dress shops often in dramas.

546
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:24,605
- Have I done that?
- You've had many onscreen romances.

547
00:21:25,145 --> 00:21:26,705
I've never had onscreen romances.

548
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:31,745
You don't need to tell me that because it's obvious, okay?

549
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:33,545
Don't you remember?

550
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:36,185
I had a wedding scene in "Marriage Contract."

551
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:38,224
- You're right.
- Right?

552
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:39,255
Yes.

553
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,524
- You and Hee Seon...
- That was "Wonderful Days."

554
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:42,654
- "Wonderful Days." - I had a wedding scene there.

555
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:43,925
- You had a wedding scene there.
- Yes.

556
00:21:44,655 --> 00:21:45,865
I got married many times.

557
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:47,095
- You?
- Yes.

558
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,694
- You should've lived well.
- What?

559
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:51,965
- You should've lived well.
- I got married many times.

560
00:21:52,435 --> 00:21:54,164
Didn't you have a dress-shopping scene?

561
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,135
Most dramas have that scene.

562
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,704
Now, we need to wear a hanbok if we get married in dramas.

563
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:00,874
Isn't that right?

564
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,044
(They suit hanbok better than tuxedos at their age.)

565
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:04,214
Hey, don't people wear hanbok when they get married...

566
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:05,445
in their sixties?

567
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:09,055
I'll have a traditional wedding like my parents.

568
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,615
Don't invite me.

569
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:12,855
You're the host.

570
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,755
Everyone needs to wear hanbok if it's a traditional wedding.

571
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:19,565
- Of course.
- Don't invite me.

572
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:22,935
I wonder if that day will ever come.

573
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:27,465
Shall we go to Mudeungsan for lunch?

574
00:22:29,235 --> 00:22:31,175
Kwang Kyu, it was at Mudeungsan where you ran into...

575
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:32,805
people from a matchmaking company.

576
00:22:33,445 --> 00:22:35,015
People from a matchmaking company.

577
00:22:36,245 --> 00:22:39,045
Hey!

578
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,585
Hey, you punk!

579
00:22:40,845 --> 00:22:42,155
It's true.

580
00:22:42,485 --> 00:22:45,084
Why did you bring up that painful memory?

581
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:47,225
That memory came back to me when you talked about Mudeungsan.

582
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:48,925
We met them at that restaurant.

583
00:22:49,495 --> 00:22:51,825
- What?
- They were having a get-together...

584
00:22:52,525 --> 00:22:53,595
at a neighbouring table.

585
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:55,765
That was when Kwang Kyu got the grade of D.

586
00:22:56,995 --> 00:22:59,735
I told him not to ask them, but he had to do it...

587
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:01,604
and get a D.

588
00:23:01,605 --> 00:23:02,735
Stop it already.

589
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:07,575
Mudeungsan brings up the memory of that matchmaking company.

590
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:10,344
May I step out?

591
00:23:10,345 --> 00:23:13,314
(Meanwhile, Ji Won has finished putting on the first dress.)

592
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:14,415
I'm stepping out.

593
00:23:16,415 --> 00:23:21,155
(Seok Jin's pick, black velvet dress)

594
00:23:22,155 --> 00:23:23,225
- She's here.
- I'm stepping out.

595
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,424
Gosh, it fits you really well.

596
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:28,695
(I picked well.)

597
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:32,535
Gosh, it fits you really well.

598
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:35,234
(My star's atmosphere has changed.)

599
00:23:35,235 --> 00:23:36,734
You must've made an effort to stay fit.

600
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:37,975
It looks nice.

601
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,975
- Have you lost weight?
- What?

602
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,415
- Have you lost weight?
- Yes.

603
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,884
- Right?
- "For Eagle Brothers" was so tough.

604
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,484
I lost weight while filming "For Eagle Brothers."

605
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:48,954
- "For Eagle Brothers?" - You're so skinny.

606
00:23:48,955 --> 00:23:51,484
- I guess you couldn't sleep well.
- It was so tough.

607
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:53,024
How's this dress? It's number one.

608
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:54,085
- Number one.
- Yes.

609
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:55,724
- Wait.
- Number one.

610
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,864
- I'll take a photo.
- Okay.

611
00:23:58,865 --> 00:23:59,964
- Take a photo.
- Okay.

612
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:01,024
Take a full-body shot.

613
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,334
- Of course.
- That way, I'll know.

614
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:05,404
- The lighting isn't very pretty.
- Still...

615
00:24:05,405 --> 00:24:07,164
- We just need to see the dress.
- It's for checking.

616
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:08,235
(He takes a photo in a trendy pose.)

617
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,774
Do I look okay? Are you taking a good photo?

618
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:13,105
(Do I look okay?)

619
00:24:13,505 --> 00:24:14,745
I don't think I've done so well.

620
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,044
- It's okay.
- It isn't too bad, right?

621
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,815
That's right. But it's a bit...

622
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:20,884
Is it the angle? Should you be at the center?

623
00:24:20,885 --> 00:24:23,255
- I tried to avoid the mirror.
- Let's have Seo Jin take a photo.

624
00:24:23,485 --> 00:24:25,685
You should take a photo.

625
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,125
I'm not very good at taking photos.

626
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:30,254
(Sticking out his butt)

627
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:31,455
Focus on the torso.

628
00:24:32,395 --> 00:24:34,525
- Should it be a portrait shot?
- No, I want a full-body shot.

629
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:36,864
Why are you putting so much care into it?

630
00:24:36,865 --> 00:24:37,865
Let me take a look.

631
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:39,705
- I'm not very good at it.
- Let's see who takes better photos.

632
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:42,735
The two of you are neck-and-neck.

633
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:44,774
The two of you are neck-and-neck.

634
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,545
(Neck-and-neck)

635
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:48,645
But these photos are for checking the fit anyway.

636
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:50,575
- That's right.
- This is number one.

637
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:52,715
Should I wear my hair up or down?

638
00:24:53,315 --> 00:24:54,385
You need to wear it up.

639
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:55,615
- Should I wear it up?
- Yes.

640
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:57,415
Where's a hair tie?

641
00:24:58,215 --> 00:24:59,855
I have a hair tie right here.

642
00:25:01,225 --> 00:25:02,355
Yes. You need to wear it up.

643
00:25:02,455 --> 00:25:03,995
I look natural with my hair down.

644
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:06,264
This dress is very tight,

645
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:08,664
- I can't get my arms up.
- I bet you can barely breathe.

646
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:11,265
Kwang Kyu, do you know how to tie hair?

647
00:25:11,465 --> 00:25:13,105
How would I know? My hair...

648
00:25:13,335 --> 00:25:15,175
- Oh, my.
- That's too...

649
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:17,174
Don't ask a bald man...

650
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,275
- if he knows how to tie hair.
- Seriously.

651
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:21,004
Don't do that to your manager.

652
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:23,474
Ji Won, just because your hair is healthy...

653
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:24,714
You have a lot of hair.

654
00:25:24,715 --> 00:25:26,984
Don't ask a bald man if he knows how to tie hair.

655
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,285
- I've never tied my hair.
- I'm sorry.

656
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:32,354
- It's okay.
- I can't get my arms up.

657
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:33,384
Seriously.

658
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:35,624
- Seo Jin, do you know how to do it?
- I don't know either.

659
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:36,725
You don't know?

660
00:25:36,895 --> 00:25:38,025
Shall I hold it like this?

661
00:25:38,095 --> 00:25:39,764
- Try it.
- Can't you do it like that?

662
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:40,995
I can't get my arms up. I'm serious.

663
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:42,564
The fabric doesn't stretch.

664
00:25:42,565 --> 00:25:43,634
(My Star has requested to have her hair tied.)

665
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:44,865
Just put it through the band.

666
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:48,435
Just tie it haphazardly.

667
00:25:50,635 --> 00:25:52,545
Put my hair through the band and twist it.

668
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:54,375
Do it 2 or 3 times.

669
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,614
(The unknown world)

670
00:25:57,615 --> 00:25:59,845
- I twisted it twice.
- Good.

671
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:02,055
Do I look better with my hair up or down?

672
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:04,785
- Do I look okay?
- Yes.

673
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,085
- She looks better with her hair up.
- Yes.

674
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:09,355
- Really?
- You look better with your hair up.

675
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:10,595
- Is that better?
- Yes.

676
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:12,725
Here.

677
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:15,265
- Are you capturing her face only?
- What?

678
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,365
- You aren't capturing the dress.
- I did that earlier.

679
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:19,134
- I bet you'll keep the photo.
- No.

680
00:26:19,135 --> 00:26:21,335
- I'll send it to her.
- Thank you. It's a pretty photo.

681
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:24,075
- Good. I'll try on the next one.
- Okay.

682
00:26:24,175 --> 00:26:25,245
Wait.

683
00:26:26,445 --> 00:26:28,075
You're good at tying hair.

684
00:26:28,405 --> 00:26:29,775
You must've done it before.

685
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:34,285
I had long hair when I was young.

686
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:36,885
Was it long like hers?

687
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:39,185
I grew out my hair for "Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

688
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:40,785
It's customary when you're in a period drama.

689
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:43,995
(He was in a period drama recently.)

690
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:45,664
- This is what Seo Jin picked.
- Yes.

691
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:46,965
- That's right.
- A mini version.

692
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:48,994
- You look pretty when you tie it.
- Is that better?

693
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:49,995
(Glancing over)

694
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:54,965
She brought a jewellery box.

695
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:56,775
- What?
- She brought a jewellery box.

696
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:59,305
- Did Ji Won bring it?
- Yes, it's her jewellery box.

697
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:01,045
- Is it hers?
- Yes.

698
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,314
Is this a real diamond?

699
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:05,884
What? Is that a diamond?

700
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,145
(Is that a real diamond?)

701
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:10,955
How many carats is that?

702
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,625
- This? It's practically a tiara.
- Yes.

703
00:27:14,055 --> 00:27:15,554
I've never seen anything like it.

704
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:17,094
Same here.

705
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,665
- It's a bit...
- I wondered what it was.

706
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:23,965
I thought it contained things like nail clippers.

707
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:27,935
It's like a knife bag that chefs carry.

708
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,775
A bag that contains things like nail clippers.

709
00:27:31,605 --> 00:27:33,045
(Picking up)

710
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:38,045
- Are your ears pierced?
- As you can see, they are.

711
00:27:39,015 --> 00:27:40,114
Really?

712
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:42,054
(The earring suits him well.)

713
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:43,155
Are your ears pierced?

714
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:45,115
I got them pierced when I was young.

715
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:46,925
- Back in university?
- Yes.

716
00:27:47,885 --> 00:27:49,255
The holes didn't close up.

717
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:52,395
It was unthinkable in my generation.

718
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:56,735
(He tries on a different earring.)

719
00:27:59,235 --> 00:28:02,475
(Grinning)

720
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:07,305
(Sticking out his buttocks)

721
00:28:09,215 --> 00:28:10,944
Hey, move your hand.

722
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:12,445
(More passionate than the time he photographed My Star)

723
00:28:13,015 --> 00:28:15,655
Most people's holes close up, but yours haven't done that.

724
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,385
Starting in my university days, I wore earrings for many years.

725
00:28:18,785 --> 00:28:19,955
You got scolded by your father, right?

726
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:21,755
I almost got kicked out of the house.

727
00:28:23,925 --> 00:28:25,155
My goodness.

728
00:28:25,395 --> 00:28:26,724
When I came back to Korea with my ears pierced,

729
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:29,665
he didn't talk to me for two weeks.

730
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:32,705
He didn't even look at me.

731
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:35,304
He didn't say, "Take out your earrings."

732
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:36,474
He didn't even look at me.

733
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,674
(Their relationship stayed frigid for 2 weeks.)

734
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,775
He didn't even talk to me.

735
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:41,444
"I sent him to the US to study, but he got his ears pierced."

736
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:42,574
I bet he had that thought.

737
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:44,275
(He was quite radical.)

738
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:46,314
I can't believe you're wearing such an outfit.

739
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:47,744
(Laughing)

740
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:49,855
- How did he choose this dress?
- Seriously.

741
00:28:50,185 --> 00:28:53,054
- He has had many girlfriends, - Really?

742
00:28:53,055 --> 00:28:55,124
- so he has a sense of style.
- He knows how to pick clothes.

743
00:28:55,125 --> 00:28:56,454
Seo Jin is like that.

744
00:28:56,455 --> 00:28:57,455
(He was quite radical.)

745
00:28:57,855 --> 00:28:58,925
All done.

746
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,165
I'm stepping out.

747
00:29:01,595 --> 00:29:03,235
(They react immediately.)

748
00:29:03,565 --> 00:29:05,935
- What do you think?
- It's cute.

749
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:12,205
- Number two.
- It's cute.

750
00:29:12,305 --> 00:29:13,945
- Cute?
- It's cute.

751
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,115
See? You look nice in a short dress too...

752
00:29:18,845 --> 00:29:19,945
because you're skinny.

753
00:29:22,515 --> 00:29:23,754
- All right.
- Okay.

754
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:25,215
All right.

755
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:27,985
- I'll photograph the back.
- The back.

756
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,854
- You got better at taking photos.
- I got better, right?

757
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:32,825
What do you think of this dress?

758
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:34,695
Don't you like it?

759
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:36,164
While it's pretty,

760
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:38,535
- I'm going to a film festival.
- Is it unfitting?

761
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,164
- It's a bit unfitting.
- That's right.

762
00:29:41,165 --> 00:29:43,575
It'd be nice for an award ceremony.

763
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:45,474
It'd be nice for an entertainment awards...

764
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:47,105
- or a drama awards.
- That's right.

765
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,814
- But I don't need this yet.
- That's right.

766
00:29:49,815 --> 00:29:51,375
I picked two dresses.

767
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:54,815
She looks good because she's tall.

768
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,415
You need to be tall to look good in a dress.

769
00:29:58,415 --> 00:30:00,225
(Glancing over)

770
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:01,684
Four dresses remain.

771
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:02,995
- What?
- Four dresses remain.

772
00:30:04,995 --> 00:30:06,465
I'm tired.

773
00:30:08,695 --> 00:30:12,365
(Yawning)

774
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:17,305
(He feels like time is passing very slowly.)

775
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,645
It's taking ten minutes per dress.

776
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:23,615
She said she'd try them on quickly, but it's taking a long time.

777
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,915
No man would enjoy being at a dress shop.

778
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:29,215
Some men might enjoy it.

779
00:30:29,585 --> 00:30:30,655
Did you enjoy it?

780
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:32,355
Did you enjoy it?

781
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:34,025
Did you enjoy it when you were there?

782
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:35,425
- When I got married?
- Yes.

783
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:37,025
- I enjoyed it.
- Really?

784
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:39,165
You must've loved her a lot.

785
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:41,324
Is there hand cream?

786
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:43,065
Do you have it?

787
00:30:43,165 --> 00:30:44,665
- Shall I ask?
- Let's do that.

788
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:49,635
She's looking for hand cream.

789
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:51,275
- Right now?
- Yes.

790
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:53,404
I'll do this.

791
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:55,775
(My Star has requested hand cream.)

792
00:30:56,345 --> 00:30:57,414
Okay.

793
00:30:57,415 --> 00:31:00,745
(The secretary goes to her with hand cream.)

794
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:05,014
- Please wait.
- Please wait.

795
00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:06,085
Okay.

796
00:31:06,485 --> 00:31:08,925
I wondered if you wanted hand cream.

797
00:31:09,055 --> 00:31:11,895
That's right. You can give it to me later.

798
00:31:12,165 --> 00:31:14,424
- I'll give it to you later.
- Okay.

799
00:31:14,425 --> 00:31:15,435
(Caretaker Fairy is quick on his feet.)

800
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:18,765
Let's see if I can slide it under the door.

801
00:31:18,905 --> 00:31:21,335
- No, wait until I'm outside.
- No? Okay.

802
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,405
No? Okay.

803
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:26,874
(What's up with him?)

804
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:27,945
That isn't toilet paper, okay?

805
00:31:29,445 --> 00:31:30,575
I mean... Hey.

806
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:33,585
I thought she needed it urgently.

807
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:36,454
- It's okay.
- You don't need it.

808
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:38,055
(Kwang Kyu learned something new today.)

809
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:40,455
It's the dress Kwang Kyu picked.

810
00:31:41,585 --> 00:31:42,724
It's the dress Kwang Kyu picked.

811
00:31:42,725 --> 00:31:44,425
Of course, it's pretty.

812
00:31:44,525 --> 00:31:46,194
You look beautiful.

813
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,294
The dress Kwang Kyu picked.

814
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:48,564
(Kwang Kyu's pick, a black halterneck dress)

815
00:31:48,565 --> 00:31:50,834
- It's more comfortable...
- Yes.

816
00:31:50,835 --> 00:31:51,935
compared to the previous ones.

817
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,034
- I can move very easily.
- Okay.

818
00:31:54,035 --> 00:31:55,134
I'll take a photo. One...

819
00:31:55,135 --> 00:31:56,605
One, two, three.

820
00:31:57,275 --> 00:31:58,404
- The back.
- The back.

821
00:31:58,405 --> 00:31:59,545
The back. Yes.

822
00:32:00,805 --> 00:32:02,044
Hold on.

823
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,975
(He runs over quickly and adjusts the dress.)

824
00:32:05,415 --> 00:32:07,015
(He works hard.)

825
00:32:07,315 --> 00:32:09,915
One, two, three.

826
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:12,724
- Let me see the photos.
- Okay.

827
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:14,424
(Please take a look, My Star.)

828
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:15,925
- Okay. Good.
- Okay.

829
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:19,024
I want to hear the opinions of the production crew members too.

830
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:20,164
Okay.

831
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:22,965
The jewels on the back are sparkling beautifully.

832
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:24,865
Jewels.

833
00:32:28,505 --> 00:32:29,774
- How many dresses remain?
- What?

834
00:32:29,775 --> 00:32:30,935
How many dresses remain?

835
00:32:31,175 --> 00:32:32,674
- Take a look.
- Shall we...

836
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:34,475
Shall we remove a few dresses?

837
00:32:35,175 --> 00:32:36,575
Did she go inside already?

838
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:40,045
- It's like a 007 movie.
- What?

839
00:32:40,345 --> 00:32:42,285
- So this isn't it, right?
- Well...

840
00:32:43,115 --> 00:32:44,154
Your back...

841
00:32:44,155 --> 00:32:45,284
My back got tanned.

842
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:46,985
(Your back got tanned.)

843
00:32:48,085 --> 00:32:50,455
- Don't look at it so closely.
- Hey.

844
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:52,265
I thought it was a shadow.

845
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,564
- Your back got heavily tanned.
- Why is your eyesight so good?

846
00:32:54,565 --> 00:32:56,565
Who picked this one?

847
00:32:57,135 --> 00:32:58,494
Who picked this one?

848
00:32:58,495 --> 00:32:59,505
Me.

849
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:02,534
Have a meeting on which dress would be the best.

850
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,335
Is this one out?

851
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:06,404
All right. Let's go.

852
00:33:06,405 --> 00:33:07,674
Let's pick a dress and leave.

853
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:09,045
- Okay.
- We have a long way to go.

854
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:11,014
Let's pick a dress and leave. We could leave now.

855
00:33:11,015 --> 00:33:13,114
We could pick a dress as we eat.

856
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:14,215
Shall we leave?

857
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:17,284
(My Star is so impatient.)

858
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,025
Let's pick it here.

859
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:21,084
- This one.
- How about this one?

860
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:22,794
- I like this one.
- This one and the previous one.

861
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:23,954
- Do you find it pretty?
- I like this one.

862
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:25,024
- I like this one.
- It's pretty, right?

863
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:26,624
There's the one that goes bling-bling.

864
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,595
- This one? Kwang Kyu's pick?
- Yes.

865
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,565
You're stylish.

866
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:32,164
- Really?
- Seriously.

867
00:33:32,165 --> 00:33:33,505
- Yes.
- It comes down to these two.

868
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:35,674
Between these two...

869
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:36,704
What's this? An earring?

870
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:38,304
Why did you try on my earring?

871
00:33:38,305 --> 00:33:39,374
What's this? An earring?

872
00:33:39,375 --> 00:33:41,345
Why did you try on my earring?

873
00:33:42,045 --> 00:33:43,914
This is driving me crazy.

874
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,145
(His shy dimple is the key point.)

875
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:47,244
- Why did you take it? Delete it.
- Why did you try it on?

876
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:50,654
He kept touching your jewellery.

877
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,755
Seo Jin likes shiny things.

878
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:53,854
Let's go with these two.

879
00:33:53,855 --> 00:33:54,924
- I'll pick between...
- Which ones?

880
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,224
Kwang Kyu's dress and my dress.

881
00:33:56,225 --> 00:33:58,655
- Okay.
- I'll talk to my stylists...

882
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:01,295
- and wear one to the film festival.
- Okay.

883
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:05,764
(The day of the Busan International Film Festival)

884
00:34:05,765 --> 00:34:08,435
(Busan International Film Festival welcomed its 30th anniversary.)

885
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:09,734
(Bong Joon Ho, Park Chan Wook, Kim You Jung, Lee Soo Hyuk, )

886
00:34:09,735 --> 00:34:10,934
(Shim Eun Kyung, Keum Sae Rok, Sylvia Chang, Sakaguchi Kentaro, )

887
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:12,174
(Lisa of BLACKPINK, Ha Jung Woo, Lee Dong Wook, Ko Kyoung Pyo, )

888
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,405
(Jung Woo, Shin Seung Ho, Jung Soo Jung, Shu Qi, etc.)

889
00:34:13,445 --> 00:34:17,915
(My Star, Um Ji Won, got invited to the glorious closing ceremony.)

890
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:22,215
(The day of the awards ceremony)

891
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:29,894
(At 8:59am, My Star's hotel)

892
00:34:29,895 --> 00:34:32,154
(Rustling)

893
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:35,594
(An automatic reaction to the alarm sound)

894
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,064
(Razor-sharp time management, mid-task updates, prompt feedback)

895
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:42,335
(My Star wakes up on time.)

896
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:50,045
(She gets up right away.)

897
00:34:52,075 --> 00:34:55,285
(Opening the curtains)

898
00:34:57,615 --> 00:35:01,525
(She stretches as she enjoys the sunlight.)

899
00:35:05,425 --> 00:35:07,125
It's the sea.

900
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:11,165
(She gets a bird's-eye view of the sea.)

901
00:35:13,265 --> 00:35:16,305
(Its Busan, where My Star will present an award.)

902
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,804
(It's an ocean-view hotel the film festival booked...)

903
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:20,245
(for the presenter.)

904
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:24,245
(Massaging)

905
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:27,715
(My Stars sits before the mirror upon waking up.)

906
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:31,484
(Massaging)

907
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:34,125
When you scrape the face with gua sha,

908
00:35:34,825 --> 00:35:36,295
the puffiness...

909
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:37,955
totally disappears.

910
00:35:39,065 --> 00:35:41,264
You scrape this area.

911
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:42,324
(Massaging)

912
00:35:42,325 --> 00:35:43,634
You scrape this area...

913
00:35:43,635 --> 00:35:45,165
as you move up.

914
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:53,844
You can see the difference, right?

915
00:35:53,845 --> 00:35:56,845
Only one side of the face is tight.

916
00:35:58,145 --> 00:36:00,385
When I scrape the ear area diligently,

917
00:36:00,915 --> 00:36:03,015
the face becomes tight.

918
00:36:04,015 --> 00:36:06,984
(She works out for an hour on an empty stomach.)

919
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:09,095
Small habits come together...

920
00:36:09,395 --> 00:36:10,725
to make a big difference.

921
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:13,725
(While My Star continues to take care of herself)

922
00:36:13,965 --> 00:36:15,025
Where are we going?

923
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,235
BIFF Hill?

924
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:19,304
(The secretaries came to survey the place in advance.)

925
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:20,864
(At 11am, Busan Cinema Center, preliminary survey)

926
00:36:20,865 --> 00:36:22,134
How may I help you?

927
00:36:22,135 --> 00:36:23,934
- We're Um Ji Won's managers.
- Um Ji Won's managers?

928
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,304
Yes.

929
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:27,774
If a manager is receiving the actor's pass for her,

930
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,215
you need to fill out the ledger.

931
00:36:30,245 --> 00:36:32,485
(The ledger?)

932
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,615
Me?

933
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:36,684
- The entertainment company...
- It's your responsibility.

934
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:38,054
Which entertainment company was it?

935
00:36:38,055 --> 00:36:39,454
- What?
- What was the name?

936
00:36:39,455 --> 00:36:40,625
It's your company.

937
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,795
(How does this manager not know the entertainment company name?)

938
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,324
It's ABM Company.

939
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,924
- What?
- ABM Company.

940
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:49,064
- ABM...
- Company.

941
00:36:49,065 --> 00:36:50,495
- Company.
- Yes.

942
00:36:50,995 --> 00:36:52,635
The number is one.

943
00:36:52,905 --> 00:36:54,064
What's one?

944
00:36:54,065 --> 00:36:55,774
You're receiving one pass.

945
00:36:55,775 --> 00:36:56,974
- One?
- Yes.

946
00:36:56,975 --> 00:36:58,674
(But there are two managers.)

947
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,975
You're here as the actor's manager.

948
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:01,204
- Yes.
- The actor gets one pass,

949
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:03,014
and the managers get two passes.

950
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,374
So please put down "One" for the actor's pass.

951
00:37:04,375 --> 00:37:06,614
- The number is one.
- Yes.

952
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:08,214
And please write down the manager's name.

953
00:37:08,215 --> 00:37:09,454
Your name?

954
00:37:09,455 --> 00:37:10,554
Write down, "Kim Kwang Kyu."

955
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:12,885
Why would you write down my name?

956
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:15,454
- You...
- You can leave that part empty.

957
00:37:15,455 --> 00:37:17,724
- You're more popular than me.
- And?

958
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:20,094
(He feels like a famous person should sign it.)

959
00:37:20,095 --> 00:37:21,794
- What?
- Please note...

960
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:24,164
that you'll need to pay ten dollars if you lose it.

961
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:25,495
- Okay.
- Please check here.

962
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:27,804
Please write the actor's name here.

963
00:37:27,805 --> 00:37:29,034
Wear it around your neck.

964
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:30,734
We don't need to do that now.

965
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:32,504
You must wear it now to accompany your actor.

966
00:37:32,505 --> 00:37:33,575
Really?

967
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:35,815
Why else would they make it?

968
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:36,975
We need to wear it now.

969
00:37:37,415 --> 00:37:39,144
Let's deliver this to Ji Won.

970
00:37:39,145 --> 00:37:40,145
(They finish wearing the pass.)

971
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:42,484
All right. Okay.

972
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:43,555
Thank you.

973
00:37:43,755 --> 00:37:46,325
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

974
00:37:47,255 --> 00:37:50,625
(They finish receiving the pass.)

975
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:54,565
(They move outside for the preliminary survey.)

976
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:56,334
We'll come this far.

977
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:58,395
Where should I wait?

978
00:37:58,795 --> 00:38:00,965
(Looking around)

979
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:04,635
Hey, you can't go in.

980
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:07,004
- Can we go in?
- The ceremony hasn't begun yet.

981
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:09,315
Hey, you can't go in. Hey!

982
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:11,115
- You can't go in.
- What?

983
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:12,544
Can't we go in?

984
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:13,914
(He only thinks about surveying the venue.)

985
00:38:13,915 --> 00:38:15,115
- Hey.
- Who cares?

986
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:18,385
I guess people get out of the car and walk through here.

987
00:38:19,225 --> 00:38:22,155
(He reads the room and follows Seo Jin.)

988
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,195
Is the red carpet over there?

989
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:29,165
(Seo Jin advances forward.)

990
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:35,975
The cameras will be over here.

991
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:38,575
- Here? Okay.
- Yes.

992
00:38:41,775 --> 00:38:44,775
(Seo Jin checks out the nooks and crannies.)

993
00:38:44,975 --> 00:38:46,685
Why is he going alone?

994
00:38:48,345 --> 00:38:49,484
It's hot.

995
00:38:49,485 --> 00:38:50,584
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

996
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:51,785
This is the red carpet.

997
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:53,385
- Is this the entrance?
- Yes.

998
00:38:55,225 --> 00:38:58,125
Then, this is where you send her off.

999
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:00,925
Shouldn't the manager...

1000
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,964
accompany the star...

1001
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:05,165
to the stage?

1002
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:10,105
What kind of a manager enters the red carpet?

1003
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:11,774
The actor enters alone.

1004
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,674
(He wants to walk down the red carpet.)

1005
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:15,404
But over there,

1006
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:18,045
the actor needs to walk down further.

1007
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:20,344
- Right?
- Then, I go to the side.

1008
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:22,444
- I don't step on the red carpet.
- That's it!

1009
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:24,615
That's it!

1010
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:27,855
When Ji Won goes this way,

1011
00:39:28,025 --> 00:39:30,324
you should walk down...

1012
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:31,594
to this spot.

1013
00:39:31,595 --> 00:39:33,325
(They move to a place where they'll wait after sending off My Star.)

1014
00:39:34,695 --> 00:39:36,294
(They return to the place where they started off.)

1015
00:39:36,295 --> 00:39:37,565
We'll come all the way here.

1016
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,765
(Walking)

1017
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,564
Please come on out...

1018
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:43,805
since people are rehearsing.

1019
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,875
Please come on out.

1020
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:49,005
May we sit here?

1021
00:39:49,045 --> 00:39:50,275
- No.
- Not even here?

1022
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:53,015
All right.

1023
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:54,384
- It's this way.
- Later on,

1024
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:56,355
can we come in here with this pass?

1025
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:57,855
Not at all?

1026
00:39:57,955 --> 00:40:00,085
How far can one go with this pass?

1027
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:01,854
There wasn't much I could do.

1028
00:40:01,855 --> 00:40:04,725
We kept getting kicked out of places.

1029
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:05,895
So...

1030
00:40:06,325 --> 00:40:08,765
it was a bit frustrating.

1031
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:14,635
(They couldn't check out the managers' waiting place.)

1032
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,374
Shall we ask them where Ji Won is sitting?

1033
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,734
(They need to figure out where to meet My Star afterward!)

1034
00:40:18,735 --> 00:40:19,845
Excuse me.

1035
00:40:20,005 --> 00:40:22,144
Are there names on the chairs?

1036
00:40:22,145 --> 00:40:23,574
- There will be later.
- Right?

1037
00:40:23,575 --> 00:40:25,674
Is it possible to check the seat right now?

1038
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:26,945
We can't do that now.

1039
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:31,714
How far can I go with this pass?

1040
00:40:31,715 --> 00:40:33,455
Can I go anywhere? No?

1041
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:34,785
How far can I go?

1042
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,654
- With that pass, - What?

1043
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:39,624
you can't enter the venue...

1044
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:41,024
or the waiting area.

1045
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:43,564
I thought we could enter the venue.

1046
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:45,064
But we kept getting kicked out.

1047
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:47,535
When I learned that we couldn't enter anywhere...

1048
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:49,735
I had to tell Ji Won,

1049
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,505
"I can't accompany you."

1050
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:52,804
"You're on your own."

1051
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:53,944
That place...

1052
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:55,545
After presenting the award,

1053
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:57,114
which way does she exit?

1054
00:40:57,115 --> 00:40:58,214
Does she exit this way or that way?

1055
00:40:58,215 --> 00:40:59,744
The right side.

1056
00:40:59,745 --> 00:41:02,014
When the actor goes to the back through the right side,

1057
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:03,915
she'll reach the pick-up area.

1058
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:06,084
That's where...

1059
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:08,454
the manager's van waits and picks up the actor.

1060
00:41:08,455 --> 00:41:10,355
Then I won't need to be here.

1061
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:13,895
We need to enter through the pick-up area.

1062
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:15,894
We can wait at the pick-up area.

1063
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:17,895
That's where we can meet Ji Won.

1064
00:41:18,535 --> 00:41:20,605
Let's go to the pick-up area now.

1065
00:41:20,635 --> 00:41:21,864
But...

1066
00:41:21,865 --> 00:41:23,104
we need to go this way to reach the pick-up area.

1067
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,434
You need to take a detour.

1068
00:41:24,435 --> 00:41:25,804
- Do we need to take a detour?
- Yes.

1069
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,075
Can't we go straight?

1070
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:28,404
The rehearsal is underway,

1071
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,175
so you can't pass.

1072
00:41:30,445 --> 00:41:32,144
I'm from Busan.

1073
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:33,644
(Out of nowhere)

1074
00:41:33,645 --> 00:41:34,645
I'm just a staff member.

1075
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,584
- I have no power.
- Really? For goodness' sake.

1076
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:39,355
- My professor made this movie.
- Your professor.

1077
00:41:39,755 --> 00:41:42,655
I'm so frustrated.

1078
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,425
I'm...

1079
00:41:44,925 --> 00:41:46,924
I'm from Busan.

1080
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:48,494
I...

1081
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:50,235
(His connections don't work on the impenetrable security.)

1082
00:41:50,695 --> 00:41:52,264
Will Ji Won come out...

1083
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:54,064
- to this road?
- No.

1084
00:41:54,065 --> 00:41:55,464
- There's a path in the back.
- Is there a path in the back?

1085
00:41:55,465 --> 00:41:56,704
Will she come out this way?

1086
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,975
Yes, you can stand by here.

1087
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,704
Will she come out through here?

1088
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:03,275
Around this area. Yes.

1089
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:04,975
You just need to wait here.

1090
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:06,685
Okay. Let's go.

1091
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:09,145
They wanted me to explain this to Ji Won.

1092
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,555
(Off to report about the on-site to My Star)

1093
00:42:14,225 --> 00:42:17,155
When I was a cab driver, there weren't these overpasses.

1094
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:19,424
There weren't any even in the 1990s?

1095
00:42:19,425 --> 00:42:20,865
No, there weren't.

1096
00:42:21,365 --> 00:42:24,235
They were only built in the 2000s.

1097
00:42:25,435 --> 00:42:28,065
(Coming back home, old memories are flooding back for Kwang Kyu.)

1098
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:31,435
That is the largest department store in the world.

1099
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:32,975
- Is it?
- It's written there.

1100
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:34,104
- The world's largest department...
- Well...

1101
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:36,004
I think they said that when they were building it.

1102
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,875
It's in the Guinness Book of Records.

1103
00:42:38,845 --> 00:42:39,884
Where does it say that?

1104
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:41,444
It's written over there. Guinness Book of Records.

1105
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:43,254
Gosh. Your eyesight is good.

1106
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:44,385
You can see that?

1107
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:46,654
- Of course.
- Guinness.

1108
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,925
I have 1.2 vision.

1109
00:42:49,955 --> 00:42:51,754
That's awesome.

1110
00:42:51,755 --> 00:42:52,865
I can't see this, though.

1111
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:54,664
- You can't see this.
- No, I can't.

1112
00:42:54,665 --> 00:42:55,724
That's totally fine.

1113
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:57,465
So you can see things afar.

1114
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:00,164
- I'll go to the hotel now.
- Let's go to the hotel for now.

1115
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:01,405
I need to go to the restroom.

1116
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,935
You're healthy.

1117
00:43:05,305 --> 00:43:07,675
Why, you can't?

1118
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:10,615
You're being jealous for nothing.

1119
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:14,045
I'm just jealous of everything you have.

1120
00:43:15,415 --> 00:43:17,985
Why would you be even jealous of going to the restroom?

1121
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:19,414
Let's go together.

1122
00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:21,524
No. You go alone.

1123
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:22,995
I went earlier.

1124
00:43:23,325 --> 00:43:24,995
Hold my hand while I go.

1125
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:30,265
(It's a rare moment of harmony.)

1126
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:34,965
(Arriving at the hotel where My Star awaits)

1127
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:38,435
(Fumbling)

1128
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,575
Let me see.

1129
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,445
(Checking the items they got from the Film Festival)

1130
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:44,775
What is this?

1131
00:43:45,075 --> 00:43:46,485
It's a sticker for the car.

1132
00:43:46,745 --> 00:43:48,244
- This...
- Do we put this up as well?

1133
00:43:48,245 --> 00:43:49,854
Wouldn't this leave a mark...

1134
00:43:49,855 --> 00:43:51,155
if we take it off later?

1135
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:53,285
- Where would you...
- Yes?

1136
00:43:53,885 --> 00:43:55,325
I think we could put it here like this.

1137
00:43:56,255 --> 00:43:57,855
(Putting it between the wipers since it could leave a mark)

1138
00:43:58,095 --> 00:43:59,224
It won't rain today, would it?

1139
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:00,764
What if I use the wipers?

1140
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:02,065
It won't rain today.

1141
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:03,394
If it doesn't...

1142
00:44:03,395 --> 00:44:05,094
What if I get nervous...

1143
00:44:05,095 --> 00:44:06,164
and use it regardless of the rain?

1144
00:44:06,165 --> 00:44:09,105
Why would you get nervous and use the wipers?

1145
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:10,974
Let's put it on.

1146
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:12,975
- I'm worried about taking it off.
- What?

1147
00:44:13,145 --> 00:44:14,504
This is sticky.

1148
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:15,904
Then, give it to me.

1149
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:16,914
- Give it to me.
- Why?

1150
00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:17,945
Give it to me.

1151
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,614
If...

1152
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,285
we use it as a lint remover a little,

1153
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,154
- it will come off easily.
- Does it?

1154
00:44:25,155 --> 00:44:27,455
Yes. You do it like this.

1155
00:44:28,055 --> 00:44:29,424
If we do this, it comes off easily.

1156
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:30,654
That's some wisdom of life.

1157
00:44:30,655 --> 00:44:31,825
Of course.

1158
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:35,265
This will come off easily later.

1159
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:37,594
- Put it on the passenger's side.
- Passenger's side?

1160
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:38,864
- Here. Passenger's side.
- Here?

1161
00:44:38,865 --> 00:44:40,104
Down or up?

1162
00:44:40,105 --> 00:44:41,865
Put it here so it's more visible.

1163
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:43,804
- Like this?
- Yes. Isn't that good?

1164
00:44:43,805 --> 00:44:45,734
Then it will be caught on the wipers.

1165
00:44:45,735 --> 00:44:46,875
Let's put it here.

1166
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,144
Kwang Kyu, the wipers won't go that way.

1167
00:44:48,145 --> 00:44:50,514
- It would move like this from here.
- Like this?

1168
00:44:50,515 --> 00:44:52,474
And what if it moves?

1169
00:44:52,475 --> 00:44:53,745
What's the matter?

1170
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:55,145
All right. Put it up there.

1171
00:44:56,115 --> 00:44:57,414
You're okay now, right?

1172
00:44:57,415 --> 00:44:58,555
(The harmony didn't last long.)

1173
00:45:00,255 --> 00:45:01,785
Okay. Stop pressing on it.

1174
00:45:03,655 --> 00:45:05,955
(Checking it until the last moment)

1175
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:10,764
(Now, off to My Star with the load)

1176
00:45:10,765 --> 00:45:11,894
Well.

1177
00:45:11,895 --> 00:45:13,734
Hello. My Star.

1178
00:45:13,735 --> 00:45:15,434
- It's been a while.
- Kwang Kyu

1179
00:45:15,435 --> 00:45:16,704
- How have you been?
- Good.

1180
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:19,235
- I've been good. How are you?
- I'm good.

1181
00:45:19,305 --> 00:45:21,145
- Have you eaten something?
- Yes?

1182
00:45:21,245 --> 00:45:24,245
Why do you have those on when your legs are not swollen?

1183
00:45:25,075 --> 00:45:27,345
Your legs are so slim that you don't need to worry about swelling.

1184
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:29,614
- Yes?
- They are too slim to be swollen.

1185
00:45:29,615 --> 00:45:30,855
They are swollen.

1186
00:45:30,985 --> 00:45:33,424
My gosh.

1187
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:35,154
- Well, I...
- Manager Kim.

1188
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:36,394
- Yes.
- Did you have a good trip?

1189
00:45:36,395 --> 00:45:38,324
- Yes.
- How did it go?

1190
00:45:38,325 --> 00:45:40,125
Well...

1191
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:44,265
Busan International Movie...

1192
00:45:44,665 --> 00:45:45,764
Not "Movie." It's "Film."

1193
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:47,165
- Film.
- Yes. Film.

1194
00:45:47,705 --> 00:45:48,804
Not "Movie."

1195
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:49,834
It's not "Movie." It's "Film."

1196
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,334
He said "BIFF" was beef earlier.

1197
00:45:51,335 --> 00:45:52,775
(He said "BIFF" was beef earlier.)

1198
00:45:53,305 --> 00:45:55,204
(Kwang Kyu is confused with "Beef," which has the same pronunciation.)

1199
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:56,844
It's "BIFF."

1200
00:45:56,845 --> 00:45:58,144
- "BIFF." - "BIFF."

1201
00:45:58,145 --> 00:46:00,544
- What's "beef?" - "BIFF."

1202
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,085
What is it an abbreviation for?

1203
00:46:02,145 --> 00:46:05,154
- Busan International Film...
- Yes.

1204
00:46:05,155 --> 00:46:06,184
Marketing.

1205
00:46:06,185 --> 00:46:07,384
Marketing?

1206
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:08,684
The last one starts with "F."

1207
00:46:08,685 --> 00:46:10,124
- There's one more.
- Fetval.

1208
00:46:10,125 --> 00:46:11,525
Fetval.

1209
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:13,964
What's that?

1210
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:15,864
- It's "Festival." - Festival.

1211
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:18,194
But you received the pass and everything.

1212
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:19,765
They gave it to us when we got there right away.

1213
00:46:20,005 --> 00:46:21,304
But we...

1214
00:46:21,305 --> 00:46:22,804
- You got one as the manager.
- We have one for you as well.

1215
00:46:22,805 --> 00:46:24,035
- We do, don't we?
- Yes, we do.

1216
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:26,304
- It's this mine?
- Yes.

1217
00:46:26,305 --> 00:46:28,605
- Thank you.
- Oh, dear.

1218
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:32,144
To celebrate the 30th anniversary, there was a huge cast of actors...

1219
00:46:32,145 --> 00:46:34,084
- who visited.
- Right.

1220
00:46:34,085 --> 00:46:35,214
What kind of actors were there?

1221
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:37,454
There seem to have been foreign actors.

1222
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:39,515
I'm not familiar with foreign actors.

1223
00:46:41,055 --> 00:46:43,755
I heard that Juliette Binoche came.

1224
00:46:43,855 --> 00:46:45,024
- Now?
- Yes.

1225
00:46:45,025 --> 00:46:46,664
(She won the Best Actress Award at 3 international film festivals.)

1226
00:46:46,665 --> 00:46:48,564
- Anyway, you leave at 6pm.
- Yes.

1227
00:46:48,565 --> 00:46:51,534
You will be awarding the BIFF MECENAT Award.

1228
00:46:51,535 --> 00:46:52,864
- The award.
- The award.

1229
00:46:52,865 --> 00:46:54,835
So, what time will I be awarding it?

1230
00:46:55,805 --> 00:46:57,934
- Do you know?
- I think you'll be done early.

1231
00:46:57,935 --> 00:46:59,774
- You're second in order.
- Yes.

1232
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,505
- So I think you'll be done early.
- That seems like it.

1233
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:02,904
You worked hard.

1234
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:04,474
- There's something I took as well.
- Okay.

1235
00:47:04,475 --> 00:47:05,714
(Oh, right.)

1236
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:07,615
I prepared something for you.

1237
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:09,884
To work hard.

1238
00:47:09,885 --> 00:47:11,054
It looks good.

1239
00:47:11,055 --> 00:47:12,255
What is it?

1240
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:13,754
It's a notebook.

1241
00:47:13,755 --> 00:47:14,854
It looks good.

1242
00:47:14,855 --> 00:47:17,795
Use it when you meet your next celebrity.

1243
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:21,094
- It's a notebook.
- Yes.

1244
00:47:21,095 --> 00:47:22,795
- She even engraved my name.
- Yes.

1245
00:47:22,865 --> 00:47:24,534
Manager Kim Kwang Kyu.

1246
00:47:24,535 --> 00:47:26,234
(Manager Kim Kwang Kyu)

1247
00:47:26,235 --> 00:47:28,635
"Manager Kim Kwang Kyu."

1248
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:32,435
"Thank you for making me shine."

1249
00:47:32,705 --> 00:47:35,205
"Um Ji Won."

1250
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:38,374
This is really nice. Thank you.

1251
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:39,415
You're welcome.

1252
00:47:39,675 --> 00:47:41,115
It's nothing big.

1253
00:47:41,145 --> 00:47:43,044
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

1254
00:47:43,045 --> 00:47:44,155
No, I haven't.

1255
00:47:44,785 --> 00:47:46,685
So we prepared this.

1256
00:47:46,725 --> 00:47:48,025
You did?

1257
00:47:49,225 --> 00:47:51,295
Granola these days is big.

1258
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:53,265
- This one?
- Yes.

1259
00:47:54,065 --> 00:47:56,195
- Do you spread this over to eat?
- Yes.

1260
00:47:56,295 --> 00:47:57,395
Really?

1261
00:47:57,635 --> 00:47:59,095
That's thoughtful of you.

1262
00:47:59,905 --> 00:48:02,064
You know that people eat peanut butter a lot...

1263
00:48:02,065 --> 00:48:04,134
when they go on a diet. You know that, right?

1264
00:48:04,135 --> 00:48:05,174
That's right.

1265
00:48:05,175 --> 00:48:06,444
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1266
00:48:06,445 --> 00:48:09,145
Then why don't you, Director Lee, spread it nicely for her?

1267
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:10,874
There's this as well.

1268
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,014
(Peanut butter spread by Young Master Seo Jin)

1269
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,145
Here.

1270
00:48:13,785 --> 00:48:15,015
Thank you.

1271
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:18,885
(First meal at 3:30pm)

1272
00:48:19,755 --> 00:48:21,354
- This is good.
- Is it?

1273
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:22,424
Yes.

1274
00:48:22,425 --> 00:48:23,755
It's domestic. Domestic peanut.

1275
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,025
It's a healthy taste.

1276
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:32,165
(Knock, knock)

1277
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:36,474
(He has one more person to take care of.)

1278
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:37,675
This is good.

1279
00:48:38,905 --> 00:48:40,144
(Handing it over casually)

1280
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:41,805
- You wanted me to give you one?
- Yes.

1281
00:48:43,145 --> 00:48:44,474
(He hasn't forgotten to care for his older bestie.)

1282
00:48:44,475 --> 00:48:45,645
This is good.

1283
00:48:49,515 --> 00:48:51,185
- Is that water in a wine glass?
- Yes.

1284
00:48:51,255 --> 00:48:53,655
- I thought you might be thirsty.
- Thank you.

1285
00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:57,154
(4:00pm, 2 hours before the red carpet)

1286
00:48:57,155 --> 00:48:58,754
Let me then start on my hair and makeup.

1287
00:48:58,755 --> 00:48:59,965
Is it okay for my face...

1288
00:49:00,025 --> 00:49:02,065
to be broadcast like this?

1289
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:05,894
- Shall we blur you out then?
- Yes.

1290
00:49:05,895 --> 00:49:07,264
- Shall we blur your out?
- Can I be on TV like this...

1291
00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:09,304
without makeup at all?

1292
00:49:09,305 --> 00:49:10,535
I don't have anything on.

1293
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:13,204
This is the downside of variety shows, My Star.

1294
00:49:13,205 --> 00:49:14,405
(The secretaries are always on standby.)

1295
00:49:14,545 --> 00:49:16,714
Call us when you need something.

1296
00:49:16,715 --> 00:49:17,775
All right.

1297
00:49:21,885 --> 00:49:22,944
- Here.
- We should finish by 5pm...

1298
00:49:22,945 --> 00:49:24,814
(It's time to break out of the blurring...)

1299
00:49:24,815 --> 00:49:26,955
(and transform into business mode.)

1300
00:49:28,285 --> 00:49:29,425
Have you eaten?

1301
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:32,725
- Did you eat?
- None of us has eaten yet.

1302
00:49:32,855 --> 00:49:34,165
- Lunch?
- Yes.

1303
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:37,994
They said they wanted us to finish by sometime after 4pm.

1304
00:49:37,995 --> 00:49:39,264
You should eat something.

1305
00:49:39,265 --> 00:49:41,005
We came right over.

1306
00:49:41,535 --> 00:49:43,535
(Worried)

1307
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:45,674
Kwang Kyu.

1308
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:47,374
- This is filling.
- Kwang Kyu.

1309
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:48,805
Yes?

1310
00:49:49,045 --> 00:49:50,914
- Yes, My Star.
- The directors...

1311
00:49:50,915 --> 00:49:52,675
here haven't eaten yet.

1312
00:49:52,745 --> 00:49:53,884
What?

1313
00:49:53,885 --> 00:49:55,414
Go out and get us something.

1314
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:56,585
(Go out and get us something.)

1315
00:49:56,715 --> 00:49:59,714
Shall I give you more granola?

1316
00:49:59,715 --> 00:50:01,455
(It's a long-awaited free time.)

1317
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:04,155
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

1318
00:50:04,225 --> 00:50:06,055
Come here for a second.

1319
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:10,364
(My Star won't let him have his time alone.)

1320
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:11,895
Yes, My Star.

1321
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:14,334
- Hello.
- Hello.

1322
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:16,804
This is my new manager.

1323
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:18,134
It's Manager Kim Kwang Kyu.

1324
00:50:18,135 --> 00:50:19,675
- He looks familiar.
- Yes.

1325
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:21,945
He was a former actor.

1326
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:24,944
I'm Manager Kim Kwang Kyu.

1327
00:50:24,945 --> 00:50:26,615
(I'm Manager Kim Kwang Kyu. Nice to meet you.)

1328
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:28,884
Would you two like....

1329
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:30,814
to eat abalone porridge? There's this really good place.

1330
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:32,085
- The place, right next to here.
- Yes.

1331
00:50:32,285 --> 00:50:34,054
There's an abalone porridge place...

1332
00:50:34,055 --> 00:50:35,484
on the first floor.

1333
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:36,754
- Yes. There is.
- You know, right?

1334
00:50:36,755 --> 00:50:37,755
Yes, I do.

1335
00:50:37,756 --> 00:50:40,165
- Two porridges for the directors...
- Yes?

1336
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:42,994
Can you get them for me?

1337
00:50:42,995 --> 00:50:44,234
- Now?
- Yes.

1338
00:50:44,235 --> 00:50:46,234
- Really?
- They'll eat them after makeup.

1339
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:48,404
Which one of you is the director?

1340
00:50:48,405 --> 00:50:49,664
Both of them are.

1341
00:50:49,665 --> 00:50:50,734
- Both of them.
- Director of makeup...

1342
00:50:50,735 --> 00:50:51,935
- and director of hair styling.
- Okay.

1343
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:53,674
- Hello.
- Hello.

1344
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,605
Shall we just order the porridge?

1345
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:57,775
- Okay, then.
- Kwang Kyu.

1346
00:50:58,045 --> 00:51:00,445
And on your way back, can you get me a coconut water?

1347
00:51:00,915 --> 00:51:02,715
- There's such a thing?
- Yes.

1348
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:04,514
Where can you get it?

1349
00:51:04,515 --> 00:51:05,584
They have it in a convenience store.

1350
00:51:05,585 --> 00:51:07,525
There's a thing called coconut water?

1351
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:09,055
It's just coconut water.

1352
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:10,855
I've never heard of this in my life.

1353
00:51:11,225 --> 00:51:12,894
- In a convenience store.
- Really?

1354
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:13,924
Coconut...

1355
00:51:13,925 --> 00:51:15,824
- How about something like a banana?
- Banana, please.

1356
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:17,064
- Okay. Banana.
- One.

1357
00:51:17,065 --> 00:51:18,535
- One banana.
- Yes.

1358
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:21,464
If you need other things, please text me, My Star.

1359
00:51:21,465 --> 00:51:23,704
- I will.
- My Star.

1360
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:26,405
Kwang Kyu, I appreciate it.

1361
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:32,375
Where is Seo Jin?

1362
00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:35,014
- Now?
- While you were doing an interview,

1363
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:36,854
Kwang Kyu went to buy abalone porridge.

1364
00:51:36,855 --> 00:51:38,314
- Why?
- He's taking care of her alone.

1365
00:51:38,315 --> 00:51:41,254
He went because the hair and makeup staff need to eat.

1366
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:42,625
That's good.

1367
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:44,725
He did well.

1368
00:51:45,755 --> 00:51:47,264
(He is on a journey to run an errand alone.)

1369
00:51:47,265 --> 00:51:49,065
Sorry.

1370
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:54,465
Banana,

1371
00:51:54,705 --> 00:51:55,865
abalone porridge...

1372
00:51:57,775 --> 00:51:58,935
Banana,

1373
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:00,575
abalone porridge...

1374
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:05,944
(As soon as he left, he forgot.)

1375
00:52:05,945 --> 00:52:08,415
It was some kind of water.

1376
00:52:10,755 --> 00:52:12,054
Palm tree water?

1377
00:52:12,055 --> 00:52:13,685
(Palm tree water?)

1378
00:52:14,585 --> 00:52:17,555
(He can tell it's not a palm tree water.)

1379
00:52:18,295 --> 00:52:22,195
(He's calling My Star to ask.)

1380
00:52:25,795 --> 00:52:27,035
She's not answering.

1381
00:52:29,735 --> 00:52:31,474
I should have written it down.

1382
00:52:31,475 --> 00:52:32,835
(He is quite forgetful.)

1383
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:35,345
Since abalone porridge...

1384
00:52:35,645 --> 00:52:37,545
will take some time...

1385
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:40,815
(He's going to buy abalone porridge, which he is sure about.)

1386
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:44,285
Hello.

1387
00:52:46,355 --> 00:52:47,355
Hello.

1388
00:52:47,356 --> 00:52:49,024
Can I have the abalone porridge to go?

1389
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:50,825
- Yes, you can.
- Then...

1390
00:52:50,855 --> 00:52:52,994
can I have the original abalone porridge...

1391
00:52:52,995 --> 00:52:55,425
- Hello.
- Hello. In regular size...

1392
00:52:55,565 --> 00:52:57,034
- You want 1 abalone porridge?
- No. Please make it 2.

1393
00:52:57,035 --> 00:52:58,665
- You want two servings, then?
- Yes, please.

1394
00:53:00,665 --> 00:53:02,735
- Is there anyone who wants one?
- You're handsome.

1395
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:07,445
Thank you.

1396
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:08,775
Thank you.

1397
00:53:09,575 --> 00:53:10,814
(Chore List: 2 abalone porridges, coconut water, 1 banana)

1398
00:53:10,815 --> 00:53:12,344
- Ma'am...
- Please wait a bit.

1399
00:53:12,345 --> 00:53:13,845
How long will it take?

1400
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:16,014
I think it'll take about ten minutes.

1401
00:53:16,015 --> 00:53:18,415
Will it? Then...

1402
00:53:19,715 --> 00:53:20,954
I should take care of it at the convenience store.

1403
00:53:20,955 --> 00:53:22,125
I'm too anxious.

1404
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:25,694
(Chore List: 2 abalone porridges, coconut water, 1 banana)

1405
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:27,024
- Hello.
- Hello.

1406
00:53:27,025 --> 00:53:28,165
Hello, there.

1407
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:31,495
(He's looking at the drinks carefully.)

1408
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:35,804
I think I have to call her again.

1409
00:53:35,805 --> 00:53:37,975
(Let me call her again...)

1410
00:53:41,945 --> 00:53:44,245
In Thailand, there was a palm tree water.

1411
00:53:44,275 --> 00:53:45,815
Is that the coconut water?

1412
00:53:49,145 --> 00:53:50,915
(He found something.)

1413
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:54,384
The person is not answering.

1414
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:55,654
Transferring to voicemail after the beep.

1415
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:57,954
(The phone call did not work out.)

1416
00:53:57,955 --> 00:53:59,024
This...

1417
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:02,465
(The phone call did not work out, but he found something.)

1418
00:54:05,765 --> 00:54:07,135
There is such a thing.

1419
00:54:15,145 --> 00:54:16,374
This...

1420
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:20,145
(He got a drink that only has a similar name.)

1421
00:54:21,115 --> 00:54:24,014
(Chore List: 2 abalone porridges, coconut water, 1 banana)

1422
00:54:24,015 --> 00:54:25,254
Corporate credit card.

1423
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:28,754
(Chore List: 2 abalone porridges, coconut water, 1 banana)

1424
00:54:28,755 --> 00:54:30,995
The banana is so cute.

1425
00:54:31,955 --> 00:54:33,355
Banana.

1426
00:54:34,665 --> 00:54:38,535
(He only needs to pick up the porridges now.)

1427
00:54:41,605 --> 00:54:46,035
(He sits down first.)

1428
00:54:46,705 --> 00:54:48,875
(Fumbling)

1429
00:54:55,845 --> 00:54:56,854
The banana...

1430
00:54:56,855 --> 00:54:58,755
She said one banana would suffice.

1431
00:54:58,785 --> 00:55:00,785
I'm worried she'd get upset if I brought her two.

1432
00:55:00,855 --> 00:55:02,155
So I should eat one.

1433
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:05,555
(What a cowardly excuse.)

1434
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:07,365
The banana is cute.

1435
00:55:08,525 --> 00:55:10,394
(Chore List: 2 abalone porridges, coconut water, 2 bananas)

1436
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:13,335
(Chore List: 2 abalone porridges, coconut water, 1 banana)

1437
00:55:14,065 --> 00:55:17,434
(The manager was able to get a short alone time.)

1438
00:55:17,435 --> 00:55:18,835
The banana is really sweet.

1439
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:23,544
- Enjoy.
- Thank you so much.

1440
00:55:23,545 --> 00:55:24,614
(Chore List: 2 abalone porridges, coconut water, 1 banana)

1441
00:55:24,615 --> 00:55:26,374
- You can't catch a break at all.
- Excuse me?

1442
00:55:26,375 --> 00:55:28,244
- You can't catch a break at all.
- Exactly.

1443
00:55:28,245 --> 00:55:30,115
This is an extreme job.

1444
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:35,025
(He is returning with his hands full.)

1445
00:55:35,155 --> 00:55:36,624
- Hi.
- Hi.

1446
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,724
How are you?

1447
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:39,554
- I'm doing well. How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

1448
00:55:39,555 --> 00:55:40,794
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1449
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,695
Where are you from?

1450
00:55:42,725 --> 00:55:44,095
- The US.
- The US?

1451
00:55:44,435 --> 00:55:45,634
(Thankfully, it's a country he knows.)

1452
00:55:45,635 --> 00:55:46,694
- Hi. The US.
- Nice to meet you.

1453
00:55:46,695 --> 00:55:48,165
I love the USA.

1454
00:55:48,305 --> 00:55:50,435
Yes.

1455
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,175
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

1456
00:55:54,045 --> 00:55:56,274
My home is Busan.

1457
00:55:56,275 --> 00:55:58,315
- Busan?
- Yes.

1458
00:55:59,415 --> 00:56:00,615
Okay.

1459
00:56:01,015 --> 00:56:02,545
Can you speak Korean?

1460
00:56:03,015 --> 00:56:04,654
Can you speak Korean?

1461
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:05,984
- Excuse me?
- Can you...

1462
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:07,225
Can you speak Korean?

1463
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:08,884
- No.
- No?

1464
00:56:08,885 --> 00:56:10,154
Okay.

1465
00:56:10,155 --> 00:56:11,355
- We can't.
- Okay.

1466
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:14,494
(Laughing)

1467
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:15,524
See you.

1468
00:56:15,525 --> 00:56:16,934
(The conversation abruptly ends.)

1469
00:56:16,935 --> 00:56:18,135
Bye.

1470
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:20,094
(Fortunately, he was in front of the hotel.)

1471
00:56:20,095 --> 00:56:21,405
They don't seem...

1472
00:56:21,565 --> 00:56:24,105
to be big talkers.

1473
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:26,945
(Bye, Kwang Kyu.)

1474
00:56:27,605 --> 00:56:29,144
(Arriving at the hotel)

1475
00:56:29,145 --> 00:56:30,675
Seriously.

1476
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:33,214
(Now, for My Star, who's been waiting, )

1477
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:37,554
(I start running from just in front.)

1478
00:56:37,555 --> 00:56:38,584
(Knocking)

1479
00:56:38,585 --> 00:56:40,655
(I start running from just in front.)

1480
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:46,794
- Kwang Kyu, you called.
- Yes, I did.

1481
00:56:46,795 --> 00:56:48,064
- I didn't know.
- You know how many...

1482
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:49,924
Do you know how many times I called you?

1483
00:56:49,925 --> 00:56:51,534
- Kwang Kyu, sorry.
- I called.

1484
00:56:51,535 --> 00:56:53,634
- Why did you call so much?
- I called you a lot.

1485
00:56:53,635 --> 00:56:54,664
My phone was...

1486
00:56:54,665 --> 00:56:56,634
- It was a banana...
- Yes.

1487
00:56:56,635 --> 00:56:58,334
- Abalone porridge.
- Abalone porridge.

1488
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:00,035
- And it's coconut, right?
- Yes.

1489
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:01,445
- Coconut water.
- Isn't it this?

1490
00:57:02,575 --> 00:57:04,415
(Coco Palm)

1491
00:57:04,815 --> 00:57:05,875
This one.

1492
00:57:07,485 --> 00:57:08,644
Coconut.

1493
00:57:08,645 --> 00:57:10,085
(Shocked)

1494
00:57:11,455 --> 00:57:13,255
(Isn't it this one?)

1495
00:57:13,315 --> 00:57:15,224
No, I wasn't sure, so I bought another one.

1496
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:17,495
- Look.
- I mean, this one is...

1497
00:57:17,955 --> 00:57:19,454
(Rummaging)

1498
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:21,024
This is for kids.

1499
00:57:21,025 --> 00:57:22,194
They had this one as well.

1500
00:57:22,195 --> 00:57:23,324
Is it this one? It's this, isn't it?

1501
00:57:23,325 --> 00:57:25,365
No, it's coconut water.

1502
00:57:26,095 --> 00:57:27,335
- Water.
- Was it water?

1503
00:57:28,105 --> 00:57:30,404
Coconut water.

1504
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,875
I did get one banana.

1505
00:57:32,435 --> 00:57:34,405
- One banana.
- This one's right. You did well.

1506
00:57:34,945 --> 00:57:36,074
I bought abalone porridge as well.

1507
00:57:36,075 --> 00:57:37,114
Abalone porridge.

1508
00:57:37,115 --> 00:57:39,075
Directors, please enjoy.

1509
00:57:40,345 --> 00:57:42,044
(Seo Jin is back from his interview.)

1510
00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:43,615
I heard Kwang Kyu bought abalone porridge.

1511
00:57:43,715 --> 00:57:44,955
I did.

1512
00:57:45,685 --> 00:57:47,625
I heard she also wanted coconut water.

1513
00:57:48,655 --> 00:57:50,124
Kwang Kyu, would you like a sip?

1514
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:51,324
Doesn't it taste the same?

1515
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:52,454
I tried it a long time ago.

1516
00:57:52,455 --> 00:57:54,294
- Have you tried it?
- Coco...

1517
00:57:54,295 --> 00:57:55,625
- Yes, I did.
- You have?

1518
00:57:55,865 --> 00:57:57,835
That's why I bought it. I know how it tastes.

1519
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:02,934
You have a child's taste.

1520
00:58:02,935 --> 00:58:04,875
- You can chew on the chunks.
- Right.

1521
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:10,104
That makes no sense.

1522
00:58:10,105 --> 00:58:11,245
(A half-century-old manager with a baby's taste)

1523
00:58:11,515 --> 00:58:13,114
So, have you decided on the dress?

1524
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,915
- I did.
- Which one is it?

1525
00:58:15,445 --> 00:58:18,084
- You'll know when I come out in it.
- All right.

1526
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:19,254
(You'll know when I come out in it.)

1527
00:58:19,255 --> 00:58:20,284
This...

1528
00:58:20,285 --> 00:58:22,855
(Whose pick did My Star choose for her dress?)

1529
00:58:23,795 --> 00:58:26,425
Finally, the Busan International Film Festival...

1530
00:58:27,665 --> 00:58:30,495
(Nervous for no reason)

1531
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,534
- Finally, the Busan...
- I'm ready.

1532
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:35,065
(I'm ready.)

1533
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:40,705
- Gosh.
- She's so pretty.

1534
00:58:43,775 --> 00:58:46,745
(His dimples are wide open.)

1535
00:58:47,245 --> 00:58:49,484
(Admiring)

1536
00:58:49,485 --> 00:58:50,714
I'm ready.

1537
00:58:50,715 --> 00:58:52,484
(Dressed in a black dress, )

1538
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:56,525
(My Star makes her appearance.)

1539
00:58:58,025 --> 00:58:59,224
You should be taking a picture.

1540
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:00,825
- Not admiring.
- Right.

1541
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:03,624
You should be taking a picture.

1542
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:05,165
- Not admiring.
- Right.

1543
00:59:06,595 --> 00:59:07,864
(For a moment, he forgot his job.)

1544
00:59:07,865 --> 00:59:09,465
- Kwang Kyu.
- I mean...

1545
00:59:09,735 --> 00:59:11,204
Kwang Kyu, do your job.

1546
00:59:11,205 --> 00:59:12,505
Yes, I will.

1547
00:59:12,605 --> 00:59:15,005
- Who chose this dress?
- This one?

1548
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:16,545
What, is there something wrong with my hair?

1549
00:59:17,715 --> 00:59:19,214
Is there something wrong with my hair?

1550
00:59:19,215 --> 00:59:21,315
Why is there hair stuck here?

1551
00:59:22,915 --> 00:59:25,055
(Seo Genie's delicate care)

1552
00:59:26,155 --> 00:59:27,155
Why do you keep on...

1553
00:59:27,156 --> 00:59:29,425
filming romance?

1554
00:59:29,485 --> 00:59:30,854
If I do it, it looks like romance,

1555
00:59:30,855 --> 00:59:32,555
- and when you do it...
- What?

1556
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:34,795
Where should we take the picture?

1557
00:59:34,965 --> 00:59:36,025
Be quiet.

1558
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,495
- Let's take pictures outside.
- Outside?

1559
00:59:39,665 --> 00:59:42,164
When you come to the BIFF...

1560
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:44,435
- Here, with the sea in the picture.
- Right.

1561
00:59:45,075 --> 00:59:46,804
Kwang Kyu, you should take the picture like this.

1562
00:59:46,805 --> 00:59:48,105
- Like this?
- Yes.

1563
00:59:48,705 --> 00:59:51,644
A little here. I think you should cut that part out.

1564
00:59:51,645 --> 00:59:52,775
Should I cut out more?

1565
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,015
But then...

1566
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:56,615
Slightly change the composition.

1567
00:59:56,645 --> 00:59:58,354
Ji Won, can you take one step forward?

1568
00:59:58,355 --> 00:59:59,654
- Yes.
- This is good.

1569
00:59:59,655 --> 01:00:00,884
Okay.

1570
01:00:00,885 --> 01:00:01,925
Here?

1571
01:00:03,155 --> 01:00:04,925
Why don't you try taking the picture like this?

1572
01:00:06,025 --> 01:00:07,294
- You take it.
- No, you...

1573
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,895
- try taking the picture like this.
- Like this?

1574
01:00:08,995 --> 01:00:10,224
Yes. With this vibe.

1575
01:00:10,225 --> 01:00:11,534
Like this?

1576
01:00:11,535 --> 01:00:12,634
(Close together passionately)

1577
01:00:12,635 --> 01:00:13,734
- Like this?
- How's this?

1578
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,835
I'll take the picture.

1579
01:00:17,275 --> 01:00:19,005
You did well.

1580
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:21,305
You did a good job. Well done.

1581
01:00:22,645 --> 01:00:24,975
I'll leave a few and delete the rest.

1582
01:00:25,045 --> 01:00:26,374
We should start leaving.

1583
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,545
Do we leave now?

1584
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:28,814
- Do we get in the car?
- It's five minutes before.

1585
01:00:28,815 --> 01:00:30,445
I think we should go down now.

1586
01:00:30,615 --> 01:00:31,784
- We only have five minutes left.
- Should I get in the car?

1587
01:00:31,785 --> 01:00:33,385
I think we should go down now.

1588
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,655
Shall I get in the car?

1589
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:37,054
You should go down.

1590
01:00:37,055 --> 01:00:38,424
When is the car coming?

1591
01:00:38,425 --> 01:00:40,154
It leaves at 6pm. We should go down.

1592
01:00:40,155 --> 01:00:41,524
- We leave at 6pm?
- Yes.

1593
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:43,425
- Are we leaving?
- To get in the car they prepared.

1594
01:00:43,695 --> 01:00:45,164
We can talk while we get on the elevator.

1595
01:00:45,165 --> 01:00:47,264
When is the appearance time?

1596
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:48,434
Was it at 7pm?

1597
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:49,465
(It's time to go down to get in the car.)

1598
01:00:50,705 --> 01:00:53,504
(Meanwhile, at the hotel lobby at the same time)

1599
01:00:53,505 --> 01:00:58,015
(Special car for My Star)

1600
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,314
(Let's go to the red carpet.)

1601
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:03,645
(The serious chauffeur.)

1602
01:01:04,485 --> 01:01:07,724
(In front of the secretaries wearing jackets for the perfect ceremony)

1603
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:09,024
See? Everything is ready downstairs.

1604
01:01:09,025 --> 01:01:10,085
We're ready.

1605
01:01:10,325 --> 01:01:12,094
- The shoes are so big, - Really?

1606
01:01:12,095 --> 01:01:14,165
I had to have an insole put in.

1607
01:01:14,195 --> 01:01:16,464
(Close-fitting care next to Ji Won.)

1608
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:17,695
Why isn't there anyone?

1609
01:01:18,365 --> 01:01:19,535
Do I just get on?

1610
01:01:19,995 --> 01:01:21,735
- You can just get in the car now.
- Which one is it?

1611
01:01:21,865 --> 01:01:23,165
I can just get in the car.

1612
01:01:23,665 --> 01:01:24,804
Which one is it?

1613
01:01:24,805 --> 01:01:26,405
I think I should get on this one.

1614
01:01:26,575 --> 01:01:27,745
Shall I get in the car in front?

1615
01:01:29,075 --> 01:01:30,205
This is the one.

1616
01:01:31,715 --> 01:01:34,584
- Please.
- Thank you.

1617
01:01:34,585 --> 01:01:35,614
Yes.

1618
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,214
Then, do I go there alone?

1619
01:01:37,215 --> 01:01:38,285
No, I'm coming with you.

1620
01:01:39,055 --> 01:01:40,215
Get in the car there.

1621
01:01:44,455 --> 01:01:46,154
Then what do we do?

1622
01:01:46,155 --> 01:01:47,265
- What about?
- The...

1623
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:49,124
- The jacket...
- Yes?

1624
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:50,325
- You can take off the jacket.
- If you take it off,

1625
01:01:50,395 --> 01:01:52,165
- I'll take it with me.
- Okay.

1626
01:01:52,335 --> 01:01:54,134
- We'll leave now.
- Yes.

1627
01:01:54,135 --> 01:01:56,334
(Starting now, Seo Genie's Care that is as gentle as Hugh Grant, is on.)

1628
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:58,005
- We'll leave now.
- Yes.

1629
01:01:58,635 --> 01:02:02,145
(Let's go to the BIFF's Closing Ceremony, where red carpet awaits.)

1630
01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:03,704
- Wait, what was the car number?
- It just left.

1631
01:02:03,705 --> 01:02:05,945
It is 9421.

1632
01:02:06,115 --> 01:02:08,144
(He has to follow the car Ji Won is riding...)

1633
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:10,685
(with the staff members.)

1634
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:16,284
(Just in case, )

1635
01:02:16,285 --> 01:02:19,995
(My Star's car will be used as the waiting room.)

1636
01:02:22,895 --> 01:02:26,734
(They left right after.)

1637
01:02:26,735 --> 01:02:29,604
(Sudden stop)

1638
01:02:29,605 --> 01:02:30,835
Did they leave?

1639
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:33,004
We have to follow them.

1640
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:34,675
(The cameraman is flustered.)

1641
01:02:36,605 --> 01:02:38,474
I think the car number was 9421.

1642
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:41,945
(But however they look around, the car cannot be seen.)

1643
01:02:42,315 --> 01:02:43,514
I think they left.

1644
01:02:43,515 --> 01:02:46,685
(I think they left.)

1645
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,884
I missed the car already.

1646
01:02:49,885 --> 01:02:52,025
(I missed the car already.)

1647
01:02:52,755 --> 01:02:54,064
(The staff are also nervous.)

1648
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:55,924
I think it was 9421.

1649
01:02:55,925 --> 01:02:57,125
(The staff are also nervous.)

1650
01:02:57,195 --> 01:02:59,594
(The car left instantly while he was running.)

1651
01:02:59,595 --> 01:03:00,764
It's not that car.

1652
01:03:00,765 --> 01:03:03,835
(The greatest crisis for the Caretaker Fairy)

1653
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,875
I think I lost my mind.

1654
01:03:06,005 --> 01:03:08,045
Where should I go?

1655
01:03:08,445 --> 01:03:10,404
We should have been in the car earlier...

1656
01:03:10,405 --> 01:03:12,645
and waited behind.

1657
01:03:13,475 --> 01:03:15,984
(Meanwhile, at the BIFF's closing ceremony)

1658
01:03:15,985 --> 01:03:18,214
- You are beautiful.
- You are pretty.

1659
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:19,514
(The audience has filled up the venue.)

1660
01:03:19,515 --> 01:03:23,355
(And the red carpet waits for the stars.)

1661
01:03:23,525 --> 01:03:27,725
(In a moment's time, My Star's schedule will begin.)

1662
01:03:28,025 --> 01:03:31,135
(Meanwhile, Ji Won's car is on the move.)

1663
01:03:31,965 --> 01:03:32,965
(Sighing)

1664
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:38,234
(My Star is very quiet, perhaps because she's nervous.)

1665
01:03:38,235 --> 01:03:39,275
Who...

1666
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:41,775
- Can you search who is coming?
- I'll take a look.

1667
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:44,644
- When does it start? 6pm?
- It starts at 6pm.

1668
01:03:44,645 --> 01:03:46,474
So don't you think someone would get off?

1669
01:03:46,475 --> 01:03:47,944
(It starts at 6pm, so wouldn't someone get off?)

1670
01:03:47,945 --> 01:03:49,345
People are arriving one by one.

1671
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:53,555
(Nervous)

1672
01:03:53,915 --> 01:03:57,284
(Reading the mood)

1673
01:03:57,285 --> 01:03:59,395
- When you arrive...
- Yes?

1674
01:04:00,325 --> 01:04:02,095
(She can hear everything.)

1675
01:04:02,225 --> 01:04:03,964
- What do I do? Do I get off alone?
- I...

1676
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,965
(She is impatient.)

1677
01:04:05,635 --> 01:04:07,805
- I'll get off and open the door.
- Yes?

1678
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:10,405
- Will you open the door for me?
- I'll open the door, and...

1679
01:04:10,835 --> 01:04:13,874
(He tells his sweet plans to My star who is nervous.)

1680
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,504
I'll hold your hand when you get off.

1681
01:04:15,505 --> 01:04:17,414
- Will you walk with me?
- No, I won't walk with you.

1682
01:04:17,415 --> 01:04:19,345
- I'll get back into the car.
- You liar.

1683
01:04:19,415 --> 01:04:21,244
I should get back in the car and leave.

1684
01:04:21,245 --> 01:04:23,544
I can't go in. I'm not allowed.

1685
01:04:23,545 --> 01:04:24,554
(He can't be on the red carpet because he's the manager today.)

1686
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:28,124
So you could drop me off at the pick-up area.

1687
01:04:28,125 --> 01:04:31,224
That's so funny. You'll open the door and help me off?

1688
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:32,554
(My Star found her smile again with a cute escort plan.)

1689
01:04:32,555 --> 01:04:34,664
- That should be the pick-up area.
- The one next to the pick-up area.

1690
01:04:34,665 --> 01:04:36,625
Yes. Behind it.

1691
01:04:37,095 --> 01:04:38,864
We're not actors. We're managers.

1692
01:04:38,865 --> 01:04:40,664
- Yes, you are a manager today.
- I'm a manager.

1693
01:04:40,665 --> 01:04:43,304
- Director Lee.
- I can't go anywhere.

1694
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:44,474
Director.

1695
01:04:44,475 --> 01:04:45,475
(Thank you, Seo Grant.)

1696
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:47,334
That is strange.

1697
01:04:47,335 --> 01:04:49,845
Then, what is Kwang Kyu doing?

1698
01:04:51,115 --> 01:04:52,644
(Sighing)

1699
01:04:52,645 --> 01:04:53,875
Suddenly missing...

1700
01:04:54,615 --> 01:04:55,915
the car...

1701
01:04:56,615 --> 01:04:58,085
My confidence plummeted.

1702
01:04:59,285 --> 01:05:01,285
(Restless)

1703
01:05:01,885 --> 01:05:03,525
There's a traffic jam already.

1704
01:05:05,525 --> 01:05:07,524
(With the evening rush hour, the cars cannot move on the road.)

1705
01:05:07,525 --> 01:05:08,625
Oh, gosh.

1706
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:11,294
The traffic is so bad.

1707
01:05:11,295 --> 01:05:13,095
(The gap is too big to catch up.)

1708
01:05:13,265 --> 01:05:16,965
(Eventually, he is calling Seo Jin.)

1709
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:18,774
Hello?

1710
01:05:18,775 --> 01:05:19,905
Seo Jin, where are you about?

1711
01:05:20,775 --> 01:05:23,204
I asked the chauffeur to go slowly,

1712
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:24,745
but I couldn't find him.

1713
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:28,284
(They are listening to the story about how he missed the car.)

1714
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:30,044
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1715
01:05:30,045 --> 01:05:31,814
(The closing ceremony is starting soon, )

1716
01:05:31,815 --> 01:05:34,824
(and the supporting staff...)

1717
01:05:34,825 --> 01:05:37,155
(and her van won't be there.)

1718
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:40,124
(This is a situation requiring crisis management skills.)

1719
01:05:40,125 --> 01:05:41,425
Anyway, Kwang Kyu...

1720
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:44,594
If there isn't anyone who can do retouching,

1721
01:05:44,595 --> 01:05:46,395
is there a reason for going together?

1722
01:05:47,265 --> 01:05:49,164
We have no reason to go together.

1723
01:05:49,165 --> 01:05:51,174
- Is that so?
- So, we'll just go first.

1724
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:52,504
The traffic is really bad.

1725
01:05:52,505 --> 01:05:53,674
(The traffic is bad, so don't force yourself to meet up.)

1726
01:05:53,675 --> 01:05:56,844
I think we're going to be late, so we should just go.

1727
01:05:56,845 --> 01:06:00,815
Okay. Then we'll just go to the pick-up area.

1728
01:06:01,115 --> 01:06:02,115
Okay.

1729
01:06:03,485 --> 01:06:06,014
(He did the research and made good plans.)

1730
01:06:06,015 --> 01:06:07,015
(Sighing)

1731
01:06:08,825 --> 01:06:12,155
(He has a heavy heart for not being much of a help.)

1732
01:06:12,725 --> 01:06:15,664
I was very embarrassed.

1733
01:06:15,665 --> 01:06:17,465
I thought, "What am I doing here?"

1734
01:06:17,795 --> 01:06:19,535
I even thought,

1735
01:06:20,165 --> 01:06:21,804
"Was I this flustered?"

1736
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:24,275
But I had sweat trickle down my back.

1737
01:06:24,935 --> 01:06:26,004
(Meanwhile, at the BIFF's closing ceremony)

1738
01:06:26,005 --> 01:06:28,344
We will begin the red carpet event for the closing ceremony...

1739
01:06:28,345 --> 01:06:31,144
of the 30th Busan International Film Festival.

1740
01:06:31,145 --> 01:06:32,145
(The red carpet event began.)

1741
01:06:32,315 --> 01:06:36,345
(Soo Hyun, the MC of the closing ceremony)

1742
01:06:36,585 --> 01:06:40,085
(Lee Jin Uk, Suzy)

1743
01:06:40,215 --> 01:06:44,555
(Taiwanese actress and director, Shu Qi)

1744
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:51,765
(The red carpet heats up with the appearance of the stars.)

1745
01:06:51,965 --> 01:06:53,435
- Please look over here.
- Over here.

1746
01:06:54,935 --> 01:06:56,764
(Meanwhile, Ji Won and Seo Jin are in front of the red carpet.)

1747
01:06:56,765 --> 01:06:59,175
There's the stage. What do I do?

1748
01:07:02,545 --> 01:07:05,444
(Checking her look for the final time)

1749
01:07:05,445 --> 01:07:06,875
- Do you need to reapply the lips?
- No.

1750
01:07:10,815 --> 01:07:13,354
(Seo Jin also puts on his confidence.)

1751
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:14,525
That's so funny.

1752
01:07:15,385 --> 01:07:16,654
(My Star's voice got high pitched as she seems to be nervous.)

1753
01:07:16,655 --> 01:07:19,295
I think someone got in, from the noise I hear.

1754
01:07:19,455 --> 01:07:20,525
This...

1755
01:07:21,965 --> 01:07:23,324
This kind of red carpet event is a first for me.

1756
01:07:23,325 --> 01:07:24,665
This must be the red carpet.

1757
01:07:25,335 --> 01:07:26,695
I should not fall.

1758
01:07:28,565 --> 01:07:30,664
(The closing ceremony venue is in sight.)

1759
01:07:30,665 --> 01:07:32,204
Are there people there?

1760
01:07:32,205 --> 01:07:33,435
- Are there people there?
- There are a lot on both sides.

1761
01:07:34,275 --> 01:07:35,744
(Visible from outside the window)

1762
01:07:35,745 --> 01:07:38,545
(The crowd visible from outside the window)

1763
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:42,985
(The 30th BIFF Closing Ceremony is filled with cheers.)

1764
01:07:43,145 --> 01:07:44,954
(Now, )

1765
01:07:44,955 --> 01:07:47,254
(among the numerous stars, )

1766
01:07:47,255 --> 01:07:52,195
(My Star will shine the night of the BIFF beautifully.)

1767
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:55,624
(Ji Won and Seo Jin arrive at the red carpet.)

1768
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,664
I'm so embarrassed.

1769
01:07:56,665 --> 01:07:59,434
Seo Jin, what do I do? I'm so embarrassed.

1770
01:07:59,435 --> 01:08:00,534
What about me?

1771
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,564
(What about me?)

1772
01:08:01,565 --> 01:08:02,605
(Flinging the door open)

1773
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:03,865
What about me?

1774
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,275
(Why is Lee Seo Jin getting out from there?)

1775
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:15,315
Ji Won, walk well.

1776
01:08:16,815 --> 01:08:17,985
I'll be waiting.

1777
01:08:22,225 --> 01:08:24,054
(I'll be waiting.)

1778
01:08:24,055 --> 01:08:25,154
Walk in carefully.

1779
01:08:25,155 --> 01:08:27,494
(I'll be waiting, so walk in carefully.)

1780
01:08:27,495 --> 01:08:32,635
(He held the hand of My Star who was nervous.)

1781
01:08:33,165 --> 01:08:35,905
(So sweet)

1782
01:08:36,305 --> 01:08:40,104
(My Star smiles brightly.)

1783
01:08:40,105 --> 01:08:44,514
(Walking lightly on the red carpet in an elegant black dress)

1784
01:08:44,515 --> 01:08:45,715
She's so pretty.

1785
01:08:46,715 --> 01:08:51,015
(Contrary to her worries, she walks confidently.)

1786
01:08:52,415 --> 01:08:54,054
(My Star Um Ji Won shone the most among the many stars.)

1787
01:08:54,055 --> 01:08:55,285
Can you look over here, please?

1788
01:08:58,355 --> 01:09:00,254
- Yes, I'm getting back in.
- Is this that TV show?

1789
01:09:00,255 --> 01:09:01,995
(Seo Genie makes an exit after shining the light.)

1790
01:09:03,665 --> 01:09:06,894
(Is she doing well?)

1791
01:09:06,895 --> 01:09:11,605
(He looked at Ji Won until he couldn't.)

1792
01:09:12,805 --> 01:09:15,475
(He leaves his confident down for a bit.)

1793
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:17,775
Shall we just go to the exit area?

1794
01:09:19,715 --> 01:09:24,215
(He heads to the meeting place quietly, as if lost in thought.)

1795
01:09:25,515 --> 01:09:26,515
(Kwang Kyu finally arrives at the exit area.)

1796
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:27,855
I'll park here.

1797
01:09:30,225 --> 01:09:34,095
(Fortunately, he is taking the first spot in the exit area.)

1798
01:09:34,995 --> 01:09:38,695
(Glancing to see if there is any competition.)

1799
01:09:38,735 --> 01:09:42,034
In fact, the most important thing is the pick-up area.

1800
01:09:42,035 --> 01:09:43,764
Until Ji Won comes out,

1801
01:09:43,765 --> 01:09:46,675
I need to stay put even if the security tells me to move.

1802
01:09:47,235 --> 01:09:48,304
"I can't leave."

1803
01:09:48,305 --> 01:09:50,905
"Please wait for a bit."

1804
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,814
You have to do this kind of thing well.

1805
01:09:52,815 --> 01:09:55,514
I don't know how long I can hold down.

1806
01:09:55,515 --> 01:09:58,084
But I'll stay put as long as I can...

1807
01:09:58,085 --> 01:10:00,215
so that Ji Won won't be uncomfortable.

1808
01:10:01,015 --> 01:10:02,284
Busan International Film Festival.

1809
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,085
(He is planning to watch the BIFF while waiting.)

1810
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,194
Thank you.

1811
01:10:06,195 --> 01:10:09,565
(Seo Jin arrives in the meantime.)

1812
01:10:11,595 --> 01:10:14,504
Are we just waiting here?

1813
01:10:14,505 --> 01:10:18,635
(They would have to wait for Ji Won in the car.)

1814
01:10:18,975 --> 01:10:20,674
That is Shu Qi, Kwang Kyu. That lady.

1815
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:21,705
- Just now?
- Yes.

1816
01:10:23,205 --> 01:10:24,845
I was confused earlier.

1817
01:10:25,015 --> 01:10:29,084
(The photo wall is taking place on one side.)

1818
01:10:29,085 --> 01:10:33,384
(The Asian star Shu Qi, who once stirred Kwang Kyu's heart)

1819
01:10:33,385 --> 01:10:34,385
(Amazed)

1820
01:10:36,085 --> 01:10:38,095
Shu Qi's age...

1821
01:10:38,895 --> 01:10:40,155
Why do you like her so much?

1822
01:10:40,225 --> 01:10:43,595
After all these years, she's still beautiful.

1823
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:46,834
(After a while)

1824
01:10:46,835 --> 01:10:49,364
Ms. Suzy and Mr. Lee Jin Uk...

1825
01:10:49,365 --> 01:10:51,134
- It was Suzy and Jin Uk.
- Ms. Suzy and Mr. Lee Jin Uk...

1826
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,135
(Suzy and Lee Jin Uk are walking in to the photo wall area.)

1827
01:10:52,136 --> 01:10:54,004
are entering together.

1828
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:56,144
Please welcome them with a round of applause.

1829
01:10:56,145 --> 01:10:57,505
It was Jin Uk and Suzy.

1830
01:10:58,145 --> 01:10:59,974
Did Suzy and Jin Uk film something together?

1831
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:01,015
They must have.

1832
01:11:01,385 --> 01:11:03,484
Um Ji Won hasn't walked in yet?

1833
01:11:03,485 --> 01:11:04,485
No, she didn't.

1834
01:11:05,355 --> 01:11:07,215
She must be awkward alone.

1835
01:11:07,355 --> 01:11:09,285
Why didn't you go with her?

1836
01:11:09,725 --> 01:11:12,025
I can't. Didn't you listen earlier?

1837
01:11:12,595 --> 01:11:14,225
They say I can't go in.

1838
01:11:14,865 --> 01:11:16,494
But going in alone...

1839
01:11:16,495 --> 01:11:17,895
(He is worried about his My Star day and night.)

1840
01:11:18,435 --> 01:11:21,264
Actress Um Ji Won is entering.

1841
01:11:21,265 --> 01:11:23,035
- Please give her a warm welcome.
- Ji Won...

1842
01:11:23,635 --> 01:11:28,704
(Finally, it's My Star's turn, which he's been waiting for.)

1843
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:30,504
(For fans)

1844
01:11:30,505 --> 01:11:31,775
My Star.

1845
01:11:33,715 --> 01:11:36,114
(My Star lights up the photo wall with a relaxed smile.)

1846
01:11:36,115 --> 01:11:37,315
You are so pretty.

1847
01:11:42,525 --> 01:11:44,725
(Shout out to Star Um.)

1848
01:11:45,155 --> 01:11:47,054
She has a confident stride.

1849
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:48,164
(Watching it enthusiastically)

1850
01:11:48,165 --> 01:11:49,695
(Proud dimples in the dark)

1851
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:51,234
She's so pretty.

1852
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:53,064
(My Star, full of coolness, ends the pre-event successfully.)

1853
01:11:53,065 --> 01:11:54,335
Slowly.

1854
01:11:56,405 --> 01:11:57,604
(After a while)

1855
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:59,505
Ji Won is calling.

1856
01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:00,735
Yes, My Star.

1857
01:12:01,345 --> 01:12:02,345
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

1858
01:12:02,346 --> 01:12:03,474
Did you make it well?

1859
01:12:03,475 --> 01:12:06,575
I'm on stand-by at the pick-up area.

1860
01:12:06,945 --> 01:12:08,314
- Are you?
- Yes.

1861
01:12:08,315 --> 01:12:09,315
Okay.

1862
01:12:09,316 --> 01:12:11,144
I have secured the exit route.

1863
01:12:11,145 --> 01:12:13,585
- You have secured the exit route?
- Yes.

1864
01:12:13,715 --> 01:12:15,484
- All right.
- Okay.

1865
01:12:15,485 --> 01:12:17,894
Have a good time.

1866
01:12:17,895 --> 01:12:20,024
- I will.
- Okay.

1867
01:12:20,025 --> 01:12:21,825
Don't fall.

1868
01:12:21,965 --> 01:12:25,395
- Okay. I won't fall.
- Okay.

1869
01:12:25,635 --> 01:12:26,694
Bye.

1870
01:12:26,695 --> 01:12:29,765
(A short phone call with Ji Won ends.)

1871
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:33,205
The last story of the 30th Busan International Film Festival...

1872
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:34,575
begins.

1873
01:12:35,805 --> 01:12:38,445
The first story begins with youth.

1874
01:12:38,915 --> 01:12:40,015
The Sonje Award.

1875
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:42,385
It's after this. It's after the Sonje Award.

1876
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:43,614
- Is it?
- Yes.

1877
01:12:43,615 --> 01:12:44,685
So soon?

1878
01:12:44,755 --> 01:12:49,355
The BIFF MECENAT Award is after the Sonje Award.

1879
01:12:50,485 --> 01:12:52,495
Then we should be on stand-by.

1880
01:12:53,955 --> 01:12:57,065
(He quickly puts on his seatbelt.)

1881
01:12:58,795 --> 01:13:01,965
Next is the BIFF MECENAT Award.

1882
01:13:02,265 --> 01:13:04,064
- MECENAT Award.
- This is it.

1883
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:05,535
BIFF MECENAT Award.

1884
01:13:05,735 --> 01:13:07,904
(My Star is about to make her appearance.)

1885
01:13:07,905 --> 01:13:11,515
We will invite Judge Kim Mi Re and Actress Um Ji Won to the stage.

1886
01:13:12,115 --> 01:13:14,015
They are giving the award together.

1887
01:13:14,145 --> 01:13:15,145
She's not doing it alone.

1888
01:13:16,015 --> 01:13:19,554
Actress Um Ji Won would think that the influence...

1889
01:13:19,555 --> 01:13:22,124
of documentaries on our society is big.

1890
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:23,485
Could you share your thoughts?

1891
01:13:24,855 --> 01:13:29,464
I would like to send my support and applause to the directors,

1892
01:13:29,465 --> 01:13:32,264
who, through documentaries, have been working...

1893
01:13:32,265 --> 01:13:35,504
on such projects by revealing the dark side of society...

1894
01:13:35,505 --> 01:13:39,375
through their own perspectives.

1895
01:13:40,775 --> 01:13:42,275
My Star speaks well.

1896
01:13:43,305 --> 01:13:44,445
She'll be coming out now, won't she?

1897
01:13:44,605 --> 01:13:46,245
- She'll be coming out.
- She'll be coming out.

1898
01:13:48,415 --> 01:13:49,415
(Opening the door again)

1899
01:13:51,045 --> 01:13:55,755
(Seo Jin suddenly gets out of the car to escort My Star.)

1900
01:13:56,825 --> 01:14:00,095
(He takes a jacket in case My Star feels cold.)

1901
01:14:00,355 --> 01:14:01,724
(With an indifferent expression, )

1902
01:14:01,725 --> 01:14:04,735
(he hurries his steps.)

1903
01:14:05,565 --> 01:14:07,734
(He heads straight forward...)

1904
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,404
(and arrives at the backstage.)

1905
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:14,435
(He marches over to escort her.)

1906
01:14:14,605 --> 01:14:18,344
(He waits right below the stage.)

1907
01:14:18,345 --> 01:14:21,585
(They're standing really close to each other.)

1908
01:14:21,985 --> 01:14:24,545
(He's right next to him, but she doesn't notice.)

1909
01:14:28,325 --> 01:14:29,554
Will you be going up on the stage?

1910
01:14:29,555 --> 01:14:33,524
- I'll be going up.
- When you go up, could you...

1911
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:36,195
tell Um Ji Won to come this way?

1912
01:14:36,925 --> 01:14:41,135
(He acts smart so he can pick her up right after presenting the award.)

1913
01:14:42,535 --> 01:14:44,834
(Meanwhile, Kwang Kyu also heads toward My Star...)

1914
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:46,735
(after parking the car.)

1915
01:14:49,675 --> 01:14:53,645
(The benefit of a site visit: You get a good sense of direction.)

1916
01:14:57,345 --> 01:14:58,384
You're here.

1917
01:14:58,385 --> 01:15:00,415
- Did you park the car here?
- I did.

1918
01:15:01,885 --> 01:15:05,825
(They stand next to each other...)

1919
01:15:06,055 --> 01:15:10,325
(and look at My Star.)

1920
01:15:11,195 --> 01:15:15,465
(The award presentation is almost over.)

1921
01:15:17,465 --> 01:15:20,234
I would like to express my special gratitude to them.

1922
01:15:20,235 --> 01:15:21,404
(With a touching acceptance speech, )

1923
01:15:21,405 --> 01:15:22,605
(the BIFF MECENAT Award presentation concludes.)

1924
01:15:25,015 --> 01:15:28,585
(The only thing left now is to take her home.)

1925
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,785
(Sending signals)

1926
01:15:33,955 --> 01:15:37,085
(She smiles as soon as she sees the Grumpy Secretary.)

1927
01:15:40,455 --> 01:15:42,625
(The steps are somewhat steep.)

1928
01:15:42,865 --> 01:15:45,895
(He quickly escorts her.)

1929
01:15:47,735 --> 01:15:49,405
How did you come here?

1930
01:15:50,565 --> 01:15:52,004
(My Star shouldn't catch a cold!)

1931
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:53,405
- How did you come here?
- What?

1932
01:15:53,735 --> 01:15:54,975
I don't have anyone to meet.

1933
01:15:55,145 --> 01:15:57,375
- How did you come here?
- Your heels are amazing.

1934
01:15:58,045 --> 01:15:59,414
Your heels are so high.

1935
01:15:59,415 --> 01:16:01,315
You have to watch where you're going.

1936
01:16:01,585 --> 01:16:03,585
Be careful.

1937
01:16:05,155 --> 01:16:07,214
(The award presentation is over.)

1938
01:16:07,215 --> 01:16:08,654
(Thanks to the site visit, they safely escorted her to the exit.)

1939
01:16:08,655 --> 01:16:11,495
Well done! It's over now.

1940
01:16:12,255 --> 01:16:13,425
Where are we going?

1941
01:16:13,955 --> 01:16:15,624
- To the restaurant.
- Restaurant.

1942
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:17,494
- To the restaurant.
- Yes.

1943
01:16:17,495 --> 01:16:19,135
- All right.
- It was very...

1944
01:16:19,895 --> 01:16:22,204
- How was it?
- touching. I really liked it.

1945
01:16:22,205 --> 01:16:23,935
You liked it? What did you like?

1946
01:16:24,365 --> 01:16:27,405
I was very touched. It was touching.

1947
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,244
I was leaving since it ended,

1948
01:16:30,245 --> 01:16:33,344
and I found Seo Jin...

1949
01:16:33,345 --> 01:16:36,414
right in front of the steps.

1950
01:16:36,415 --> 01:16:39,354
It was really like...

1951
01:16:39,355 --> 01:16:41,624
There were so many people,

1952
01:16:41,625 --> 01:16:45,154
but it was as if only Seo Jin was under the spotlight.

1953
01:16:45,155 --> 01:16:47,725
There were so many people there, but I could see him so well.

1954
01:16:48,095 --> 01:16:51,935
When I spotted him, it felt like a movie.

1955
01:16:52,435 --> 01:16:55,064
That feeling...

1956
01:16:55,065 --> 01:16:56,604
(It felt like her supporter was waiting down the stage.)

1957
01:16:56,605 --> 01:16:58,975
I was very grateful.

1958
01:17:00,305 --> 01:17:02,674
- I was...
- He's putting in effort.

1959
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:05,015
I took a photo with Juliette Binoche!

1960
01:17:05,415 --> 01:17:08,414
- You took a photo?
- I took a photo!

1961
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,114
You took a photo with whom?

1962
01:17:10,115 --> 01:17:12,454
- Juliette Binoche.
- Who is she?

1963
01:17:12,455 --> 01:17:14,185
- Earlier...
- You don't know Juliette Binoche?

1964
01:17:15,285 --> 01:17:17,824
- "The Lovers on the Bridge." - Really?

1965
01:17:17,825 --> 01:17:18,854
(I see.)

1966
01:17:18,855 --> 01:17:21,524
She's the person from "The Lovers on the Bridge?"

1967
01:17:21,525 --> 01:17:22,625
That's right.

1968
01:17:23,795 --> 01:17:25,764
(The main character of "The Lovers on the Bridge,")

1969
01:17:25,765 --> 01:17:28,335
(the essence of French romantic cinema.)

1970
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:30,264
(She won the Best Actress Award at Cannes, Berlin, and Venice, )

1971
01:17:30,265 --> 01:17:34,035
(the three top international film festivals.)

1972
01:17:34,675 --> 01:17:37,745
(France's beloved actress, Juliette Binoche)

1973
01:17:38,145 --> 01:17:40,614
(She took a photo with her while waiting for her turn.)

1974
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,315
I took a photo with her. Look at this.

1975
01:17:42,385 --> 01:17:43,414
(Exclaiming)

1976
01:17:43,415 --> 01:17:44,444
(Exclaiming)

1977
01:17:44,445 --> 01:17:47,214
Why are they reacting like that...

1978
01:17:47,215 --> 01:17:48,825
when I told them I took a photo with Juliette Binoche?

1979
01:17:49,585 --> 01:17:50,724
(Grumpy Secretary isn't good at reacting.)

1980
01:17:50,725 --> 01:17:52,795
That's because he doesn't know who Juliette Binoche is.

1981
01:17:53,595 --> 01:17:55,164
- Is she French?
- Yes.

1982
01:17:55,165 --> 01:17:57,165
She's France's beloved actress.

1983
01:17:57,995 --> 01:18:00,364
- I'm sorry.
- Right.

1984
01:18:00,365 --> 01:18:01,664
It's really...

1985
01:18:01,665 --> 01:18:03,405
The questions...

1986
01:18:03,865 --> 01:18:06,735
Why didn't you tell me that there were going to be questions?

1987
01:18:08,945 --> 01:18:11,005
- There were questions?
- We didn't get the script.

1988
01:18:11,245 --> 01:18:13,174
This is what they said.

1989
01:18:13,175 --> 01:18:14,575
I went backstage. They said,

1990
01:18:14,745 --> 01:18:17,144
"You heard the question, right?"

1991
01:18:17,145 --> 01:18:18,815
I said, "What question?"

1992
01:18:19,015 --> 01:18:22,624
"We communicated it to everyone." "What question?"

1993
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:25,155
They didn't tell us.

1994
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:27,794
I said, "I don't know," and they said, "What?"

1995
01:18:27,795 --> 01:18:29,895
They told me to go to the stage. So I just went.

1996
01:18:30,895 --> 01:18:32,635
It looked natural. It didn't seem like you memorized it.

1997
01:18:33,165 --> 01:18:35,364
I don't even remember what I said.

1998
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:37,105
- You spoke well.
- You did so well.

1999
01:18:37,565 --> 01:18:39,605
You said you were sending cheers and applause.

2000
01:18:39,705 --> 01:18:41,175
I clapped as well.

2001
01:18:42,245 --> 01:18:45,445
(My Star regained her smile.)

2002
01:18:47,715 --> 01:18:49,914
(Looking around)

2003
01:18:49,915 --> 01:18:51,284
Where's my water?

2004
01:18:51,285 --> 01:18:53,115
Why didn't you prepare water?

2005
01:18:53,815 --> 01:18:54,984
- Where's my water?
- There's no water?

2006
01:18:54,985 --> 01:18:56,955
Why is there no water in the car?

2007
01:18:57,025 --> 01:18:59,295
I didn't come in this car.

2008
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:01,525
We'll be at the restaurant soon.

2009
01:19:01,795 --> 01:19:03,195
Please wait a little bit.

2010
01:19:03,425 --> 01:19:04,625
- All right.
- Yes.

2011
01:19:05,035 --> 01:19:06,934
There should be water in the car.

2012
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:08,364
You should take care of such things.

2013
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:09,904
Goodness. Water.

2014
01:19:09,905 --> 01:19:11,004
Why didn't you take care of that?

2015
01:19:11,005 --> 01:19:13,905
- Goodness.
- The bottle should be placed here.

2016
01:19:14,935 --> 01:19:16,045
If I came in this car,

2017
01:19:16,445 --> 01:19:18,105
there would be boxes of water bottles here.

2018
01:19:19,815 --> 01:19:22,285
I didn't check the back seat.

2019
01:19:23,115 --> 01:19:25,884
You were focused on driving, right?

2020
01:19:25,885 --> 01:19:26,885
Yes.

2021
01:19:27,015 --> 01:19:31,154
Your hair looked so beautiful and silky on screen.

2022
01:19:31,155 --> 01:19:32,525
- It's the straightening perm.
- Straightening perm?

2023
01:19:32,755 --> 01:19:34,724
I straightened my hair with a perm.

2024
01:19:34,725 --> 01:19:35,824
It was so silky.

2025
01:19:35,825 --> 01:19:37,025
I thought you were Cleopatra.

2026
01:19:37,665 --> 01:19:38,695
(Smiling)

2027
01:19:39,965 --> 01:19:42,165
You're trying to make up for not placing the water with that.

2028
01:19:42,735 --> 01:19:44,465
(He got caught.)

2029
01:19:44,635 --> 01:19:45,874
- Hey.
- It did look nice.

2030
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:47,504
- That goes the same for you.
- But...

2031
01:19:47,505 --> 01:19:49,074
- It really looked beautiful.
- it looked nice.

2032
01:19:49,075 --> 01:19:51,715
(They arrived at the dinner venue while quarrelling.)

2033
01:19:52,945 --> 01:19:54,845
It's my first time coming here in all my days living in Busan.

2034
01:19:58,215 --> 01:19:59,915
(Looking around)

2035
01:20:02,055 --> 01:20:04,024
(He notices someone.)

2036
01:20:04,025 --> 01:20:05,754
I hear she's a famous actress in France.

2037
01:20:05,755 --> 01:20:07,255
Yes. She's...

2038
01:20:07,755 --> 01:20:09,064
(Thinking)

2039
01:20:09,065 --> 01:20:11,734
She's Juliette Binoche.

2040
01:20:11,735 --> 01:20:14,265
- The famous actress in France.
- Yes. In France.

2041
01:20:14,435 --> 01:20:17,404
She's the famous actress.

2042
01:20:17,405 --> 01:20:19,635
Really? Juliette Binoche.

2043
01:20:19,935 --> 01:20:21,674
- She'd be happy if you greeted her.
- Right.

2044
01:20:21,675 --> 01:20:22,874
- Really?
- Really?

2045
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:24,705
- She'd be happy.
- Really?

2046
01:20:25,075 --> 01:20:27,715
Let's all take a photo with Juliette Binoche.

2047
01:20:28,145 --> 01:20:29,945
Are you good at French?

2048
01:20:30,315 --> 01:20:31,544
- French?
- Are you good at French?

2049
01:20:31,545 --> 01:20:32,755
I can't speak French.

2050
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:37,655
(They're on their way to meet My Star's star.)

2051
01:20:39,455 --> 01:20:40,594
Hello.

2052
01:20:40,595 --> 01:20:41,995
(Greeting shyly)

2053
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:47,794
We took a photo.

2054
01:20:47,795 --> 01:20:49,165
Yes. Of course.

2055
01:20:49,735 --> 01:20:53,604
He's one of the famous actors in Korea.

2056
01:20:53,605 --> 01:20:55,144
- Hello.
- Kwang Kyu. Good evening.

2057
01:20:55,145 --> 01:20:56,504
- Good evening. Nice to meet you.
- Good evening.

2058
01:20:56,505 --> 01:20:57,505
(Nice to meet you.)

2059
01:20:59,645 --> 01:21:01,344
Nice to meet you.

2060
01:21:01,345 --> 01:21:03,714
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

2061
01:21:03,715 --> 01:21:06,115
- Nice to meet you.
- Take a seat.

2062
01:21:07,485 --> 01:21:09,124
(He's very nervous.)

2063
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:10,855
Yes.

2064
01:21:12,055 --> 01:21:14,155
- Come.
- Come.

2065
01:21:16,695 --> 01:21:17,894
(Photo time)

2066
01:21:17,895 --> 01:21:19,865
One, two, three.

2067
01:21:19,965 --> 01:21:21,594
One, two, three.

2068
01:21:21,595 --> 01:21:22,805
- Merci.
- Merci.

2069
01:21:22,935 --> 01:21:25,004
(A photo with the star of My Star)

2070
01:21:25,005 --> 01:21:26,735
Thank you.

2071
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:29,674
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2072
01:21:29,675 --> 01:21:30,944
Bye. Thank you.

2073
01:21:30,945 --> 01:21:32,744
Goodbye.

2074
01:21:32,745 --> 01:21:34,215
Call me.

2075
01:21:34,615 --> 01:21:35,715
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

2076
01:21:36,385 --> 01:21:38,114
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2077
01:21:38,115 --> 01:21:39,385
"The Lovers on the Bridge."

2078
01:21:39,785 --> 01:21:42,425
(Am I dreaming?)

2079
01:21:44,585 --> 01:21:47,295
"The Lovers on the Bridge." What am I going to do?

2080
01:21:48,795 --> 01:21:51,024
(She's in her best mood.)

2081
01:21:51,025 --> 01:21:53,634
- She hasn't paid yet, right?
- She hasn't.

2082
01:21:53,635 --> 01:21:54,834
I'll pay.

2083
01:21:54,835 --> 01:21:55,965
Thank you.

2084
01:21:56,565 --> 01:21:58,774
(He bought Juliette Binoche a meal.)

2085
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:00,074
Kwang Kyu. Did you meet her well?

2086
01:22:00,075 --> 01:22:01,604
I did.

2087
01:22:01,605 --> 01:22:02,605
- Did you do well?
- I did.

2088
01:22:02,606 --> 01:22:04,044
We took a photo.

2089
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:06,044
She was very kind.

2090
01:22:06,045 --> 01:22:07,574
She was cool.

2091
01:22:07,575 --> 01:22:09,714
Her charisma.

2092
01:22:09,715 --> 01:22:11,585
She was very charismatic.

2093
01:22:11,915 --> 01:22:13,954
- Are you happy?
- I'm so happy.

2094
01:22:13,955 --> 01:22:14,985
I'm also happy.

2095
01:22:16,425 --> 01:22:17,854
You can brag about it until the day you die.

2096
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:20,294
He's someone who bought Juliette Binoche a meal.

2097
01:22:20,295 --> 01:22:21,424
That's right.

2098
01:22:21,425 --> 01:22:22,664
Welcome to Korea.

2099
01:22:22,665 --> 01:22:23,695
(Sniffing)

2100
01:22:23,865 --> 01:22:24,865
- Okay.
- Does he smell bad?

2101
01:22:24,866 --> 01:22:26,565
I hope he didn't smell bad.

2102
01:22:29,765 --> 01:22:30,964
(He's hurt.)

2103
01:22:30,965 --> 01:22:33,205
Ji Won. Is that how it is between us?

2104
01:22:33,305 --> 01:22:35,604
We've known each other for 22 years.

2105
01:22:35,605 --> 01:22:36,704
Is that how it is?

2106
01:22:36,705 --> 01:22:39,545
- That's not what I meant.
- She was concerned for you.

2107
01:22:39,815 --> 01:22:43,544
You don't smell nice, but you don't smell bad either.

2108
01:22:43,545 --> 01:22:45,785
(The real story of a star only heard after assisting them)

2109
01:22:49,085 --> 01:22:50,654
(He calms himself by drinking cold water.)

2110
01:22:50,655 --> 01:22:53,254
- Well done!
- Well done!

2111
01:22:53,255 --> 01:22:54,955
Well done.

2112
01:22:55,995 --> 01:22:57,365
Well done.

2113
01:22:57,695 --> 01:22:58,764
Well done.

2114
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:00,964
Your speech was nice, and your dress looked nice.

2115
01:23:00,965 --> 01:23:02,035
They were nice.

2116
01:23:02,465 --> 01:23:04,035
(She eats a cucumber first.)

2117
01:23:04,305 --> 01:23:05,435
I'm tired now.

2118
01:23:06,035 --> 01:23:07,735
My energy was drained.

2119
01:23:08,605 --> 01:23:10,945
- Are you not hungry?
- I should eat now.

2120
01:23:11,545 --> 01:23:13,274
- Wasn't the banana tasty?
- It was tasty.

2121
01:23:13,275 --> 01:23:14,875
The small banana...

2122
01:23:15,945 --> 01:23:17,414
Why? Was it expensive?

2123
01:23:17,415 --> 01:23:18,585
Earlier...

2124
01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:20,154
Did you eat one?

2125
01:23:20,155 --> 01:23:21,355
I ate one.

2126
01:23:22,025 --> 01:23:23,984
I ate one, and it was really tasty.

2127
01:23:23,985 --> 01:23:25,454
- It was the best banana...
- That was why your belly was big.

2128
01:23:25,455 --> 01:23:26,924
I've eaten recently.

2129
01:23:26,925 --> 01:23:28,125
(Glancing)

2130
01:23:28,625 --> 01:23:29,865
Did you even eat lunch?

2131
01:23:31,395 --> 01:23:32,395
Did you eat lunch?

2132
01:23:32,395 --> 01:23:33,395
(Did you eat lunch without me?)

2133
01:23:33,396 --> 01:23:34,495
No.

2134
01:23:34,895 --> 01:23:36,905
- I didn't eat.
- I...

2135
01:23:36,965 --> 01:23:38,064
- Did you eat?
- What did you eat?

2136
01:23:38,065 --> 01:23:39,105
What did you eat?

2137
01:23:39,605 --> 01:23:40,635
Did you eat something?

2138
01:23:41,575 --> 01:23:43,305
All I ate was a banana.

2139
01:23:44,745 --> 01:23:46,274
- You ate a sandwich.
- You ate something.

2140
01:23:46,275 --> 01:23:47,614
I'll know when I watch the show.

2141
01:23:47,615 --> 01:23:49,584
(Glaring)

2142
01:23:49,585 --> 01:23:51,314
- Did you eat lunch as well?
- Was it out of 100?

2143
01:23:51,315 --> 01:23:52,355
You said you even ate lunch.

2144
01:23:54,255 --> 01:23:58,155
Did I eat it alone? You ate as well.

2145
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:00,855
I wasn't going to say it.

2146
01:24:02,425 --> 01:24:04,095
(While My Star was working out, )

2147
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:08,635
(they enjoyed a Korean buffet.)

2148
01:24:09,265 --> 01:24:11,534
(Smiling)

2149
01:24:11,535 --> 01:24:13,174
Why didn't you ask me...

2150
01:24:13,175 --> 01:24:14,274
if I was going to eat?

2151
01:24:14,275 --> 01:24:17,245
You shouldn't eat. You had to wear a dress.

2152
01:24:17,305 --> 01:24:19,144
That's my choice. Why did you...

2153
01:24:19,145 --> 01:24:21,315
No. That's for the manager to decide.

2154
01:24:21,615 --> 01:24:22,944
- Really?
- Yes.

2155
01:24:22,945 --> 01:24:25,015
- I didn't know that.
- We need to be tough.

2156
01:24:25,145 --> 01:24:26,254
(She feels betrayed.)

2157
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:27,454
So I said,

2158
01:24:27,455 --> 01:24:29,685
"Shouldn't Ji Won eat?" He said you shouldn't.

2159
01:24:30,085 --> 01:24:31,854
He said you shouldn't eat.

2160
01:24:31,855 --> 01:24:33,624
- Did you have that conversation?
- We did.

2161
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:34,825
- We did.
- Of course.

2162
01:24:34,995 --> 01:24:36,094
We did.

2163
01:24:36,095 --> 01:24:37,995
You're lying.

2164
01:24:41,265 --> 01:24:43,135
I've never told a lie.

2165
01:24:44,465 --> 01:24:46,575
- You lied about eating before.
- What?

2166
01:24:46,775 --> 01:24:48,304
That was a white lie.

2167
01:24:48,305 --> 01:24:49,604
(That was a white lie.)

2168
01:24:49,605 --> 01:24:50,974
- A white lie.
- That wasn't a lie?

2169
01:24:50,975 --> 01:24:54,474
That's a white lie. He thought I'd be hungry if I knew.

2170
01:24:54,475 --> 01:24:55,845
You secretly ate the banana too.

2171
01:24:57,645 --> 01:24:58,954
You said you didn't eat it.

2172
01:24:58,955 --> 01:25:01,254
Is that a white lie? I don't think it is.

2173
01:25:01,255 --> 01:25:03,724
He also started to run in front of the elevator.

2174
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:05,324
(Running only in front of her)

2175
01:25:05,325 --> 01:25:06,425
- When?
- You did that as well?

2176
01:25:06,995 --> 01:25:09,325
That's not a white lie. That's wrong.

2177
01:25:11,865 --> 01:25:12,995
He's a thug.

2178
01:25:14,535 --> 01:25:16,064
He was acting.

2179
01:25:16,065 --> 01:25:18,874
I said we should let you eat, but he stopped me.

2180
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:21,134
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2181
01:25:21,135 --> 01:25:22,175
(Thank you for the meal anyway.)

2182
01:25:22,245 --> 01:25:23,405
It looks good.

2183
01:25:23,745 --> 01:25:25,175
The pufferfish.

2184
01:25:25,475 --> 01:25:28,315
Don't eat 1 at a time. Eat 3 pieces at once.

2185
01:25:28,715 --> 01:25:30,584
Really? Because I'll have to keep making the wrap?

2186
01:25:30,585 --> 01:25:32,685
You have to get them at once with the chopsticks.

2187
01:25:33,555 --> 01:25:35,785
It'll take a long time if you eat one at a time.

2188
01:25:36,285 --> 01:25:37,584
(He tries to please My Star by taking care of her.)

2189
01:25:37,585 --> 01:25:38,655
Eat them all at once.

2190
01:25:39,395 --> 01:25:42,064
You shouldn't eat one piece at a time.

2191
01:25:42,065 --> 01:25:43,065
(Shaking)

2192
01:25:43,066 --> 01:25:44,465
The chair...

2193
01:25:44,695 --> 01:25:45,865
What's wrong?

2194
01:25:45,995 --> 01:25:47,034
The chair...

2195
01:25:47,035 --> 01:25:48,664
- Should I get it changed?
- was pulled out too far.

2196
01:25:48,665 --> 01:25:49,665
I almost fell.

2197
01:25:49,665 --> 01:25:50,665
No, it's fine.

2198
01:25:50,666 --> 01:25:52,874
- Should I get it changed?
- No. It's fine.

2199
01:25:52,875 --> 01:25:54,374
- What will you change it with?
- With mine.

2200
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:55,444
- Change it.
- No.

2201
01:25:55,445 --> 01:25:57,305
Do you have cushions?

2202
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:59,514
- I'll get you one.
- Yes, please.

2203
01:25:59,515 --> 01:26:01,215
- Do you need just one?
- Yes.

2204
01:26:01,715 --> 01:26:03,785
- Are you comfortable?
- Do you have two?

2205
01:26:05,115 --> 01:26:07,815
(He naturally asks for one more cushion.)

2206
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:11,124
- My buttocks...
- Your buttocks hurt.

2207
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:12,624
- Your buttocks...
- He recently had surgery.

2208
01:26:12,625 --> 01:26:13,955
Right. I read the news.

2209
01:26:14,525 --> 01:26:15,764
It was on the news?

2210
01:26:15,765 --> 01:26:18,064
- There were many articles.
- There were articles.

2211
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:19,194
It was on the news?

2212
01:26:19,195 --> 01:26:21,065
("Kim Kwang Kyu, 57, Still Unmarried But Illness Relapsed")

2213
01:26:21,665 --> 01:26:23,164
(The next dish comes in.)

2214
01:26:23,165 --> 01:26:25,575
Here you go.

2215
01:26:26,575 --> 01:26:28,505
(Clam soup)

2216
01:26:30,005 --> 01:26:31,905
- This is clam soup?
- Yes.

2217
01:26:32,945 --> 01:26:34,274
Let me taste it.

2218
01:26:34,275 --> 01:26:36,645
(Switching to Royal Chef Eom mode)

2219
01:26:37,245 --> 01:26:39,454
- Royal Chef Eom.
- Royal Chef Eom.

2220
01:26:39,455 --> 01:26:40,885
Taste the food.

2221
01:26:41,555 --> 01:26:43,455
Taste the food, Royal Chef Eom.

2222
01:26:45,955 --> 01:26:49,165
It's light and has the taste of nature.

2223
01:26:50,225 --> 01:26:52,265
Are you a noble? Why are you acting like a noble?

2224
01:26:53,065 --> 01:26:55,165
Don't act noble characters. It doesn't suit you.

2225
01:26:55,865 --> 01:26:56,935
It's tasty.

2226
01:26:58,705 --> 01:26:59,805
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

2227
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:01,905
(He's satisfied.)

2228
01:27:04,605 --> 01:27:07,515
- This is seasoned pufferfish skin.
- Seasoned pufferfish skin.

2229
01:27:08,175 --> 01:27:09,315
I can't eat it.

2230
01:27:09,385 --> 01:27:11,114
- This is the tastiest part.
- Really?

2231
01:27:11,115 --> 01:27:12,715
Why can't you eat it? You can eat pufferfish.

2232
01:27:12,855 --> 01:27:14,454
I'm scared of its skin.

2233
01:27:14,455 --> 01:27:16,255
- I see.
- It's really tasty.

2234
01:27:19,155 --> 01:27:24,295
(She finally enjoys the meal freely.)

2235
01:27:24,895 --> 01:27:26,695
Eating this is waking me up a bit.

2236
01:27:27,395 --> 01:27:29,264
It was tiresome.

2237
01:27:29,265 --> 01:27:31,365
It was tiresome to pretend to be pretty.

2238
01:27:32,065 --> 01:27:33,375
You were pretty today.

2239
01:27:34,675 --> 01:27:37,344
You were perfect for the closing ceremony.

2240
01:27:37,345 --> 01:27:39,214
Stop your white lies.

2241
01:27:39,215 --> 01:27:40,374
No.

2242
01:27:40,375 --> 01:27:42,285
- Stop.
- Why do you keep saying white lies?

2243
01:27:42,945 --> 01:27:44,514
- I didn't...
- Stop saying white lies.

2244
01:27:44,515 --> 01:27:46,315
Stop it, Kwang Kyu.

2245
01:27:46,455 --> 01:27:47,455
(Laughing)

2246
01:27:48,825 --> 01:27:50,685
(Laughing)

2247
01:27:52,395 --> 01:27:53,395
Was it obvious?

2248
01:27:53,425 --> 01:27:55,564
- Stop it, Kwang Kyu.
- No.

2249
01:27:55,565 --> 01:27:58,064
When I was walking the red carpet,

2250
01:27:58,065 --> 01:27:59,764
I was wearing open-toe shoes,

2251
01:27:59,765 --> 01:28:03,005
and the hem of my dress got caught between my toes.

2252
01:28:04,765 --> 01:28:06,135
It got caught between your toes?

2253
01:28:06,505 --> 01:28:07,804
- The...
- The dress...

2254
01:28:07,805 --> 01:28:09,204
- went between the toes?
- The dress's hem...

2255
01:28:09,205 --> 01:28:11,744
isn't stitched all the way through. It's stitched sparsely.

2256
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:14,614
- Right.
- So my big toe...

2257
01:28:14,615 --> 01:28:17,815
got caught in the hole.

2258
01:28:19,355 --> 01:28:20,484
What did you do?

2259
01:28:20,485 --> 01:28:22,725
So I walked funny.

2260
01:28:23,285 --> 01:28:24,825
(Laughing)

2261
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:26,524
- I tried to act natural.
- Really?

2262
01:28:26,525 --> 01:28:29,394
I tried to act natural, but when I walked,

2263
01:28:29,395 --> 01:28:30,664
I was worried I might fall.

2264
01:28:30,665 --> 01:28:31,864
It didn't show.

2265
01:28:31,865 --> 01:28:34,195
I'm a bit worried.

2266
01:28:34,735 --> 01:28:36,904
The fancy and glamorous moments of the award ceremony...

2267
01:28:36,905 --> 01:28:38,464
and the preparation...

2268
01:28:38,465 --> 01:28:40,674
only make up 1 to 2 percent...

2269
01:28:40,675 --> 01:28:45,344
of what I do. They're very glamorous sides of me.

2270
01:28:45,345 --> 01:28:46,914
Actors get lots of love,

2271
01:28:46,915 --> 01:28:49,815
but once they're hated, they get hated endlessly.

2272
01:28:50,385 --> 01:28:51,445
You know that, right?

2273
01:28:51,945 --> 01:28:54,984
When you film movies, they put your name on the chair...

2274
01:28:54,985 --> 01:28:57,785
only when you're the main character.

2275
01:28:58,155 --> 01:29:00,525
That's right.

2276
01:29:00,555 --> 01:29:03,164
When I got that chair,

2277
01:29:03,165 --> 01:29:06,634
- I was really happy.
- Yes.

2278
01:29:06,635 --> 01:29:07,995
- Um Ji Won.
- Yes.

2279
01:29:08,595 --> 01:29:11,204
- It's overwhelming.
- It's overwhelming.

2280
01:29:11,205 --> 01:29:14,535
So I stuck my name on my chair.

2281
01:29:14,905 --> 01:29:17,444
(He increased his heart rate himself.)

2282
01:29:17,445 --> 01:29:20,775
I stuck it on my chair.

2283
01:29:23,145 --> 01:29:24,645
I'll evaluate your work today.

2284
01:29:25,615 --> 01:29:26,654
(Suddenly?)

2285
01:29:26,655 --> 01:29:27,755
Work evaluation.

2286
01:29:28,255 --> 01:29:32,294
What score would you give yourself?

2287
01:29:32,295 --> 01:29:33,724
- Me?
- Yes.

2288
01:29:33,725 --> 01:29:35,594
- As my manager today.
- As your manager?

2289
01:29:35,595 --> 01:29:38,165
I'd give myself 75 points.

2290
01:29:38,425 --> 01:29:40,995
You didn't even place water in the car.

2291
01:29:41,365 --> 01:29:44,334
Was that my task? You should have done that as well.

2292
01:29:44,335 --> 01:29:45,904
I didn't ride that car.

2293
01:29:45,905 --> 01:29:47,175
I took the escort car.

2294
01:29:48,535 --> 01:29:50,644
(He can't think of anything to say back.)

2295
01:29:50,645 --> 01:29:51,805
Kwang Kyu.

2296
01:29:52,675 --> 01:29:56,145
I'll give you both the same score.

2297
01:29:57,745 --> 01:30:00,484
I think the manager's mistakes...

2298
01:30:00,485 --> 01:30:02,685
are ultimately the director's responsibility.

2299
01:30:04,625 --> 01:30:06,094
You're from the same company.

2300
01:30:06,095 --> 01:30:07,725
No. We're from different companies.

2301
01:30:08,395 --> 01:30:09,564
We're from different companies.

2302
01:30:09,565 --> 01:30:11,165
- Are we from different companies?
- We're from different companies.

2303
01:30:11,895 --> 01:30:13,864
We're from different companies, but we're working together...

2304
01:30:13,865 --> 01:30:15,064
because we have no choice.

2305
01:30:15,065 --> 01:30:16,504
- We're from different companies.
- You're from different companies?

2306
01:30:16,505 --> 01:30:17,535
We're from different companies.

2307
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:19,974
(That might be right.)

2308
01:30:19,975 --> 01:30:21,004
We're from different companies.

2309
01:30:21,005 --> 01:30:22,074
You're in my company,

2310
01:30:22,075 --> 01:30:23,774
and I just invited him for a brief time.

2311
01:30:23,775 --> 01:30:27,044
We were short-handed, so I brought him to drive.

2312
01:30:27,045 --> 01:30:30,384
(They're business partners.)

2313
01:30:30,385 --> 01:30:33,355
Do you have fun working as a manager?

2314
01:30:38,755 --> 01:30:39,925
I'm curious.

2315
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:43,265
If we were to do...

2316
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:47,094
something completely different,

2317
01:30:47,095 --> 01:30:48,095
it could be tough.

2318
01:30:49,035 --> 01:30:50,164
- Instead of working as a manager?
- Yes.

2319
01:30:50,165 --> 01:30:51,964
Managers are people...

2320
01:30:51,965 --> 01:30:54,135
we always see.

2321
01:30:56,275 --> 01:30:58,474
So we know how the work is done.

2322
01:30:58,475 --> 01:30:59,475
(They've always been with managers.)

2323
01:30:59,915 --> 01:31:01,045
Anyway,

2324
01:31:01,215 --> 01:31:04,444
our teamwork is getting better than before.

2325
01:31:04,445 --> 01:31:05,814
- Really?
- Yes.

2326
01:31:05,815 --> 01:31:06,885
Really?

2327
01:31:10,225 --> 01:31:11,725
I'm working really hard.

2328
01:31:12,225 --> 01:31:14,125
(Shaking his head)

2329
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:15,624
(He has to take care of My Star and be careful around Seo Jin.)

2330
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:17,865
I'm working really hard.

2331
01:31:18,595 --> 01:31:19,795
Do you want to quit?

2332
01:31:21,335 --> 01:31:23,305
Why are you taking things to the extreme?

2333
01:31:23,865 --> 01:31:24,904
Hey.

2334
01:31:24,905 --> 01:31:28,175
(Things are peaceful at My Grumpy Secretary as always.)

2335
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:33,115
(He's getting off work with some beer.)

2336
01:31:37,145 --> 01:31:38,145
There.

2337
01:31:39,415 --> 01:31:41,985
Like that. That's how you do it.

2338
01:31:43,055 --> 01:31:45,655
(Drinking a can of beer after work)

2339
01:31:46,055 --> 01:31:47,255
Isn't that really smooth?

2340
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:50,225
It's really smooth.

2341
01:31:50,425 --> 01:31:51,764
Isn't it like draft beer?

2342
01:31:51,765 --> 01:31:54,394
It would be nice to drink a can while watching a movie.

2343
01:31:54,395 --> 01:31:55,465
Like draft beer.

2344
01:31:55,735 --> 01:31:59,075
(My Grumpy Secretary's hands-on care in Busan wraps up.)

2345
01:31:59,135 --> 01:32:00,974
How would you describe it in one sentence?

2346
01:32:00,975 --> 01:32:02,305
A mess.

2347
01:32:05,075 --> 01:32:06,245
It was fun.

2348
01:32:06,715 --> 01:32:08,644
It became a good memory.

2349
01:32:08,645 --> 01:32:10,184
Kwang Kyu...

2350
01:32:10,185 --> 01:32:11,345
(What do you want to say to the next star?)

2351
01:32:11,985 --> 01:32:13,785
doesn't understand what you mean very well,

2352
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:17,625
but he's kind and pure.

2353
01:32:17,925 --> 01:32:20,595
Kwang Kyu also tells a lot of white lies.

2354
01:32:21,425 --> 01:32:24,625
So don't get fooled by his lies.

2355
01:32:26,695 --> 01:32:28,135
Seo Jin...

2356
01:32:29,635 --> 01:32:31,265
lacks empathy.

2357
01:32:35,235 --> 01:32:37,405
Don't get hurt...

2358
01:32:38,245 --> 01:32:39,945
by the frank remarks that Seo Jin makes.

2359
01:32:40,715 --> 01:32:42,715
He means no harm.

2360
01:32:44,715 --> 01:32:47,085
But Seo Jin is very sharp,

2361
01:32:47,485 --> 01:32:49,355
and he's surprisingly very considerate as well.

2362
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:51,085
Please try to see the best in him.

2363
01:32:53,025 --> 01:32:54,124
Dae Eun...

2364
01:32:54,125 --> 01:32:55,864
(Send a video message to your real manager.)

2365
01:32:55,865 --> 01:32:57,824
You always...

2366
01:32:57,825 --> 01:32:59,835
Seo Jin!

2367
01:33:03,135 --> 01:33:04,405
Are you crazy?

2368
01:33:05,005 --> 01:33:08,075
- The guest is speaking.
- Seo Jin!

2369
01:33:08,405 --> 01:33:11,774
- Guest?
- Guest.

2370
01:33:11,775 --> 01:33:13,245
(Looking away)

2371
01:33:13,475 --> 01:33:16,614
I'm not a guest. This is my room.

2372
01:33:16,615 --> 01:33:18,445
You're the guest!

2373
01:33:18,915 --> 01:33:21,315
Right. This is my room.

2374
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:23,825
This is my room!

2375
01:33:24,085 --> 01:33:26,594
(It's the first time having a secretary open the door.)

2376
01:33:26,595 --> 01:33:28,625
(My life is happy.)

2377
01:33:29,125 --> 01:33:31,365
(My Star who's always happy, Sunwoo Yong Yeo)

2378
01:33:32,225 --> 01:33:33,734
(Assist her through the most important schedule...)

2379
01:33:33,735 --> 01:33:34,835
(in her 80-year life.)

2380
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:36,635
(My Star has a sore throat.)

2381
01:33:37,005 --> 01:33:38,404
(Let me open the sachet.)

2382
01:33:38,405 --> 01:33:41,235
(When it comes to assisting an elderly, Seo Jin is the best.)

2383
01:33:41,535 --> 01:33:42,574
(He gets her the side dishes.)

2384
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:43,744
He goes immediately.

2385
01:33:43,745 --> 01:33:45,545
(It's "Grandmas Over Flowers" instead of "Grandpas Over Flowers.")

2386
01:33:46,045 --> 01:33:47,575
(Hands-on care)

2387
01:33:47,645 --> 01:33:48,645
(Sighing)

2388
01:33:48,815 --> 01:33:50,815
(How could you not do this when you're a secretary?)

2389
01:33:51,315 --> 01:33:53,755
(I was going to give it to you at the end.)

2390
01:33:54,155 --> 01:33:56,725
(Why have you not done that?)

2391
01:33:57,285 --> 01:33:58,684
(Start the car quickly.)

2392
01:33:58,685 --> 01:34:00,525
(Should I be waiting or should you?)

2393
01:34:00,755 --> 01:34:02,624
(Stay out of it.)

2394
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,795
(Okay.)

2395
01:34:04,225 --> 01:34:06,735
(You don't like me, do you?)

2396
01:34:07,465 --> 01:34:11,134
(My Grumpy Secretary is disciplined by Tough Yong Yeo.)

2397
01:34:11,135 --> 01:34:13,904
(They also have to take care of tougher women.)

2398
01:34:13,905 --> 01:34:15,505
(They're flustered.)

2399
01:34:16,045 --> 01:34:17,605
(Shocked)

2400
01:34:17,975 --> 01:34:19,144
(Lee Seo Jin...)

2401
01:34:19,145 --> 01:34:20,315
(is very charming.)

2402
01:34:21,145 --> 01:34:22,785
(He fails to react.)

2403
01:34:23,245 --> 01:34:24,784
(They fail to assist them...)

2404
01:34:24,785 --> 01:34:26,755
(because of their extraordinary level of energy.)

2405
01:34:28,215 --> 01:34:30,755
(Mom, I'm Mi Sun.)

2406
01:34:31,325 --> 01:34:35,595
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2407
01:34:35,855 --> 01:34:41,935
(My Grumpy Secretary)
