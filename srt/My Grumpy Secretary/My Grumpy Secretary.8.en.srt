00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:16,017
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:17,847
Hello.

3
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:20,047
Hello.

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,457
(Shaking)

5
00:00:24,027 --> 00:00:26,027
(He gets ready to take supplements as soon as he arrives.)

6
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:27,757
I guess you need the energy boosters.

7
00:00:28,497 --> 00:00:29,697
(Dropping)

8
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,667
(It's an ominous beginning.)

9
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:34,267
My gosh.

10
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:36,297
(Blowing on it)

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,467
- Share it with us.
- I...

12
00:00:41,277 --> 00:00:43,477
Do you think it's going to be an energy draining day?

13
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:44,707
Well.

14
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,747
We've never cared for five stars.

15
00:00:49,317 --> 00:00:52,787
I stayed up all night yesterday memorizing their names.

16
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:55,017
- Did you memorize them all?
- I did.

17
00:00:55,757 --> 00:01:00,087
ANNIE was born in 2002. TARZZAN was also born in 2002.

18
00:01:00,757 --> 00:01:02,227
BAILEY was born in 2004.

19
00:01:03,027 --> 00:01:04,467
WOOCHAN was born in 2004.

20
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:06,467
YOUNGSEO was born in 2005.

21
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,137
You studied hard, didn't you?

22
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:09,337
I studied hard.

23
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:10,507
(Today's My Star is ALLDAY PROJECT.)

24
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:14,077
(ALLDAY PROJECT Tops the Music Chart in Just 3 Days)

25
00:01:14,077 --> 00:01:16,277
(Mega Rookie ADP Becomes the Rookie of the Year)

26
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,377
(In just 10 days after the debut, they ranked 1st on a music show.)

27
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:26,017
(They've got the free energy we have never seen before.)

28
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:30,117
(They are the trend-leading fashion icon of Zen Z.)

29
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:33,797
(They are the five artists with fresh charms.)

30
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:36,997
(ALLDAY PROJECT)

31
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,597
You studied hard, didn't you?

32
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,067
I studied hard.

33
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,697
You even put on a bracelet because you're meeting Zen Z.

34
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,307
I tried hard.

35
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,177
I... Goodness.

36
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:49,577
- Vitamin.
- Wait.

37
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,777
What's up with the ring?

38
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,847
(Accessories that seem picked with My Star in mind)

39
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:55,377
I saw that they are mostly rappers.

40
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:57,847
They rap. They don't sing K-pop songs.

41
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:00,387
They sing English pop songs.

42
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,317
How should I put it?

43
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:06,227
I didn't want to get intimidated by them.

44
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,197
(He plans to set the tone with his accessories.)

45
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:09,297
This...

46
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:11,527
- No.
- He's here.

47
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,537
(Seo Jin's car comes in.)

48
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:17,007
Stop!

49
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:19,367
There's a car coming. Come here.

50
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,677
Kwang Kyu came fully prepared.

51
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:23,747
Vitamins...

52
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:26,047
Look at Kwang Kyu's outfit.

53
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:28,317
- What?
- What do you think of his outfit?

54
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,517
- Do you like it?
- What do you think?

55
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,017
I gave him these pants.

56
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:34,217
Hey!

57
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:38,227
You have a good memory, don't you?

58
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:40,697
You remember all those clothes?

59
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:43,097
No way. I didn't tell them.

60
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:45,597
You are so sharp.

61
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:46,797
My jacket smells.

62
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,237
- Spray some fabric mist.
- Right.

63
00:02:49,997 --> 00:02:52,207
I still enjoy wearing the clothes you gave me.

64
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:53,407
I think it's been about ten years now.

65
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,877
(Smell check is a must-do before meeting the stars.)

66
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,147
Flip it.

67
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,277
- We're meeting the stars after all.
- Right.

68
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:01,047
We shouldn't smell like old bachelors.

69
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,047
(Sniffing)

70
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:03,247
Did you have kimchi jjigae?

71
00:03:05,647 --> 00:03:07,257
- Did you?
- Of course I didn't.

72
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:08,717
It's new, but spray it anyway.

73
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:11,257
- Is it new?
- It smells like gasoline.

74
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:15,557
It makes the clothes smell like clean laundry. So fresh.

75
00:03:15,557 --> 00:03:17,497
- This is very convenient.
- Right?

76
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:19,827
It freshens the fabric really well.

77
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:24,207
We need to smell fresh when we meet them.

78
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,137
Hello.

79
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:27,707
- Hello.
- Hello.

80
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,547
I am Naomi, the manager of ALLDAY PROJECT.

81
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:32,847
- Naomi?
- Yes.

82
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,447
Is your last name Na?

83
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:36,947
- No, it's not my real name.
- No, right? Your name is Naomi.

84
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:40,247
- It's an English name.
- My company encourages us...

85
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,257
to use an English name for equal relationships.

86
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,517
It's nice to meet you, Naomi.

87
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:45,057
You need to come up with one too.

88
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,527
We all use English names,

89
00:03:47,897 --> 00:03:49,827
- so you use make one too.
- I will.

90
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:52,627
This is our card key.

91
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:55,837
- Right.
- When it comes to the things...

92
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:57,307
I need to hand over and the schedule briefing,

93
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:00,207
there are just too many, so I will tell you downstairs.

94
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,677
- Are there too many things?
- Yes.

95
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,077
Is memorizing the names of the five members not enough?

96
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:06,007
There are too many other things you should know about.

97
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:09,377
No wonder I couldn't sleep well.

98
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,547
- I will explain it downstairs.
- Do I need to wear it around?

99
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:12,887
(They will go inside the building for the handover process.)

100
00:04:20,157 --> 00:04:21,527
You can go inside.

101
00:04:24,127 --> 00:04:26,797
(Awkward)

102
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:28,997
It feels a bit like...

103
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:32,037
(Conscious)

104
00:04:32,037 --> 00:04:33,207
Say it.

105
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:35,177
Why can't you speak?

106
00:04:35,177 --> 00:04:36,877
I feel like I got dragged into a marriage agency.

107
00:04:38,007 --> 00:04:39,807
(That's how nervous he is.)

108
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,877
- First of all, - I feel like I got dragged...

109
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:44,087
- into a marriage agency.
- these are the things you need.

110
00:04:44,747 --> 00:04:47,287
- Those are all the things we need?
- Yes.

111
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,987
(It's a bagful.)

112
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:53,427
Those are the things I need to hand over to you.

113
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,627
(There's a huge suitcase and smaller bags too.)

114
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,267
Those are the things I need to hand over to you.

115
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,937
You can wear these bags at the set.

116
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,967
What's in it?

117
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:08,377
(Today’s luggage is on another level.)

118
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:12,447
(She shows them the things she will hand over.)

119
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:15,477
This is the bag you take to the shoot. There's tissue.

120
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:19,147
Straws, masks, wet tissue,

121
00:05:19,247 --> 00:05:21,687
power bank, mirror,

122
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:23,057
and...

123
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,497
The female members wear nail tips on their nails.

124
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:30,997
When the tips come off, you should use the stickers to stick them back.

125
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:34,267
(Flustered)

126
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:37,167
It's got the extra stickers.

127
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,207
(Confused)

128
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:42,607
This is the tool you use to punch a hole...

129
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:44,907
- onto a cap.
- You have one too.

130
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:46,307
We've got one too.

131
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,947
Goodness.

132
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:50,177
- Yes.
- I've got one.

133
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:52,817
- You should...
- I should combine the two.

134
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:53,987
You should combine the two bags.

135
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,327
The things the members need when they put on a makeup...

136
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:01,097
are all in here.

137
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:05,027
Here.

138
00:06:06,797 --> 00:06:08,237
Blanket.

139
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:15,507
When you go to a shoot, you put their water bottles here.

140
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:18,477
You should punch a hole and put a straw on each too.

141
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:20,917
You need to do that.

142
00:06:21,217 --> 00:06:24,717
These are the lenses the members wear.

143
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:27,387
Nail tips and pill cases.

144
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,757
And this is the light they need for their selfies.

145
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:33,587
These are the straws. These are toothbrushes.

146
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:36,027
If they need a power bank.

147
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,767
If the lens cases are missing the lenses,

148
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:41,467
you can find them here and fill them.

149
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:50,007
(They've got a huge list of things needed to care for 5 My Stars.)

150
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:55,047
Let's stop the shoot, shall we?

151
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:57,647
He's already lost it.

152
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,517
I suddenly got tired.

153
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:03,057
Is it something a human can do?

154
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:04,427
I thought the suitcase was over-the-top.

155
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:07,897
- Mr. Manager.
- Coming!

156
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,297
(This is the fate they will face soon.)

157
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:10,927
- Mr. Manager.
- This is it, right?

158
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:12,867
I have the wet tissue.

159
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:14,737
- I think I saw it here earlier.
- Mr. Manager.

160
00:07:14,737 --> 00:07:16,937
You should read it, if it's gray or brown.

161
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,067
It's in Korean, you know.

162
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:20,777
Gray.

163
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:22,537
The writings are too small for me to read.

164
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,147
Where did this coffee come from?

165
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,707
I made it especially for you.

166
00:07:27,207 --> 00:07:30,017
- You guys are super popular.
- Super popular.

167
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:34,387
(The big crowd makes My Stars nervous.)

168
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,527
(Peeking)

169
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,557
Don't get out until I open the door.

170
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:41,657
Wait. Can you hold this when they take the photo...

171
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:42,657
with a Polaroid?

172
00:07:42,657 --> 00:07:46,027
Let's take a photo individually in front of your photo.

173
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:48,037
Why don't we do the media interview over here?

174
00:07:48,037 --> 00:07:49,567
They are like Mom and Dad.

175
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,667
Mom and Dad.

176
00:07:50,667 --> 00:07:53,937
It was like spending a day with five children,

177
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:56,107
two boys and three girls.

178
00:07:57,447 --> 00:07:59,247
I was glad I didn't have any children.

179
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,347
You know?

180
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,117
I suddenly feel tired.

181
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,287
(The Grumpy Secretaries' parenting diary is coming soon.)

182
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,847
Just hearing it makes us feel tired, doesn't it?

183
00:08:07,757 --> 00:08:09,217
- This is today's schedule.
- We're going there too?

184
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:11,757
Yes. I will go over today's schedule with you.

185
00:08:12,357 --> 00:08:14,657
It's 11am now, and they are getting their hair and makeup done.

186
00:08:14,857 --> 00:08:17,367
They will be out by 2pm.

187
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:21,097
We will arrive at the site at 3pm and do the photo call first.

188
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,107
For the media interview, each media gets ten minutes.

189
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:28,077
If they go over the 10 minutes, you 2 need to put a stop to it.

190
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:29,277
Putting a stop to something is our specialty.

191
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:32,507
Seo Jin is very good at that.

192
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:34,177
I can put a stop to anything.

193
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,647
All right. I will go home then.

194
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,187
- Please do a good job.
- Okay.

195
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:41,117
- Okay.
- We will do our best.

196
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:43,187
Where do we go?

197
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:44,657
(They go to where My Stars are getting the hair and makeup done.)

198
00:08:51,327 --> 00:08:53,927
(Caretaker Fairy struggles to carry the big loads.)

199
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,467
Gosh.

- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

209
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:17,157
- It's a pleasure.
- The pleasure is mine.

210

Hello.

211
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:20,857

00:09:37,947 --> 00:09:39,407
I've known her since she was born.

222
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:42,017
I was so happy to see her...

223
00:09:42,017 --> 00:09:44,087
becoming so popular as soon as she debuted.

(It was 1530.)

232
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:02,337
(SAT score of over 1500 means she did really well.)

233

One...

274
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:29,387
- Speak in Korean.
- Tom.

275
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:30,957
- Tom.
- Do you understand Korean?

276
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,387
- Yes.
- I see.

277
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,487
- Tom.
- They are Koreans.

278
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:36,457
The first one is Tom, as in Tom Cruise.

279

- Tom is catchy.
- Like Tom and Jerry?

- Okay. Tom.
- Tom?

286

Tom sounds good.

287

- Are you getting it now?
- We have to get everything done.

298
00:12:12,097 --> 00:12:13,897
- Only the base makeup.
- We haven't gotten it all done yet.

- We have to take turns now.

We eat anywhere. We can eat there too.

00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,137
- We are actually quite free.
- I'm hungry.

303
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:25,177

- Yes.

304
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,807
- Is there no cafeteria?
- No.

305
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,317
- We don't have a cafeteria yet.
- No cafeteria?

306
00:12:29,477 --> 00:12:30,547
Hello.

307
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,287
It's too hectic.

308
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,917
Do you want to eat first?

309
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,757
- Yes. I'm hungry.
- Yes.

310
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,857
What do you want? Tell us.

311
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:39,127
I want Subway.

Subway? Okay.

313
00:12:40,997 --> 00:12:42,627
I prefer Korean food.

315
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:46,567

317
00:12:47,637 --> 00:12:49,467
- I want rice.
- Did you order?

318
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,007
- I didn't order anything yet.
- You didn't order anything yet.

319
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:53,307
How about you, BAILEY? What would you like?

320
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,777
Perhaps sweet potato from the convenience store?

321
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:56,907
BAILEY.

322
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,947

Have you heard of konjac jelly?

326

- Konjac jelly.
- Do they have that at the store?

327
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,227
When we go to a convenience store,

328
00:13:11,387 --> 00:13:13,257
we get protein bars, energy bars,

329
00:13:13,257 --> 00:13:15,697
konjac jelly, soft-boiled eggs...

330
00:13:15,697 --> 00:13:17,197
Wait. Slow down.

331
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,297

333
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,037

00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,867
- Protein bar.
- Protein bar.

336
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,137
Protein bar.

337
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:28,477
It's "protein."

338
00:13:30,237 --> 00:13:31,347
Protein bar.

339
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:34,377
Protein bar.

340

- Yes.

342
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,017
- Sweet potato.
- Just sweet potato?

343
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,447
- Do they sell that?
- Dried sweet potato?

344
00:13:39,817 --> 00:13:41,587
- Anything is fine.
- Sweet potato jerky.

345
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,787

- And Gamdong egg.
- Gamdong egg.

347
00:13:44,927 --> 00:13:46,027
- What?
- Egg.

348
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,457
- It has to be Gamdong egg.
- Isn't it an egg?

349
00:13:47,457 --> 00:13:48,797
What kind of an egg is that?

350
00:13:48,797 --> 00:13:51,927
- It's got a really moist yolk.
- Like a poached egg?

351
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,737
- It's a soft-boiled egg.
- That's a must.

352
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,737
Greek yogurt.

353
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:59,537
I know Greek yogurt. Yogurt from Greece.

354
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,537
- It's thick.
- And Lingtea, YOUNGSEO.

00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:05,447
- Lingtea Zero.
- And zero-calorie drinks.

356
00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:08,247
They could order one by one.

357
00:14:08,677 --> 00:14:11,347
But they talked all at once.

358
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:13,987
I realised we shouldn't serve five stars ever again.

359
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,787
That's a lot. Lingtea.

360
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:22,097
Because he speaks with an accent, he sounds more friendly.

361
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:23,997
- Who has the accent?
- You have the accent.

362
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,367
- I speak with an accent?
- Yes.

363
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,997
I'm speaking standard Korean.

364
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,797
That's what I always say.

365
00:14:30,797 --> 00:14:32,107
- Really?
- Yes.

366
00:14:32,337 --> 00:14:33,367
Where are you from?

367
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:34,807
I'm from Ulsan.

368
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:37,007
You should've said it earlier.

369
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:40,277
(Cute)

370
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,947
But is Tom going to be buying all those alone?

371
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,487
- I will go with him.
- Go with him.

372
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,157
Yes. I will read it.

373
00:14:48,157 --> 00:14:50,117
Konjac jelly, protein bar, sweet potato, Gamdong egg,

374
00:14:50,117 --> 00:14:52,157
Greek yogurt, Lingtea, three green ones,

375
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,827
chicken breast, Almond Breeze.

376
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,997
- Yes!
- Yes!

377
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,367
I could turn it into a song.

378
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,027
- Let's go, Tom.
- Sounds great.

379
00:15:01,137 --> 00:15:04,767
Then... Will you go with TARZZAN?

380
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,267
- I will go with TARZZAN.
- Yes.

381
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,407
- Will you?
- I'll be back.

382
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,177
- Make sure you get the receipt.
- Okay.

383
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:13,647
(My Stars are anxious.)

384
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:16,277
It's tiring, isn't it?

385
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,087
Does everyone speak English well?

386
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,447
Here's how I know him.

387
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,657
He's very close to my parents.

388
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,927
So I've known him...

389
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,927
- since I was very young.
- She calls me Uncle.

390
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,157
Right. Uncle Seo Jin.

391
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:29,157
But today, he's...

392
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,297
- He's Jerry.
- He's Jerry.

393
00:15:31,427 --> 00:15:33,997
- He's Jerry today.
- Goodness.

394
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:36,497
She was always splitting her legs at home.

395
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:42,207
How will you call Seo Yoon today, Jerry?

396
00:15:42,577 --> 00:15:43,807
- ANNIE.
- ANNIE.

397
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:45,847
I never knew she was ANNIE.

398
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:48,347
- What are you saying?
- I didn't know you were ANNIE.

399
00:15:48,577 --> 00:15:50,847
I always called you Seo Yoon. When did I call you ANNIE?

400
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:52,987
- That's true.
- I didn't know.

401
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:54,387
Today, she's ANNIE.

402
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:57,457
(Today, ANNIE and Jerry will be together.)

403
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,657
I wanted to tell you this story.

404
00:16:00,187 --> 00:16:03,227
When I was in Ulsan,

405
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:05,727
I auditioned for a child actor role. Only once in my life.

406
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:06,767
You did?

407
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,867
And that was for "Friend."

408
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:12,237
- Really?
- For a role in "Friend 2."

409
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,307
- Really?
- I auditioned for the role.

410
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,077
I didn't get the role of course.

411
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:18,507
- Right.
- When I was studying for it,

412
00:16:19,347 --> 00:16:22,417
I watched the first "Friend."

413
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,817
That's why you know my line, "What does your dad do for a living?"

414
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,647
And my dad is a big fan of yours.

415
00:16:27,787 --> 00:16:30,217
- So he teased me often.
- Did he really?

416
00:16:30,317 --> 00:16:32,687
- I'm honoured.
- That's how I know you.

417
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,757
So what does your dad do?

418
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:36,057
- My dad?
- Yes.

419
00:16:36,057 --> 00:16:37,227
My dad is a gangster.

420
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:38,997
Hey!

421
00:16:39,727 --> 00:16:41,097
(Naughty TARZZAN)

422
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:44,437
Goodness. Your joke is over-the-top.

423
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:46,437
Is he really a gangster?

424
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:47,907
Of course he's not.

425
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,407
He's busy making a living for me.

426
00:16:52,147 --> 00:16:53,877
You will have to make a living for him now.

427
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:55,877
Yes. I told him to quit his job...

428
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:57,817
if this album does well.

429
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,987
You are amazing.

430
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,387
How old is your dad?

431
00:17:01,517 --> 00:17:03,387
He was born in 1970.

432
00:17:03,717 --> 00:17:04,887
Is he?

433
00:17:05,287 --> 00:17:06,887
(Crying)

434
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:09,327
Almost the same age as Seo Jin.

435
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,897
(Kwang Kyu, born in 1967, is older than TARZZAN's dad.)

436
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:16,137
How long has it been since you debuted?

437
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,067
It's been almost 4, 5 months.

438
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,837
Really? Less than a year?

439
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:24,007
It's been less than a year.

440
00:17:24,847 --> 00:17:26,507
- It hasn't been long at all.
- Right.

441
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:28,677
That's why you don't have too many songs out.

442
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,577
- We only have two songs.
- Right.

443
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,647
- We are preparing for a comeback.
- I see.

444
00:17:33,647 --> 00:17:34,757
(They are flipping the world with "One More Time.")

445
00:17:34,957 --> 00:17:36,957
Why is your name TARZZAN?

446
00:17:36,957 --> 00:17:37,987
- Me?
- Yes.

447
00:17:37,987 --> 00:17:41,057
When I was a senior in high school...

448
00:17:41,057 --> 00:17:43,597
I originally majored in contemporary dance.

449
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:47,967
There was a video of me dancing in skin-colour tights.

450
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,207
(Winner of Korea's top dance competition, )

451
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:55,207
(the Dong-A Dance Concours, 2 years in a row)

452
00:17:55,377 --> 00:18:00,207
(My Star TARZZAN is the hidden gem the dance world missed.)

453
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:03,517
When I participated in the competitions in Seoul,

454
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:05,147
my friends told me...

455
00:18:05,547 --> 00:18:07,687
that I danced like TARZZAN.

456
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:10,017
I am funny too,

457
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:11,787
so they called me that.

458
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:15,157
I was thinking about my Instagram ID then,

459
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,797
and TARZZAN came to my mind.

460
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,827
After that, people started calling me TARZZAN.

461
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,867
Now it's like my name.

462
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:26,037
TARZZAN is great.

463
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:29,637
But I think I look more like Mowgli.

464
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:30,937
Who's Mowgli?

465
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:33,007
A character from "The Jungle Book."

466
00:18:33,007 --> 00:18:34,277
I didn't watch "The Jungle Book."

467
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,617
- It suddenly went like this.
- Lizard.

468
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,347
- An alligator?
- An alligator.

469
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,587
I should listen to the cry of an alligator.

470
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:44,727
What?

471
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:48,327
I will look for the cry of an alligator.

472
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:51,597
My shoulder popped out while I was mimicking an alligator.

473
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,727
This is the cry of an alligator.

474
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:54,867
(Growling)

475
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:56,567
(Laughing)

476
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:01,677
(My Star plays differently.)

477
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,077
(Next is the cry of an elephant.)

478
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:05,077
(Mimicking)

479
00:19:06,207 --> 00:19:08,777
(ADP Elephant)

480
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:10,777
(Happy)

481
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:13,247
(Mimicking an elephant)

482
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:18,127
It's nice that they play together.

483
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:19,657
(It's nice that they play together.)

484
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:24,927
BAILEY, Zero and WOOCHAN...

485
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,467
were pretending to be two alligators fighting.

486
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,767
And that's why he hurt his shoulder.

487
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,107
My shoulder popped out.

488
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,507
(Approaching)

489
00:19:34,637 --> 00:19:36,237
Do you always converse in English?

490
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:37,837
We don't.

491
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:38,977
Do you all speak English well?

492
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:41,817
But look.

493
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:43,847
We're good at imitating animal sounds.

494
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:46,087
Should the three of us try it?

495
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:48,057
You're going to imitate that sound?

496
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:49,857
- It's the elephant sound.
- The elephant sound.

497
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:50,887
The three of us should try it.

498
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,187
Okay. The three of us should harmonize.

499
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:55,297
- Harmonize?
- Yes.

500
00:19:55,697 --> 00:19:58,497
(The trio of ALLDAY Elephants)

501
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:06,407
(His eyes dart around rapidly.)

502
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:09,007
You all sound like a bunch of dogs.

503
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,307
(You're just making dog noises.)

504
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:13,377
- You just sound like puppies.
- No.

505
00:20:13,377 --> 00:20:15,177
This is how elephants sound when they're upset.

506
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:16,377
That's not how elephants sound.

507
00:20:21,347 --> 00:20:23,917
(The generation gap is real between me and My Stars.)

508
00:20:23,917 --> 00:20:26,957
- It was way better before.
- Yes. We were focused then.

509
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,827
(Pacing back and forth)

510
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,327
(Standing still)

511
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:34,397
He's a natural at this.

512
00:20:34,397 --> 00:20:36,197
(He's on standby to take care of them up close.)

513
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,737
You're standing there like you've done this before.

514
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,737
Is that how it looks?

515
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:43,437
You seem to blend in quite well here.

516
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:47,207
- You didn't send it to me.
- No, I did.

517
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,577
Are you the youngest of the group?

518
00:20:49,577 --> 00:20:51,147
WOOCHAN and I are the same age.

519
00:20:51,147 --> 00:20:52,187
You are the same age?

520
00:20:52,587 --> 00:20:55,787
(The youngest members of the group were born in 2005.)

521
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:58,227
I look younger than him, right?

522
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:00,857
You do look younger.

523
00:21:01,387 --> 00:21:02,857
- And someone told me...
- Yes!

524
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:04,557
- that you were the youngest. Yes.
- Really?

525
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:05,997
I was born later in the year.

526
00:21:05,997 --> 00:21:07,327
He was born in the Year of the Monkey.

527
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,467
But I was born in the Year of the Rooster.

528
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,037
You're a year younger than him, then.

529
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,507
No. But still.

530
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:12,937
I can memorize this.

531
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,237
(Rummaging through her bag)

532
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,947
Do you want some vitamin supplements?

533
00:21:18,947 --> 00:21:20,047
No, I'm fine.

534
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:24,817
I carry all kinds of health supplements with me.

535
00:21:25,547 --> 00:21:27,687
- I'm fine.
- I have a ton of them.

536
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:29,917
Vitamin D.

537
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:32,927
(My 20-year-old Star takes health seriously.)

538
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:35,127
(They're waiting for their sandwiches.)

539
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,667
- And what else...
- As for your outfit today,

540
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,127
it's hip like ours.

541
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:43,367
- I tried to dress up to your level.
- Gosh.

542
00:21:43,367 --> 00:21:44,367
(Subtly showing off his accessories)

543
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:46,637
- If you're going for the hip look, - Okay.

544
00:21:46,637 --> 00:21:49,237
you need to sag your pants a bit. That completes the look.

545
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:50,877
I didn't pay attention to my pants.

546
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:52,277
Lower your pants a bit.

547
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:53,477
- Lower them?
- Yes.

548
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,777
Just let your pants sit right on your hips.

549
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:57,047
My pants are too tight for that.

550
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,187
- I can't lower them further.
- You can't.

551
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:03,957
So do you see this part? This part has to sag as if I pooped.

552
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,257
My dad would scold me...

553
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,327
- if I wore them like this.
- Really?

554
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:09,257
My gosh. Why do kids these days wear their pants like that?

555
00:22:09,527 --> 00:22:12,197
When we put our phones in our pockets,

556
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:13,227
the pants slide down since they're heavy.

557
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:14,397
- That's one reason.
- Okay.

558
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,737
But this kind of style became fashionable.

559
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:17,837
- It's fashionable?
- Yes.

560
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,637
Underwear is also part of fashion.

561
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,007
- Right.
- So...

562
00:22:22,237 --> 00:22:23,977
- It's...
- I didn't go all out today, though.

563
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:26,707
I usually layer three different pairs of pants.

564
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:29,547
Three layers? Don't you get hot in summer?

565
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,647
I do. But as long as I look cool...

566
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,147
But as long as I look cool...

567
00:22:34,147 --> 00:22:35,657
(Trailing off)

568
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:36,957
I was surprised.

569
00:22:36,957 --> 00:22:39,427
I get that he's an artist and all.

570
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:42,657
But we were still filming a TV show. Two-thirds of his pants sagged.

571
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:44,867
Well,

572
00:22:45,327 --> 00:22:49,097
I could be as old as his father. He didn't show me any manners.

573
00:22:49,237 --> 00:22:51,467
First of all, he ought to pull up his pants.

574
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:52,707
(Strict Dad Kwang)

575
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,237
Why don't we go to a nail salon together sometime?

576
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:57,237
No, I don't want to get my nails done.

577
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:58,547
My nails are thin.

578
00:22:59,147 --> 00:23:01,077
Didn't your dad say something about your nails?

579
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:02,547
He said he was going to pull out my nails.

580
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,347
Exactly. Look at your nails. You're a guy.

581
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:06,347
(Another example of their generation gap)

582
00:23:06,347 --> 00:23:08,387
Come on. What is this?

583
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,927
Hey. Bring your dad to school tomorrow.

584
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,487
(Laughing)

585
00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:15,827
My dad is a gangster. Are you sure about that?

586
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,027
(Getting playful again)

587
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:19,167
He must've watched that movie a lot.

588
00:23:20,327 --> 00:23:21,527
You must have watched it a lot.

589
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,697
(After picking up the sandwiches, they go to the convenience store.)

590
00:23:24,697 --> 00:23:26,707
- We must go to a convenience store.
- That's right.

591
00:23:27,337 --> 00:23:29,307
- I have a present for you.
- What is it?

592
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:30,877
- It's a necklace.
- Okay.

593
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,177
Here.

594
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:39,117
(My Star is full of love.)

595
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,587
Thank you.

596
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,087
My gosh. I really thought he was going to give me a necklace.

597
00:23:45,287 --> 00:23:48,057
I thought I was getting a new necklace.

598
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,297
Hey. Look at this guy.

599
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:51,527
I had it with me since this morning,

600
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:52,867
- so I could give it to you.
- Really?

601
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,227
Do that to Seo Jin too later.

602
00:23:54,227 --> 00:23:55,797
- Sure. I will.
- That was great.

603
00:23:55,797 --> 00:23:59,907
(While Tom and TARZZAN share an affectionate moment...)

604
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,037
Where did YOUNGSEO go?

605
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:05,647
I think she left to spend some time by herself.

606
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:07,377
Really?

607
00:24:08,577 --> 00:24:12,787
(YOUNGSEO is sleeping soundly by herself.)

608
00:24:13,647 --> 00:24:17,217
(My Star needs more sleep lately.)

609
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,127
- Does she like spending time alone?
- Yes.

610
00:24:19,657 --> 00:24:20,757
We all like to do that.

611
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:21,857
- You guys spend time alone?
- Yes.

612
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:23,557
- You guys like being alone?
- Yes.

613
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:27,327
But the thing is that my makeup gets done fast...

614
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:28,567
- because I'm a guy.
- Yes.

615
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,697
So I'm always bored.

616
00:24:29,697 --> 00:24:30,967
Okay. I see.

617
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,767
(Is Seo Jin indifferent to guys?)

618
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:35,177
- Is this our schedule?
- Yes.

619
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,677
- Can I take a look?
- Go ahead.

620
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,747
- This is the schedule...
- Yes.

621
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:41,277
for your event today.

622
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:42,817
You didn't check it?

623
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:45,587
(Going over the schedule intently)

624
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:48,247
- I think I made a mistake.
- Okay.

625
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:50,157
This is a closed event.

626
00:24:50,317 --> 00:24:52,157
- I did a live stream yesterday.
- Okay.

627
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,897
I let it slip that I was going to this event today.

628
00:24:57,527 --> 00:24:59,997
(You know that we're attending the event tomorrow, right?)

629
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:03,237
(We didn't know about it.)

630
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:06,607
(WOOCHAN caused trouble.)

631
00:25:07,637 --> 00:25:09,337
(A mistake from WOOCHAN...)

632
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:12,577
(led to big trouble.)

633
00:25:14,377 --> 00:25:16,577
So there might be a lot of people today.

634
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,987
(At that moment, Seo Jin had no idea...)

635
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:27,027
(about the butterfly effect WOOCHAN's mistake would cause.)

636
00:25:28,287 --> 00:25:31,027
So you need to keep us safe like a bodyguard.

637
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:32,767
Don't worry about that.

638
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:35,997
I've been to many events. You know?

639
00:25:35,997 --> 00:25:37,037
- Right.
- So...

640
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:39,567
- But we're all free-spirited.
- Okay.

641
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,407
We sometimes climb over the fence.

642
00:25:42,337 --> 00:25:44,077
We sometimes climb over the fence.

643
00:25:45,747 --> 00:25:47,277
- Then...
- When we do that,

644
00:25:47,277 --> 00:25:48,647
you have to grab us and pull us down.

645
00:25:49,747 --> 00:25:51,177
You can't behave like that at events.

646
00:25:52,547 --> 00:25:53,587
Okay?

647
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:56,817
It's not your event. You must be respectful...

648
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:58,287
- of the advertisers.
- You do have a point.

649
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,097
Hey.

650
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,327
(Go.)

651
00:26:03,597 --> 00:26:05,397
- Are you done?
- No.

652
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:06,967
Can't I go in a little later?

653
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:08,967
What? What else do you need to get done?

654
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:12,307
I only have foundation on.

655
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:13,407
- You look good.
- Right?

656
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:14,607
- You don't look good.
- Should I go like this?

657
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,437
I'm sorry to be blunt.

658
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:17,637
- He looks good.
- I should stop here. It's a hassle.

659
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:19,177
You don't need to get makeup done.

660
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,777
I think your makeup is done. You know?

661
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:23,177
They have to put more layers of products on my face.

662
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:25,187
- Layers of products?
- I don't know much about them.

663
00:26:25,187 --> 00:26:26,187
(It's hard to understand the world of makeup for Seo Jin.)

664
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:28,187
- Right? He gets angrier.
- Oh, right.

665
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:33,727
Did you know Jerry has a scar on his face?

666
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:35,427
No.

667
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:38,227
It happened when he was at my house.

668
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:40,227
- Remember what I always say?
- Yes.

669
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:41,327
I tell you to sleep on my dad's sofa...

670
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:42,937
- when you get sleepy at my house.
- Yes.

671
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:46,807
He did that and then fell from the sofa.

672
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:48,537
Oh, my gosh.

673
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:49,837
- He fell asleep on the sofa.
- I didn't know...

674
00:26:49,837 --> 00:26:51,137
someone actually tried it.

675
00:26:51,137 --> 00:26:54,177
He actually tried it. He fell off when he was sleeping on the sofa.

676
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:56,417
That's how he got the scar on his forehead.

677
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,617
Really?

678
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,417
Back then, her mom was on a business trip, so she wasn't home.

679
00:27:00,587 --> 00:27:02,087
Her dad and I were having drinks.

680
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:03,857
Then I told him I was going to sleep on the sofa, so I did.

681
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:06,527
When I woke up the next morning, her dad said,

682
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:08,697
"What's wrong with your face?"

683
00:27:08,697 --> 00:27:10,627
I was like, "What?" Then my face was covered in blood.

684
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:11,927
(His face was bloody.)

685
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,767
- She was at home too.
- Yes.

686
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,237
She went, "Your face is bleeding!"

687
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:18,337
Her sister's name is Seo Jin too.

688
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:19,567
- Yes, Seo Jin.
- It's Seo Jin.

689
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:20,767
- Seo Jin saw it too.
- Right.

690
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,207
The scar is there.

691
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:23,507
- You can clearly see it.
- Right.

692
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,577
- Where?
- Right above my eyebrow.

693
00:27:24,577 --> 00:27:25,747
Yes, I can see it.

694
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,647
- I was really young back then.
- They were fascinated.

695
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:35,117
So you've been friends with her dad ever since you were kids?

696
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,517
When I was in college, her dad was in high school.

697
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:38,787
- Really?
- That's when we first met.

698
00:27:38,787 --> 00:27:40,557
Gosh, you've known each other for a long time.

699
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:42,557
I've known her mom since I was in elementary school.

700
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:43,797
- Really?
- Yes.

701
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:45,797
Then you must've known ANNIE since birth.

702
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,797
Right.

703
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,267
We met when she was little.

704
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:49,467
(They've known each other since her birth.)

705
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,807
Her dad got really good grades when he was young.

706
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:55,377
He's always been knowledgeable. He has a lot of interests too.

707
00:27:55,737 --> 00:27:57,537
- He can play the guitar too.
- Yes.

708
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:01,877
I have this favourite guitarist from a band.

709
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,317
Her dad gave me the same guitar as a present.

710
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:06,347
- Really? Which one? A Gibson?
- Yes, it was a Gibson.

711
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,317
He knew that I liked that guitar brand.

712
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:11,657
So he gave me one as a present.

713
00:28:12,227 --> 00:28:13,487
- An electric guitar?
- Yes.

714
00:28:14,687 --> 00:28:16,427
I used to learn how to play the guitar with that.

715
00:28:17,827 --> 00:28:18,897
Yes.

716
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,997
It's fun to talk to her dad.

717
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:23,697
He's so knowledgeable.

718
00:28:24,467 --> 00:28:27,267
(Flashing his dimpled smile at the mention of his old friend)

719
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,177
Wait. Our visual team...

720
00:28:30,737 --> 00:28:31,837
They're upstairs.

721
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:33,247
What's this visual team?

722
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:36,747
- They make sure we look good.
- What kind of team is that?

723
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,817
I see. There's a whole team for that?

724
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,087
- Yes. What about our nails today?
- You don't call them stylists?

725
00:28:41,747 --> 00:28:42,817
Your nails?

726
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:45,327
- They look good. What do you mean?
- What?

727
00:28:45,887 --> 00:28:48,187
I can't go to the event with these nails.

728
00:28:48,187 --> 00:28:50,327
- Why not? They look good.
- No way.

729
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:51,427
Wait, BAILEY. Do you have your nails done?

730
00:28:51,427 --> 00:28:52,527
No.

731
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:53,967
I know. So we need to do...

732
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:55,637
You need to get them done? Are they your nails?

733
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:57,537
- Yes. The tips must go on my nails.
- More tips on your nails?

734
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:58,907
- Yes.
- They're already long.

735
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,837
- It's not about the length.
- Okay.

736
00:29:00,837 --> 00:29:02,237
They look so naked.

737
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:03,907
They are bare.

738
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,347
- You want some tips on them?
- Yes.

739
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:08,177
(He found out for the first time how important nail tips are.)

740
00:29:08,177 --> 00:29:09,277
This is complicated.

741
00:29:10,617 --> 00:29:12,317
I really need to get my nail tips done now.

742
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,787
Okay. Let's do it then.

743
00:29:16,717 --> 00:29:19,757
(Looking for her nail tips)

744
00:29:20,287 --> 00:29:24,297
(He may not understand it, but he gives them everything they want.)

745
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,097
- Thank you.
- This is it, right?

746
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,497
- Yes.
- Okay. Where...

747
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:28,997
- do you want to sit? Over there?
- Yes.

748
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,367
(My Star is serious about nail art.)

749
00:29:30,367 --> 00:29:31,897
It's connected to B.

750
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:32,937
(My Star is serious about nail art.)

751
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,207
(At the same time, )

752
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,937
(BAILEY, who's done with her makeup and hair...)

753
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:46,017
(is stretching in the dance room by herself.)

754
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:52,287
(She's been dancing since she was 3.)

755
00:29:52,287 --> 00:29:54,657
(So her joints are flexible from her dance training.)

756
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:02,267
(BAILEY was the youngest member...)

757
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,597
(of a world-class dance crew, The Kinjaz.)

758
00:30:07,607 --> 00:30:08,607
(BAILEY)

759
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:14,507
(She mastered ballet, modern dance, and tap dance since she was 3.)

760
00:30:14,507 --> 00:30:15,647
(BAILEY)

761
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:21,047
(She worked as a choreographer for K-pop stars at just 14.)

762
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:22,787
(She's a respected dancer...)

763
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:26,087
(who created the choreography for aespa, Taeyang, and Lisa.)

764
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:32,027
(She's just stretching, but it looks like she's doing yoga.)

765
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:37,097
(Lying flat on the floor)

766
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:47,477
- Gosh. Are you taking turns...
- Hello.

767
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:49,647
to stretch?

768
00:30:50,977 --> 00:30:52,317
Did you eat the sandwich?

769
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,347
No, it was taking too long, so I got it to go.

770
00:30:54,347 --> 00:30:56,617
- And we got sweet potatoes.
- Sweet potatoes?

771
00:30:56,617 --> 00:30:58,087
- Yes.
- Gosh, you know what I like.

772
00:30:58,287 --> 00:30:59,287
What else did you want...

773
00:30:59,287 --> 00:31:01,087
- other than the sweet potatoes?
- Roasted sweet potatoes. Thank you.

774
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:02,297
Jelly?

775
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:03,527
- Do you have...
- Okay.

776
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:05,097
any chicken breast?

777
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,967
- Chicken breast?
- Yes.

778
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:08,397
- Thank you.
- My gosh.

779
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:09,497
What else?

780
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:10,537
I'm good now.

781
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:11,637
That's everything you wanted?

782
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,667
- Yes. I only wanted these two.
- Okay.

783
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:16,177
Your meal is simple.

784
00:31:16,177 --> 00:31:17,377
You're a good one.

785
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:18,477
Okay.

786
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:19,547
- Thank you.
- Sure.

787
00:31:19,547 --> 00:31:20,977
- Enjoy.
- I'm going to stretch here.

788
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,317
- Go ahead.
- I'll have this here.

789
00:31:22,317 --> 00:31:24,047
- Call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

790
00:31:24,047 --> 00:31:25,417
- Thank you.
- Sure.

791
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:27,287
(If you need anything, call Tom.)

792
00:31:28,547 --> 00:31:31,317
(Eating the sweet potato Tom got for her)

793
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:34,687
It took like ten minutes for him to order at the kiosk.

794
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:36,627
- Really?
- Yes.

795
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:37,727
(Laughing)

796
00:31:38,457 --> 00:31:39,997
I like Tom.

797
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:41,597
- Tom.
- Yes.

798
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,237
You know he's a movie star?

799
00:31:44,597 --> 00:31:45,707
What?

800
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:46,867
You know?

801
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:48,037
- Him?
- Yes.

802
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:49,407
Yes. I saw something.

803
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,277
- I think...
- Do you want to watch it?

804
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,447
All right.

805
00:31:54,177 --> 00:31:56,677
(Tom the movie star?)

806
00:31:58,547 --> 00:31:59,787
What does your dad do for a living?

807
00:32:00,787 --> 00:32:02,957
What does your dad do for a living?

808
00:32:03,387 --> 00:32:06,257
Your dad saves lives to put you through school.

809
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,657
But you're not even trying to study.

810
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:10,297
I'm scared.

811
00:32:10,297 --> 00:32:11,797
- Oh, Tom.
- Tom.

812
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,867
Oh, Tom.

813
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,097
(Smacking)

814
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:17,167
Go back to your seat!

815
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:19,937
If we don't listen to him, he'll do that to us.

816
00:32:19,937 --> 00:32:23,177
- Oh, Tom.
- Oh, Tom.

817
00:32:23,177 --> 00:32:25,337
(They witnessed the real side of Tom who couldn't order at the kiosk.)

818
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:30,547
(Scary Tom is delivering food as he sniffles.)

819
00:32:30,547 --> 00:32:32,017
- He's back.
- I'm back.

820
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,517
You should have some food. Eat first and then get ready.

821
00:32:34,587 --> 00:32:36,217
What did you want?

822
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:37,557
- This...
- This is what I wanted.

823
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:39,157
This one?

824
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:40,487
Is it over there?

825
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:41,627
(He rolls up his sleeves...)

826
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,727
(and starts taking care of the 5 siblings.)

827
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:48,267
- Is this what you wanted?
- That's it. Thank you.

828
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,937
- Gosh, thank you.
- One more?

829
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:52,607
- Three?
- Yes. Thank you.

830
00:32:52,607 --> 00:32:54,307
(I love it.)

831
00:32:55,037 --> 00:32:56,607
WOOCHAN, is there anything you want to eat?

832
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,047
But...

833
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,977
- I like Korean food.
- Korean food?

834
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:02,247
Yes. I'm feeling Korean food now.

835
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:03,877
What kind of Korean food?

836
00:33:04,277 --> 00:33:06,117
Food like doenjang stew.

837
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:07,617
(He loves doenjang stew.)

838
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:13,587
(He looks up Korean food on the delivery app.)

839
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,087
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes.

840
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,257
Should I order kimchi stew for you?

841
00:33:16,557 --> 00:33:17,797
- For you?
- For you.

842
00:33:18,227 --> 00:33:20,167
- Yes. We should eat with them.
- No.

843
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,497
I have to order two dishes.

844
00:33:21,497 --> 00:33:23,567
- Otherwise, I can't place an order.
- Really?

845
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:24,897
Then order both.

846
00:33:24,897 --> 00:33:26,407
(He also orders lunch for his older bestie.)

847
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:29,437
(He has some spare time after feeding the 5 siblings.)

848
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:31,077
Kwang Kyu. Sit down.

849
00:33:31,077 --> 00:33:32,577
We have an extra one here.

850
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:34,677
- Drink this.
- I'm good.

851
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:36,577
- Here's what I think.
- Yes.

852
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:40,287
So there's YOUNGSEO.

853
00:33:40,587 --> 00:33:42,317
- Yes.
- She's the youngest.

854
00:33:42,317 --> 00:33:43,917
She's the most unique one here.

855
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:47,757
What do you mean by that?

856
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:50,027
In what way?

857
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:53,967
(Picking it up with his hand)

858
00:33:55,537 --> 00:33:58,837
(Gorging on the food in case they ask for him)

859
00:33:59,707 --> 00:34:02,337
(Glancing around)

860
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:08,177
(The mother of the 5 siblings must eat quickly, as always.)

861
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:11,217
(Sniffling)

862
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,047
(The father of the 5 siblings is sniffling next to the mom.)

863
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,247
(Sniffling)

864
00:34:15,247 --> 00:34:16,617
This is driving me crazy.

865
00:34:17,987 --> 00:34:19,287
(Snorting)

866
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,727
(Itchy)

867
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:27,067
(Blowing his nose)

868
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,627
(Sniffling)

869
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:32,467
Where's the medicine box?

870
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:38,207
(He opens up the medicine box in the end.)

871
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:39,477
Gosh, darn it.

872
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:42,147
Why do you need that?

873
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:44,817
It's for you?

874
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:45,887
Yes.

875
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,957
(He can't believe Kwang Kyu.)

876
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:53,187
(Sniffling)

877
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,487
I guess the energy of this building doesn't align with mine.

878
00:34:57,997 --> 00:35:00,227
There it is. There's one for the runny and stuffy nose.

879
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:01,297
(Sniffling)

880
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:02,967
- What are you looking for?
- What?

881
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,097
What are you trying to find?

882
00:35:04,097 --> 00:35:06,567
I guess the energy of this building doesn't align with mine.

883
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,607
Why? Are you sick?

884
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,837
I'm having an allergic reaction. My nose is runny.

885
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:12,037
There must be some allergy medicine in the box.

886
00:35:12,037 --> 00:35:13,207
I found it here.

887
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:14,707
I think I can take this one.

888
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:16,047
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Okay.

889
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,017
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, no. Please take it.

890
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,517
You can't be sick.

891
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:22,987
(Laughing)

892
00:35:23,257 --> 00:35:24,687
(Groaning)

893
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:26,387
(Grunting)

894
00:35:26,387 --> 00:35:28,087
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

895
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,427
(Glancing back)

896
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:33,397
My job was taking care of these babies.

897
00:35:33,597 --> 00:35:35,497
But when I was about to, I started to sniffle.

898
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:37,397
When I was about to help them, my nose got runny.

899
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,307
I went to the bathroom and slapped myself.

900
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:42,977
I blew my nose.

901
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:44,907
I slapped myself and said, "Get a grip!" Then I came out.

902
00:35:45,207 --> 00:35:46,977
When I stepped out, my nose got runny again.

903
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:48,247
(The never-ending battle with a runny nose)

904
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:52,117
(What am I going to do with that poor guy?)

905
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,347
Tom and Jerry.

906
00:35:54,347 --> 00:35:55,417
- Yes.
- What is it?

907
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:57,087
Do you have paper cups?

908
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,617
- Paper cups? Seo Jin.
- Yes.

909
00:35:58,617 --> 00:35:59,687
- What?
- I have to put on...

910
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:01,787
(Finishing the meal as My Star asks for his help)

911
00:36:02,797 --> 00:36:05,157
We want to microwave the chicken breast.

912
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:08,227
We need something we can put in the microwave.

913
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,997
- We want to microwave this.
- You can put it in as it is.

914
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,267
- What?
- We can put it in as it is, right?

915
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:16,377
- Of course.
- It was designed for that purpose.

916
00:36:16,377 --> 00:36:17,537
- Right. This is...
- Yes.

917
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,347
- Just open the corner here.
- Yes.

918
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:21,777
- Where's the microwave?
- Where is the microwave?

919
00:36:21,777 --> 00:36:23,417
- Our contact lenses?
- The lens container?

920
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,517
- The microwave.
- It's over there.

921
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:25,647
- It's over there.
- What?

922
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:27,747
- The microwave, not contacts.
- Not contact lenses.

923
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:29,617
(Shockingly, they can understand each other.)

924
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:31,557
Run it for 30 seconds.

925
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:32,987
Where do I press?

926
00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:34,627
- No.
- Gosh.

927
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,857
(Anxiously screaming)

928
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:39,067
- Don't run it for 99 minutes.
- That's not right.

929
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:41,667
(Oh, no! My chicken breast!)

930
00:36:42,697 --> 00:36:43,867
Yes.

931
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:47,307
You saw that?

932
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:48,567
(Scary Tom saves the chicken breast.)

933
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:50,777
Mr. Manager!

934
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:51,907
Yes.

935
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:53,607
Mr. Manager!

936
00:36:53,607 --> 00:36:54,747
Yes.

937
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,017
I need coffee.

938
00:36:57,247 --> 00:36:58,377
What kind of coffee?

939
00:36:58,377 --> 00:37:00,317
- Mr. Manager!
- What?

940
00:37:00,717 --> 00:37:02,217
Tom and Jerry.

941
00:37:02,217 --> 00:37:03,757
Why are there so many shades of gray?

942
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:05,157
Tom and Jerry.

943
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:06,257
Yes.

944
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:07,787
- Seo Jin.
- Yes?

945
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:08,927
Jerry.

946
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,357
(Close, hands-on care)

947
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,097
Tom and Jerry.

948
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:15,097
Jerry. Tom.

949
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:16,797
Tom and Jerry.

950
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:18,267
- The food is here?
- Yes, it's here.

951
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:19,337
(With 5 stars to take care of, )

952
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,807
Let me clear the table and set it with food.

953
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:23,277
(they don't even have a moment to rest.)

954
00:37:24,237 --> 00:37:26,777
- Mr. Manager.
- Yes.

955
00:37:27,107 --> 00:37:29,977
- I need the lens container.
- Okay.

956
00:37:30,077 --> 00:37:33,017
Our agency has a separate box just for contact lenses.

957
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,047
Of course.

958
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:37,357
I'm wearing brown contacts now.

959
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:39,087
For my outfit today,

960
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,387
- I'm wearing a gray padded jacket.
- Okay.

961
00:37:41,387 --> 00:37:43,497
So I'll change to gray contact lenses.

962
00:37:43,557 --> 00:37:45,727
Could you kindly find them?

963
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:48,467
- This...
- Open the box.

964
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:51,697
And find them now.

965
00:37:52,397 --> 00:37:53,507
Find what?

966
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:56,677
- I'm wearing contact lenses now.
- Okay.

967
00:37:57,107 --> 00:38:00,047
I want the same ones but in gray.

968
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:03,577
I want the same ones but in gray.

969
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:07,587
(YOUNGSEO is looking for the same contacts but in gray.)

970
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:11,387
How can I find them?

971
00:38:11,387 --> 00:38:12,987
- You need to check everything now.
- What?

972
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:15,557
Pull them out and check them like this.

973
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:17,197
You can see the colours then.

974
00:38:17,257 --> 00:38:18,597
- When you compare them...
- I can't see them clearly.

975
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,997
You can find the right ones...

976
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,397
- once you compare them.
- What?

977
00:38:21,597 --> 00:38:22,937
So take a look at this now.

978
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:25,567
As you can see, the circles are smaller.

979
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:27,737
They aren't the right ones. So you keep going.

980
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:31,607
They are purple. So you keep going.

981
00:38:31,907 --> 00:38:33,047
What are you looking for now?

982
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,107
I...

983
00:38:34,107 --> 00:38:36,177
(What are you looking for now?)

984
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,317
- What are you looking for now?
- I...

985
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:42,317
- Right now, - Gray contact lenses.

986
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:44,887
- I'm wearing brown contacts.
- Okay.

987
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:45,927
- You want to change them to gray?
- But...

988
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:48,127
I want to wear the same contact lenses,

989
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:49,627
but in gray.

990
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,057
I want the same-sized contacts.

991
00:38:51,057 --> 00:38:54,827
I don't want them to have clear outer rings.

992
00:38:55,427 --> 00:38:56,837
They must be the same as these.

993
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,737
(I want the gray version of the same contact lenses.)

994
00:39:01,067 --> 00:39:02,307
They must be the same as these.

995
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,407
(Pulling back)

996
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:09,747
These are the ones.

997
00:39:09,747 --> 00:39:10,977
(These are the ones.)

998
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:13,987
These are the ones.

999
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,387
(These are the ones.)

1000
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,627
- They're not. No.
- No?

1001
00:39:19,627 --> 00:39:21,887
If you know them so well, why do you want me to find them?

1002
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:25,597
- You sound firm.
- Right.

1003
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:28,567
I can't live without these contacts.

1004
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:31,367
Are they the ones?

1005
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,307
- Did I find the right ones?
- Yes.

1006
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:35,167
Thank you.

1007
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,937
(I finally found My Star's gray contact lenses.)

1008
00:39:37,237 --> 00:39:39,377
YOUNGSEO is the most unique one...

1009
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,707
- What makes you say that?
- among the five of them.

1010
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:43,517
That's why I thought...

1011
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,847
I should pay more attention to her.

1012
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:48,017
Tom and Jerry.

1013
00:39:48,017 --> 00:39:49,047
(This time, TARZZAN is looking for his manager.)

1014
00:39:49,557 --> 00:39:51,457
I need to wear my contact lenses.

1015
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,627
- Okay.
- Do you want to wear them first?

1016
00:39:52,627 --> 00:39:53,657
You also wear contacts?

1017
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:55,927
I heard only female members wore contact lenses.

1018
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:57,927
I also wear contact lenses.

1019
00:39:57,927 --> 00:39:59,227
- You do?
- Yes.

1020
00:39:59,227 --> 00:40:00,397
So what?

1021
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:01,727
(So what?)

1022
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:03,197
So what?

1023
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:04,267
(So what?)

1024
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:05,697
- You have to help him put them on.
- I see.

1025
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:08,707
(Tom is feeling a bit loopy from the medicine.)

1026
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:09,877
You have to help him put them on.

1027
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:10,937
- I have to do that?
- Yes.

1028
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:12,537
His manager does that for him?

1029
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:15,277
Could you grab the container and get my...

1030
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:17,747
I've never worn contacts myself.

1031
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:19,687
I can't even put in eye drops.

1032
00:40:20,917 --> 00:40:22,487
I can't even put in eye drops.

1033
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:25,387
(His eyes have been eye-drop-free for 60 years.)

1034
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:27,127
When I was learning how to box,

1035
00:40:27,127 --> 00:40:28,657
I had to keep my eyes open.

1036
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:30,527
But I couldn't, so I quit boxing.

1037
00:40:31,297 --> 00:40:32,997
Could you help me?

1038
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,327
- Well, I'll give it a try.
- Okay.

1039
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:37,537
- Gray. Yes.
- Nils Gray?

1040
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,267
There's a shade called Nils Gray?

1041
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:40,537
Yes, Nils Gray.

1042
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,267
There's a shade called Nils Gray?

1043
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:43,677
Yes, Nils Gray.

1044
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:45,137
- Seo Jin.
- Yes?

1045
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:47,347
Gosh. Jerry.

1046
00:40:48,147 --> 00:40:49,717
I need Nils Gray.

1047
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,117
Nils Gray?

1048
00:40:52,177 --> 00:40:54,747
(Nils Gray)

1049
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:58,117
(The search for lenses begins again.)

1050
00:40:58,787 --> 00:41:01,627
(Extending his arm far)

1051
00:41:01,957 --> 00:41:04,957
(Observing in fascination)

1052
00:41:05,357 --> 00:41:07,267
- What does it say? Metal Gray?
- What?

1053
00:41:07,797 --> 00:41:10,097
- Nils?
- Nils Gray.

1054
00:41:10,397 --> 00:41:11,897
- Nils Gray?
- Yes.

1055
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:14,937
Could you help us, YOUNGSEO?

1056
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:18,807
There's a colour named Nils Gray?

1057
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:20,007
(She ends up helping them while having lunch.)

1058
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:22,577
- I see.
- This is it, right?

1059
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:23,817
(Spotting Nils Gray)

1060
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:25,347
- Nils Gray. This one?
- Yes.

1061
00:41:26,647 --> 00:41:29,457
(He quickly finds the contacts with YOUNGSEO's help.)

1062
00:41:30,087 --> 00:41:31,357
I found Nils Gray.

1063
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,257
There are many shades of gray.

1064
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:35,857
Then put them in for me.

1065
00:41:36,997 --> 00:41:38,057
- I have to do that?
- Yes.

1066
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:39,527
Shouldn't I wash my hands then?

1067
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:40,997
- How...
- Hold on.

1068
00:41:40,997 --> 00:41:42,327
- Why am I nervous?
- I have to use that?

1069
00:41:42,427 --> 00:41:43,867
This is going to be fun.

1070
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:45,037
I want to watch this.

1071
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:46,407
- Same here. I want to watch too.
- I want to watch them.

1072
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,407
I see. Like that?

1073
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:49,707
(Sanitizing his hands first)

1074
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,737
How? Gosh.

1075
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:52,507
Like this.

1076
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,847
- I see. I saw that.
- After that...

1077
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,777
Pull his eyelids open.

1078
00:41:58,117 --> 00:42:00,187
- Pull his eyelids open like this.
- I see.

1079
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,287
Lean back.

1080
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:03,887
Lean back.

1081
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:05,517
(Tom is a manly guy.)

1082
00:42:06,227 --> 00:42:08,757
(Determined to do it right)

1083
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:10,457
(Suddenly, it turns into a medical drama.)

1084
00:42:10,457 --> 00:42:11,627
Open them wider.

1085
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:13,797
- Pull them apart hard.
- Pull them apart hard?

1086
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,237
(Performing the transplant surgery of Nils Gray)

1087
00:42:16,237 --> 00:42:17,397
Open wider.

1088
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:23,277
(Dr. Tom is performing his first surgery at the age of 60.)

1089
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:24,477
Why is it sticking to my finger?

1090
00:42:24,477 --> 00:42:25,637
Hold on.

1091
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,447
(The lens refuses to stick, when snot sticks just fine.)

1092
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:28,847
It's like surgery.

1093
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,517
- Like LASIK surgery.
- Okay.

1094
00:42:32,347 --> 00:42:33,647
Try to relax your eyes.

1095
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:34,947
- Loosen up.
- Okay.

1096
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:36,957
Relax.

1097
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:40,427
(He fails.)

1098
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:42,027
(He fails again.)

1099
00:42:42,327 --> 00:42:44,397
(His failed attempts ruin the lens.)

1100
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:46,067
- Give me another one.
- You're...

1101
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,667
It really looks like he's performing surgery.

1102
00:42:48,897 --> 00:42:50,797
BAILEY, why don't you show him how to do it on one eye first?

1103
00:42:50,797 --> 00:42:51,897
- Yes.
- Okay.

1104
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:53,067
Are you good at this?

1105
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:54,207
Yes, I'm good at this.

1106
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:55,937
Gosh, BAILEY.

1107
00:42:55,937 --> 00:42:57,677
- Let me watch you and learn.
- Okay.

1108
00:42:57,677 --> 00:42:58,677
(Trustworthy BAILEY will try.)

1109
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:01,077
- Let me do this side.
- What?

1110
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:02,577
(He joins them as he's worried.)

1111
00:43:02,707 --> 00:43:04,647
- Should we open them wider?
- Yes.

1112
00:43:04,917 --> 00:43:06,787
- All right. Good, right?
- I did it.

1113
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,687
(It only took 3 seconds.)

1114
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:09,717
- Open his eyelids wide.
- Are you okay?

1115
00:43:09,717 --> 00:43:11,387
- My gosh. Then...
- Oh, my. His eyes...

1116
00:43:11,817 --> 00:43:14,027
(A genius doctor from California)

1117
00:43:14,027 --> 00:43:15,257
- Open his eyelids wide.
- Are you okay?

1118
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:16,857
(Gray swag is locked in.)

1119
00:43:16,857 --> 00:43:18,297
Jerry, do you want to try it?

1120
00:43:18,297 --> 00:43:19,397
You try it.

1121
00:43:19,397 --> 00:43:20,497
Let me try it.

1122
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:22,367
- You have to pull it wide.
- Okay. I got it.

1123
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,497
(Tom is out, and Jerry is in.)

1124
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,097
- Hey, TARZZAN.
- Yes?

1125
00:43:25,097 --> 00:43:26,237
Let's go.

1126
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,107
Hey. All right.

1127
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,437
(Frightened)

1128
00:43:31,437 --> 00:43:33,507
- TARZZAN. Okay.
- TARZZAN.

1129
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:35,547
Okay. Relax.

1130
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,047
- All right. Open it.
- Open it?

1131
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:39,447
- Open it wide.
- Just like that.

1132
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:40,847
(Open up. Here comes the lens.)

1133
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:49,287
(Everyone's eyes are on him as if it's real surgery.)

1134
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,167
- I got it.
- My gosh.

1135
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:56,937
(Putting in the lens)

1136
00:43:56,937 --> 00:43:58,067
- I got it.
- My gosh.

1137
00:43:58,067 --> 00:44:00,667
(Putting in the lens)

1138
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:02,537
Jerry.

1139
00:44:02,537 --> 00:44:03,877
- My gosh.
- Jerry.

1140
00:44:03,877 --> 00:44:05,007
- He did it in one go?
- Jerry.

1141
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:07,077
- Yes. He must've done this a lot.
- My gosh.

1142
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,977
(He can see out of both eyes now.)

1143
00:44:08,977 --> 00:44:10,517
Let's go, cheetah.

1144
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:11,747
Let's go, cheetah.

1145
00:44:11,747 --> 00:44:14,117
I might wear it. Should I bring the beanie?

1146
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:18,917
(ANNIE gets a call.)

1147
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:20,927
Oh, you're out and about?

1148
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:22,897
(My Star quickly answers the call.)

1149
00:44:22,897 --> 00:44:25,227
I'm filming this show.

1150
00:44:25,227 --> 00:44:28,167
But it's with Uncle Seo Jin. Like Uncle Lee Seo Jin.

1151
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:29,767
Oh, wait. Can I say hi to him?

1152
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,367
Yes. He's acting as our manager today.

1153
00:44:33,107 --> 00:44:36,377
(It sounds like the girl on the phone knows Seo Jin.)

1154
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:37,477
- Uncle.
- Yes.

1155
00:44:37,477 --> 00:44:38,737
This is Seo Jin.

1156
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:41,577
Seo Jin.

1157
00:44:41,577 --> 00:44:42,747
Hello.

1158
00:44:43,317 --> 00:44:45,017
Seo Jin is in New York.

1159
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,047
(It's ANNIE's younger sister, Seo Jin.)

1160
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:47,787
Seo Jin changed so much.

1161
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:49,717
He said you changed.

1162
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:51,757
(A proud uncle moment)

1163
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:52,857
- Taylor.
- Yes.

1164
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:54,287
We're filming now.

1165
00:44:54,287 --> 00:44:56,597
- Would you mind being on camera?
- Would you mind?

1166
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,397
- Yes, it's okay.
- Nice.

1167
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,897
(ANNIE's sister, Moon Seo Jin)

1168
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:03,637
Seo Yoon, isn't Seo Jin graduating next year?

1169
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:05,367
- She is.
- Say hi.

1170
00:45:05,797 --> 00:45:06,967
Hello.

1171
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:10,207
(See you next time, Uncle Seo Jin.)

1172
00:45:11,137 --> 00:45:12,377
- Okay. Bye, Taylor.
- Bye, Taylor.

1173
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:13,547
Love you.

1174
00:45:14,747 --> 00:45:16,147
(A proud moment...)

1175
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,977
(is fleeting.)

1176
00:45:20,747 --> 00:45:22,047
Why do you keep sniffling?

1177
00:45:23,017 --> 00:45:24,557
(Checking the time)

1178
00:45:24,557 --> 00:45:25,657
(Checking the time too)

1179
00:45:25,657 --> 00:45:27,687
- We have to head out at 2pm?
- Yes.

1180
00:45:28,357 --> 00:45:30,897
(Current time, 1pm)

1181
00:45:31,157 --> 00:45:33,597
(After checking the schedule, )

1182
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,397
(Kwang Kyu quickly starts running.)

1183
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:39,767
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

1184
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:42,137
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1185
00:45:43,137 --> 00:45:44,407
There's a sugar-free one too.

1186
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:46,037
- I was waiting for you.
- You were?

1187
00:45:46,037 --> 00:45:47,907
- You could've eaten first.
- Gosh, no.

1188
00:45:48,577 --> 00:45:50,447
- Let's eat.
- Thank you.

1189
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,277
Okay. Eat a lot.

1190
00:45:59,387 --> 00:46:01,157
(Bobbing his head)

1191
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:04,227
I'm the only one who loves Korean food.

1192
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:06,597
I mostly eat Korean food with ANNIE.

1193
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,767
The rest of them prefer...

1194
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,667
- sandwiches.
- I see. Really?

1195
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,497
I need to have a filling meal.

1196
00:46:12,497 --> 00:46:14,467
- I need soup. You know?
- Exactly.

1197
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,167
- You and I are similar.
- Yes.

1198
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,577
Can you stay on as our manager?

1199
00:46:17,577 --> 00:46:18,977
- What?
- Can you stay on as our manager?

1200
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:20,547
I can't stay on as your manager.

1201
00:46:20,747 --> 00:46:21,847
It's too much work.

1202
00:46:22,707 --> 00:46:24,647
This is a big group.

1203
00:46:24,817 --> 00:46:26,117
- It is.
- Yes.

1204
00:46:27,147 --> 00:46:28,247
By the way,

1205
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:31,157
- we have to get going in an hour.
- Yes.

1206
00:46:31,217 --> 00:46:33,557
I'm the only one who got changed.

1207
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,327
You need to find them one at a time in this building.

1208
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:37,797
- You're changed, right?
- Yes.

1209
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:38,997
Okay. Then...

1210
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:40,527
let her finish her meal.

1211
00:46:40,627 --> 00:46:42,067
She doesn't have time to eat now.

1212
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,137
Should we wrap up?

1213
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:44,397
- She needs to wrap up first.
- Right.

1214
00:46:44,397 --> 00:46:46,507
Why don't you go and get changed first?

1215
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:48,537
- Okay.
- Okay.

1216
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:50,577
Who else is left?

1217
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:52,307
My outfit...

1218
00:46:52,407 --> 00:46:53,507
Is it inside?

1219
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:55,607
I think he's in here.

1220
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:59,277
(TARZZAN and ANNIE are in here.)

1221
00:46:59,547 --> 00:47:00,987
- Ms. Zero?
- Yes?

1222
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:02,117
Okay.

1223
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:05,687
(To be precise, only WOOCHAN is nowhere to be seen.)

1224
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:09,027
(At that moment, a man crosses his mind.)

1225
00:47:10,597 --> 00:47:12,127
- WOOCHAN, stop eating.
- Stop eating.

1226
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,227
- WOOCHAN.
- Come on out.

1227
00:47:13,227 --> 00:47:15,497
(Frozen)

1228
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:18,467
You need to get changed.

1229
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:20,167
(WOOCHAN, you need to get changed.)

1230
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,267
That's good. Put down your spoon. You had enough.

1231
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:23,907
- Let's go now.
- Okay.

1232
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:27,907
I can keep eating, right?

1233
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:31,577
- Hey.
- My gosh.

1234
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:32,647
Let me have one more spoonful.

1235
00:47:32,647 --> 00:47:34,287
- Hey. Hold on.
- Come on out.

1236
00:47:34,347 --> 00:47:36,617
- We just started eating.
- What? Come out already.

1237
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,617
Let me have one more spoonful and come out.

1238
00:47:38,617 --> 00:47:40,227
- Seriously.
- My gosh.

1239
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:41,657
(Kwang Kyu has no intention of putting down his spoon.)

1240
00:47:41,657 --> 00:47:43,097
(Kwang Kyu's appetite is robust this fall.)

1241
00:47:43,097 --> 00:47:44,997
He won't even let us have our meal.

1242
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,567
How come Seo Jin always comes when I start eating?

1243
00:47:47,827 --> 00:47:49,937
It's so not fair. You know?

1244
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:52,397
Just when I have 2 or 3 spoonfuls,

1245
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:55,067
he always shows up. It's crazy.

1246
00:47:55,067 --> 00:47:57,337
I wonder if someone's feeding him information.

1247
00:47:57,907 --> 00:48:00,547
All he does is eat. I can't leave him in charge of them.

1248
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,107
He's always pigging it out.

1249
00:48:02,107 --> 00:48:04,117
I can't leave them with him.

1250
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:05,177
(Stopping him from pigging it out like a good mother)

1251
00:48:05,817 --> 00:48:09,887
(Tom's happy lunch continues.)

1252
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:12,387
(It's been a while since Jerry has been busy on his own.)

1253
00:48:12,387 --> 00:48:14,687
All right. WOOCHAN has to get changed.

1254
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:17,557
(He sounds like a mom right before her kids go to school.)

1255
00:48:17,557 --> 00:48:18,697
Do you know which one is yours?

1256
00:48:18,697 --> 00:48:20,367
- This is probably mine.
- Okay.

1257
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:22,297
- You can get changed on your own?
- Yes.

1258
00:48:22,297 --> 00:48:24,337
(Yes!)

1259
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,967
Which earrings should I wear?

1260
00:48:28,567 --> 00:48:31,607
- What do you need?
- I need earrings.

1261
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:32,777
- So...
- Earrings?

1262
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:34,877
- I need earrings.
- Okay.

1263
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:36,347
But she's gone.

1264
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:37,477
Who's gone?

1265
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:39,447
My stylist.

1266
00:48:39,817 --> 00:48:41,817
- We didn't get your earrings.
- I need your help.

1267
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:43,287
- We didn't get your earrings.
- I need your help...

1268
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,987
- because I got my hair done.
- Okay.

1269
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:48,157
- Could you just hold the front?
- Ms. Yu Mi.

1270
00:48:48,427 --> 00:48:49,727
She's not here.

1271
00:48:50,457 --> 00:48:51,527
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1272
00:48:51,727 --> 00:48:54,167
(After helping him change, he helps YOUNGSEO right away.)

1273
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,567
We don't have your earrings.

1274
00:48:55,567 --> 00:48:58,337
Ms. Yu Mi said she'd give us earrings.

1275
00:48:58,337 --> 00:48:59,737
What do you think happened?

1276
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,407
- Ms. Yu Mi?
- Yes. Ms. Yu Mi.

1277
00:49:02,907 --> 00:49:06,207
(He sets out to find Ms. Yu Mi whom he's never met before.)

1278
00:49:06,207 --> 00:49:07,977
Who's Ms. Yu Mi?

1279
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,607
(Feeling bad)

1280
00:49:09,607 --> 00:49:10,717
Ms. Yu Mi.

1281
00:49:11,347 --> 00:49:12,747
Do you know who Ms. Yu Mi is?

1282
00:49:12,747 --> 00:49:15,047
- What? Ms. Yu Mi? Is she here?
- Ms. Yu Mi.

1283
00:49:15,047 --> 00:49:16,957
- I don't know where she is.
- Have the sweet potatoes.

1284
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:19,117
- Sit down and eat.
- They're your sweet potatoes.

1285
00:49:19,117 --> 00:49:20,787
- Eat your sweet potatoes.
- I need your help again.

1286
00:49:20,787 --> 00:49:22,087
- What? Okay.
- I had mine.

1287
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:25,427
All right. Put it in.

1288
00:49:25,427 --> 00:49:27,297
(Looking for Ms. Yu Mi, urging BAILEY to eat sweet potatoes, )

1289
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,167
(helping WOOCHAN change)

1290
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:31,367
- Can you pull the shirt open?
- Sure.

1291
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:33,837
- Thank you.
- There you go.

1292
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:37,577
(All right. I just helped WOOCHAN.)

1293
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:39,177
Ms. Yu Mi.

1294
00:49:39,947 --> 00:49:41,107
- Right?
- Have the sweet potatoes.

1295
00:49:41,347 --> 00:49:43,777
(He tells her to eat sweet potatoes every time he sees her.)

1296
00:49:43,777 --> 00:49:45,777
- Ms. Yu Mi.
- Where's Ms. Yu Mi?

1297
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:47,387
(It's like an endless loop song.)

1298
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:48,547
- Turn off the microphone.
- So...

1299
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:50,657
here's how it felt for me today.

1300
00:49:51,357 --> 00:49:55,457
It felt like I was a parent spending a day out...

1301
00:49:55,687 --> 00:49:57,157
with 2 sons and 3 daughters.

1302
00:49:58,397 --> 00:50:01,067
There were five of them. And they were all different.

1303
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:02,467
So...

1304
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:05,167
it felt like I was taking care of my children today.

1305
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,297
(He sounds affectionate.)

1306
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:08,567
So I thought that not having kids was the right call.

1307
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,337
(Thanks to them, his values have gotten stronger.)

1308
00:50:11,877 --> 00:50:14,847
(Ms. Yu Mi shows up.)

1309
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:16,577
Ms. Yu Mi is here.

1310
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:18,477
Ms. Yu Mi, I need earrings.

1311
00:50:18,477 --> 00:50:20,887
(The youngest daughter's wish has come true.)

1312
00:50:21,287 --> 00:50:24,017
(It seems we're on track.)

1313
00:50:24,387 --> 00:50:27,057
(He finally sits down after a long while.)

1314
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,157
- I'm torn.
- What is it this time?

1315
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,097
- Well, - Okay.

1316
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:34,497
I'm going to wear a wig for my bangs.

1317
00:50:34,497 --> 00:50:35,927
- So I'll have full bangs.
- Okay.

1318
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,037
- I have some curls now.
- Yes.

1319
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:40,437
Should I wear my hair half-up?

1320
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:42,537
- Or should I go with a ponytail?
- A ponytail would look great.

1321
00:50:42,537 --> 00:50:43,837
- Oh, really?
- Of course.

1322
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,477
Thank you for giving me a clear answer right away.

1323
00:50:46,507 --> 00:50:47,577
Good.

1324
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:48,577
A ponytail.

1325
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:50,217
Is everyone about ready?

1326
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:51,747
- Is everyone ready?
- No.

1327
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:53,177
They're still not ready? What...

1328
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:54,517
Why does it take so long?

1329
00:50:54,517 --> 00:50:55,717
(What's taking them so long?)

1330
00:50:55,717 --> 00:50:58,587
Do you guys take this many breaks while getting ready?

1331
00:50:59,217 --> 00:51:01,827
- Is this how you usually do it?
- We need breaks in between.

1332
00:51:01,857 --> 00:51:05,597
(Fact: There are only 3 chairs, so they need to take breaks.)

1333
00:51:05,957 --> 00:51:07,097
This is tiring.

1334
00:51:07,127 --> 00:51:08,497
You guys need to wrap up soon.

1335
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:10,867
I just need to tie up my hair. Then I'm done.

1336
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,297
(I just need to tie up my hair. Then I'm done.)

1337
00:51:14,537 --> 00:51:17,177
Who gets their hair and makeup done for three hours while taking breaks?

1338
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,007
It only takes three minutes for Kwang Kyu.

1339
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:21,407
He doesn't have any hair left.

1340
00:51:21,507 --> 00:51:23,247
So he just needs to get his makeup done.

1341
00:51:23,377 --> 00:51:25,917
Usually, it only takes ten minutes for me too.

1342
00:51:26,017 --> 00:51:27,417
(This Young Fifty style was done in 10 minutes.)

1343
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,047
I asked if they were done, and they said no.

1344
00:51:29,317 --> 00:51:30,587
I kept asking, and they kept saying no.

1345
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,327
They took three breaks to get their hair done.

1346
00:51:33,787 --> 00:51:35,357
All right. We must get going.

1347
00:51:36,027 --> 00:51:38,097
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1348
00:51:40,467 --> 00:51:43,027
(Grabbing the youngest's cute bag)

1349
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:44,167
TARZZAN, do you need to grab anything?

1350
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,797
- I...
- Whose bag is this?

1351
00:51:45,797 --> 00:51:47,407
- Put it in there.
- That's mine.

1352
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:49,007
- Whose is that?
- I can never throw this out.

1353
00:51:49,007 --> 00:51:51,077
The bag looks great on you.

1354
00:51:53,307 --> 00:51:55,447
(Grabbing the padded jacket without a fuss)

1355
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:57,017
- Isn't this yours, WOOCHAN?
- Yes, it is.

1356
00:51:57,017 --> 00:51:58,077
My gosh. That's a cute bag.

1357
00:51:58,077 --> 00:51:59,747
- I'll leave it in the car.
- What?

1358
00:51:59,747 --> 00:52:01,887
(He's like a mom getting ready for the picnic.)

1359
00:52:01,887 --> 00:52:03,487
- I'll carry it.
- Yes, carry it with you.

1360
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,827
(The 5 siblings' picnic begins at last.)

1361
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:08,287
There's a version without that.

1362
00:52:08,287 --> 00:52:10,597
(3pm, the event venue in Seongsu-dong)

1363
00:52:12,227 --> 00:52:13,427
My gosh.

1364
00:52:13,427 --> 00:52:14,427
(This is the most people...)

1365
00:52:14,427 --> 00:52:15,767
Should we keep going in all the way?

1366
00:52:15,767 --> 00:52:17,097
I can go in.

1367
00:52:17,097 --> 00:52:18,167
(they've ever had in the history of the show.)

1368
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:20,907
- Three people have to sit there?
- Should I go in?

1369
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:22,867
I bumped my head on the camera.

1370
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:24,537
(More people continue to get in.)

1371
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:26,437
One more person has to sit in the back.

1372
00:52:26,437 --> 00:52:27,877
Only two people can sit in the front.

1373
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:29,747
My gosh.

1374
00:52:29,747 --> 00:52:32,147
(Considerate BAILEY moves to the back seat.)

1375
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:33,647
If three people have to sit in the back,

1376
00:52:34,247 --> 00:52:35,987
isn't it better for them to switch seats?

1377
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,517
Because we're going to play some music or something.

1378
00:52:38,557 --> 00:52:39,857
Do you want to party?

1379
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:41,757
- No.
- We'll move up the car a bit.

1380
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:43,627
My gosh.

1381
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:46,627
(The two of them switch seats for this reason.)

1382
00:52:46,627 --> 00:52:48,097
So YOUNGSEO and I...

1383
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:49,197
will just sit here and do nothing.

1384
00:52:49,197 --> 00:52:50,467
- Yes. That sounds great.
- Yes.

1385
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,097
Sitting in the front will be exhausting.

1386
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:54,937
(ALLDAY's...)

1387
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:56,907
(party vibe...)

1388
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,777
(with TARZZAN and BAILEY)

1389
00:53:00,207 --> 00:53:02,477
Could you crank up the volume a bit?

1390
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:03,677
- The volume?
- The volume?

1391
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:07,787
(Turning up the volume for a fun picnic)

1392
00:53:09,647 --> 00:53:11,487
(Mom, turn it up louder.)

1393
00:53:11,587 --> 00:53:13,557
- Louder, please.
- Louder than this?

1394
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,587
Yes.

1395
00:53:14,587 --> 00:53:16,227
(Turn it up louder, please.)

1396
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,457
(Cranking up the volume more for their fun picnic)

1397
00:53:18,457 --> 00:53:20,767
- I can't hear the bass.
- What?

1398
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,697
Could you turn it up a bit more?

1399
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:23,767
Okay.

1400
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:27,767
(Turning the volume all the way up)

1401
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:30,577
I can't hear it well.

1402
00:53:30,837 --> 00:53:32,177
I can't hear it well.

1403
00:53:32,307 --> 00:53:33,977
- Louder?
- Max it out, please.

1404
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,447
- Hey. What's up with your ears?
- Yes?

1405
00:53:35,447 --> 00:53:37,547
Did you have to fire guns a lot? You can't hear this?

1406
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,877
Fire guns?

1407
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:40,387
(His military joke is right up their alley.)

1408
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:43,187
(The mother sacrifices her hearing for her children.)

1409
00:53:43,317 --> 00:53:45,357
(Satisfied)

1410
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:49,027
(The hip-hop vibe kicks in within minutes.)

1411
00:53:49,027 --> 00:53:50,757
(The party has officially started.)

1412
00:53:50,757 --> 00:53:52,357
Open the door!

1413
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,467
(Glancing back)

1414
00:53:54,467 --> 00:53:55,797
It's a party, sir.

1415
00:53:56,567 --> 00:54:00,107
(Bouncing up and down)

1416
00:54:00,607 --> 00:54:05,007
(The 5 siblings get pumped up with the club vibe.)

1417
00:54:08,547 --> 00:54:12,647
(That's what kids these days do for fun.)

1418
00:54:13,787 --> 00:54:15,717
(Grooving)

1419
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,257
Our car is shaking.

1420
00:54:17,357 --> 00:54:19,417
(Rocking)

1421
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:21,557
(His wild side that was locked in comes out.)

1422
00:54:21,987 --> 00:54:24,527
(I knew it.)

1423
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,657
I thought that not having kids was the right call.

1424
00:54:26,657 --> 00:54:28,727
(I knew it. I thought that not having kids was the right call.)

1425
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:30,837
(What song does DJ TARZZAN play next?)

1426
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:32,097
(This is my song.)

1427
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:33,367
I say, "Yes"

1428
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:35,437
(Jerry responds to the song.)

1429
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:37,137
You guys know a lot of the old songs.

1430
00:54:38,077 --> 00:54:39,777
Is this the song you chose?

1431
00:54:40,247 --> 00:54:42,707
No. It's an old-school rap song.

1432
00:54:42,707 --> 00:54:44,047
- I see.
- They all know these songs.

1433
00:54:45,117 --> 00:54:49,017
(The cheerful vibe of ADP freely jumps between eras.)

1434
00:54:49,017 --> 00:54:51,187
(They even know the lyrics of an old song...)

1435
00:54:51,187 --> 00:54:53,387
(that came out 20 years before their birth.)

1436
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:58,857
(He grooves to the nostalgic song with his dimples.)

1437
00:54:58,857 --> 00:55:00,197
They were singing along to every song.

1438
00:55:00,197 --> 00:55:01,497
That's how it is.

1439
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:03,227
When people are well-versed in music,

1440
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:04,637
they go back in time for older songs.

1441
00:55:04,737 --> 00:55:06,367
They listen to songs from the 60s and 70s.

1442
00:55:06,867 --> 00:55:09,107
By listening to older songs,

1443
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:13,107
they show off that they know a lot about music.

1444
00:55:14,507 --> 00:55:19,017
("Purple Rain" by Prince and The Revolution from 1984)

1445
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:21,087
They know every old song.

1446
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,947
(One of the most famous songs by Prince, the superstar of his era)

1447
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:27,187
(Absorbed in the song)

1448
00:55:27,187 --> 00:55:28,527
I watched him perform in person.

1449
00:55:28,527 --> 00:55:29,627
- Really?
- Of course.

1450
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:30,657
How was it?

1451
00:55:30,657 --> 00:55:32,927
He was incredible. I went to his concert...

1452
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,667
at Madison Square Garden.

1453
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:36,597
I envy you.

1454
00:55:36,597 --> 00:55:38,337
(Sharing a common interest)

1455
00:55:38,397 --> 00:55:41,007
Then you must've seen Michael Jackson perform too.

1456
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,937
- Seriously.
- I didn't get to see him in person.

1457
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,607
But I saw Madonna.

1458
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,307
(The living relic of the MTV Era)

1459
00:55:46,307 --> 00:55:47,477
I also saw George Michael.

1460
00:55:47,747 --> 00:55:48,947
Gosh, George Michael?

1461
00:55:48,947 --> 00:55:49,977
(To ADP, performers from Seo Jin's memories are legends.)

1462
00:55:49,977 --> 00:55:52,217
I also saw Elton John and so on.

1463
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:56,417
(As they chat about the old days, )

1464
00:55:56,417 --> 00:55:57,457
We're almost there.

1465
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:59,257
Yes, we're here.

1466
00:55:59,257 --> 00:56:00,727
(they arrive in Seongsu, the hip neighbourhood.)

1467
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,257
Why are there so many people here?

1468
00:56:04,757 --> 00:56:05,757
Look over there.

1469
00:56:06,097 --> 00:56:07,567
(Amazed)

1470
00:56:08,467 --> 00:56:09,967
This is Seongsu.

1471
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:14,537
(The closer they get to the venue, the thicker the crowd becomes.)

1472
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,707
Oh, my. What's going on here?

1473
00:56:19,607 --> 00:56:21,107
(The forest of people next to Seoul Forest)

1474
00:56:21,107 --> 00:56:22,407
Please keep on moving!

1475
00:56:23,777 --> 00:56:25,277
My gosh, you guys are super popular.

1476
00:56:25,277 --> 00:56:26,847
- You're so popular.
- Seriously.

1477
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:28,617
- It's crazy in Seongsu-dong.
- It's crazy.

1478
00:56:28,617 --> 00:56:29,987
Seriously. Gosh.

1479
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:31,817
(Cameras are on standby.)

1480
00:56:31,817 --> 00:56:33,417
I guess they are really trending nowadays.

1481
00:56:33,417 --> 00:56:35,027
Gosh, this is crazy.

1482
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:36,997
(ANNIE, hurry and get here.)

1483
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,857
It's dangerous. Please move in, everyone.

1484
00:56:39,857 --> 00:56:42,467
(Many guards have been dispatched for safety reasons.)

1485
00:56:42,827 --> 00:56:47,107
(Seeing the big crowd makes him nervous.)

1486
00:56:49,107 --> 00:56:54,547
(He goes over the manual again just in case.)

1487
00:56:57,317 --> 00:57:00,317
(The 5 siblings also seem nervous at the big crowd of their fans.)

1488
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:01,617
- It's so crowded in Seongsu.
- Seongsu...

1489
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:03,987
There are so many people here.

1490
00:57:07,087 --> 00:57:08,487
Don't get out until I open the door for you.

1491
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:09,557
- Okay.
- Okay.

1492
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,667
- That was cool.
- Seriously. It really was.

1493
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:15,627
(My gosh, Jerry is so cool.)

1494
00:57:17,297 --> 00:57:22,407
(They arrive at the promotional event.)

1495
00:57:23,437 --> 00:57:28,007
(ADP's bodyguard, Seo Jin, gets out first.)

1496
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:29,307
Where can we park our car?

1497
00:57:29,577 --> 00:57:30,817
- How do we park here?
- Valet parking is provided.

1498
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:32,947
- Will the valet come right away?
- Yes.

1499
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:36,247
(Kwang Kyu also gets out while carrying the 5 siblings' bag.)

1500
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:37,317
Hello.

1501
00:57:37,317 --> 00:57:39,857
- Hello. Yes, here's the key.
- Is the key inside?

1502
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:43,527
(And ADP...)

1503
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:47,627
(gets ready to meet the fans too.)

1504
00:57:48,067 --> 00:57:52,837
(Only after Seo Jin thoroughly checks everything, )

1505
00:57:53,197 --> 00:57:56,437
(they proceed with the pop-up event.)

1506
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:57,607
The press wall is over there.

1507
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:01,107
(I can't believe I'm seeing ADP in person.)

1508
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:03,377
(Chattering)

1509
00:58:03,377 --> 00:58:05,117
She looks so beautiful. Oh, my.

1510
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:11,657
(They walk over to the press wall with a calm facial expression.)

1511
00:58:12,217 --> 00:58:16,087
(ANNIE is the last one to join them.)

1512
00:58:16,657 --> 00:58:21,227
(They stand at the press wall before the event.)

1513
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:23,697
(So many of their fans came to the pop-up event...)

1514
00:58:23,697 --> 00:58:25,567
(thanks to WOOCHAN's slip-up.)

1515
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:29,507
(Languages from all over the world are spoken at this bustling venue.)

1516
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:33,607
(The 5 siblings are working hard like professionals.)

1517
00:58:33,607 --> 00:58:38,317
(Parents Tom and Jerry are proudly watching them from afar.)

1518
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:41,417
Their lives changed within 4 to 5 months.

1519
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:42,887
I wonder how that feels.

1520
00:58:44,417 --> 00:58:47,457
It's a weekday. I didn't know it'd be that crowded.

1521
00:58:48,427 --> 00:58:50,527
The rush you feel when your career takes off...

1522
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,627
and fans swarm around you...

1523
00:58:53,297 --> 00:58:54,797
is unforgettable.

1524
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,967
You'll never experience the same excitement you felt...

1525
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:59,597
at the beginning of your career ever again.

1526
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:02,867
My gosh. My career should've taken off like theirs.

1527
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:05,107
You tried it for 20 years, but it never happened for you.

1528
00:59:05,107 --> 00:59:06,107
- What?
- Right?

1529
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:08,447
(Laughing)

1530
00:59:09,747 --> 00:59:12,077
(Amidst the many cameras that capture ALLDAY PROJECT, )

1531
00:59:12,077 --> 00:59:15,487
(a few cameras show an unusual taste.)

1532
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,827
(He responds with his dimples.)

1533
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:23,427
- We'll get going now.
- Please hurry.

1534
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:25,897
(Seo Jin approaches.)

1535
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:27,067
Come this way.

1536
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,197
(The quick-witted Seo Jin escorts them.)

1537
00:59:30,197 --> 00:59:31,337
We'll get going now.

1538
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:39,207
(Thanks to Seo Jin, they move to the venue without delay.)

1539
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:43,107
(The next schedule is a media interview.)

1540
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:45,217
Who are the people in here?

1541
00:59:46,247 --> 00:59:47,247
Media people.

1542
00:59:48,617 --> 00:59:50,147
- Hello.
- Hello.

1543
00:59:50,147 --> 00:59:51,687
(About 20 teams are on standby.)

1544
00:59:51,857 --> 00:59:53,857
We'll begin the media interview.

1545
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:55,387
(The media interview begins.)

1546
00:59:56,257 --> 00:59:57,497
Please look this way.

1547
00:59:57,897 --> 01:00:00,197
Please wait. We'll take some photos.

1548
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,167
Please step back.

1549
01:00:02,167 --> 01:00:03,967
We need some space for filming. We're sorry.

1550
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:06,497
- We'll take some photos.
- Are we doing it here?

1551
01:00:07,907 --> 01:00:10,837
(Assessing the situation)

1552
01:00:12,377 --> 01:00:13,637
(He moves quickly.)

1553
01:00:13,637 --> 01:00:14,747
- Excuse me.
- This...

1554
01:00:15,777 --> 01:00:17,217
Where will we have the media interview?

1555
01:00:17,877 --> 01:00:19,947
Shall we have the media interview over here?

1556
01:00:19,947 --> 01:00:21,517
(Jerry quickly fixes the problem.)

1557
01:00:21,517 --> 01:00:23,287
This way? At first...

1558
01:00:23,447 --> 01:00:26,057
- Wait here for a second.
- Thank you.

1559
01:00:26,487 --> 01:00:27,487
Here.

1560
01:00:27,487 --> 01:00:29,627
(He becomes their bodyguard as well.)

1561
01:00:30,597 --> 01:00:32,557
(Dependable)

1562
01:00:32,557 --> 01:00:35,127
- They're like Mom and Dad.
- I know.

1563
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:36,527
It hasn't begun yet.

1564
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:38,467
How will the media interview proceed?

1565
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:40,637
- Media people are coming.
- Okay.

1566
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,207
At that spot...

1567
01:00:42,207 --> 01:00:44,577
- Which spot?
- Behind that thing over here.

1568
01:00:44,737 --> 01:00:46,707
- Here?
- Here,

1569
01:00:46,707 --> 01:00:49,347
Two interviews will take place here.

1570
01:00:49,507 --> 01:00:51,947
All right. We'll proceed with the interview.

1571
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:56,347
For this, TARZZAN and BAILEY...

1572
01:00:56,347 --> 01:00:58,317
- You know the Rice Barley Game.
- Yes.

1573
01:00:58,317 --> 01:01:01,527
"Rice, rice, Salomon." When you say that,

1574
01:01:01,627 --> 01:01:04,997
other members will give a judging look.

1575
01:01:04,997 --> 01:01:05,997
Then...

1576
01:01:05,997 --> 01:01:07,097
Do they need to act as well?

1577
01:01:07,827 --> 01:01:09,567
Why are you making them act for an interview?

1578
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:10,667
(Checking the details)

1579
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,997
It's for the fans.

1580
01:01:12,397 --> 01:01:14,337
- Afterward...
- Rice, rice, Salomon.

1581
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,537
- They say their comments.
- Yes.

1582
01:01:15,537 --> 01:01:18,037
- Rice, rice, Salomon.
- Will they take turns?

1583
01:01:18,037 --> 01:01:20,277
- I usually do this.
- Okay.

1584
01:01:20,277 --> 01:01:22,877
- Then YOUNGSEO will follow.
- She'll follow. Okay.

1585
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:25,817
(Jerry checks the details meticulously.)

1586
01:01:26,117 --> 01:01:27,117
Rice.

1587
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,647
Rice.

1588
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:30,047
Rice. Salomon.

1589
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:33,517
Thank you. Here comes the next one.

1590
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:34,957
- Bye.
- Bye.

1591
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:38,097
Thank you. Who's next?

1592
01:01:38,357 --> 01:01:40,357
- Hello.
- Hello.

1593
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:45,067
- I'll move away and come back.
- Okay.

1594
01:01:45,067 --> 01:01:46,097
(He checks the next schedule while My Star has an interview.)

1595
01:01:46,797 --> 01:01:49,767
(Why is he checking so meticulously?)

1596
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:54,047
For the media interview, each media only gets ten minutes.

1597
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:58,177
If it goes over ten minutes, you need to cut them off.

1598
01:01:58,547 --> 01:01:59,747
Cutting things off is our specialty,

1599
01:02:01,247 --> 01:02:02,917
- Seo Jin is good at it.
- I see.

1600
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,017
That won't be a problem.

1601
01:02:04,457 --> 01:02:07,057
(They need to have an interview with about 10 teams.)

1602
01:02:07,427 --> 01:02:10,187
(It's 10 minutes per team.)

1603
01:02:10,697 --> 01:02:14,167
- ALLDAY PROJECT! Salomon, come on!
- ALLDAY PROJECT! Salomon, come on!

1604
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:15,267
(10 minutes)

1605
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:17,467
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1606
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,067
- Thank you.
- For the next one, go there.

1607
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:20,737
- Okay.
- "Cosmopolitan"

1608
01:02:23,037 --> 01:02:25,207
How are our managers of the day?

1609
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:26,777
- They're so nice.
- Aren't they cool?

1610
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:27,877
The tempo is the best right now.

1611
01:02:29,247 --> 01:02:30,507
- Here.
- He's smiling more.

1612
01:02:30,507 --> 01:02:31,717
- Where?
- Here.

1613
01:02:31,817 --> 01:02:33,617
- Here.
- This way. Here.

1614
01:02:33,877 --> 01:02:35,047
Hello.

1615
01:02:35,047 --> 01:02:36,447
(The interview goes smoothly.)

1616
01:02:36,447 --> 01:02:38,787
We'll film two reels.

1617
01:02:38,787 --> 01:02:40,287
The first one is this.

1618
01:02:40,287 --> 01:02:43,387
(Unlike other teams, this media team prepared a parody video.)

1619
01:02:43,787 --> 01:02:45,127
- Oh, my goodness.
- No.

1620
01:02:45,727 --> 01:02:46,727
- Oh, my goodness.
- No.

1621
01:02:46,727 --> 01:02:47,727
How will we do that?

1622
01:02:47,727 --> 01:02:48,997
Just like this,

1623
01:02:48,997 --> 01:02:51,367
- cover your face and move.
- Cover your face.

1624
01:02:51,437 --> 01:02:53,767
Cover your face and move it to the bottom.

1625
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:54,767
(It's a request for a difficult dance challenge.)

1626
01:02:55,437 --> 01:02:57,107
The second one is this.

1627
01:02:58,607 --> 01:03:01,647
(He checks the video himself.)

1628
01:03:02,907 --> 01:03:03,947
We'll proceed with this.

1629
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,117
It's excessive.

1630
01:03:05,117 --> 01:03:06,617
I don't think we can do that.

1631
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:09,147
- It's excessive.
- We received a video in advance.

1632
01:03:09,147 --> 01:03:10,887
- What was the 1st one?
- This is the 1st one.

1633
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,687
They don't stick in their faces.

1634
01:03:12,687 --> 01:03:14,987
They'll hide their faces and move.

1635
01:03:14,987 --> 01:03:17,087
They can't do that either.

1636
01:03:17,957 --> 01:03:19,227
You can't suddenly give them a difficult challenge.

1637
01:03:19,227 --> 01:03:20,867
Is there a doable one between the two?

1638
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:22,867
No. They can't do either.

1639
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:24,167
(Jerry clears the situation sternly.)

1640
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,867
- They can't do either.
- Our agency...

1641
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:27,367
They can't do either.

1642
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:28,667
Both of them are too hard.

1643
01:03:28,807 --> 01:03:29,867
In that case,

1644
01:03:29,867 --> 01:03:32,037
we'll get a close-up shot of each member...

1645
01:03:32,037 --> 01:03:33,177
and proceed with the interview.

1646
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,507
- Okay.
- Then we'll do this last.

1647
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:36,507
- Okay.
- Okay.

1648
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:38,747
Let's check the microphone.

1649
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:39,817
(Why did you refuse sternly?)

1650
01:03:39,817 --> 01:03:41,717
When I go to an event,

1651
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:44,157
I want my manager to do those things.

1652
01:03:44,557 --> 01:03:47,927
It's up to the manager to protect the celebrity.

1653
01:03:47,927 --> 01:03:48,927
(His work was based on his experience.)

1654
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:50,697
- Let's wrap up...
- Okay.

1655
01:03:50,697 --> 01:03:52,057
- after a few more photos.
- Okay.

1656
01:03:53,727 --> 01:03:56,497
- Jerry has leadership.
- It's very...

1657
01:03:56,497 --> 01:03:59,567
- He's relaxed.
- Jerry's management is great.

1658
01:03:59,797 --> 01:04:00,807
He has leadership.

1659
01:04:00,807 --> 01:04:02,737
- We love it.
- Seriously, we love it.

1660
01:04:04,977 --> 01:04:06,237
That's good.

1661
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:10,547
(Things go smoothly.)

1662
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:13,977
(10 minutes)

1663
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:16,187
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1664
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:18,817
Please strike a cool pose.

1665
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:21,357
Stop. They can't do that. Let's get going.

1666
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,887
Please strike a cool pose.

1667
01:04:23,857 --> 01:04:28,127
(Jerry protects My Star if they don't follow the rules.)

1668
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,067
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

1669
01:04:30,297 --> 01:04:31,497
- He's scary.
- Jerry.

1670
01:04:31,497 --> 01:04:32,497
(They marvel at his charisma.)

1671
01:04:32,497 --> 01:04:33,637
He's the leader.

1672
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,437
He's cool.

1673
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:37,507
Jerry is working hard right now.

1674
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,237
- Jerry's charisma is insane today.
- I know.

1675
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:41,477
- He's so charismatic today.
- Jerry.

1676
01:04:42,647 --> 01:04:43,647
"No."

1677
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:45,177
- He was stern.
- He was stern.

1678
01:04:45,177 --> 01:04:47,887
- "No." - I've never seen a manager...

1679
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:49,817
with such a stern attitude.

1680
01:04:50,147 --> 01:04:51,787
He was so stern.

1681
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:54,387
He did so well...

1682
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:57,557
that we could depend on him. He was trustworthy.

1683
01:04:58,097 --> 01:05:00,297
- We're hungry.
- We need food.

1684
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:02,467
Since everyone is hungry, let's eat pizza...

1685
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:03,567
and practice.

1686
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,667
(A snack to sate My Star's hunger)

1687
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:08,307
- My goodness.
- Earlier...

1688
01:05:08,907 --> 01:05:10,037
We're hungry.

1689
01:05:10,737 --> 01:05:13,637
The pizzas look as nice as you guys.

1690
01:05:13,707 --> 01:05:14,877
They don't look like us.

1691
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,047
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1692
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:18,417
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy the food.

1693
01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:22,187
There's so much seafood.

1694
01:05:22,187 --> 01:05:23,187
(There is a pizza that's full of seafood toppings.)

1695
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:25,617
It has whole corn and shrimp.

1696
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:27,157
It really is whole corn.

1697
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:28,287
(There's also a pizza with whole corn and shrimp.)

1698
01:05:28,287 --> 01:05:30,257
Seafood and cream cheese go really well together.

1699
01:05:30,257 --> 01:05:31,457
(Eating)

1700
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:33,697
- This brand is very popular.
- It's so tasty.

1701
01:05:33,827 --> 01:05:35,967
I often order their pizza. I ordered a sweet potato pizza...

1702
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:37,097
- yesterday.
- Me too.

1703
01:05:37,197 --> 01:05:38,297
- Really?
- Yes.

1704
01:05:38,297 --> 01:05:39,467
It's tasty.

1705
01:05:39,467 --> 01:05:43,837
It was your first time going to an event with a group.

1706
01:05:44,177 --> 01:05:45,577
- That's the thing with an event.
- Okay.

1707
01:05:45,877 --> 01:05:47,077
It was different from going alone, right?

1708
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,677
If you start meeting their demands, there'll be no end.

1709
01:05:50,507 --> 01:05:51,717
You need to stop them at some point.

1710
01:05:51,717 --> 01:05:53,847
- It's no wonder you did so well.
- You stopped them...

1711
01:05:53,847 --> 01:05:55,347
You stopped them sternly.

1712
01:05:55,417 --> 01:05:56,447
You need to stop them sternly.

1713
01:05:56,517 --> 01:05:59,087
We were comfortable since you stopped them sternly.

1714
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:01,457
- "No!" - "This is where it stops."

1715
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,357
(He feels proud.)

1716
01:06:03,357 --> 01:06:06,457
You protected us better than our managers.

1717
01:06:06,457 --> 01:06:07,827
- You were dependable.
- Yes.

1718
01:06:08,027 --> 01:06:09,827
THEBLACKLABEL should recruit him.

1719
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:13,067
We strongly recommend that you join THEBLACKLABEL.

1720
01:06:13,067 --> 01:06:14,267
(My Star is highly satisfied with the secretaries' care.)

1721
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,467
I never heard that while filming My Grumpy Secretary.

1722
01:06:16,467 --> 01:06:17,807
There was one more thing that I liked.

1723
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:20,877
When you have a schedule like that, you become exhausted and down.

1724
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:24,047
But looking at Tom's face made me happy.

1725
01:06:24,277 --> 01:06:26,777
- He spread happiness to everyone.
- That's right.

1726
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:29,317
(Embarrassed)

1727
01:06:29,487 --> 01:06:30,717
This pizza is tasty.

1728
01:06:30,717 --> 01:06:32,187
(Pizza is especially tasty today.)

1729
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:33,317
It was very nice.

1730
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,657
For how many hours do you need to practice?

1731
01:06:36,727 --> 01:06:38,597
It's up to Instructor BAI.

1732
01:06:40,197 --> 01:06:42,727
While there isn't a leader,

1733
01:06:43,097 --> 01:06:45,967
BAILEY is in charge of everything when it comes to dance.

1734
01:06:47,067 --> 01:06:48,167
She's the dance leader.

1735
01:06:48,167 --> 01:06:49,337
(ADP's dance leader)

1736
01:06:49,337 --> 01:06:50,977
- If she says, "One more time..." - Does BAILEY have to like it?

1737
01:06:50,977 --> 01:06:52,177
- Yes.
- "One more time."

1738
01:06:52,177 --> 01:06:54,007
(A former choreographer, BAILEY will lead...)

1739
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:56,007
(a dance practice for the new song...)

1740
01:06:56,007 --> 01:06:57,477
(with 18 days remaining until the comeback.)

1741
01:06:57,677 --> 01:06:59,317
You need to stretch, right?

1742
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:00,377
- Yes.
- Yes.

1743
01:07:00,477 --> 01:07:03,247
You should stretch your body after today's long car ride.

1744
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:05,157
Shall I stretch my body as well?

1745
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:09,457
(Laughing)

1746
01:07:12,097 --> 01:07:13,297
My goodness.

1747
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:14,597
(Stretching)

1748
01:07:15,797 --> 01:07:17,097
(My Star is very flexible.)

1749
01:07:17,097 --> 01:07:18,337
YOUNGSEO.

1750
01:07:18,997 --> 01:07:20,037
Suddenly...

1751
01:07:20,567 --> 01:07:21,767
She's falling asleep like that.

1752
01:07:21,767 --> 01:07:23,507
(The half-century-old managers can't take their eyes off.)

1753
01:07:24,167 --> 01:07:26,237
Suddenly, all eyes are on me.

1754
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:27,777
I feel so embarrassed.

1755
01:07:29,607 --> 01:07:32,347
(The 5 My Stars are stretching in 5 different ways.)

1756
01:07:32,977 --> 01:07:35,447
(Sliding)

1757
01:07:36,017 --> 01:07:37,787
(With a serene smile on her face, )

1758
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,087
(she stretches in an extraordinary way.)

1759
01:07:39,087 --> 01:07:40,287
Suddenly...

1760
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:44,327
(He can't believe his eyes.)

1761
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:47,027
Have you done gymnastics?

1762
01:07:47,967 --> 01:07:49,227
- Gymnastics.
- My goodness.

1763
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:52,667
(My Star stretches in an extraordinary way.)

1764
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:54,437
(They're jealous of their young joints.)

1765
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,437
It's no joke.

1766
01:07:57,007 --> 01:08:00,807
(After stretching, they practice the dance for the new song.)

1767
01:08:01,207 --> 01:08:02,207
(With BAILEY's lead, they check the moves without music.)

1768
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:03,547
Move this way.

1769
01:08:04,477 --> 01:08:09,217
Seven, eight. One more time, one more time.

1770
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:10,547
(Which song will My Stars practice today?)

1771
01:08:10,547 --> 01:08:14,527
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight.

1772
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:17,257
(Upon release, their new song took the charts by storm.)

1773
01:08:20,897 --> 01:08:26,597
(It's characterized by the fast beat and fancy dance moves.)

1774
01:08:27,367 --> 01:08:29,237
Shall we dance to music now, Instructor BAI?

1775
01:08:30,167 --> 01:08:31,637
Instructor BAI isn't satisfied.

1776
01:08:31,637 --> 01:08:33,437
- Instructor BAI isn't satisfied.
- She isn't satisfied.

1777
01:08:33,507 --> 01:08:34,777
- Instructor BAI.
- Instructor BAI.

1778
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:36,477
- Just come.
- Instructor BAI, dance with us.

1779
01:08:36,477 --> 01:08:38,447
- Dance with us.
- Please.

1780
01:08:38,617 --> 01:08:40,177
- Please.
- Just come, Instructor BAI.

1781
01:08:40,177 --> 01:08:43,387
(All members of ADP will check the details to the music.)

1782
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:46,057
- Please raise the volume.
- Please raise the volume.

1783
01:08:46,057 --> 01:08:47,057
Let's make it intense.

1784
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:48,927
(Music, )

1785
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:50,957
(cue!)

1786
01:08:54,397 --> 01:08:55,997
(Grooving)

1787
01:08:57,297 --> 01:08:58,897
(Wait, you sure you could keep up?)

1788
01:09:09,577 --> 01:09:11,117
(Wait, you sure you could keep up?)

1789
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:15,387
(The tempo is fast and there's no break between the moves.)

1790
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:19,357
(His eyes go wide.)

1791
01:09:24,397 --> 01:09:25,527
I messed up.

1792
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:27,097
Where did you mess up?

1793
01:09:27,097 --> 01:09:28,297
I messed up the formation.

1794
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:32,367
(My Stars' intense performance puts them in a daze.)

1795
01:09:32,697 --> 01:09:34,267
It's better that way.

1796
01:09:34,267 --> 01:09:35,307
Instructor BAI, I'm exhausted.

1797
01:09:36,537 --> 01:09:37,637
Do you want to shoot it though?

1798
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:39,437
- Sure.
- Yes.

1799
01:09:39,437 --> 01:09:40,477
- Right away?
- Yes.

1800
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:41,577
- Right away?
- Would you...

1801
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:42,647
- What?
- Would you film us?

1802
01:09:42,647 --> 01:09:44,577
- The monitoring video.
- Teach him the moves.

1803
01:09:44,817 --> 01:09:45,817
The moves?

1804
01:09:46,377 --> 01:09:48,347
Go with the feel. It's like this.

1805
01:09:48,947 --> 01:09:50,217
- Okay.
- Move the camera to the beat.

1806
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:51,387
It's like this.

1807
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,157
(He has filmed a challenge before.)

1808
01:09:53,157 --> 01:09:54,157
Okay.

1809
01:09:54,157 --> 01:09:56,227
(A lesson on the camera moves)

1810
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:58,757
(Focused)

1811
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,767
(After the last lyrics, "Night,")

1812
01:10:02,767 --> 01:10:04,567
(shake the camera with your hands.)

1813
01:10:07,907 --> 01:10:09,007
(He shakes his butt only.)

1814
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:12,037
(Did I do it wrong?)

1815
01:10:12,037 --> 01:10:13,107
No, do this.

1816
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:14,337
- Tu, ru, ru, - Like what you did with Yunho.

1817
01:10:14,337 --> 01:10:15,707
- When you hear "Night..." - Like this?

1818
01:10:15,707 --> 01:10:16,777
- Yes.
- Yes.

1819
01:10:16,807 --> 01:10:18,117
- When you hear "Night..." - "Night?"

1820
01:10:18,117 --> 01:10:20,377
- "Night." Tu, ru, ru.
- Like this? "Night." Tu, ru, ru.

1821
01:10:20,377 --> 01:10:22,047
- Do it to the beat.
- Okay.

1822
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:23,347
Listen to the music.

1823
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:25,657
- Where does it start?
- Okay.

1824
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:28,857
(They practice to the music.)

1825
01:10:30,387 --> 01:10:31,857
Five, six, seven.

1826
01:10:32,057 --> 01:10:33,697
(Focused)

1827
01:10:36,927 --> 01:10:38,837
(Dancing)

1828
01:10:39,337 --> 01:10:40,867
(Shaking his entire body)

1829
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:44,737
(His entire body is sync.)

1830
01:10:45,137 --> 01:10:47,907
(His movements are quite different from what she has taught.)

1831
01:10:47,907 --> 01:10:48,907
Stop.

1832
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:52,917
You need to stop once.

1833
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:54,377
(Stop?)

1834
01:10:54,377 --> 01:10:56,017
(Freezing, unfreezing)

1835
01:10:57,247 --> 01:10:58,687
(Shaking)

1836
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:01,987
(He shakes his butt instead of his hands.)

1837
01:11:01,987 --> 01:11:03,487
(Hands-on coaching)

1838
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:04,727
Then you move it up.

1839
01:11:04,997 --> 01:11:06,197
At the end, move it up.

1840
01:11:06,357 --> 01:11:08,127
At first, begin like this.

1841
01:11:08,127 --> 01:11:09,397
Boom, boom, boom.

1842
01:11:09,597 --> 01:11:11,567
- At first, I do this.
- From the bottom. Yes.

1843
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:12,567
From the bottom.

1844
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:13,597
(Start by moving the camera upward from the bottom.)

1845
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:16,537
- This is hard.
- This is hard.

1846
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:18,707
We don't know exactly when we shake the camera.

1847
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:19,977
- It's confusing.
- We'll tell you.

1848
01:11:20,807 --> 01:11:23,077
(My Stars' repeated lesson)

1849
01:11:24,677 --> 01:11:26,277
(Shaking his head)

1850
01:11:29,647 --> 01:11:31,417
Three times?

1851
01:11:31,857 --> 01:11:33,157
You shake the camera three times.

1852
01:11:33,157 --> 01:11:34,557
- No, two times.
- Two times?

1853
01:11:34,887 --> 01:11:36,187
I really want to do well.

1854
01:11:36,727 --> 01:11:37,997
Memorize it by numbers.

1855
01:11:37,997 --> 01:11:40,857
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1856
01:11:40,857 --> 01:11:42,767
- One, two, three, four, five.
- One, two, three, four, five.

1857
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:45,097
- Shake. You do it at five.
- Shake.

1858
01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:46,137
Five?

1859
01:11:46,867 --> 01:11:47,867
Five?

1860
01:11:50,207 --> 01:11:51,207
I'll count.

1861
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:53,337
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1862
01:11:53,337 --> 01:11:55,007
I'll count. You try it.

1863
01:11:55,007 --> 01:11:56,507
Just let the beat control your body.

1864
01:11:56,507 --> 01:11:57,547
Okay.

1865
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:00,517
- Think that you're dancing with us.
- Dance with me now.

1866
01:12:00,517 --> 01:12:01,617
- Okay.
- Dance with me now

1867
01:12:03,447 --> 01:12:05,557
It comes up from the bottom, right? When do I do it?

1868
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:06,957
- You know the timing, right?
- Yes.

1869
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:09,287
- Ready...
- A bit closer.

1870
01:12:09,457 --> 01:12:11,197
(Fine-tuning the location)

1871
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:13,327
Ready. Roll.

1872
01:12:15,227 --> 01:12:17,097
(My Stars are ready.)

1873
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:19,367
Go up.

1874
01:12:19,437 --> 01:12:20,467
(Filming points)

1875
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:24,307
(Start by moving the camera upward from the bottom.)

1876
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:26,207
(Shake at the end of "One more time to the night.")

1877
01:12:26,207 --> 01:12:28,307
(Keeping still)

1878
01:12:30,747 --> 01:12:33,047
(Shake the hands at "Night.")

1879
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:35,587
(Laughing)

1880
01:12:39,417 --> 01:12:41,757
(I don't know anymore.)

1881
01:12:43,187 --> 01:12:44,927
- Now is the time!
- Shake!

1882
01:12:44,927 --> 01:12:46,197
(Shake!)

1883
01:12:46,327 --> 01:12:47,457
(Now is the time!)

1884
01:12:47,457 --> 01:12:49,067
(Shake!)

1885
01:12:49,267 --> 01:12:50,897
- Now is the time!
- Shake!

1886
01:12:50,897 --> 01:12:52,267
(Shaking endlessly)

1887
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:56,307
(They can't stifle their laughter.)

1888
01:12:57,067 --> 01:12:59,907
(Insane shaking)

1889
01:13:01,347 --> 01:13:03,107
- Oh, my.
- Why...

1890
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:05,247
(Collapsing)

1891
01:13:07,477 --> 01:13:09,387
(Crying)

1892
01:13:09,387 --> 01:13:12,387
How are you guys not laughing?

1893
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:14,057
I was laughing the whole time.

1894
01:13:14,357 --> 01:13:16,957
How can you guys be so serious?

1895
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:17,957
(His camera moves were quite shocking.)

1896
01:13:17,957 --> 01:13:19,527
It was impossible not to laugh.

1897
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:22,427
- It was so confusing.
- It was so confusing.

1898
01:13:23,397 --> 01:13:25,167
I tried to do better, but it didn't work.

1899
01:13:25,697 --> 01:13:27,867
- You shook the camera too much.
- Was it excessive?

1900
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,347
It's pretty good.

1901
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:43,647
(He cut off WOOCHAN.)

1902
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:44,987
He's exhausted now.

1903
01:13:46,457 --> 01:13:47,687
He shook it hard.

1904
01:13:48,527 --> 01:13:50,587
- He shook it too much.
- It's like an earthquake.

1905
01:13:50,587 --> 01:13:51,897
(The earthquake shot)

1906
01:13:52,497 --> 01:13:54,457
(You can't make out My Stars.)

1907
01:13:54,457 --> 01:13:55,867
You can't use this.

1908
01:13:57,097 --> 01:13:58,137
You can't use this.

1909
01:13:58,137 --> 01:13:59,297
(Gosh, they can't use this.)

1910
01:13:59,697 --> 01:14:01,507
- I'm exhausted.
- Oh, no. His wrists hurt.

1911
01:14:01,507 --> 01:14:02,567
(He's out of energy.)

1912
01:14:02,567 --> 01:14:05,977
Since you got exhausted, you shook the camera too hard.

1913
01:14:06,337 --> 01:14:08,307
Seo Jin will try it this time.

1914
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:10,277
- How will he do?
- How will he do?

1915
01:14:10,577 --> 01:14:12,677
- I can't film it.
- Try it.

1916
01:14:12,877 --> 01:14:14,047
I don't know when to shake the camera.

1917
01:14:14,047 --> 01:14:15,887
You'll figure out when to shake the camera.

1918
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:17,417
You can do it.

1919
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:18,457
(When to shake the camera?)

1920
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:19,957
(What should we do?)

1921
01:14:19,957 --> 01:14:21,757
You should try it this time. You got the hang of it.

1922
01:14:22,527 --> 01:14:23,827
Why don't we say it out loud?

1923
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:25,957
- We can give him a signal.
- "Boom! Shake!"

1924
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:27,797
We can make sounds as we dance.

1925
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,667
Sound will get added to this video anyway.

1926
01:14:29,667 --> 01:14:31,097
We can go, "Boom! Shake!"

1927
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:33,197
- I can't film it.
- Try it.

1928
01:14:33,797 --> 01:14:35,107
You can do it.

1929
01:14:37,977 --> 01:14:40,637
(Seo Jin's first attempt at filming)

1930
01:14:40,837 --> 01:14:43,407
"ONE MORE TIME." ANNIE's uncle.

1931
01:14:44,377 --> 01:14:45,447
"ONE MORE TIME."

1932
01:14:45,847 --> 01:14:47,217
- "ONE MORE TIME." - Yes.

1933
01:14:47,217 --> 01:14:48,217
"ONE MORE TIME."

1934
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:51,617
He has done everything by the book so far, so I'm excited.

1935
01:14:53,317 --> 01:14:55,587
(My Stars are excited.)

1936
01:14:55,587 --> 01:14:57,227
- Do you film it like this?
- Yes.

1937
01:14:58,757 --> 01:14:59,797
(Mr. By the Book, Jerry is ready.)

1938
01:14:59,797 --> 01:15:01,197
- Like this?
- Yes.

1939
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:04,327
- Shake it when we say, "Shake." - Okay. It's when they say, "Shake."

1940
01:15:04,327 --> 01:15:05,367
"Stop. Shake."

1941
01:15:05,367 --> 01:15:07,197
- Let's go.
- "Stop. Shake."

1942
01:15:07,197 --> 01:15:08,767
Roll. Let's go.

1943
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,007
Let's go.

1944
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:12,507
(Focused)

1945
01:15:13,607 --> 01:15:17,207
(Let's liven up the atmosphere.)

1946
01:15:17,207 --> 01:15:19,177
(Raise the camera.)

1947
01:15:20,317 --> 01:15:22,087
(Steady camera move)

1948
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:23,147
Get ready!

1949
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,287
(Shake!)

1950
01:15:25,787 --> 01:15:26,787
(Shake!)

1951
01:15:27,317 --> 01:15:28,357
(Shake!)

1952
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,087
(He was half a beat late.)

1953
01:15:31,457 --> 01:15:32,457
(Shake!)

1954
01:15:32,457 --> 01:15:34,097
(He was a beat late.)

1955
01:15:36,267 --> 01:15:37,567
- Stop!
- Go!

1956
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:41,407
(Clenching his teeth)

1957
01:15:41,967 --> 01:15:43,337
(Success!)

1958
01:15:43,337 --> 01:15:45,177
(Proud)

1959
01:15:47,407 --> 01:15:48,407
(Shake!)

1960
01:15:50,007 --> 01:15:51,877
Shake! Three times.

1961
01:15:51,877 --> 01:15:52,917
(He never does it to the beat.)

1962
01:15:53,317 --> 01:15:55,847
(The corners of his mouth go down in concentration.)

1963
01:15:56,987 --> 01:15:59,717
Okay.

1964
01:16:01,257 --> 01:16:04,827
We never thought that we'd say "Shake" out loud.

1965
01:16:05,497 --> 01:16:06,897
"Shake" was nice.

1966
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:09,097
Shake.

1967
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,797
(Exhausted)

1968
01:16:11,997 --> 01:16:13,037
Shake.

1969
01:16:13,037 --> 01:16:15,207
(Checking the outcome)

1970
01:16:18,677 --> 01:16:20,907
(Steady camera move)

1971
01:16:22,847 --> 01:16:24,377
(Shake!)

1972
01:16:24,707 --> 01:16:25,777
It was a bit late.

1973
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,047
(Shake!)

1974
01:16:30,047 --> 01:16:32,517
(Perfect timing)

1975
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:37,427
(Shake!)

1976
01:16:38,357 --> 01:16:40,257
(Cheers erupt.)

1977
01:16:40,727 --> 01:16:42,367
(His dimples show his satisfaction.)

1978
01:16:45,797 --> 01:16:47,097
(He nailed it!)

1979
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:48,837
You did well. You did pretty well.

1980
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:52,537
- Compared to the agency's video, - Compared to the agency's video...

1981
01:16:52,537 --> 01:16:54,877
Tom and Jerry's videos makes us look like...

1982
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:56,177
better dancers.

1983
01:16:56,177 --> 01:16:57,177
- Really?
- Shake!

1984
01:16:57,177 --> 01:17:00,317
- The second shake was perfect.
- It was perfect.

1985
01:17:00,317 --> 01:17:01,887
- It was perfect.
- It was perfect.

1986
01:17:01,887 --> 01:17:04,017
- Masterpiece.
- Okay.

1987
01:17:04,647 --> 01:17:06,687
It was hard to suppress our laughter.

1988
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,887
They danced with us as they filmed the video.

1989
01:17:09,887 --> 01:17:11,127
- They danced with us.
- Head,

1990
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,657
shoulders, and footwork.

1991
01:17:12,657 --> 01:17:14,457
They even did the footwork.

1992
01:17:14,557 --> 01:17:17,467
They gave us better videos than THEBLACKLABEL.

1993
01:17:18,297 --> 01:17:20,297
(5 siblings are highly satisfied.)

1994
01:17:21,467 --> 01:17:22,707
It's very fast.

1995
01:17:23,607 --> 01:17:25,107
I'm hungry.

1996
01:17:25,437 --> 01:17:27,077
Did you digest pizza already?

1997
01:17:27,077 --> 01:17:28,477
- Rumble.
- "Rumble?"

1998
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,647
Is it "Rumble" this time?

1999
01:17:30,377 --> 01:17:33,077
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

2000
01:17:33,077 --> 01:17:34,747
- Shake!
- Shake!

2001
01:17:34,747 --> 01:17:36,117
- Shake!
- Shake! What's this?

2002
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:37,147
- Shake!
- Shake!

2003
01:17:37,617 --> 01:17:38,757
He's grilling meat.

2004
01:17:39,987 --> 01:17:41,357
- Shake!
- He's grilling meat.

2005
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:43,657
(His face lights up.)

2006
01:17:43,657 --> 01:17:45,197
Okay.

2007
01:17:45,197 --> 01:17:46,557
- Let's go and eat meat.
- Okay.

2008
01:17:47,157 --> 01:17:50,097
- Good work, everyone.
- Good work.

2009
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:52,967
Let's go, people.

2010
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:54,297
(7:30pm, get-together at a restaurant)

2011
01:17:54,297 --> 01:17:56,467
It's your favourite cut, beef brisket.

2012
01:17:56,667 --> 01:17:57,937
Beef brisket.

2013
01:17:58,177 --> 01:18:00,237
(They eat meat after the passionate challenge.)

2014
01:18:00,707 --> 01:18:01,877
(In charge of grilling meat)

2015
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,907
- Are you good at grilling meat?
- Yes, I'm pretty good.

2016
01:18:03,907 --> 01:18:05,117
Really?

2017
01:18:05,277 --> 01:18:07,347
I'm a bit nervous to see you put all the meat on the grill.

2018
01:18:07,347 --> 01:18:08,987
- He's really good at it.
- Really?

2019
01:18:09,187 --> 01:18:10,247
Really?

2020
01:18:10,247 --> 01:18:11,617
I'll make it crispy.

2021
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:14,687
That's right. You're serious about meat.

2022
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:18,087
(At the next table, WOOCHAN is in charge of grilling meat.)

2023
01:18:18,087 --> 01:18:20,057
WOOCHAN, do you grill meat when you eat with your family?

2024
01:18:20,057 --> 01:18:21,997
- Yes. But my dad...
- Really?

2025
01:18:22,227 --> 01:18:23,367
likes to grill meat.

2026
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:25,797
- He must be serious about taste.
- Yes.

2027
01:18:25,797 --> 01:18:27,097
I learn a lot from my dad.

2028
01:18:27,097 --> 01:18:29,867
- Of course.
- He even uses a thermometer.

2029
01:18:29,867 --> 01:18:32,037
Your dad is serious about food.

2030
01:18:32,037 --> 01:18:33,037
Yes.

2031
01:18:33,037 --> 01:18:34,477
- He's serious about meat.
- Right.

2032
01:18:34,947 --> 01:18:37,507
Both male members are good at grilling meat.

2033
01:18:37,507 --> 01:18:38,577
I know.

2034
01:18:38,717 --> 01:18:40,817
- Go ahead and eat. It's ready.
- Is it ready?

2035
01:18:41,447 --> 01:18:42,917
Thank you for the food.

2036
01:18:44,817 --> 01:18:46,757
(Eating)

2037
01:18:46,757 --> 01:18:47,757
(Impressed)

2038
01:18:49,327 --> 01:18:51,157
(It tastes good!)

2039
01:18:51,697 --> 01:18:53,297
You're good at grilling meat.

2040
01:18:53,297 --> 01:18:54,397
(They fill their stomachs after sweating.)

2041
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,597
Are there no dance instructors?

2042
01:18:57,197 --> 01:18:59,267
You called BAILEY "Instructor."

2043
01:19:00,097 --> 01:19:02,607
We have a dance instructor and a choreographer,

2044
01:19:02,937 --> 01:19:05,107
but BAILEY is in charge.

2045
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,577
- She's in charge.
- In the group?

2046
01:19:06,807 --> 01:19:09,707
- Then...
- She makes the final decisions.

2047
01:19:10,077 --> 01:19:13,177
- She had to choose between golf...
- She chose one.

2048
01:19:13,177 --> 01:19:14,717
- and dance.
- Really?

2049
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:15,887
- Yes.
- She chose dance.

2050
01:19:15,887 --> 01:19:17,447
- That was how she became a dancer.
- In that case...

2051
01:19:17,647 --> 01:19:18,787
- Really?
- Yes.

2052
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:19,817
- I...
- In the US?

2053
01:19:19,817 --> 01:19:22,327
played golf from the age of five.

2054
01:19:23,157 --> 01:19:26,897
(From a five-year-old golf prodigy)

2055
01:19:27,457 --> 01:19:28,797
I switched to dance.

2056
01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:29,927
That's impressive.

2057
01:19:30,727 --> 01:19:33,597
- When I was little, - Yes?

2058
01:19:33,767 --> 01:19:36,707
I watched so many variety shows. So it's very fascinating...

2059
01:19:36,707 --> 01:19:38,477
- to be here.
- Really?

2060
01:19:38,477 --> 01:19:39,737
What did you watch?

2061
01:19:39,737 --> 01:19:40,937
I just watched...

2062
01:19:40,937 --> 01:19:42,247
Did you watch his show, "Three Meals a Day?"

2063
01:19:42,247 --> 01:19:44,977
"Three Meals a Day," "Jinny's Kitchen,"

2064
01:19:45,177 --> 01:19:48,117
- "Grandpas Over Flowers," - Grandpas.

2065
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,087
and "Sisters Over Flowers."

2066
01:19:49,317 --> 01:19:50,517
He became a grandpa.

2067
01:19:56,287 --> 01:19:57,757
You guys will star in variety shows, right?

2068
01:19:58,857 --> 01:20:01,427
I really want to star in a fun one.

2069
01:20:03,097 --> 01:20:04,997
But I can't make people laugh.

2070
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:08,537
- It's okay. That's...
- I don't know what to do.

2071
01:20:10,207 --> 01:20:11,937
You don't need to be so seasoned.

2072
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:14,407
I think it's better to have fresh charms.

2073
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:18,617
Who does well from the start?

2074
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,617
Still.

2075
01:20:21,077 --> 01:20:22,347
It's okay. You can go slowly.

2076
01:20:24,317 --> 01:20:26,757
Your dad is so worried about you.

2077
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:31,727
Your vibe is so similar to her dad's.

2078
01:20:31,897 --> 01:20:33,727
- Me?
- You sound like him.

2079
01:20:33,727 --> 01:20:35,167
(He seems strangely familiar.)

2080
01:20:35,527 --> 01:20:37,597
You didn't know that I'd debut for real, right?

2081
01:20:39,097 --> 01:20:42,607
Well, I saw you through your trainee days.

2082
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:44,667
It was still shocking, right?

2083
01:20:44,767 --> 01:20:46,077
Although I was aware of that...

2084
01:20:46,707 --> 01:20:49,977
Your mom was so against it too.

2085
01:20:50,277 --> 01:20:51,347
So I didn't know that you'd actually debut.

2086
01:20:52,417 --> 01:20:54,217
Debuting is important,

2087
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:58,187
but becoming successful at once is harder.

2088
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:00,087
That's the best.

2089
01:21:00,087 --> 01:21:01,657
(He's proud of her.)

2090
01:21:03,157 --> 01:21:06,797
(Meanwhile, My Star TARZZAN is focused on eating.)

2091
01:21:07,457 --> 01:21:11,267
(Slurping noodles)

2092
01:21:13,437 --> 01:21:14,437
(Humming in approval)

2093
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:16,107
(Laughing)

2094
01:21:17,167 --> 01:21:20,707
(My Star TARZZAN is serious about eating.)

2095
01:21:20,707 --> 01:21:23,407
TARZZAN eats with gusto.

2096
01:21:23,407 --> 01:21:24,547
He eats very well.

2097
01:21:24,947 --> 01:21:27,017
(Embarrassed)

2098
01:21:27,117 --> 01:21:28,887
You'll definitely get an offer to film a food commercial.

2099
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:30,947
- What?
- You'll film a food commercial.

2100
01:21:30,947 --> 01:21:32,417
He has already filmed eight commercials.

2101
01:21:32,417 --> 01:21:34,757
- Have you done it already?
- He has filmed eight commercials.

2102
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:35,957
Has he filmed eight commercials?

2103
01:21:36,827 --> 01:21:38,027
Let's work together.

2104
01:21:41,227 --> 01:21:43,027
- We haven't done a food commercial.
- What?

2105
01:21:43,027 --> 01:21:44,127
We haven't done a food commercial.

2106
01:21:44,127 --> 01:21:47,337
You and I should film a food commercial?

2107
01:21:47,497 --> 01:21:49,937
- How about a fried chicken brand?
- I'd love that.

2108
01:21:50,537 --> 01:21:54,637
But fried chicken commercials are filmed...

2109
01:21:54,637 --> 01:21:57,007
by the biggest actors.

2110
01:21:57,007 --> 01:21:58,247
(Choking)

2111
01:21:59,617 --> 01:22:01,147
(I didn't mean it like that.)

2112
01:22:03,087 --> 01:22:04,747
You can't film a soju commercial.

2113
01:22:04,747 --> 01:22:06,387
I've never filmed a liquor commercial.

2114
01:22:07,617 --> 01:22:09,757
There are so many things you've never done.

2115
01:22:09,957 --> 01:22:11,827
Why would you say that?

2116
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:14,727
Have you filmed a wig commercial?

2117
01:22:15,197 --> 01:22:16,297
I have, okay?

2118
01:22:17,927 --> 01:22:18,937
You punk.

2119
01:22:18,937 --> 01:22:19,997
(Proud)

2120
01:22:19,997 --> 01:22:22,237
Do you think your mom will like him or not?

2121
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:23,637
- I think she'll love him.
- Right?

2122
01:22:23,637 --> 01:22:25,107
- What do you think?
- I think she'll love him.

2123
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,307
- I think she'll love him.
- Totally.

2124
01:22:27,777 --> 01:22:28,777
Why?

2125
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,277
ANNIE's mom loves funny and entertaining people.

2126
01:22:32,477 --> 01:22:34,477
She won't like me since I'm too serious.

2127
01:22:34,477 --> 01:22:35,447
(Kwang Kyu wants to be serious.)

2128
01:22:35,887 --> 01:22:37,487
Your dad might not like him.

2129
01:22:37,487 --> 01:22:38,517
- That's right.
- Yes.

2130
01:22:38,517 --> 01:22:40,257
Dad is...

2131
01:22:42,027 --> 01:22:43,957
a very serious person.

2132
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:47,727
Her dad was in a band.

2133
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:51,197
- Really?
- I've never seen her dad...

2134
01:22:51,997 --> 01:22:53,437
read a book.

2135
01:22:53,437 --> 01:22:55,537
(I've never seen ANNIE's dad read a book.)

2136
01:22:55,707 --> 01:22:57,967
He absolutely loves music.

2137
01:22:58,637 --> 01:22:59,937
When we drank together in our younger days,

2138
01:23:00,437 --> 01:23:02,247
he only rapped.

2139
01:23:03,877 --> 01:23:06,047
- Did he rap?
- So...

2140
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:09,587
when my family members and my parents' friends...

2141
01:23:09,587 --> 01:23:11,217
drink and eat,

2142
01:23:11,217 --> 01:23:13,517
- there's always a karaoke machine.
- A karaoke machine.

2143
01:23:13,517 --> 01:23:15,327
- Dad and I rap as a duo.
- That's right.

2144
01:23:16,727 --> 01:23:17,927
Her dad raps in English.

2145
01:23:17,927 --> 01:23:20,257
Her dad got good grades since he was very smart.

2146
01:23:20,597 --> 01:23:23,367
He rapped like crazy in English.

2147
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:24,397
He spat out the verses...

2148
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:25,967
in English.

2149
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:26,967
(Rapping seriously)

2150
01:23:26,967 --> 01:23:28,097
I can't imagine it.

2151
01:23:28,507 --> 01:23:30,907
- Haven't you heard it?
- Have you never joined...

2152
01:23:30,907 --> 01:23:32,407
my family's karaoke session?

2153
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,207
- No. I haven't heard her dad's rap.
- I'll invite you next time.

2154
01:23:35,207 --> 01:23:38,407
- Haven't you heard it?
- TARZZAN and YOUNGSEO have.

2155
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:39,677
They've been to the karaoke session.

2156
01:23:39,677 --> 01:23:41,987
I've seen it. It was so shocking.

2157
01:23:43,117 --> 01:23:45,387
When you go to her place, the karaoke machine comes out.

2158
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:48,627
- I haven't seen it.
- WOOCHAN hasn't experienced it.

2159
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,757
I've seen a duet performance by ANNIE and her dad.

2160
01:23:51,757 --> 01:23:53,197
YOUNGSEO has seen our debut performance.

2161
01:23:53,197 --> 01:23:55,027
(Even the members know about ANNIE's family's good cheer.)

2162
01:23:55,027 --> 01:23:56,797
YOUNGSEO has seen our debut performance.

2163
01:23:57,667 --> 01:24:00,837
I think ANNIE got her musical talent...

2164
01:24:00,837 --> 01:24:01,937
from her dad.

2165
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:03,937
- She got it from her dad.
- Yes.

2166
01:24:04,637 --> 01:24:08,007
When I hear Mom and Dad's stories...

2167
01:24:08,177 --> 01:24:11,147
about partying like crazy...

2168
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:14,577
in their college days,

2169
01:24:14,577 --> 01:24:15,787
they always feature Uncle Seo Jin.

2170
01:24:16,787 --> 01:24:17,787
Always.

2171
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:19,317
He specialised in partying.

2172
01:24:20,617 --> 01:24:23,057
If it weren't for the shoot, I would've asked your dad to pay.

2173
01:24:24,387 --> 01:24:25,697
If it weren't for the shoot, I would've done that.

2174
01:24:26,457 --> 01:24:27,527
What does your dad do for a living?

2175
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:30,627
- He works at a company.
- Does he work at a company?

2176
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:33,937
Then you shouldn't ask him to pay.

2177
01:24:34,897 --> 01:24:36,167
My dad works at a company.

2178
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:37,607
- CEO...
- Do you want to pay?

2179
01:24:37,607 --> 01:24:38,677
- What?
- Do you want to pay?

2180
01:24:38,677 --> 01:24:40,507
(Shaking his head)

2181
01:24:40,707 --> 01:24:42,847
(To be continued)

2182
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:45,779
It feels strange...

2183
01:24:45,917 --> 01:24:48,347
since my ears are empty for the first time in a while.

2184
01:24:48,347 --> 01:24:49,947
I need to listen to music.

2185
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,957
- Silence feels strange, right?
- Really?

2186
01:24:52,957 --> 01:24:54,957
Shall I play my songs then?

2187
01:24:54,957 --> 01:24:56,587
Please sing them.

2188
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:57,827
That's a good idea.

2189
01:24:58,057 --> 01:25:02,197
One, two, one, two, three, four.

2190
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:04,267
(Open)

2191
01:25:04,267 --> 01:25:05,567
(Sesame)

2192
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:09,767
(My Star plays the table drum.)

2193
01:25:10,507 --> 01:25:11,507
(Singing passionately)

2194
01:25:11,507 --> 01:25:12,937
(Covering her mouth)

2195
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:20,447
(Open your heart wide)

2196
01:25:25,317 --> 01:25:27,457
(I love you)

2197
01:25:27,457 --> 01:25:30,187
(He passionately wastes his talent.)

2198
01:25:30,187 --> 01:25:31,187
(Chuckling)

2199
01:25:32,797 --> 01:25:34,897
(I'm so embarrassed.)

2200
01:25:35,927 --> 01:25:36,997
Thank you.

2201
01:25:38,567 --> 01:25:40,537
(His impromptu live performance satisfied ADP.)

2202
01:25:40,537 --> 01:25:42,837
Although they were young people...

2203
01:25:42,837 --> 01:25:45,067
who were much younger than me,

2204
01:25:45,237 --> 01:25:48,007
they didn't find me uncomfortable.

2205
01:25:48,177 --> 01:25:50,977
They treated me like a close friend.

2206
01:25:51,207 --> 01:25:55,147
I'm so thankful for it.

2207
01:25:55,517 --> 01:25:57,447
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

2208
01:25:58,087 --> 01:26:00,087
Being open-minded, they treated me...

2209
01:26:00,587 --> 01:26:01,887
like a friend.

2210
01:26:03,327 --> 01:26:08,397
I could tell that they were really young.

2211
01:26:09,227 --> 01:26:10,567
They're cheerful and funny.

2212
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:15,097
They're working toward to make a globally-popular group.

2213
01:26:16,037 --> 01:26:19,607
I always think it's a matter of who is more unique.

2214
01:26:19,937 --> 01:26:21,977
They have unique charms.

2215
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:24,177
They're incredible.

2216
01:26:25,777 --> 01:26:28,547
I think the highlight was...

2217
01:26:28,547 --> 01:26:31,817
when Tom filmed our reels.

2218
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:34,017
It was so hard...

2219
01:26:34,257 --> 01:26:36,557
to suppress our laughter.

2220
01:26:36,557 --> 01:26:39,557
He danced with us as he filmed our reels.

2221
01:26:40,197 --> 01:26:43,197
Another highlight was Jerry's reaction...

2222
01:26:43,197 --> 01:26:45,567
when we got an additional request at the Salomon event.

2223
01:26:45,837 --> 01:26:46,997
"No!"

2224
01:26:47,137 --> 01:26:48,367
- He was stern.
- He was stern.

2225
01:26:49,967 --> 01:26:51,237
(Charismatic)

2226
01:26:51,237 --> 01:26:53,007
No one has been so stern.

2227
01:26:53,437 --> 01:26:54,977
He was so stern.

2228
01:26:55,307 --> 01:26:56,407
That was...

2229
01:26:56,407 --> 01:26:59,577
He was so dependable and trustworthy.

2230
01:27:00,877 --> 01:27:02,387
He was incredible.

2231
01:27:03,447 --> 01:27:05,787
I think it'll be better to go to Jerry...

2232
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:08,457
for any work-related issues.

2233
01:27:08,827 --> 01:27:11,687
We'll just have a fun time with Tom.

2234
01:27:13,157 --> 01:27:16,097
I think other celebrities should do the same.

2235
01:27:17,467 --> 01:27:19,537
- Are they talking about us?
- I don't know

2236
01:27:22,267 --> 01:27:23,667
Are they talking about us?

2237
01:27:24,237 --> 01:27:26,637
(Hey, this place is really nice.)

2238
01:27:27,707 --> 01:27:28,977
Do you need anything?

2239
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,447
(My Star's MBTI is FFFF.)

2240
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:34,077
(Young Master)

2241
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:36,187
(My Star who is a total feeler, Lee Mi Sook)

2242
01:27:36,287 --> 01:27:38,087
(Kwang Kyu, look at the sky!)

2243
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:39,487
(Sighing)

2244
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:41,087
(There she goes again.)

2245
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:43,057
(We can't look at it since we don't have sunglasses.)

2246
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,757
(Squeezing his eyes shut)

2247
01:27:44,757 --> 01:27:47,697
(Sentimentality might be harder to deal with than passion.)

2248
01:27:48,427 --> 01:27:49,497
(Bring some leaves.)

2249
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:51,727
(Here come the leaves.)

2250
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:56,207
(The most sentimental woman the secretaries have seen)

2251
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:58,467
(Let's buy something like a burger!)

2252
01:27:58,467 --> 01:28:00,877
(My Star wants a picnic at the park.)

2253
01:28:01,577 --> 01:28:03,107
(Can we eat food here?)

2254
01:28:03,807 --> 01:28:05,447
(What kind of sentimentality is this?)

2255
01:28:05,777 --> 01:28:07,617
(Let's eat as we enjoy the autumn sun.)

2256
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:09,547
(What's harder to deal with, sentimentality or passion?)

2257
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:11,847
(Dealing with sentimentality is harder than physical care.)

2258
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:14,517
(Mi Sook will hit me.)

2259
01:28:14,857 --> 01:28:16,027
(You badmouthed me, right?)

2260
01:28:16,027 --> 01:28:17,057
(You criticized me, right?)

2261
01:28:17,057 --> 01:28:19,357
(They're here to soothe my sentimentality, but...)

2262
01:28:19,457 --> 01:28:20,457
(Let's switch them!)

2263
01:28:20,457 --> 01:28:21,527
(Can't I get new managers?)

2264
01:28:21,527 --> 01:28:24,497
(If you get mad, which drumbeat am I supposed to dance to?)

2265
01:28:24,497 --> 01:28:25,937
(Shall I dance?)

2266
01:28:26,297 --> 01:28:27,467
(That's the least you can do.)

2267
01:28:29,467 --> 01:28:33,077
(A difficult day with the sentimental My Star)

2268
