1
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,920
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,320
(My Star is waiting at a beauty parlour in Cheongdam-dong.)

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,060
(My Star warms up his voice while getting makeup done.)

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,000
(With his sweet voice, this artist mastered both acting and singing.)

5
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,410
(My Star, Cho Jung Seok)

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,740
(He's on his way to work to meet My Star.)

7
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,310
Is this it?

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,179
(2 seconds before meeting My Star)

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,350
(1 second before meeting My Star)

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,250
- Jung Seok.
- Hi, Seo Jin.

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,220
Are you Jum Seok or Jung Seok? Who are you today?

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,019
Will you draw a fake mole or not?

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,360
- Please wait outside for a while.
- Will you?

14
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,300
(The person Seo Jin met 2 weeks earlier)

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,269
(I'm Cho Jum Seok.)

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,400
(I have a mole on my face, as you can see.)

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,300
(He definitely looked like Jung Seok.)

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,639
(Who are you today?)

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,539
(Will you draw a fake mole or not?)

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,980
- Please wait outside for a while.
- Will you?

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,750
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, really? Got it.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,919
He hasn't even changed his clothes yet.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,719
- I haven't changed my clothes yet.
- Your outfit looks nice.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,650
I haven't even put on a mic yet.

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,119
That's okay. You can just do it without a mic.

26
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,920
That's not necessary. You don't need to prepare anything.

27
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,290
(Seo Jin helps him relax with jokes and leaves nonchalantly.)

28
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,430
As soon as Seo Jin saw me, he asked,

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,429
- "Are you Jum Seok or Jung Seok?" - Exactly.

30
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,070
I knew he would ask that.

31
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,200
I had a feeling that that'd be the first thing he'd say.

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,239
And he did just as expected.

33
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,870
(My Star and Grumpy Secretary know each other well.)

34
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,239
He can't seem to understand the universe.

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,439
(He can't seem to understand the "Jum Seok" universe.)

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,640
He just can't understand that.

37
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,879
I'll make sure to help him understand.

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,350
(He's excited about nagging the older friends.)

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,179
(The man who doesn't understand the universe takes over the job.)

40
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,689
(Jung Seok's manager)

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,919
- I'll give you a summary.
- Yes.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,220
After getting hair and makeup done,

43
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,760
he should go to SBS Prism Tower and shoot "Mom's Diary."

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,329
Right after that, he should go to the band practice studio.

45
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,699
After the shoot for the variety show,

46
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,130
he's scheduled for a rehearsal for his national concert tour.

47
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,799
- Rehearsal? I see.
- Yes.

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,410
He'll hold a concert tour for the first time.

49
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,480
("Box-Office King Cho Jung Seok To Hold His First Concert Tour")

50
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,849
(He'll play the guitar and sing songs that he made.)

51
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,750
(He'll exude his charms as a singer-songwriter.)

52
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,949
He needs his electric and acoustic guitars...

53
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,020
for the rehearsal.

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,120
- So we should bring those.
- Yes.

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,660
- Don't forget to bring those.
- Does he play both types?

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,989
Yes, he plays both types of guitars.

57
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,559
- He's good at playing the guitar.
- He plays the guitar really well.

58
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,659
Wherever he goes,

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,130
he always carries his guitars with him.

60
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,439
(Acoustic guitar, electric guitar)

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,370
(He always keeps his precious guitars around him.)

62
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,909
And his guitars are very expensive.

63
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,139
- How much are they worth?
- What brand are they from?

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,179
Lagobia?

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,009
Lagobia? You're spewing nonsense.

66
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,820
Are they from brands like Gibson and Fender?

67
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,349
I heard they were expensive. So carry them carefully, please.

68
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,489
I'm sure they're from Gibson or Fender.

69
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,290
I know quite a lot about guitars.

70
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,460
You should help him...

71
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,030
- take good care of his voice.
- Got it.

72
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,999
Give him lukewarm water frequently.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,329
- Lukewarm water?
- Yes.

74
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,399
It's better than cold water. Please don't forget this.

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,439
- Does he drink coffee?
- Water.

76
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,599
Jung Seok rarely drinks coffee.

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,939
- He mostly drinks water.
- He drinks water?

78
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,769
Please give him water instead of coffee.

79
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,879
One more thing. His car is very large.

80
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,909
What car is it?

81
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,210
- Escalade. I saw it out front.
- It's an Escalade.

82
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,280
Have you ever driven an Escalade?

83
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,980
I've never driven that car before.

84
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,059
In that case...

85
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,289
The long-wheelbase model is so big. It's really long.

86
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,029
Isn't the US presidential state car from that brand?

87
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,629
- Yes, you can say that.
- That's right.

88
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,199
- Why does he ride a car like that?
- Here's the thing.

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,629
- It's okay to drive it.
- Okay.

90
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,770
- But it's really hard to park it.
- I see.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,469
- Because it's long.
- Right.

92
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,609
(Worried)

93
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,609
- I used to ride an Escalade.
- You did?

94
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,740
I scratched my car several times while parking.

95
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,109
- It's hard to park.
- Oh, boy.

96
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,079
(Not just once, but several times?)

97
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,949
I'll give you the car keys.

98
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,080
(He hands over the keys for the extra-long car.)

99
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,750
(Will it be okay for me to drive this car?)

100
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,150
All right.

101
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,790
Then I'll be off now.

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
- Done.
- Great.

103
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,130
- Thank you so much.
- You're done.

104
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,000
You should rather wear a beanie.

105
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,370
- Hey, Jung Seok.
- My face gets tanned a lot.

106
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,130
- You're here.
- Let's get going.

107
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,700
- You're here.
- Yes.

108
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,639
- Let's get going now.
- Hey.

109
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,370
Hi, My Star.

110
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,070
- You're here.
- Yes, My Star.

111
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,979
- Isn't he leaving in this outfit?
- No, I'll get changed.

112
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,710
- Will you change your clothes?
- Yes. Please wait for a while.

113
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,749
- Where will you get changed?
- Upstairs.

114
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,980
Let's go upstairs, then.

115
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,519
- No, you guys stay here.
- Here?

116
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,819
- Please stay here.
- He seems very uncomfortable.

117
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,089
- Just wait for a while.
- Why?

118
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,459
- Wait here, please.
- We'll go with you.

119
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,589
(Grumpy Secretary makes My Star a little bit uncomfortable.)

120
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,359
- He said not to follow him.
- It's just...

121
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,129
- He'll get changed.
- Thinking you'll go with me,

122
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,900
I feel strange for some reason.

123
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,870
- I'm a little anxious too.
- Hey.

124
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,239
(The duo makes My Star anxious for some reason.)

125
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,239
- Please wait here. I'll be back.
- Yes.

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,270
- Okay.
- Okay.

127
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,280
(While My Star changes his clothes...)

128
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,110
His guitars are in there?

129
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,850
(My Star's essential items, the most important items today)

130
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,789
This guitar is not so... It's quite small.

131
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,589
- This one is an acoustic guitar.
- Right.

132
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,060
- This one is an electric guitar.
- An electric guitar. Right.

133
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,560
Oh, my. We should be really careful with it.

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,029
(Unlike what he said, he'll take a look at the guitar.)

135
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,100
I...

136
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,999
This guitar is cute.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,100
My, it's lovely.

138
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll show my guitar skills.

139
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,239
We were told to handle it carefully. But you'll play it?

140
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,579
As his manager, I should check if the strings are okay.

141
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,980
You mean, if it's in tune.

142
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,980
(He seems to have meant he'd tune the guitar.)

143
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,759
(You, you, you)

144
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,060
I can't find the first note.

145
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,969
(Your)

146
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,139
(Silence)

147
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,210
(Made my lips dry)

148
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,109
(It gives you a melancholic feeling.)

149
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,579
(Older bestie's live acoustic guitar performance)

150
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,690
It freezes my feet

151
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,960
I was going to sing it for my future girlfriend.

152
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,490
What's the title of the song?

153
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,730
"Hopeless Love."

154
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,610
(Goodbye, farewell)

155
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,110
Are you playing it with only three chords? E, A, and C?

156
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,840
Am I right?

157
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,480
(He hastily adds soulful ad-lib.)

158
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,619
This is all I can do.

159
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,790
- Do you want to play a song?
- No.

160
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,219
Put it back in the case now.

161
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,459
(He's afraid Jung Seok might see them.)

162
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,690
I've shown too much.

163
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,430
You've shown everything.

164
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,300
There's nothing more you can show off.

165
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,030
(It was his only special skill, and he gave it his all.)

166
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,640
- Let's get going now.
- Yes, My Star.

167
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,870
- Shall we leave right now?
- Well...

168
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,910
- What time is it?
- Is it too early?

169
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,239
We'll be right on time if we leave now.

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,209
Oh, we're late. Aren't we late?

171
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,580
I heard the shoot would start at 1pm.

172
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,649
- Oh, really?
- But there will be a table read...

173
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,949
- Then get me some coffee, please.
- starting at noon.

174
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,979
- Sorry?
- Get me some coffee, please.

175
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,719
We heard you rarely drank coffee.

176
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,319
I need some coffee right now.

177
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,019
I thought you didn't drink coffee to keep your voice healthy.

178
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,159
- You don't like coffee.
- Why are my guitars here?

179
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,530
I took them out to take them with us.

180
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,529
I was asked to handle them with care and put them on the tables.

181
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,059
- Oh, I see.
- They were standing over there.

182
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,029
- Why? What's wrong?
- We were asked to be careful.

183
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,729
Exactly. As for my guitars...

184
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,440
Why? Should they be leaning against the wall?

185
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,340
- No, that's not what I'm saying.
- No, that's not it.

186
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,470
- You can lay it down flat.
- Okay.

187
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,279
- But without my permission, - Yes.

188
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,249
- you must never touch my guitars.
- Oh, I see.

189
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,079
Of course. We'll be careful.

190
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,919
He even played your guitar.

191
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,179
- I...
- You played my guitar?

192
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,719
(You played my guitar?)

193
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,050
He did, not me.

194
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,859
- He played the acoustic guitar.
- Kwang Kyu.

195
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,259
- Yes?
- Why did you...

196
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,989
He was curious about the brand your guitar was from.

197
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,830
- I see.
- So we opened the case.

198
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,530
- We just took a look.
- No, wait.

199
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,299
We're not in a rush.

200
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,470
- Please get me some coffee now.
- Oh, coffee?

201
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,609
We don't have to leave now, so put the guitar down.

202
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,569
Would you like your coffee hot?

203
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,580
- I always drink iced coffee.
- Or cold?

204
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,540
- You always drink iced coffee?
- Yes.

205
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,810
Do you mind drinking the leftover coffee?

206
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,979
- All right.
- It's not leftover coffee.

207
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,249
You poured some fresh coffee in that cup.

208
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,249
- That's right. It's fresh coffee.
- It's fresh coffee.

209
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,649
- You poured coffee from this cup.
- Right.

210
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,859
- I see. But still...
- It's fresh coffee.

211
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,059
- Please get me a new cup of coffee.
- Sure. I'll do that.

212
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,060
Then I'll drink this...

213
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,089
- and get you a new cup.
- Thank you.

214
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,729
- Jung Seok, have a seat.
- Okay.

215
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,230
It's funny we met again like this.

216
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,669
- Actually, - We met not long ago...

217
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,270
- we have a situation now.
- What is it?

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,199
- Actually, - We met not long ago...

219
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,870
- we have a situation now.
- What is it?

220
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,709
- What's wrong?
- The car battery is dead.

221
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,709
(The car battery is dead.)

222
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,910
The car battery is dead.

223
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,849
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

224
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,679
- Then...
- We're calling roadside assistance.

225
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,850
- Oh, I see.
- Then...

226
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,990
(Jung Seok's car was parked in front of the beauty parlour.)

227
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,230
(The alarm kept going off because the battery was dead.)

228
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,770
(The car won't even start.)

229
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,639
As soon as possible...

230
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,909
We're willing to pay an extra fee if you can come shortly.

231
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,540
- We don't know when they'll come.
- Right. We should leave now.

232
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,709
- There must be something.
- The battery died suddenly?

233
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,109
- Before you leave...
- The alarm suddenly went off.

234
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,179
- Really?
- Yes.

235
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,950
- You mean, our car, the Cadillac?
- You'd better not start the car.

236
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,320
- Then...
- The battery will die again.

237
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,359
- We didn't drive a long distance.
- It will take some time.

238
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,560
Then why would the battery die?

239
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,629
We'll call roadside assistance to change the battery.

240
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,100
- It will take quite a lot of time.
- Then...

241
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,470
Then what car should we ride in?

242
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,229
What's your plan?

243
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,939
- We'll sort out the problem first.
- We need a car...

244
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,339
There must be a car we can ride in.

245
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,409
- Why did the battery suddenly die?
- It might be fixed...

246
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,110
before you leave.

247
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,610
It takes a long time to change it.

248
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,849
And if you turn off the engine and then turn it on again,

249
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,879
the battery might die again.

250
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,180
If you don't change the battery.

251
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,949
It's dangerous. You have to keep the engine on.

252
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,950
(He figures out the situation calmly.)

253
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,349
You guys stay here for a while. We'll get it sorted out.

254
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,659
We'll ride in Kwang Kyu's car instead.

255
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,389
It'll be easier for him to drive because it's his own car.

256
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,830
- Exactly.
- This is a real situation, right?

257
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,829
It takes a long time.

258
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,700
(It's 100 percent real.)

259
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,040
(Jung Seok's car hasn't broken down in the past 2 years.)

260
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,969
- Why am I so worried?
- Hey.

261
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,639
- I mean, seriously...
- The car suddenly broke down.

262
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,479
- Why...
- You haven't even left.

263
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,640
- Exactly. Why... Gosh, seriously.
- Why is this happening?

264
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,350
(Grumpy Secretary hurries not to be late for the shoot.)

265
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,590
What is going on?

266
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,689
The car must be old.

267
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:52,690
Gi Hyeong.

268
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,959
- Is it still dead?
- Yes, right now...

269
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,159
The road assistance will be here in ten minutes.

270
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,929
No, I think... Let's ride in Kwang Kyu's car.

271
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,800
- This won't work.
- Is that so?

272
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,699
- We'll be late.
- Where's Kwang Kyu's car?

273
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,539
My car? Where is my manager?

274
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,269
(They decided to ride in Kwang Kyu's car.)

275
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,110
- They'll ride in Kwang Kyu's car.
- Okay.

276
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,739
- Camera prep team director! Sir.
- Yes?

277
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,579
They decided to ride in Kwang Kyu's car.

278
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,680
- Oh, I thought...
- What?

279
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,810
But there's so much stuff in his car.

280
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,149
We have no choice. Where is Kwang Kyu's car?

281
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,250
Oh, no.

282
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,949
Hold on.

283
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,989
- Right now...
- I'll be back shortly.

284
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,290
- We're running late. Hurry up.
- I'll be right back.

285
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,960
We have to set up cameras in the car right now.

286
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,989
By what time should we arrive at the studio?

287
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,400
By 12:30pm.

288
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,169
- Oh, no. We should hurry up, right?
- Yes.

289
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,829
- It's in Sangam, so...
- That's why we should get going...

290
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,369
She's coming driving Kwang Kyu's car.

291
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,370
(Worried)

292
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:39,639
- What if we're late?
- The show is also SBS' show.

293
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,210
So it'll be okay even if we're late.

294
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,139
- I hope we won't be late.
- Don't worry.

295
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,610
I really hate being late for anything.

296
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm not you.

297
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
(He can't deny it.)

298
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,219
What is wrong with you?

299
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,979
I'm so worried about how things will work out today.

300
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,589
- Maybe I should assist them.
- That's not true.

301
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,690
I should avoid talking as much as possible.

302
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,330
Be careful.

303
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,859
Gosh. He's all talk...

304
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,700
(Seo Jin's indifferent comfort makes him choke with emotion.)

305
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,159
Do you have anything to soothe my throat?

306
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,430
- Like propolis spray or something?
- Sorry?

307
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,939
- He has everything in his bag.
- No, that's fine.

308
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,770
- I brought something for you.
- Tell us if you need anything.

309
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,510
(Rummaging)

310
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,910
Jung Seok, do you like boiled eggs?

311
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
I love boiled eggs.

312
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:23,979
- I like boiled eggs and bananas.
- Really?

313
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,450
These are raw eggs.

314
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,350
(Raw eggs)

315
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,219
- Raw eggs?
- They're raw eggs?

316
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,960
- I mean, he needs to keep...
- What?

317
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,959
He needs to keep his throat moist.

318
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,889
- Are those raw eggs?
- They're raw eggs.

319
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,259
- They must be boiled eggs.
- No, they're raw.

320
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,969
Jung Seok, do you eat raw eggs?

321
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,899
I heard he ate raw eggs to take care of his throat.

322
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,739
Did you really bring raw eggs for me?

323
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,769
Of course.

324
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,609
- You really brought raw eggs?
- Who eats raw eggs...

325
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,109
- these days?
- They're raw eggs.

326
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,509
You have a concert ahead of you.

327
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,810
How do you even eat a raw egg?

328
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,619
To prepare for his concert,

329
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,949
he should eat some raw eggs, so I prepared them.

330
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,190
- I already feel queasy.
- My gosh.

331
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,619
- People eat raw eggs?
- Raw eggs, yes.

332
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,759
- What's this? A humidifier?
- Yes.

333
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,890
A humidifier? That's nice.

334
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,129
You even prepared...

335
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,230
(Holding it close to Jung Seok)

336
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,830
- Thanks, Kwang Kyu.
- Open your mouth.

337
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,970
(Holding the humidifier right under his nose to hydrate his throat)

338
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,670
(Open your mouth.)

339
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,740
My baby, open your mouth.

340
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I prepared stuff like this.

341
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
I'm worried about how things will work out today.

342
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,479
(Don't worry. I'll keep you moist all day long.)

343
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,120
- So that's the real purpose of it.
- No.

344
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,150
- It's to keep your skin moist.
- No.

345
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:36,750
- What's that?
- What?

346
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,290
The green bottle.

347
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,960
- This is...
- It's a car humidifier.

348
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,659
The one we saw earlier was a joke. This is the real deal.

349
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,700
- Yes, this is really helpful.
- Nice.

350
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,260
Will you perhaps do this again?

351
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,129
(He's almost 60 now.)

352
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,040
(Hydration is necessary at his age.)

353
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,740
- I'm good.
- Here.

354
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,369
- We should move the car.
- Let's get going.

355
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,769
- Let's go now.
- Anyway...

356
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,909
(With anxiety, they barely manage to leave for the next location.)

357
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,839
Please make sure to be there on time.

358
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,949
- All right.
- Okay.

359
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,509
Right. You just find your way...

360
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,379
- Where should I put the guitars?
- Give me this one.

361
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,219
- Sorry? Okay.
- I'll put this in the back.

362
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,390
- Can you put it over there?
- Okay.

363
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,019
(He gets in the car with his precious guitar.)

364
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,090
Dear me.

365
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,200
My manager can go back to the office.

366
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,129
Take a taxi.

367
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,800
Go ahead and take a taxi.

368
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,200
Thank you.

369
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,869
- Enter the address, Kwang Kyu.
- Wait.

370
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,010
- I should turn on the humidifier.
- Right. That's a good idea.

371
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,539
(Anxious)

372
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,680
I'll turn it on.

373
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,749
(He must be anxious for many reasons.)

374
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,249
- All right.
- Here you go.

375
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,620
We're going to SBS Prism Tower.

376
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,650
- Where is it?
- What?

377
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,550
- It's in Sangam-dong.
- What are you talking about?

378
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,060
- It's in Sangam-dong.
- I just...

379
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,089
- I'm a little out of it.
- Let's go.

380
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,390
- Okay.
- How long does it say it'll take?

381
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,900
- It says 36 minutes.
- Good. We'll be there on time.

382
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,799
(12:30pm, SBS Prism Tower in Sangam, Shoot for "Mom's Diary")

383
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,929
Go straight...

384
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,899
- and turn right.
- Turn right onto the main street.

385
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,339
- I see. Got it.
- Go to the main street.

386
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,569
I'm counting on you two to help me a lot today.

387
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,040
- Of course, My Star.
- Of course.

388
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,510
Jung Seok, when will you have lunch?

389
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,850
- I'll have lunch later on...
- Yes.

390
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,449
After shooting "Mom's Diary."

391
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,579
- Will you eat after the shoot?
- Yes, after the shoot.

392
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,049
- I'll eat anything...
- Then it'll be too late for lunch.

393
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,420
- Actually...
- Aren't you hungry?

394
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,290
I ate a little bit late before leaving home.

395
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,860
- You ate before coming out? I see.
- Yes, I ate.

396
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,629
- I guess your wife cooks for you.
- Yes, she does.

397
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,669
- Gummy made...
- Yes.

398
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,769
- perilla seed...
- Perilla seed makguksu?

399
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,799
She made perilla seed mushroom soup for me.

400
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,970
- Soup?
- Yes.

401
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,209
It's made with perilla seed broth, chives, mushrooms, and beef.

402
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,409
(They're more jealous than usual that My Star had a warm breakfast.)

403
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,810
She must be a good cook.

404
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,050
I told her that I'd meet you guys.

405
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,549
So I suppose she was worried...

406
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,150
as it might be physically exhausting.

407
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,119
She made an invigorating dish for breakfast.

408
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,219
(Gummy has the gift of foresight?)

409
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,519
- Kwang Kyu said...
- Yes?

410
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,390
He was curious why her stage name was Gummy.

411
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,230
- Oh, that.
- Yes.

412
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,900
Before Gummy made her debut,

413
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,669
she tried to come up with a stage name as a singer.

414
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,070
While thinking of some ideas...

415
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,440
She shot her music video before choosing her stage name.

416
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,250
There's this underwater scene in her music video.

417
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,179
Do you remember that?

418
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,279
- An underwater scene?
- An underwater scene?

419
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Yes.

420
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:22,650
Back then, she had long reggae hair.

421
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,060
And her hair floated while she was under the water.

422
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,590
- Oh, her hair floated?
- And it looked like a spider.

423
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,300
"Gummy" as in "spider" was suggested among the people at the agency.

424
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,199
When a bug gets caught in a spider web,

425
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,870
it's really hard to get out of it, right?

426
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,110
When people listen to Gummy's music, they can't get out of it.

427
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,139
That's the meaning of her stage name, apparently.

428
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,740
(Gummy's stage name suits her charms perfectly.)

429
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,879
- It's true, isn't it?
- Yes, indeed.

430
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,880
Right.

431
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,390
Can you pick an insect for me too?

432
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,320
What are you...

433
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,319
- We're talking about the singer.
- Why would you say such a thing?

434
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,460
I just want to make a nickname like that.

435
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,899
Give me a nickname like that. What could suit me?

436
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,200
(Anyway, My Star is laughing.)

437
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,769
You'll sing 19 songs. What songs will you sing?

438
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,980
The title of my concert is "Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B"

439
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,639
- As in Side A and Side B?
- That's correct.

440
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,150
That means...

441
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,479
- my acting career is Side A...
- I see.

442
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,849
- You'll show another side of you.
- while my singing career is Side B.

443
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,290
And I want to show people a new side of me.

444
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,559
You'll hold a concert in Busan too, right?

445
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,319
I'll start my concert tour in Busan.

446
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,989
I know. We saw your concert banner...

447
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,489
- We saw the banner.
- when we went to Busan.

448
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,660
That's right.

449
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,529
If we go straight...

450
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,530
(Glancing)

451
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,169
It says "Cho Jung Seok Show" will be held.

452
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,540
- Where?
- Over there.

453
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,599
What?

454
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,470
It says "Cho Jung Seok Show." What will he do?

455
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,770
He'll hold a concert?

456
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,280
I'm curious what he'll do at his concert.

457
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,579
I released my first song album last year.

458
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,919
- Does it have only your own songs?
- Of course.

459
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,280
- All songs are your own songs?
- Yes.

460
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,390
To tell you the truth, since I was a little boy,

461
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,790
it's been my dream...

462
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,929
- to become a singer-songwriter.
- To release a song album?

463
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,230
- Oh, to become a singer-songwriter?
- Yes.

464
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,330
Does that mean you wrote the lyrics and composed all your songs?

465
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,899
I made almost all of those songs.

466
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,270
- Really?
- Yes.

467
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,730
I participated in making all those songs.

468
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,170
What's the song that represents your album?

469
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,639
- The title track of the album is...
- The title track?

470
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,939
- "Champagne." - The title track.

471
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,009
- "Champagne?" - Yes.

472
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,640
- Nice. Let's hear it.
- Yes.

473
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,510
What do you say?

474
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,549
- My manager.
- You heard he should take care...

475
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,679
- of his throat.
- Right.

476
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,019
- I mean...
- I'll sing it many times later on.

477
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,990
He's going to have to sing it at the rehearsal.

478
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,760
Really? Okay.

479
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,229
- "Let's hear it." - I mean...

480
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,330
Will there be any guest singers?

481
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,400
- Guest singers?
- Yes.

482
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,529
(He senses something is wrong.)

483
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,999
I think Kwang Kyu is looking to you to invite him.

484
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,200
- No guest singers.
- But...

485
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,040
No guest singers.

486
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,569
But you'll need time to change your outfit.

487
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,039
- I think...
- There will be a short break time.

488
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,750
Anyway, he'll need to get changed.

489
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,309
There will be very little time for that, but I can manage it.

490
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,380
But that's...

491
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,749
(He'll manage time efficiently.)

492
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,120
If you want me there... Shall I sing a song for you?

493
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,490
No, that's okay.

494
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,759
- That's okay. I'll just relax...
- If you want...

495
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,490
I can be there if you want. I've released two albums.

496
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,029
- Oh, that's right.
- Yes.

497
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,699
- You released "Open Sesame" too.
- Yes.

498
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,529
You'll need to change your clothes between performances.

499
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,299
Yes, I'll need to do so.

500
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Will there be any guest singers?

501
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,110
As I already told you, there will be no guest singers.

502
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,779
There will be none?

503
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,440
I was joking. Actually, there are open positions.

504
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,749
It hasn't been decided. That's all.

505
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,979
(Keeping Kwang Kyu in check)

506
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,280
(Open sesame)

507
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,489
(He suddenly starts singing.)

508
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,020
I knew he would sing it.

509
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,260
- I hope the opportunity is open.
- The moment he said "open,"

510
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,230
- I knew he'd sing that song.
- I really hope so.

511
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,130
I hope you keep the opportunity open...

512
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,199
so that I can meet your mother too.

513
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,769
- I...
- I hope it'll be closed.

514
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,100
I'll go anywhere if you get me a train ticket.

515
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,510
I heard...

516
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,709
that you made a YouTube video not long ago...

517
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,839
with someone who looked like me.

518
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,479
(I heard you made a video with someone who looked like me.)

519
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,519
I was so surprised.

520
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,480
- "Cheonggyesan Daengi Records?" - Yes.

521
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,089
How did it go? Does he really look like me?

522
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,520
I thought he was you.

523
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,660
- Gosh.
- What?

524
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,089
Hey.

525
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,660
There's a pocket inside.

526
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,629
- Hello?
- Hi.

527
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,339
I'm writer Jeon Hyo Rim from SBS's "Mom's Diary."

528
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,400
- Yes, hi.
- I see.

529
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,839
- Hi.
- Hi.

530
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,769
What time will you be arriving?

531
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,110
- About 23 minutes.
- We're about 23 minutes away.

532
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,950
- Got it.
- It'll take us about 25 minutes.

533
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,620
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

534
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,550
I thought it was a spam call.

535
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,320
Come on, Kwang Kyu.

536
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,489
Squeeze in as you go. Squeeze in now.

537
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,959
I'll take care of the driving.

538
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,659
This is the way...

539
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,899
- I know, okay?
- to Banpo Bridge.

540
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,570
- Guys, I'm curious.
- Yes?

541
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,369
- Do you two get along well?
- Hey.

542
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,509
You two are always bickering.

543
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,480
- We don't get along.
- Every time I see you.

544
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,579
- One of the two has to sacrifice...
- Right.

545
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,779
- for the relationship to continue.
- Yes.

546
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,220
Who do you think is sacrificing between us?

547
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,390
I think it's me who is sacrificing.

548
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,059
- This is interesting.
- You get it now?

549
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,590
- You two are...
- This is us.

550
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,430
I thought I was the one sacrificing here.

551
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,569
My Star, don't you have it easy, sitting at the back?

552
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,500
- This is all really comfortable.
- Good.

553
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,899
I just have a feeling...

554
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,339
- Yes?
- that's how my day will turn out.

555
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,209
All the guests feel the same way...

556
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,810
- as you do.
- But...

557
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,119
You must take good care of your voice.

558
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,150
I do.

559
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,520
You have to constantly sing, right? Like practising.

560
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,120
Or else, your voice will go bad, no?

561
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,359
- Yes.
- Right?

562
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,460
By the way, now that I'm looking at it from here,

563
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,800
the humidifier mist is travelling forward.

564
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,169
Could you possibly just hold it?

565
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,540
- Okay.
- In front of you... Good.

566
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,439
- Leave it next to you.
- Leave it near your face.

567
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,510
- No, I'll put it on my left side.
- Yes, leave it there.

568
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,240
- You were right.
- Gosh.

569
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,609
But why? The AC air is flowing backward.

570
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,909
The mist kept blowing toward Seo Jin.

571
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,820
- That humidifier.
- No wonder my throat felt moist.

572
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,860
My throat kept feeling moist.

573
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,330
If you want it to feel even more moist, have a raw egg.

574
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,829
Did you really prepare raw eggs?

575
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,029
- Of course.
- But...

576
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,730
there are many who can't eat raw eggs.

577
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,930
- I can't have it. It's too rich.
- Same here.

578
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,970
- Can you eat raw eggs?
- What?

579
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,769
- I can't.
- But why?

580
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,839
- Why did you buy it...
- Listen...

581
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,909
- if you can't eat any?
- Listen...

582
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,580
I thought Jung Seok could eat raw eggs.

583
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,539
I'm sure more people can't eat it.

584
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,910
I'll talk about it.

585
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,110
To whom?

586
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,679
During the "Mom's Diary" shoot.

587
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,120
No, don't.

588
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,589
Dong Yeob will enjoy it.

589
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,090
- I don't think he'll eat it.
- He totally will.

590
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,329
Aren't you friends with Dong Yeob, Seo Jin?

591
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,460
We are.

592
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,660
- We live in the same neighbourhood.
- I see.

593
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,100
You two have known each other for a long time, right?

594
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,730
I've known Jang Hoon much longer.

595
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,740
Dong Yeob has been friends with my friends since we were young.

596
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,510
Because we'd heard a lot about each other,

597
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,509
we became friends the moment we met.

598
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,250
We simply had so many mutual friends.

599
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,519
There are only...

600
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,119
two celebrities I have befriended,

601
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,549
and one of them is Dong Yeob.

602
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,520
- And who else?
- Lee Byung Hun.

603
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,090
(Seo Jin's precious celebrity friends)

604
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,460
(Chatting about their friends, they got close to the destination.)

605
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,070
We got here much more fun and comfortable than expected.

606
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,270
- Right? What were you imagining?
- What?

607
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,169
- It's just...
- What did you imagine?

608
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,569
I thought I'd be the one driving.

609
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,880
(I thought I'd be the one driving.)

610
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,549
(I thought I'd be the one driving.)

611
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,879
(A little while later)

612
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,750
(Laughing)

613
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,790
(You're good at driving, Jung Seok.)

614
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,190
(The driver My Star can't help but just laugh.)

615
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,959
(What happened to them?)

616
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,329
- Is that SBS?
- Yes.

617
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,359
SBS...

618
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,560
We're not late.

619
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,970
You can leave the guitar in the car.

620
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,230
- Okay.
- Yes.

621
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

622
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,610
- Here. Let's go.
- Hi.

623
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,639
- Ms. Jeon. Hi.
- Hi.

624
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,739
I'm Jeon Hyo Rim from "Mom's Diary."

625
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,210
- Yes, nice to meet you.
- This way, please.

626
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,009
You're not playing the guitar on "Mom's Diary?"

627
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,080
- No.
- I see.

628
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,849
Jung Seok,

629
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,620
managers need to double-check and even triple-check things.

630
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,719
- You're right.
- Don't make him repeat...

631
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,590
the same answers to you.

632
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,329
Can we go over the script right away?

633
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,760
- Of course.
- Of course.

634
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,299
You can just talk to me directly.

635
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,930
- No, please go through me.
- Got it.

636
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,610
(My Star doesn't trust the Grumpy Secretaries.)

637
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,880
- Hi.
- Hi.

638
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,880
- Is this the waiting room?
- Yes.

639
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,680
- So this is the waiting room.
- The waiting room.

640
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,479
You can dig into the boxed lunches.

641
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,819
Okay.

642
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,180
(Boxed lunches for the actor and staff)

643
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,850
Have some water.

644
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,019
- Why are you taking care of us?
- Well...

645
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,460
- Don't.
- It's out of habit.

646
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,230
There's no need to take care of us.

647
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,000
(Rummaging)

648
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,830
There are so many boxed lunches.

649
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:33,000
(Looking around)

650
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,940
Why are there so many boxed lunches?

651
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,440
All right, have one later.

652
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,139
- Seriously.
- Seo Jin.

653
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,209
(Smiling)

654
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,679
I'm just asking who they're for.

655
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,710
You can have one later, okay?

656
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,120
Did they prepare for our production team too?

657
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,290
They're for Jung Seok's staff.

658
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,789
That includes you. It's fine.

659
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,320
Don't worry, I'll make sure you get one.

660
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,130
Thanks.

661
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,199
- For real.
- I didn't have breakfast.

662
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,929
He's only had eyes for the boxed lunches since we walked in.

663
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,830
(Eyes locked on the boxed lunches from the moment he entered)

664
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,440
Why are you eating so much these days?

665
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,139
It's fall. Haven't you heard of the season of abundance?

666
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,710
- The season of abundance?
- Goodness.

667
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,280
The time when people get fat.

668
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,349
(It's also the season of abundance for Kwang Kyu.)

669
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,689
(The "Mom's Diary" writer arrives for the meeting.)

670
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,120
- Hi. I'm here for the interview.
- Hi.

671
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,360
- I see. Hi.
- Hi.

672
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,930
(Getting the interview script)

673
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,459
- We...
- Nice to meet you.

674
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,460
Right.

675
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:36,799
- Did you read the script?
- Yes, I did.

676
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,599
- Anything that needs editing?
- You did a great job.

677
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,940
(My Star's preliminary interview begins.)

678
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,010
(Taking care of My Star from up close)

679
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,180
(He notices something he can do.)

680
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,749
(Ready to hand over the humidifier)

681
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,920
(Looking around)

682
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,420
Got it.

683
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,729
(He squeezes through and sets up the humidifier.)

684
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,760
- Got it.
- After that...

685
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,999
(Glancing)

686
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
(Laughing)

687
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,300
- Okay.
- Yes.

688
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,170
(Smiling)

689
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,010
(Done setting up the humidifier)

690
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,139
(Seo Jin sits right next to him.)

691
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,750
(Kwang Kyu also sits right beside them.)

692
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,780
(The Grumpy Secretaries continue their close care.)

693
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,220
(Glancing)

694
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,260
(My Star feels a bit uncomfortable.)

695
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,189
- Feedback?
- Yes.

696
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,659
(Even so, the meeting progresses smoothly.)

697
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,599
- I even heard that...
- Yes?

698
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:43,070
It was much better than any meat eaten at a restaurant.

699
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,739
(Glancing)

700
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,699
It was much better than any meat eaten at a restaurant.

701
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,540
(My Star seems uneasy.)

702
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,779
Can you take this away?

703
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,279
Doesn't your armpit feel wet?

704
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,950
No wonder my bottom...

705
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,479
felt wet.

706
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,450
It was just to take care of your voice.

707
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,320
(Wet)

708
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,230
I doubt he got wet.

709
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,170
I'm sure it was just slightly moist.

710
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,129
(Embarrassed despite saying it himself)

711
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,170
Seriously.

712
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,300
Someone that young...

713
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,040
could have endured that short moment.

714
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,379
When do we start?

715
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,680
- In ten minutes.
- Ten minutes?

716
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,149
(10 minutes before the "Mom's Diary" shoot)

717
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,349
Where's Seo Jin?

718
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,320
(Kwang Kyu is back from the restroom.)

719
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,149
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

720
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,250
Have a boxed lunch.

721
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,889
- Right now?
- Yes.

722
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,289
This is the only time you'll get.

723
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,460
Have it now. I'm serious.

724
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,489
If you do, I'll...

725
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,689
But Seo Jin will nag at me like crazy.

726
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,729
Eat now.

727
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,459
- It's your only chance.
- Is it?

728
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,029
This is the only time you can eat.

729
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,429
You should have some too.

730
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,599
- No, I already had a meal.
- I see.

731
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,210
- Dig in.
- But...

732
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:56,969
No, I'll get you...

733
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,139
- a spoon and chopsticks.
- No.

734
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,909
- I'll get them.
- No, stay.

735
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,980
No.

736
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,449
(His eyes are fixed on the boxed lunch.)

737
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,950
- Here.
- No, but...

738
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,179
- You should...
- Have some water.

739
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,980
- It's okay.
- This is the humidifier.

740
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,589
- You should eat a bit.
- No, I'm okay.

741
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,989
- Dig in.
- You'll get hungry.

742
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,789
No, you kept mentioning you were hungry earlier.

743
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,190
Hurry up and eat while Seo Jin isn't here.

744
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,030
You won't get another chance.

745
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,240
- Where did Seo Jin go?
- To the restroom.

746
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,609
Is that so?

747
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,610
(Good news)

748
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,380
Seo Jin went to the restroom.

749
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,880
(Opening it after hearing the good news)

750
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,680
(It looks delicious.)

751
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,689
I had nothing for breakfast.

752
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,519
What did you have again?

753
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,160
Perilla seed soup or something.

754
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,329
(Being on guard)

755
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,530
I didn't do anything.

756
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,129
Perilla seed soup or something.

757
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,130
(Glancing)

758
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:56,729
Kwang Kyu, Seo Jin is back.

759
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,740
Is that so? Hey, Seo Jin.

760
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,199
You should've waited until his shoot started.

761
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,839
Could you not wait that short time?

762
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,309
It's his only chance.

763
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,279
- There won't be another chance.
- Why? When your shoot starts...

764
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,739
We need to go to the studio once it does.

765
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,150
We can do that after our meal.

766
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,849
You need to monitor me when the shoot starts.

767
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,180
I can do that while he eats.

768
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,149
- Let's go.
- Where?

769
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,590
- He's done.
- Dong Yeob.

770
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,090
- Dong Yeob.
- Yes.

771
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,460
Rinse your mouth with water.

772
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,959
The congratulatory video is important. Hurry.

773
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,000
- Okay.
- Good.

774
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,499
(Required: Take a congratulatory video at the studio)

775
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,869
If you can ask the MCs to shoot congratulatory videos.

776
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,369
- Seo Jang Hoon and Shin Dong Yeob?
- Yes.

777
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,870
- I'd be grateful.
- Got it.

778
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,969
(Congratulatory video:)

779
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,379
(A video to congratulate or support a concert, )

780
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,740
(mainly featuring celebrities)

781
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:45,080
(An important step in starting a concert)

782
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,249
Hi.

783
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,590
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

784
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,349
- Is he in here?
- Yes, he's waiting.

785
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,890
(Visiting MC Dong Yeob's waiting room first)

786
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,590
- Dong Yeob.
- Hey.

787
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,930
- It's been a while.
- Yes.

788
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,200
Gosh.

789
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,370
- Kwang Kyu.
- Dong Yeob.

790
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,940
Long time no see.

791
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,740
To think you two are managers.

792
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,840
Yes, we're Jung Seok's managers today.

793
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,980
You're doing anything that brings in money.

794
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,080
- Right?
- Goodness.

795
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,209
- You...
- It's a good thing.

796
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,449
Yes, of course.

797
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,620
I'll do anything if asked. I don't have a choice.

798
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,980
- So it's Jung Seok, today?
- Yes, Jung Seok.

799
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,549
(Looking at him)

800
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,049
- Did you drink a lot yesterday?
- What?

801
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,560
- I did drink a bit yesterday.
- I see.

802
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,690
How red my face was surprised me.

803
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,259
I heard you cut back on drinking,

804
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,799
- but you still drink a lot.
- Of course.

805
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,029
- Did you really cut back?
- What?

806
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,199
Didn't you say you were cutting down?

807
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,530
I only said that publicly.

808
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,409
Not long ago, I was drinking with my wife in the neighbourhood,

809
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:45,979
and we ran into him, so he joined us.

810
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,639
- Really?
- We met by chance.

811
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,179
So you two do meet up at times.

812
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,480
- We met at the bar by chance.
- Yes.

813
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,219
I sometimes bump into his wife...

814
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,550
since we live in the same neighbourhood.

815
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,150
Seo Jin treated us to drinks back then.

816
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,890
- Seo Jin is very generous.
- Yes.

817
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,460
By the way, Jung Seok is holding a concert.

818
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,129
- I'm talking about Jung Seok.
- I see.

819
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,170
He asked for a congratulatory video.

820
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,240
(Desperate)

821
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,739
For his concert?

822
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,570
Yes, a congratulatory video for it.

823
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,270
(I see.)

824
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,810
- Do you not want to do it?
- No.

825
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,980
I'm guessing you don't know about my relationship with Jung Seok.

826
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,710
- Are things awkward?
- We...

827
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,619
- We're not really on good terms.
- Did you two fight?

828
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,650
I...

829
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,490
(Taken aback by the unexpected conflict)

830
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,589
I'm serious right now. I absolutely love Gummy,

831
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,400
but he got married to her, which has made me hate him.

832
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,730
(This is how Dong Yeob jokes.)

833
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,899
(That was a shocker.)

834
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,399
- I tried to hate him, - Right.

835
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,639
But the guy himself is too kind...

836
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,569
- and too good at acting.
- True.

837
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,570
That's why...

838
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,079
What do I say in the congratulatory video?

839
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:56,810
"Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B." Please include it.

840
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,319
"SIDE A" is him being an actor, and "SIDE B" is him being a singer.

841
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,020
- Right.
- That phrase is only required.

842
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,820
- "Cho Jung Seok..." - "SHOW."

843
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,190
- "Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B." - "SIDE B."

844
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,590
- Okay.
- Check the angle.

845
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,429
- What?
- The angle.

846
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,789
- Move in closer.
- Closer?

847
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,430
No, closer like this.

848
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,600
Hi, it's Shin Dong Yeob.

849
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,000
"Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B."

850
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,970
Congratulations from the bottom of my heart.

851
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:25,009
Actually, I really adore Jung Seok.

852
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:28,239
And since his two managers asked,

853
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,650
I couldn't say no to congratulating him.

854
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,949
Among all the actors I know,

855
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,419
he's the kindest...

856
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,860
and the best at acting.

857
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,190
The one and only actor. That's Cho Jung Seok.

858
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,259
An actor who is really kind...

859
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,360
but isn't as good at acting is Lee Seo Jin.

860
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,100
It's really a bummer.

861
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,969
Either way, Jung Seok has it all.

862
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,939
He's even good at singing.

863
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,410
Good luck, "Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B."

864
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,640
As expected of a professional.

865
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,880
- That was smooth.
- Yes, smooth.

866
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,680
You asked out of the blue.

867
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,249
- You're good.
- I could've taken it separately.

868
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,649
Do you have to drink a lot to be that smooth?

869
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,820
- No.
- No way.

870
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,759
Sincerity, being honest, and facts.

871
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,919
I mean, he's kind...

872
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,289
but isn't as good at acting.

873
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,660
I don't act anymore.

874
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,959
- My acting career has ended.
- He doesn't get cast.

875
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,569
- No?
- No.

876
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,630
I don't get cast.

877
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,740
(Meanwhile, in My Star's waiting room)

878
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,040
I feel bad that Kwang Kyu didn't get to eat.

879
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,540
It looks all lonely, doesn't it?

880
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,409
Kwang Kyu's trace.

881
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,910
(Trace of Kwang Kyu trying to eat)

882
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,050
I should be taking care of him.

883
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,090
Even breakfast... This is how hardworking...

884
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,259
he is, everyone.

885
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,160
Please watch the show.

886
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,490
Good luck, My Grumpy Secretary.

887
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,659
- Okay.
- We're heading down now.

888
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,129
- I've got to see Jang Hoon.
- Got it.

889
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,930
Please take good care of My Star.

890
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,270
(20 minutes before the shoot)

891
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,610
(Heading to the studio with My Star)

892
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,640
We need Jang Hoon's congratulatory video.

893
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,180
Where's Jang Hoon?

894
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,209
- Hi, Jang Hoon.
- Hey.

895
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,680
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

896
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,920
- I'm Cho Jung Seok's manager.
- Right.

897
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,459
I'm Cho Jung Seok's another manager.

898
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,490
I see.

899
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,490
Why are you...

900
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:26,430
- Are you with him the whole day?
- Yes, the whole day.

901
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,870
(Awkward, he doesn't know what to do with his hands.)

902
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,099
Why are you laughing?

903
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,000
Don't laugh. You're making it embarrassing.

904
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:38,140
(The encounter feels strangely embarrassing.)

905
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,410
- Come on.
- Should we take it here?

906
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,450
- What? The congratulatory video?
- The congratulatory video.

907
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,410
Take what?

908
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,789
Jung Seok is having a concert.

909
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,519
- I see.
- That's right.

910
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,620
The congratulatory...

911
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,189
- Congratulate him.
- Okay, let's do it now.

912
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,689
Out there right now?

913
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,559
We need to have Jang Hoon sit.

914
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,729
Or else, we can't take it.

915
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,930
- Jung Seok is having a concert?
- Yes.

916
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,999
- Closer.
- Okay, closer.

917
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,699
- This close?
- Yes.

918
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,670
- You don't look that big.
- Okay.

919
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,940
Good.

920
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,539
You can start.

921
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,540
Hi, it's Seo Jang Hoon.

922
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:18,279
Actor Cho Jung Seok, whom I adore,

923
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,020
is holding a concert.

924
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,550
It's a nationwide concert tour.

925
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,060
I hope many show interest and love for it.

926
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:30,530
"Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B."

927
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,830
Please hit the jackpot. You can do it!

928
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,330
(Congratulatory video has been taken.)

929
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,030
- Thank you.
- No problem.

930
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,170
(Meanwhile, My Star is all set for the shoot.)

931
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,509
Please stand by over there.

932
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,580
- Over here.
- Let's go.

933
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,780
(My Star stands by at the entrance.)

934
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,390
(Grumpy Secretary moves closer to My Star.)

935
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,629
(A close care without having to mention it now)

936
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,160
Seo Jin, if you stand there, you'll get caught in the camera.

937
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,759
What now? Let's hurry.

938
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,429
(The half-century-old managers are in the way.)

939
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,900
(But he's still grateful.)

940
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,140
(Moved back to avoid the camera)

941
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,180
(Work mode on)

942
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,519
(Showing off his sweet voice, )

943
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,190
(My Star enters.)

944
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,460
(Good luck, My Star!)

945
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,170
(With My Star's opening performance, )

946
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,570
(the shoot for "Mom's Diary" begins.)

947
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,580
(Grumpy Secretaries monitor in the back.)

948
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,409
What are you not good at?

949
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,810
Exactly.

950
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,520
What's really impressive is that...

951
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,120
his managers are Lee Seo Jin and Kim Kwang Kyu.

952
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:08,319
- They're right there.
- Those two are over there.

953
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,430
Nice to meet you.

954
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,330
Hello, ma'am.

955
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,200
- They're full of strong points.
- Gosh.

956
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,430
I felt in on my way here,

957
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,810
but Manager Kwang Kyu is great at driving.

958
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,370
He made it comfortable.

959
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:28,109
Meanwhile, Manager Seo Jin always has a critical point of view.

960
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,749
(Seo Jin is a critically thinking manager.)

961
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,880
- Yes, critical.
- Right?

962
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,820
Out of everyone I know, he grumbles the most.

963
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,349
But that's what's hilarious.

964
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,919
He only says facts when meeting privately.

965
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,089
- You know him well.
- Of course.

966
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,959
He's kind of like Jang Hoon.

967
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,830
I can't even compete against him.

968
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:49,569
He grumbles a lot more than me.

969
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,869
(A grumpier person than Seo Jang Hoon)

970
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,970
But above everything else,

971
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,169
- those two are perfect...
- Gosh.

972
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,079
- for "Mom's Diary." - The leading figures.

973
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,640
You're totally right.

974
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,080
- Both of them.
- Yes, both of them.

975
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,209
- You're right.
- Even Kwang Kyu.

976
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,819
They're both "Mom's Diary" material.

977
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,089
- For sure.
- They're clearly diary material.

978
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,149
- Yes.
- They're perfect for it.

979
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,359
(Grumpy Secretaries, the most wanted in "Mom's Diary")

980
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,660
By the way...

981
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,530
(While the shoot for "Mom's Diary" continues...)

982
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,869
We all know, even through dramas, how good he is...

983
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,130
- at singing.
- Shall we leave?

984
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,370
- Yes, let's.
- We can't help...

985
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,269
- but expect him to do it.
- Let's go.

986
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,669
(My Star's first schedule is sailing smoothly.)

987
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,840
That's in the past now.

988
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,309
(My Star's Schedule:)

989
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,149
(12:30pm, "Mom's Diary" shoot at SBS Prism Tower)

990
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,580
(5pm, Concert practice at Music Studio)

991
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,250
(Eating lunch in between schedules)

992
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,420
(Gosh, I'm starving.)

993
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:52,190
The shoot is until 4pm?

994
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,330
Does it end that quickly?

995
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,340
- Were you in it?
- Yes.

996
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,910
I was in it for a while.

997
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,080
(Since I'm hungry, let's dig in first.)

998
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,380
(Staring)

999
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,650
What is it?

1000
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,450
- Yours is different.
- Yes.

1001
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,859
(Kwang Kyu's boxed lunch has rice and side dishes.)

1002
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,260
Why is yours so simple?

1003
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,689
- Mine has soup.
- Hey.

1004
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,829
(Meanwhile, Seo Jin even has soup.)

1005
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,359
You're right. This is...

1006
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,130
(Failed to get a nice boxed lunch)

1007
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,039
Out of all the boxed lunches...

1008
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,870
(Regretfully, he chose the boxed lunch.)

1009
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,340
(Having some soup)

1010
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,880
I should get the same food.

1011
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,120
Yours has eggs.

1012
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,680
- Didn't yours have any?
- No.

1013
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:50,020
Yes.

1014
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,960
(He's satisfied.)

1015
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:56,490
(Eating the eggs that are included only in his lunchbox)

1016
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,060
Kwang Kyu.

1017
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:00,229
(Stop)

1018
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,059
What? Are you done?

1019
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,100
Let's go.

1020
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,939
I didn't even eat much.

1021
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,100
(Rushing)

1022
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,069
We'll be late.

1023
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,210
(My Star is filming right now.)

1024
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,810
Give me two more minutes.

1025
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,110
Two minutes.

1026
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,250
(The Caretaker Fairy is still hungry.)

1027
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,250
Let's go. Come on.

1028
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,890
- That guy.
- Let's go.

1029
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,860
(He even uses his slurping technique.)

1030
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,430
We're going to be late!

1031
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,430
- It's good.
- We'll be late. We have to hurry.

1032
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,000
(He's rushing alone.)

1033
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,000
(The older bestie doesn't leave any food.)

1034
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,940
(In the end, the lunchbox was confiscated.)

1035
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,180
(Crying)

1036
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,050
I was frustrated since then.

1037
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,020
He tried to eat all the food until the end.

1038
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,650
Of course, I'd be frustrated.

1039
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,849
You're not supposed to disturb someone who is eating.

1040
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,219
- You almost had indigestion.
- Yes.

1041
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,660
It felt like I was at Nonsan Military Training Center.

1042
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,430
Goodness.

1043
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,399
Didn't he ask for warm water?

1044
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,770
That's right.

1045
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,029
(The 2025 Cho Jung Seok SHOW: SIDE B is coming up.)

1046
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,199
(Always focus on maintaining his vocal health.)

1047
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,209
(Keep lukewarm water ready at all times.)

1048
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:18,240
That's hot.

1049
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,550
(He prepares lukewarm water for My Star's vocal cords.)

1050
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,450
(Careful temperature check)

1051
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,520
(Kwang Kyu is in charge of the humidifier.)

1052
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,060
(The humidifier is ready as well.)

1053
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:35,789
(They fully prepare to take care of My Star...)

1054
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,359
(and return to the studio.)

1055
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,960
It's not over yet. Is there still a lot left?

1056
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,900
(They quickly ate and came, but My Star is still working.)

1057
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,640
(Checking the humidifier)

1058
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,810
I think the water smells.

1059
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,880
(Smelling)

1060
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,720
(Coughing)

1061
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,390
(Coughing)

1062
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,919
(It smells a little, )

1063
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,090
(but he keeps hydrating the air.)

1064
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,000
(Moving it)

1065
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:21,170
(It's not product placement.)

1066
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:25,039
(A humidifier therapy by older bestie...)

1067
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,380
(with meticulous hands)

1068
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,379
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1069
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,509
(Schedule's done.)

1070
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,280
Well done, Jung Seok.

1071
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,949
- Seo Jin, I'm off.
- Dong Yeob.

1072
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,019
- Well done.
- You're working hard.

1073
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,090
- I'll get going, Kwang Kyu.
- Bye.

1074
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,590
- Bye.
- I'll be in touch.

1075
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,689
- I'm a big fan.
- Hello.

1076
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,899
- You're so funny.
- Hello.

1077
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,629
- You waited long.
- It's okay.

1078
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,969
- We went somewhere too.
- You should wait as the manager.

1079
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,070
Yes.

1080
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,870
- You should get married.
- Yes.

1081
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,540
Yes.

1082
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,410
Even Kyeong Hwan isn't married.

1083
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,549
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1084
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,120
Thank you.

1085
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,550
Have some water. Warm water.

1086
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,250
Warm water.

1087
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,120
Why are you suddenly taking photos?

1088
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,759
All we'll have left are the photos.

1089
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,730
- Jung Seok. The guitar...
- Yes.

1090
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,170
- What's wrong?
- The person explained a little.

1091
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,069
That's going to take two and a half hour.

1092
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,769
- So...
- There were many things to fix.

1093
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,339
We didn't go all the way to Nagwon Musical Instrument Arcade.

1094
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,910
We went to Hongdae.

1095
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,310
- I'll use that guitar at the show.
- Okay.

1096
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,980
When I start recording "Mom's Diary,"

1097
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,019
could you go to Nagwon Musical Instrument Arcade...

1098
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,789
and have the guitar strings replaced and set?

1099
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,219
(They headed to Nagwon Musical Instrument Arcade.)

1100
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,820
When are we going to get back?

1101
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,359
(There's heavy traffic.)

1102
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,430
It's so jammed.

1103
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,429
(Thinking)

1104
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,900
Should we look for a nearby guitar shop...

1105
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,400
and go there?

1106
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,600
A guitar repair shop in Hongdae.

1107
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,769
Should we go there?

1108
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,800
Hello.

1109
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,740
Excuse me.

1110
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,179
- What strings should I use?
- Good ones.

1111
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,979
(Good ones)

1112
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,950
How long has he been playing?

1113
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,819
(My Star's playing experience?)

1114
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,920
I don't think he plays crazily well.

1115
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,589
I don't think he plays guitar solos.

1116
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:20,189
He plays the rhythm.

1117
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,919
(My Star's guitar went to Hongdae because of their trickery.)

1118
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,129
So I think we can pick it up as we go.

1119
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,789
- Hongdae.
- Hongdae...

1120
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,129
- is near the rehearsal room.
- Right.

1121
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,699
- Really?
- It's nearby.

1122
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,929
It's nearby? Okay.

1123
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,699
There was so much traffic going to Nagwon Musical Instrument Arcade.

1124
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,139
So we went to Hongdae.

1125
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,210
Still,

1126
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,839
you're quite reliable.

1127
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,149
(For the first time, My Star thinks Grumpy Secretary is reliable.)

1128
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,379
I think...

1129
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,980
you've improved...

1130
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,489
- while filming My Grumpy Secretary.
- No, we haven't.

1131
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:51,750
- I'm serious.
- We haven't. It doesn't improve.

1132
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,619
- It doesn't?
- It doesn't improve.

1133
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,260
(Their tricks have surely improved.)

1134
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:56,589
- Left.
- Yes.

1135
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,890
Get changed.

1136
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,229
Hello. This is Lee Seo Jin, the person who left the guitar...

1137
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,830
- for repair earlier.
- Yes.

1138
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,699
- Is it done?
- It's done.

1139
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,100
We'll soon be there to pick it up.

1140
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,010
- Come anytime.
- Thank you.

1141
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,410
Thank you.

1142
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,979
- The guitar repair is done.
- Let's go.

1143
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,250
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1144
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,909
We have many things to do.

1145
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:19,980
All right.

1146
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,420
I'm really hungry.

1147
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,289
- You're hungry?
- Yes.

1148
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,820
I should go and eat.

1149
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,730
They have curry pork cutlet there. How about that?

1150
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,589
That's so nice. Let's go with curry pork cutlet.

1151
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,759
It's right in front of it.

1152
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,959
It's very...

1153
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,030
After you.

1154
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:40,140
Maybe because I didn't have high expectations,

1155
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,540
I'm very satisfied.

1156
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,009
Did you record the congratulatory message?

1157
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,610
Of course. We did both.

1158
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,409
(That's amazing.)

1159
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,410
Amazing.

1160
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:52,450
I'll watch it in the car.

1161
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,779
You won't be able to watch it in the car. He recorded it.

1162
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,389
- He has to look at the map.
- Oh, okay.

1163
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:58,019
- Then when we're eating...
- Yes.

1164
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,360
(He input the destination on the navigation.)

1165
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,230
(Escorting)

1166
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:06,430
You even open the door for me.

1167
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,630
- Now I get your style.
- Jung Seok.

1168
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,000
- You might need this.
- Yes.

1169
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,599
Now I get your style.

1170
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,970
- What is it?
- What's our style?

1171
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,040
Seo Jin...

1172
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,979
takes care of you...

1173
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,409
(Manager Seo Jin is like a sweet boyfriend.)

1174
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,650
like he takes care of his girlfriend.

1175
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:28,879
I think it's perfect for him.

1176
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:29,950
(He's happy.)

1177
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,320
For Kwang Kyu, it's like...

1178
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,959
- You're spot on.
- "It's hard to make a living."

1179
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,530
You could approach it like that.

1180
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,599
He's spot on.

1181
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,000
(My Star has great insight.)

1182
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,570
(3:40pm, heading to pick up the guitar)

1183
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:52,169
The congratulatory message you recorded...

1184
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:55,679
I hope you didn't record it vertically.

1185
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,850
I recorded it vertically.

1186
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,980
People record it vertically these days.

1187
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,420
Do you take it horizontally?

1188
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,220
- Vertically...
- I'll look at it later.

1189
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,930
I'm getting nervous again.

1190
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,960
These days, people...

1191
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:18,400
We recorded it vertically...

1192
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,939
with U-Know Yunho.

1193
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,169
You were scolded because you recorded it horizontally.

1194
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,239
I was scolded because I recorded it horizontally.

1195
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,269
I got used to recording it vertically.

1196
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,340
Oh, I should film it vertically.

1197
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,579
- It's going to be played...
- Yes, the screen.

1198
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:30,880
On the screen at the concert hall.

1199
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,610
Do I have to record it again?

1200
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,280
How will you record it again?

1201
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,390
About the congratulatory message, it was because of U-Know Yunho.

1202
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,290
He always has someone to blame.

1203
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,489
- Yunho...
- He always blames it on someone.

1204
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,500
I usually take videos horizontally.

1205
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,369
He should have told me to take it horizontally.

1206
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,030
Jung Seok is at fault.

1207
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,040
He should have told me to record it horizontally.

1208
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,709
(He looks at his reaction.)

1209
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,710
That's tasty.

1210
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:02,639
- How was the recording?
- It was...

1211
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,009
- It's was fun.
- Fun?

1212
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,209
That's a relief.

1213
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,549
Did you monitor it?

1214
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,189
Of course.

1215
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:11,520
I couldn't see you anywhere.

1216
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,189
You wouldn't have seen us because it was dark.

1217
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,559
The lights were off.

1218
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,529
Still, you would be visible.

1219
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:18,560
No, I mean...

1220
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:23,570
What do you mean?

1221
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,069
- After leaving the guitar, - Yes?

1222
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:30,609
I quickly took a picture from afar when I came back.

1223
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,770
- Really?
- Yes.

1224
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,710
- I zoomed in to take the shot.
- Why are you lying so much?

1225
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,650
Right? I couldn't see him anywhere.

1226
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,419
(He's full of distrust.)

1227
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,290
Listen to me.

1228
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,389
One of the traits I hate most in a manager is...

1229
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,460
- That car looks pretty.
- That car looks pretty.

1230
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,360
(That car looks pretty.)

1231
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:56,200
Things like this.

1232
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,200
Steering the conversation.

1233
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,340
Lying.

1234
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,610
- That's not nice.
- He's too much.

1235
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,239
Liar.

1236
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,310
I like liars.

1237
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,209
(I like liars.)

1238
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,309
What?

1239
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:14,149
Why do you like liars? You like liars?

1240
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,020
- He likes liars.
- No.

1241
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,749
- I'm...
- What are you talking about?

1242
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,590
I'm just practising my English!

1243
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,289
That pretty car is still in front of us.

1244
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:26,030
You're right. What a pretty car.

1245
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:30,069
But is it okay to repair the guitar like that?

1246
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,729
- We didn't tell him what to do.
- Yes?

1247
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:34,670
The shop owner took it into his own hands.

1248
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,340
- Sure.
- That's how...

1249
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,369
He asked us...

1250
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,379
how well you played.

1251
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,839
(The repair method differs depending on the player's skill.)

1252
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,209
He asked us that.

1253
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:45,409
So what did you tell him?

1254
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:48,420
So I said you're not at the level of playing a guitar solo.

1255
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,920
You play the rhythm guitar.

1256
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,150
He plays the rhythm.

1257
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,659
I play guitar solos too.

1258
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,389
(I play guitar solos too.)

1259
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,830
- You also play guitar solos?
- Yes.

1260
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,490
(He's flustered.)

1261
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,959
You also play guitar solos?

1262
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,960
Of course.

1263
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:03,769
I play a guitar solo at this show.

1264
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,399
- That's why...
- Really?

1265
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,870
You play a guitar solo while singing as well?

1266
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,199
- Yes.
- That's amazing.

1267
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,670
I'm practising to play it well.

1268
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,079
(He needs the guitar for today's performance.)

1269
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,080
(Would it have been repaired well?)

1270
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,480
Let's go and see...

1271
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,150
how the guitar has changed.

1272
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,959
(They arrive at the guitar shop with nervous hearts.)

1273
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,060
Hello.

1274
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,660
We came with the guitar's owner.

1275
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,160
Hello.

1276
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,830
Hello.

1277
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,470
- Take a look.
- How is it?

1278
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,429
It was repaired well.

1279
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,969
- I'll connect it.
- Yes.

1280
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,040
Feel free to play it.

1281
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,609
It's a bit...

1282
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,810
(My Star checks it right away.)

1283
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,230
It's so nice.

1284
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,970
It's nice.

1285
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,940
(He's surprised.)

1286
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,149
(My Star's guitar skills are better than expected.)

1287
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,150
He's good.

1288
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,550
He's good.

1289
00:52:32,551 --> 00:52:34,389
(Grumpy Secretary is shocked by My Star's guitar skills.)

1290
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:36,890
- He plays so well.
- It's good.

1291
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,260
Thank you.

1292
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,330
I'm so satisfied. Great.

1293
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,399
Thank you.

1294
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,169
We came here by chance, but it was a master's shop.

1295
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:51,940
I know.

1296
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,009
- Really...
- Thank you.

1297
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,109
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1298
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,350
(The guitar repair was successfully done.)

1299
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,750
Out of everything you did, I'm most happy about this.

1300
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,920
I realised that you're skilled.

1301
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,760
You're the best managers.

1302
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:13,030
- You wore it the other way around.
- It's the other way around?

1303
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,430
If you didn't do things like this, I'd be really happy.

1304
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,730
While preparing for the concert,

1305
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,970
I had many concerns...

1306
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,539
about where to take the guitar and when...

1307
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,280
to have it set.

1308
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:33,180
Actually, they solved that problem perfectly...

1309
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,650
(Looking at them)

1310
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,650
They're doing that now,

1311
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,559
but they did it so perfectly.

1312
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,160
So I think that was perfect.

1313
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,089
Let's first go to the main road.

1314
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:48,700
(My Star's Schedule: 5pm, concert practice at a music studio)

1315
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,200
(Laughing)

1316
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,209
(My Star is holding the steering wheel.)

1317
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:01,040
Jung Seok drives well.

1318
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,710
(My Star can't do anything but laugh.)

1319
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,080
You drive it so well.

1320
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,680
It's not even your car.

1321
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:12,250
- We should have let him drive.
- Yes.

1322
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,159
He's good.

1323
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,190
I know.

1324
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,600
(30 minutes ago, lunch with My Star)

1325
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,799
When will I get to enjoy such a luxury again?

1326
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,200
They're...

1327
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,440
When we go to grill restaurants, they'll say, "Grill some meat."

1328
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,710
(Feeling guilty)

1329
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,280
- Fried chicken karaage.
- Yes.

1330
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,239
One udon with fried shrimp.

1331
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,480
- Udon with fried shrimp.
- Yes.

1332
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,380
- Draft beer.
- Draft beer.

1333
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,049
- What would you like?
- He has to drive. He can't drink.

1334
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,490
(Tempted)

1335
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,050
Draft beer here looks tasty.

1336
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:49,390
Would you like a glass of draft beer?

1337
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,859
I have to sing.

1338
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,459
- You have to make it wet.
- Seo Jin.

1339
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,529
It feels better when you drink a glass.

1340
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,769
I quit drinking.

1341
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:57,830
- Really?
- Yes.

1342
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,200
Aren't you going to ask me?

1343
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,900
You have to drive. You can't drink.

1344
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:04,110
We can make Jung Seok drive.

1345
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,880
The first time...

1346
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,910
It seemed like he wanted to drink beer.

1347
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,180
Really?

1348
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,619
You can have a drink. I'll drive.

1349
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,490
(He throws empty words.)

1350
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:18,649
Hey.

1351
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:19,689
(I have a conscience, you know.)

1352
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,790
Let's make this extreme.

1353
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,160
I mean...

1354
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,600
Since he's saying that,

1355
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,460
it feels like we should drink.

1356
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:34,669
He's very firm.

1357
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:35,670
(Looking around)

1358
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:36,969
Then...

1359
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,670
can you drive a Carnival?

1360
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,779
Are you really going to drink?

1361
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,810
(He's flustered.)

1362
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:47,220
He's crazy today.

1363
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,720
Aren't you going to drink?

1364
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,090
You can't drink alone.

1365
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,320
Right.

1366
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,960
(Let's drink together.)

1367
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,790
Press the pay button.

1368
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:00,829
A small one.

1369
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:02,360
- Isn't this the small one?
- That's right.

1370
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,600
Seriously.

1371
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,540
It's really being paid.

1372
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,240
- Gosh.
- This is funny.

1373
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,779
This is funny. My Grumpy Secretary is very funny.

1374
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,340
(Clenching his teeth)

1375
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,410
For the first time...

1376
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,749
To Cho Jung Seok Show.

1377
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,879
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1378
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,949
Enjoy.

1379
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,850
(Drinking)

1380
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:26,990
(Exclaiming)

1381
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:33,659
(His sudden exclamation fills the air.)

1382
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,059
My throat is clearing.

1383
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,130
Yes.

1384
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:40,969
You can do this with me.

1385
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:42,270
Who else would you do that with?

1386
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,740
Of course.

1387
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,440
Jung Seok kept telling us to drink.

1388
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,410
How could we refuse that?

1389
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,050
- My Star told us to drink.
- Your star...

1390
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,079
It is being negligent at work, but I thought...

1391
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:57,349
it would be nice to show...

1392
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:59,419
the artist driving.

1393
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,460
- You thought about the content?
- I thought about the content.

1394
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:07,660
I'm saying this in case the viewers take it wrong.

1395
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,970
This is really happening.

1396
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,439
We're not doing this...

1397
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,370
to make this funny.

1398
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:21,539
Grumpy Secretary. I think they're really mad.

1399
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,580
- I mean...
- Seriously.

1400
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,279
Be careful.

1401
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,980
(To the next star)

1402
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,320
Sitting here is really uncomfortable.

1403
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:35,260
Stop lying.

1404
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,160
Stop lying!

1405
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,130
It's really uncomfortable. I should have sat in front.

1406
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,299
I heard the breath that came out from your belly...

1407
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,700
after you got in the car.

1408
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,500
(Exclaiming)

1409
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:51,939
It was a sigh of apology.

1410
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,970
(It was because I felt sorry, My Star.)

1411
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,810
I really didn't want to drink.

1412
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,879
I also drank because the production crew said...

1413
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,949
they were hungry.

1414
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,749
I meant the beer.

1415
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,320
- Beer?
- What are you talking about?

1416
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:08,890
I don't know about other things,

1417
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,490
but we have to make it really cool this time.

1418
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:13,700
(Yawning)

1419
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,830
(My Star's seat makes him sleepy.)

1420
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,370
(Glancing)

1421
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:20,900
(Glancing again)

1422
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,100
Are you sleeping, Kwang Kyu?

1423
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,140
- No. I'm listening.
- Yes. But...

1424
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:27,240
it's very...

1425
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,280
This looks so natural,

1426
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,680
and that makes me mad.

1427
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:36,550
- Jung Seok.
- So even while driving,

1428
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:38,320
I'm thinking, "What is this?"

1429
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,420
An hour ago,

1430
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,690
I was sitting there.

1431
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,559
- Is that how it was?
- Yes.

1432
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:46,560
(He's still flustered.)

1433
00:58:46,561 --> 00:58:47,860
Drive properly.

1434
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,429
We're almost there.

1435
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,370
It's in a residential neighbourhood like this.

1436
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,209
(My Star even parks perfectly.)

1437
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:00,739
- We're here.
- Thank you.

1438
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,180
He parks at once.

1439
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:03,980
Goodness.

1440
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:05,679
He drives well.

1441
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,919
Not at all.

1442
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,279
- What can't you do?
- We're here!

1443
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,520
Well done.

1444
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:13,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

1445
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,660
(My Star's Evening Schedule: Band practising for the concert)

1446
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,959
(My Star's old dream)

1447
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,560
(Singer-songwriter Cho Jung Seok)

1448
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,669
(The place where that dream, "Cho Jung Seok Show," comes alive)

1449
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,599
(The rehearsal room)

1450
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,869
(His dimples show with his entrance.)

1451
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:31,110
I like bands.

1452
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,310
I like music, and I'm very interested in guitars.

1453
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,580
I still...

1454
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:39,510
memorize all the Billboard chart songs from the 1980s.

1455
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:42,749
If you play the songs ranked 1 to 100 back then,

1456
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,650
I can name all of them.

1457
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:51,290
(Looking around)

1458
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:56,330
(He found the rehearsal cue sheet.)

1459
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:58,499
(He quickly scans the songs with his experience in music.)

1460
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,100
Have I been here before?

1461
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:02,840
There's "Rain and You."

1462
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,869
(There's rock that Seo Genie likes in the practice list.)

1463
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:08,840
It seemed like the intro of "Rain and You."

1464
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,549
- Hello.
- Hello.

1465
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,280
(What songs will My Star sing today?)

1466
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:15,319
- Hello.
- Hello.

1467
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,720
(My Star comes in while greeting them politely.)

1468
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:20,690
Ji Won. Aren't you going to eat?

1469
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,959
- Dinner.
- Dinner?

1470
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,360
Yes. I'm going to ask them to get something.

1471
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:26,729
You will?

1472
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,559
- Snacks will do.
- Snacks?

1473
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,400
- I don't need a full meal.
- Really?

1474
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,930
All right.

1475
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,700
Managers.

1476
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,100
Yes.

1477
01:00:36,101 --> 01:00:37,469
(He responds right away.)

1478
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,309
Could you get snacks?

1479
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,640
- What kind?
- What snacks?

1480
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,879
Things like street food.

1481
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,650
- Street food or...
- Chicken?

1482
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,820
- Chicken sounds nice. Good.
- Okay.

1483
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,920
- Chicken or something like that.
- Something like that? Okay.

1484
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:55,160
Please get us nice snacks.

1485
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,890
Couldn't we have it delivered?

1486
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,230
- Delivered?
- Yes.

1487
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:02,099
(He's experienced with the delivery app..)

1488
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,330
You'd have to use your money.

1489
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,300
(He goes big and flexes with his card.)

1490
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,509
(While Grumpy Secretary orders the snacks, )

1491
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:16,140
(he naturally sits down with his guitar.)

1492
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,780
I had the guitar fixed.

1493
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:21,750
(Thank you, Grumpy Secretary.)

1494
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,950
(Guitar showcase)

1495
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:28,120
Full volume. Okay.

1496
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:33,729
(A cool sound check)

1497
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:36,860
(Feeling proud)

1498
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,670
(The practice is already cool.)

1499
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,510
(It sounds good.)

1500
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,649
Did you practice playing the guitar?

1501
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,520
I did. But...

1502
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,750
I did my best...

1503
01:01:57,350 --> 01:01:59,889
(An exciting sound check with brand-new guitar strings ends.)

1504
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,620
You may have been surprised.

1505
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:07,460
My managers from My Grumpy Secretary are here.

1506
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:09,560
(He introduces the Grumpy Secretary.)

1507
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:10,970
Hello.

1508
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:13,029
One looks like the manager,

1509
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,340
and one looks like the CEO,

1510
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:18,870
but please work with them well.

1511
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,940
Please take care of the prompter.

1512
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:23,180
- Okay!
- Okay.

1513
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,749
(The musician of 2 albums...)

1514
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,610
(volunteers to be in charge of the lyric prompter.)

1515
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,950
"Aloha?" Shall we start with "Aloha?"

1516
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,619
- They'll play "Aloha." - "Aloha?"

1517
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,920
Yes. "Aloha."

1518
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,020
This isn't there.

1519
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,660
- What?
- Where is it?

1520
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,199
There's no mouse. How do you do this?

1521
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,759
You don't use your fingers. It's not a touch screen.

1522
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,869
You don't use your fingers.

1523
01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:46,199
(At this important moment...)

1524
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:47,869
- Where is it?
- You can't do it either.

1525
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:48,899
You try it.

1526
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,970
I don't know. I haven't used it.

1527
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,809
Where is it?

1528
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,110
(It feels like things have gone completely wrong from the start.)

1529
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,709
Where is it?

1530
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:59,710
Okay.

1531
01:02:59,711 --> 01:03:02,449
(All eyes naturally head to one spot.)

1532
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:03,480
How do you put it down?

1533
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,459
(Why do bad feelings never turn out wrong?)

1534
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:09,960
You have to put that down.

1535
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:11,329
We'll start when the prompter changes.

1536
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:12,859
(Reading the room)

1537
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:14,929
Prompter, please. Prompter!

1538
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:16,630
(Stern order)

1539
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:18,100
There's no mouse.

1540
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,230
(Laughing)

1541
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,570
There's no mouse.

1542
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:23,870
Go this way.

1543
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,810
It's not there.

1544
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,040
Hold on. I'll go there.

1545
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:33,450
(My Star comes himself.)

1546
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:34,719
How do you do this?

1547
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,819
(Help me.)

1548
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,919
Where is it?

1549
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,789
(But Jung Seok goes straight ahead.)

1550
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:39,850
Excuse me.

1551
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:42,420
They can't find the mouse.

1552
01:03:42,590 --> 01:03:44,189
I think you'll have to show them.

1553
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,060
(He summons the show staff to ensure a clear solution.)

1554
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,860
The comma doesn't go to this side.

1555
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,470
(He's frustrated.)

1556
01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:56,200
(They just feel sorry.)

1557
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,809
- It's this. Right.
- Yes.

1558
01:03:58,810 --> 01:03:59,840
(The analogue Grumpy Secretary, an average age of 55.5 feel sorry.)

1559
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,679
All right.

1560
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,310
(Fortunately, it was solved quickly.)

1561
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:05,449
The intro.

1562
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,650
(That's a relief.)

1563
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:09,620
(Building up the emotion)

1564
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,620
(Lyric display)

1565
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,690
(He displayed the first line during the intro.)

1566
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,830
(That much is fine.)

1567
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:22,630
(It's a relief.)

1568
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:26,599
(Prompter: Under the dim lights, a single candle glows)

1569
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:31,109
(A promise rests in a glass of wine)

1570
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:34,080
(I'll always stay by your side and protect you)

1571
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:40,280
(Fortunately, the prompter is working smoothly.)

1572
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,829
(After adjusting to the digital device, )

1573
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,500
(he finally hears his sweet voice.)

1574
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:59,300
(As long as I have you, that's enough)

1575
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:01,840
I believe

1576
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:03,970
I believe

1577
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,079
I believe

1578
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,910
(The prompter is getting more relaxed.)

1579
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:17,690
(The dimples are moving to the rhythm.)

1580
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:35,970
(My Star singing "Aloha" is sweeter than a sugar cane.)

1581
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,040
(Vocalizing)

1582
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:21,680
(Old-fashioned)

1583
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,689
(Cho Jung Seok's "Aloha" is sweet as expected.)

1584
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,030
It reminds me of old times.

1585
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,600
What does it remind you of?

1586
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,870
I practised with a band for a long time like this.

1587
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:42,299
- Why?
- When I did "Hot Singers."

1588
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:43,969
There was a show called "Hot Singers?"

1589
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,340
Yes.

1590
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,269
It's getting hot.

1591
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:49,539
(My Star's song makes his heart grow warm again.)

1592
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,810
Should I start Kim Kwang Kyu's band again?

1593
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:53,879
(Let's start making the 3rd album.)

1594
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,250
I should start singing again.

1595
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:00,250
Next, we'll play "Rain and You."

1596
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,290
(He prepares the prompter.)

1597
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:08,460
(The second practice song: "Rain and You")

1598
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:15,170
(A rock classic that hits your heart right from the very first note)

1599
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,070
(Let's go.)

1600
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:20,640
(Pressing)

1601
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,049
(Prompter: I don't miss you anymore I don't feel the urge to see you)

1602
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:31,119
(Even the love we had is slowly fading away, quietly)

1603
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,990
(It's too fast.)

1604
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,360
(Freddie Kwangcury's mistake)

1605
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:41,700
(But My Star calmly moves on from the crisis.)

1606
01:08:55,770 --> 01:09:02,440
("Rain and You" melts the cold heart on a chilly late-autumn night.)

1607
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,620
(We'll do this part one more time!)

1608
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,550
(Let's leave it as it is.)

1609
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,490
(But he presses it twice in excitement.)

1610
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:15,519
(The prompter went off course.)

1611
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,789
He said they'll do it one more time.

1612
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,960
(He said they'll do it one more time!)

1613
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:24,699
(Because of the prompter that went off course, )

1614
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:29,970
(he lost the beat.)

1615
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,109
(I'm sorry.)

1616
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:33,810
(I was too excited.)

1617
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:37,110
(Idiot)

1618
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:49,960
(I won't make any more mistakes.)

1619
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:52,859
(They practice the repeating chorus.)

1620
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,090
One more time?

1621
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,430
Okay.

1622
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,469
Let's go to "Even the love."

1623
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:02,869
- That part.
- Okay.

1624
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,369
(He repeats one line and ends.)

1625
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,240
(Even the love we had is slowly fading away, quietly)

1626
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:10,210
(That's out of scope.)

1627
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:14,250
(It still hasn't returned.)

1628
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,449
(Please take care of the prompter well.)

1629
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:21,060
Where is it?

1630
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:22,360
Is it verse two?

1631
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,920
It's...

1632
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:25,690
Which part is it?

1633
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,829
- The prompter...
- You have to go here.

1634
01:10:27,830 --> 01:10:29,830
- Here?
- isn't settled.

1635
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,129
He understood it.

1636
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:35,270
(He's reading the lines of "Rain and You" alone.)

1637
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,639
(Silent pressure)

1638
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,739
I didn't know you'd do it again.

1639
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,179
- You should do it until the end.
- Quickly move the slides.

1640
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:42,209
All right.

1641
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:45,480
(It's his nth time apologising.)

1642
01:10:45,610 --> 01:10:46,849
It was just as I expected.

1643
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:49,120
- Was it what you expected?
- Yes. Exactly what I expected.

1644
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,790
Or even more.

1645
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,520
All right.

1646
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,060
You know,

1647
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,860
why is the humidifier...

1648
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:01,260
The humidifier...

1649
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,559
(Why is his pet humidifier next to him?)

1650
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,199
- Why is it there?
- Sorry.

1651
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,100
- Please bring it here.
- I'm sorry.

1652
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,739
- What...
- You had already begun,

1653
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:11,709
- so I didn't want to interrupt you.
- Sure.

1654
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,710
(Telling a white lie like it's nothing)

1655
01:11:12,711 --> 01:11:14,380
Please get the prompter.

1656
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:17,480
There must have been a misunderstanding with it.

1657
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,510
It's...

1658
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:21,779
You mean an error.

1659
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,880
Yes.

1660
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:24,689
It's a good song.

1661
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:27,150
(We hope you come to terms with the prompter.)

1662
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:28,659
Can we start now?

1663
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,759
(What song will he practice next?)

1664
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,860
All right.

1665
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:33,889
(Putting the humidifier away for now)

1666
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:36,260
(He sits down.)

1667
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:39,130
(Curious)

1668
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,039
(Taking out a guitar)

1669
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,869
At first,

1670
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:46,709
I play the guitar and sing.

1671
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:49,110
(His heart races again after seeing the guitar.)

1672
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,309
(My Star is playing the guitar that the secretaries fixed.)

1673
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:53,510
Here we go.

1674
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,480
Okay.

1675
01:11:56,180 --> 01:12:00,090
(My Star's own song, "Champagne")

1676
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:07,030
(He slightly gets better at writing the prompt.)

1677
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:13,129
("Champagne" is the title track of his 1st full-length album.)

1678
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,439
(It's a blues-rock song...)

1679
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,510
(that he wrote, composed, and arranged himself.)

1680
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:20,570
Do you have any leftover soda?

1681
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:23,580
(Two for ourselves.)

1682
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,809
(He forgot to write the prompt because of the soda.)

1683
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:26,810
(Angry)

1684
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,220
(Oops)

1685
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,320
(The prompt is three steps late.)

1686
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:39,390
(All I can do is laugh about it.)

1687
01:12:41,330 --> 01:12:44,200
(You never fail to disappoint me.)

1688
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:52,270
(Trying to focus again)

1689
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:10,460
(Guitar solo)

1690
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:23,970
(His fabulous guitar solo makes them proud of getting it fixed.)

1691
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:30,610
(This is how you play the guitar.)

1692
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:40,520
I was so surprised.

1693
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:44,260
I didn't know he was good enough to do a guitar solo.

1694
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:46,760
I thought he would only play the rhythm.

1695
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:48,699
He was really good at it.

1696
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,330
And I've never seen him sing before.

1697
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,769
He's a great singer.

1698
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:55,339
(He's a great singer.)

1699
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,810
(Jung Seok)

1700
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:03,339
(My Star is...)

1701
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:06,680
(a singer-songwriter, indeed.)

1702
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,649
I came up with some ad-libs in the back.

1703
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:17,020
(He finishes the song with his own ad-libs.)

1704
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:28,100
- It goes like this.
- That was good.

1705
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:31,710
I came up with some ad-libs in the back.

1706
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,980
I would be holding a guitar, anyway.

1707
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,140
Then...

1708
01:14:36,141 --> 01:14:39,950
(Jung Seok's fabulous performance ends.)

1709
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:43,350
(Standing up)

1710
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:45,090
That's okay.

1711
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,420
Yes.

1712
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:51,990
(He brings fried chicken as there's a break.)

1713
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:56,860
(Bringing the chicken inside for the smell)

1714
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:03,440
(Gesturing that he'll go and buy drinks.)

1715
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,770
(He moves quickly so as not to interrupt them.)

1716
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:11,410
(Scanning which drinks there are)

1717
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,350
(Getting cola)

1718
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,920
Thank you.

1719
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,789
Goodbye.

1720
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:25,330
(Getting enough drinks for everyone)

1721
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,170
(He returns to the studio at lightning speed.)

1722
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:37,570
Your chicken is here.

1723
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:40,170
(Let's eat it before it gets cold.)

1724
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:45,709
Let's take a short break.

1725
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:47,480
(A break)

1726
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,679
Should we set the table?

1727
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,050
- Here?
- Here?

1728
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:55,319
- Yes. Fried chicken.
- They brought some food.

1729
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,160
- Thank you for the food!
- Thank you for the food!

1730
01:15:57,190 --> 01:15:58,360
They're fried chicken and pizza.

1731
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,030
Thank you.

1732
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:04,330
(Proud dimples)

1733
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,229
- Eat up, guys.
- Thanks.

1734
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:08,369
Eat it while it's still hot!

1735
01:16:08,370 --> 01:16:10,200
I didn't buy it with my money, though.

1736
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:13,140
Shouldn't we leave the room?

1737
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,279
Yes, we should give them some privacy.

1738
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:18,650
(The secretaries leave for them to feel more comfortable.)

1739
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,880
(The band members gather after they leave.)

1740
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:23,320
Thank you for the food.

1741
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:24,720
Thank you for the food.

1742
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:27,120
My throat is in such a bad condition.

1743
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,320
You guys made me talk too much.

1744
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:32,290
(Speechless)

1745
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:34,489
Also, what was wrong with the prompt?

1746
01:16:34,490 --> 01:16:35,629
The prompt...

1747
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:38,530
(My Star has a lot to get off his chest.)

1748
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,540
You put the humidifier near you,

1749
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,600
so I got choked up.

1750
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,909
I couldn't find the right time to bring it.

1751
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:49,480
I should have, but...

1752
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,709
I was worried I might interrupt you.

1753
01:16:51,710 --> 01:16:52,810
(Such a humid lie)

1754
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:54,510
I am sorry.

1755
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,350
Be careful.

1756
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:00,589
Where do we put it?

1757
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,590
(What's with the cake?)

1758
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,290
What's that?

1759
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:07,060
What is it?

1760
01:17:07,061 --> 01:17:09,699
It's a cake to wish that your concert goes well.

1761
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:10,930
What?

1762
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,600
Gosh.

1763
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:15,669
(Touched)

1764
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,909
It's a character from the hottest animated film.

1765
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:20,809
- It's a cute cake, right?
- It's cute, right?

1766
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,139
- Isn't it?
- It's so cute.

1767
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:23,780
(Wishing for a successful nationwide tour)

1768
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:26,949
Let Jung Seok's show be a huge success!

1769
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:28,520
Thank you.

1770
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,350
- Thank you, Seo Jin.
- Congratulations.

1771
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:36,160
I think the power of a TV show is huge.

1772
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:38,030
Seo Jin usually finds...

1773
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,659
this type of stuff cringe.

1774
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,100
(He may be sassy, but he's a professional.)

1775
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,099
The tangy and nutty tastes go well together.

1776
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,730
It's refreshing.

1777
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,040
Let's wrap up.

1778
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,410
Actually...

1779
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:57,940
The band members may or may not know,

1780
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,750
but have you heard of "Open Sesame?"

1781
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:03,320
Have you heard of "Open Sesame?"

1782
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,550
- Don't do it.
- It's a song by Kwang Kyu.

1783
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:08,590
- I know.
- Do you?

1784
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:11,119
I know that you have a song.

1785
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,490
Thank you.

1786
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,829
I'm Kim Kwang Kyu, a singer with two albums.

1787
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:17,560
We haven't...

1788
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:21,229
actually thought of...

1789
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,670
any guest singers yet.

1790
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:25,169
- If you don't mind...
- Oh, of course.

1791
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:28,039
Will you come out here and sing it for us?

1792
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,340
(How about an audition, just in case?)

1793
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:31,210
This is so embarrassing.

1794
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,079
There's the microphone. Check it once.

1795
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,320
(An on-the-spot audition)

1796
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,949
Hello, I'm from Busan.

1797
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:41,790
And I'm a singer with two albums and national actor, Kim Kwang Kyu.

1798
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:44,720
Okay. Thank you.

1799
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,199
I had told him...

1800
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,060
that I was willing to help out if he needed a guest singer.

1801
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:53,630
Do you have the scores, though?

1802
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,069
We can play it without one.

1803
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:58,540
Such a wonderful musician.

1804
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,370
I can't believe you know this masterpiece.

1805
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,880
All right. Here we go.

1806
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,409
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

1807
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:08,350
I'll sing the first verse of "Open Sesame."

1808
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,250
Go, "Cho Jung Seok Show!"

1809
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:15,660
Go, "Cho Jung Seok Show!"

1810
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,590
(He's thankful and embarrassed at the same time.)

1811
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,560
(Shutting his eyes tight)

1812
01:19:25,470 --> 01:19:28,100
(Showing all of his gums)

1813
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,640
(Blocking his own view)

1814
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,380
(I love)

1815
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:39,780
(The sparkle in your eyes)

1816
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,180
(Eyes)

1817
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,880
(They're even adding a chorus?)

1818
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,990
(Worried that he'll be too good)

1819
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,290
(Glancing)

1820
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,490
(He sings live better than they expected.)

1821
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,130
(Let's make a connection, "Cho Jung Seok Show.")

1822
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:58,700
(Open sesame)

1823
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:04,100
(He missed the beat big-time.)

1824
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,710
He's off-beat.

1825
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,510
You're off-beat.

1826
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:11,880
(Trying to get him back on beat)

1827
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,920
(He finally found his rhythm.)

1828
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:18,590
(Open sesame, Jung Seok's heart.)

1829
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:20,250
(Trying to win the guest singer spot)

1830
01:20:24,460 --> 01:20:26,860
(Jumping up)

1831
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:29,300
(He goes to stop his older bestie.)

1832
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,300
- What? Why?
- I apologise.

1833
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,430
It's your song, and you can't even stay on the beat.

1834
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,040
- You're so embarrassing.
- Goodness.

1835
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,539
You can't even stay on the beat of your own song.

1836
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:40,540
I've only sung with background vocals before.

1837
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,809
- No, you were great.
- I guess I was nervous.

1838
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,180
- I was so touched.
- I must have been nervous.

1839
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,349
You can't even stay on the beat. You're so embarrassing.

1840
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:48,750
I was nervous.

1841
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:52,590
I was so ashamed when I missed the beat.

1842
01:20:52,990 --> 01:20:54,890
I didn't know what to do, so I was actually thankful.

1843
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,630
I couldn't wait to run away because I had two albums.

1844
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:04,230
I guess I got too excited.

1845
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,199
I was too nervous.

1846
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,599
I got nervous, singing in front of musicians.

1847
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,970
(The pressure must have been huge as they were professionals.)

1848
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,140
- Can I give you my honest opinion?
- Yes.

1849
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:13,740
Sure.

1850
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,309
I'm against it.

1851
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:17,779
(I'm against him being a guest singer.)

1852
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,209
(Officially rejected)

1853
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:22,579
You were good, but it didn't exactly suit the vibe.

1854
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:23,650
I understand.

1855
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:26,050
(He couldn't win over the bandmaster.)

1856
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:28,049
- I'm sorry.
- That's fine.

1857
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,389
- I was...
- Good work, though.

1858
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:30,519
- I was too nervous.
- You even missed the beat.

1859
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:32,330
Enjoy your dried bellflower roots.

1860
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:36,200
(Practice how to stay on the beat before releasing your 3rd album.)

1861
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,699
- This is a good spot.
- Do you come here often?

1862
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,600
The band has gatherings here.

1863
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:43,469
I want pork belly.

1864
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,570
You should get it.

1865
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,970
Kwang Kyu is good at grilling meat. You've seen it.

1866
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:48,940
You've seen it.

1867
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:53,010
(Remembering his other channel)

1868
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,779
When have I ever seen him...

1869
01:21:54,780 --> 01:21:57,179
- grill meat?
- Well,

1870
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,419
there's a guy who resembles you.

1871
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:01,249
- Oh, him.
- He grilled meat for that guy.

1872
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,290
- The YouTuber, Cho Jum Seok?
- Yes.

1873
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:05,960
I'm pretty good.

1874
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:09,630
(Kwang Kyu grills meat. Only Jum Seok knows of his skills.)

1875
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:12,799
- I'm the only guest today, - Yes.

1876
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,239
But what do you do...

1877
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:16,940
if there are five guests?

1878
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,370
I'm worried for you.

1879
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,569
You should come if you're so worried.

1880
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,080
(Brazen)

1881
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:26,779
- He's a good driver.
- Pardon?

1882
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:27,980
You're a good driver.

1883
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,580
Jung Seok is such a good driver.

1884
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:34,150
Your wife often tells you you're a skilled driver, right?

1885
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,890
- She does.
- Right?

1886
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,689
He's such a good driver.

1887
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:39,090
I drive smoothly.

1888
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,960
It'd be great if you could come and drive for us.

1889
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:43,799
Right.

1890
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,100
(Sneakily trying to hire him as a secretary)

1891
01:22:46,030 --> 01:22:48,440
(Chomping down)

1892
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,940
Seo Jin.

1893
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:56,040
(They're actually looking forward to his answer.)

1894
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:57,910
There's a thing called shame.

1895
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:00,909
Most of the things they say...

1896
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:02,280
have zero shame.

1897
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:04,480
Just...

1898
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:06,290
It's that tough.

1899
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:09,190
Wasn't it such an easy job today?

1900
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:11,259
You had no shame when you said,

1901
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:12,890
"You could come and drive for us."

1902
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:15,430
But it's tiring.

1903
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,430
I have a question.

1904
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:21,600
What's the intention of this show?

1905
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,670
It's to make people realise the value of their managers.

1906
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:28,609
- The value of their managers?
- Yes, their current managers.

1907
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:30,209
The value of their current managers.

1908
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:32,279
(Thinking)

1909
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:34,250
Then, it's going exactly as you intended.

1910
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,619
- It's...
- Right?

1911
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,619
- We're doing a good job.
- Definitely.

1912
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:41,620
(Bringing the show's concept to life at a full 200 percent)

1913
01:23:41,621 --> 01:23:43,120
We're doing exactly as the show intends.

1914
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,789
All of My Stars say,

1915
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:49,460
"I should be nice to my manager."

1916
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,770
To my manager.

1917
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:54,670
I never realised...

1918
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:56,440
I don't think I can do without you.

1919
01:23:57,270 --> 01:23:59,439
I realised how precious you were.

1920
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,140
I realised he was doing a great job.

1921
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:04,739
I realised the value of my manager today.

1922
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,050
(My Star's messages to their actual managers)

1923
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:09,280
If that's the goal of this show,

1924
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:10,880
it's the best show ever.

1925
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,390
We're doing a good job, aren't we?

1926
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,560
You should be getting awards at the end of the year.

1927
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:20,530
The Grand Award, at that.

1928
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:23,660
Goodness.

1929
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:27,070
Is this your first national tour?

1930
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:28,639
- It is.
- It is?

1931
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,640
Yes.

1932
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:34,470
I've always found making music intriguing.

1933
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,179
I've always dreamed...

1934
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:40,409
of becoming a singer...

1935
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:43,120
with the songs that I created.

1936
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:46,250
What I'm doing this time is actually a challenge.

1937
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:49,560
Going on a nationwide tour itself...

1938
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:53,190
is a huge challenge for me.

1939
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:55,430
Gummy...

1940
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,570
always tells me that she believes in me.

1941
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:04,569
She always roots for me.

1942
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:06,040
(My Star can't help but smile as he talks about his wife.)

1943
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:07,970
How did you first meet your wife?

1944
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:10,640
(That was so random.)

1945
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:13,950
I was actually a fan of hers.

1946
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,380
- For real?
- Yes.

1947
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,789
"Snowflake" was my favourite song at the time.

1948
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:20,920
At the time.

1949
01:25:21,390 --> 01:25:22,959
"That Winter, the Wind Blows" was...

1950
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,060
such a popular show.

1951
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:30,300
And Gummy made a comeback with this song after a long time.

1952
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:32,569
In her blonde hair.

1953
01:25:32,570 --> 01:25:35,000
(He still remembers vividly.)

1954
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,799
(The woman with blonde hair that stole his heart)

1955
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:43,410
(The woman with blonde hair that stole his heart)

1956
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:46,380
As a fan,

1957
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:50,920
I was so surprised.

1958
01:25:51,250 --> 01:25:53,690
Then, I somehow got to meet her.

1959
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:57,059
We slowly got more intimate after that.

1960
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:58,659
(That's how she became my wife.)

1961
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:00,060
So, I like that song.

1962
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:03,330
(I'm jealous.)

1963
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:05,199
There's a song I love among Gummy's songs.

1964
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,530
- "I'm Sorry." - Yes.

1965
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:08,300
You told me.

1966
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,570
I had a shoot in the US,

1967
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:12,969
and we talked about what we would choose...

1968
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:14,640
if we could only listen to one song.

1969
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,640
And I said I'd listen to "I'm Sorry" by Gummy.

1970
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:20,380
(Moved)

1971
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:23,950
It played so many times on the radio once.

1972
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,219
(Humming)

1973
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,690
It's a great song.

1974
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:28,960
It's so sophisticated.

1975
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:30,860
She's good.

1976
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,259
I'm proud of her.

1977
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,430
(He's a fool for his wife.)

1978
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:38,200
Does she sing for you at home?

1979
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,629
No, not anymore.

1980
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,240
Back when we were dating,

1981
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,939
we used to go to karaoke rooms after a drink.

1982
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:49,239
And singers tend to enjoy going to karaoke.

1983
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,779
- Really? I never thought so.
- Yes.

1984
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,380
- And singers...
- Yes.

1985
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:56,150
Look so cool when they sing other people's songs.

1986
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,950
When they sing...

1987
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:01,050
And they sing live for you, you know.

1988
01:27:01,690 --> 01:27:02,790
- How would I know?
- What?

1989
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:05,759
(Only you would know.)

1990
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,260
I don't want to live anymore.

1991
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,700
I don't know about Jung Seok,

1992
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:13,430
but I had this concept.

1993
01:27:14,530 --> 01:27:16,170
Female actors are only colleagues to me.

1994
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,110
But female singers are stars to me.

1995
01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:22,080
- Oh, I see.
- I had that back in the day.

1996
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:26,650
I was fascinated and excited about meeting female singers.

1997
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,949
You've dated quite a few, haven't you?

1998
01:27:29,950 --> 01:27:31,080
Only a few.

1999
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,750
He has.

2000
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,319
- So, you've been to karaoke.
- What?

2001
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,990
- You've been there with them.
- Of course.

2002
01:27:37,190 --> 01:27:38,929
I sang for them when they asked.

2003
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:39,990
Which songs?

2004
01:27:40,860 --> 01:27:43,760
I liked singing Shin Hae Chul's songs.

2005
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:46,230
- I see.
- Don't look

2006
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:49,399
- So sad - Yes, "Don't Look So Sad."

2007
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,069
- That song and...
- I won't give up

2008
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:53,109
"I Even Loved the Pain."

2009
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:54,439
(Seo Jin's favourite song to sing, )

2010
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,440
(“I Even Loved the Pain” by Jo Jung Hyun)

2011
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:58,380
Can we listen to a song by Hae Chul?

2012
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:04,520
(Reminiscing while listening to The Demon Lord's song)

2013
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,120
I loved him.

2014
01:28:10,190 --> 01:28:12,160
This was before he formed the band N.EX.T.

2015
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,660
This was probably his first album after Infinite Orbit.

2016
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:21,700
And he had a song called "The Knight of a Doll."

2017
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,899
"Here, I Stand for You."

2018
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:27,870
(They take a musical trip down memory lane with My Star.)

2019
01:28:30,980 --> 01:28:32,480
It brings back old memories.

2020
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,019
When you were going to karaoke rooms?

2021
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:37,620
Yes, I remember when we were dating.

2022
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:39,590
It must be more memorable for him.

2023
01:28:39,850 --> 01:28:41,089
(How would you define My Star in one phrase?)

2024
01:28:41,090 --> 01:28:45,320
The model of an artist.

2025
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:47,530
Yes.

2026
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:51,230
He's a good singer, he's a good actor,

2027
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:54,400
he's polite, he's a good driver,

2028
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:56,440
he's a good father,

2029
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:58,370
and he's a good husband.

2030
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,180
I envy him for those things.

2031
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,640
You know, being able to sing and play instruments.

2032
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:08,779
Also, he lives happily with a family that he wanted.

2033
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:13,019
He's doing what he's good at,

2034
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,860
and people genuinely appreciate it.

2035
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,790
That's a great thing.

2036
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,559
(What would you say to the next guest?)

2037
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:26,100
I thought hard about it, and...

2038
01:29:27,370 --> 01:29:29,640
But let me ask for your understanding first.

2039
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:33,039
Please decline.

2040
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,510
(Decline the show.)

2041
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,340
This is wrong.

2042
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,749
This show...

2043
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,480
(Looking back)

2044
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,350
(Sighing)

2045
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,650
Whatever you're imagining,

2046
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:48,620
they will go beyond that.

2047
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:55,129
It felt like I spent a day...

2048
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,500
with 2 sons and 3 daughters.

2049
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,830
(Who are the five children of the secretaries?)

2050
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,140
(ALLDAY PROJECT, a super rookie group)

2051
01:30:04,070 --> 01:30:05,399
("The Return of Co-Ed Groups, ALLDAY PROJECT Creates a Sensation")

2052
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:06,610
("K-pop's First Wealthy Idol Band, Annie Makes a Surprise Idol Debut")

2053
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:08,640
(They topped the chart only 3 days into their debut.)

2054
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,410
(They won 1st place on music shows 10 days into their debut.)

2055
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,810
I thought, "I'm glad I didn't have any children."

2056
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,719
We're eating out?

2057
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:18,679
- Yes.
- Outside? No, stay.

2058
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:20,890
(The secondborn keeps trying to go outside.)

2059
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:22,820
(Manager!)

2060
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,020
(The youngest calls the secretaries non-stop.)

2061
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,790
(Manager!)

2062
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:28,460
Where is this coffee from?

2063
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,560
It's handmade.

2064
01:30:29,561 --> 01:30:31,299
- Woo Chan, stop eating.
- Stop eating?

2065
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,970
(Seo Jin is anxious as they're running late.)

2066
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:35,640
(The secondborn even asks them to check her eyes.)

2067
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,939
You should have read the Korean description...

2068
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:40,209
to see if it's gray or brown.

2069
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:42,040
I couldn't read it as the letters were too small.

2070
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:43,740
Let's wrap up the shoot.

2071
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:47,910
(But the secretaries will continue to look after them!)

2072
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:49,379
(Just a moment.)

2073
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,880
(Seo Genie shows what it's like to be a clever worker.)

2074
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,719
Let's take individual photos...

2075
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:55,619
in front of your cutouts. Then, we leave.

2076
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:59,130
(Helping the five siblings do an interview...)

2077
01:30:59,230 --> 01:31:05,360
(and film challenges)

2078
