1
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,944
(Today is December 25, 2025, Christmas.)

2
00:00:20,174 --> 00:00:24,314
(7am, coming to work early in the morning when it's dark)

3
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:27,684
(Today's must-have item, Ihabong)

4
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:31,083
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:31,084 --> 00:00:32,124
(Kwang Kyu comes to work first with the light stick.)

6
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:36,354
(He turns on the light.)

7
00:00:37,054 --> 00:00:38,194
It's an Ihabong.

8
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:41,763
That, that galaxy.

9
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,094
We'll finally meet.

10
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:44,433
We'll finally meet.

11
00:00:44,434 --> 00:00:46,234
- Are you excited?
- Of course.

12
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:47,704
You're wearing a bright outfit today.

13
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:49,873
I put effort into it.

14
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:51,674
(I put effort into it.)

15
00:00:51,974 --> 00:00:54,074
(Seo Jin's van)

16
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:55,773
Hey, why aren't you getting out?

17
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:56,814
(Hey, why aren't you getting out?)

18
00:00:58,074 --> 00:01:00,884
Bbambbabambba bam bbambbabam.

19
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:04,384
(Displeased)

20
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:09,494
- Merry Christmas. What?
- Get it together.

21
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:10,993
Get it together.

22
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:13,523
Hey, how could you say that?

23
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:14,894
(He's a bit sensitive from coming to work early.)

24
00:01:15,864 --> 00:01:17,133
Did you bring it?

25
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:18,193
(Did you bring the light stick?)

26
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:20,233
We bought it back then.

27
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,104
- You bought it for me.
- Really?

28
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:24,974
Back then at the Myeongdong Cathedral...

29
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:27,404
Back then?

30
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:30,813
You forgot that, right?

31
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:32,444
Back then, we drank a lot during the day.

32
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:35,143
It's cold. Tell this person to hurry up! Who is it?

33
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:36,583
(It's cold. Tell this person to hurry up! Who is it?)

34
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,614
- Who is it?
- You should've dressed warmly.

35
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:40,254
You said that we'd be indoors.

36
00:01:40,654 --> 00:01:41,984
It's cold.

37
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:45,094
(He spots My Star.)

38
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,224
(His face lights up.)

39
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:48,394
Hurry up.

40
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:50,564
It's cold. Let's wrap things up here and leave.

41
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:52,133
Why did you dress so coldly?

42
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,333
They told me that we'd be indoors.

43
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:54,734
- Hello.
- Hurry up.

44
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,943
(The representative 4th generation idol group...)

45
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:04,474
(that leads the K-pop industry)

46
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:11,284
(The leader of IVE)

47
00:02:13,824 --> 00:02:16,593
(With her clear eyes that resemble sunlight...)

48
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,624
(and craziness, she took over variety shows.)

49
00:02:20,794 --> 00:02:21,794
Cat, six.

50
00:02:22,094 --> 00:02:25,663
(The icon of Gen Zers...)

51
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,834
(and the perfect idol, An Yu Jin)

52
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:33,944
(And during the press conference of the show in October of last year)

53
00:02:33,974 --> 00:02:37,814
Kwang Kyu keeps saying that he wants to meet Jang Won Young.

54
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:41,714
That's right. I want to meet Jang Won Young and An Yu Jin.

55
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,784
(He finally met My Star.)

56
00:02:44,785 --> 00:02:45,823
This is nice.

57
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,424
(He finally met My Star.)

58
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,093
Hey, where's your scarf?

59
00:02:51,094 --> 00:02:52,094
(Full of affection)

60
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:53,964
- My goodness.
- It's cold.

61
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:55,594
All right.

62
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:56,964
It's cold.

63
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:57,964
(Kim Do Jin, An Yu Jin's manager)

64
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:59,434
- It's cold.
- It's cold.

65
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:02,233
- Today...
- All right.

66
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:03,274
Give us the card.

67
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,343
- It's cold.
- Here is the company card.

68
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:07,444
(Due to the cold weather, he asks for the company card right away.)

69
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:09,874
The managers are so scary.

70
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:13,044
- It isn't like that.
- It's because we're cold.

71
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:14,744
All right.

72
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,353
(The duties get transferred quickly.)

73
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:18,714
Today, she'll go to "SBS Gayo Daejeon."

74
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:20,284
- Are you an emcee this year?
- Yes.

75
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,824
Didn't you know?

76
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,153
You won't sing. You're an emcee.

77
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:25,193
(My Star's 6th schedule as the emcee of "SBS Gayo Daejeon")

78
00:03:25,194 --> 00:03:26,423
- Forget it.
- How about IVE?

79
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:27,493
Everyone will be there.

80
00:03:27,494 --> 00:03:28,863
- Will everyone sing?
- Yes.

81
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:30,534
I'll perform and emcee the show.

82
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:37,204
(The K-pop festival the entire world watches, "The SBS Gayo Daejeon")

83
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:43,374
(All K-pop singers who made 2025 shine will be there.)

84
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:50,384
(Fancy lineup of 36 teams and performances)

85
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:56,293
(The performance will be aired live for 4 hours and 10 minutes.)

86
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:58,693
On "The 2022 SBS Gayo Daejeon..."

87
00:03:58,694 --> 00:04:00,963
This is "The 2023 SBS Gayo Daejeon."

88
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,093
This is "The 2024 SBS Gayo Daejeon."

89
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:05,064
(To 2025)

90
00:04:05,164 --> 00:04:10,434
(She has emceed "SBS Gayo Daejeon" 6 times over the course of 4 years.)

91
00:04:12,404 --> 00:04:17,344
(She'll also give a performance like a Christmas present.)

92
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,584
Hey, my experience in "Inkigayo" doesn't compare.

93
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,513
That show is about popularity of one week.

94
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,453
"SBS Gayo Daejeon" encompasses one year.

95
00:04:25,454 --> 00:04:26,523
The scale is different.

96
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:27,824
(A bit nervous)

97
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:29,854
What's that bag?

98
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:33,493
It has the items she needs on the set.

99
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:35,393
- Everything she needs is in here.
- Okay.

100
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:37,763
Her condition matters the most today,

101
00:04:37,764 --> 00:04:39,063
so give her many compliments.

102
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:40,064
(To make her confident as "SBS Gayo Daejeon" MC, tell her she's pretty.)

103
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:42,973
You're so pretty. Yu Jin, you're so pretty.

104
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:45,874
You're so pretty. Yu Jin, you're so pretty.

105
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,643
You're so pretty. Seriously.

106
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:49,473
When she's on the road,

107
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:52,514
she likes to communicate with her managers.

108
00:04:52,744 --> 00:04:55,143
It'll be nice if one manager sits by her side.

109
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:56,213
- Okay.
- By her side?

110
00:04:56,214 --> 00:04:58,414
By her side? I'll drive.

111
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,653
- You must be cold. Let's get in.
- My goodness.

112
00:05:00,654 --> 00:05:02,994
(They move hurriedly for My Star.)

113
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,154
Thank you.

114
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:07,063
Here is a blanket.

115
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:08,194
Thank you.

116
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:09,834
Why is it so cold?

117
00:05:10,864 --> 00:05:13,034
(Rummaging)

118
00:05:13,134 --> 00:05:14,303
Do you want a hot pack?

119
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:15,304
Yes, please.

120
00:05:18,274 --> 00:05:19,443
Thank you.

121
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,573
(Moved)

122
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:22,273
- Seo Jin, do you want one?
- No.

123
00:05:22,274 --> 00:05:23,843
(My Star's first schedule, going to a concert hall in Incheon)

124
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,544
- Let's hit the road.
- Okay.

125
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,784
Kwang Kyu,

126
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:28,543
you sing their song all the time.

127
00:05:28,544 --> 00:05:31,213
- That's right. I saw it.
- Of course, I know IVE's songs.

128
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,023
All songs become that one song...

129
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:34,284
as you sing.

130
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,654
(My Stars Ahn Eun Jin and Jang Ki Yong Episode)

131
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:44,534
(Learning "Golden," a song from "KPop Demon Hunters")

132
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,363
(He suddenly began singing IVE's song.)

133
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:49,974
(Galaxy)

134
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:53,274
(His head is filled with IVE.)

135
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:54,603
That's a song by IVE.

136
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,273
(The galaxy enthusiast of My Grumpy Secretary)

137
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,914
I'm a fan of "Galaxy."

138
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:01,214
The song title isn't "Galaxy," is it?

139
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:02,584
No.

140
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:05,754
Don't you know the song title?

141
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:08,654
It isn't "Galaxy."

142
00:06:08,884 --> 00:06:10,893
Isn't it "I AM?"

143
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:12,693
- That's right. "I AM."
- "I AM."

144
00:06:12,694 --> 00:06:14,024
I studied yesterday.

145
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:17,733
The thing is,

146
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:20,234
I need to come up with a title...

147
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:24,203
other than "Senior" for you to put myself at ease.

148
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,743
Call me however you want. You can call me "Kwang Kyu."

149
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,573
I'd be uncomfortable with that.

150
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:30,213
- Call me "Dad."
- "Father?"

151
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:31,913
- An English nickname...
- Bigger Uncle.

152
00:06:31,914 --> 00:06:33,914
- What?
- Younger Uncle.

153
00:06:34,084 --> 00:06:35,084
But...

154
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,854
He's older than your dad.

155
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:39,023
- Really?
- Hey.

156
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,053
- Of course.
- Why would you talk about my age?

157
00:06:41,054 --> 00:06:42,823
My dad was born in 1970.

158
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:44,424
Your dad is the same age as me.

159
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,824
- Really?
- Yes.

160
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,123
Pick an English nickname like Tom.

161
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:49,733
- He's Jerry.
- Tom?

162
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:50,763
No. We used those nicknames...

163
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:52,063
during a previous episode.

164
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:53,164
- Really?
- We can't use them.

165
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:55,833
They might be at the show.

166
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,003
- ALLDAY PROJECT?
- I heard that they'd be there.

167
00:06:57,004 --> 00:06:58,503
- Yes.
- That's right.

168
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:00,204
But you shouldn't look after them.

169
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,244
We did that in the past...

170
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:04,673
- because of the shoot.
- That's right.

171
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,983
Today, you're My Star.

172
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,444
(Today, we'll look after you.)

173
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,283
Today, you guys are my managers.

174
00:07:09,284 --> 00:07:10,584
(Reassured)

175
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:12,684
Don't you usually work on Christmas?

176
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:14,753
It's Christmas today.

177
00:07:14,754 --> 00:07:16,793
- Yes, it's Christmas today.
- What did you do yesterday?

178
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:18,924
- Me? I had a rehearsal.
- Did you sleep?

179
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:22,633
- Seriously. I couldn't move.
- A rehearsal for this show?

180
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:24,793
- Yes, this one.
- Did you rehearse last night too?

181
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:25,904
Yes.

182
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:27,734
We rehearse the night before.

183
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,834
I always come to INSPIRE Arena on December 24 and 25.

184
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:33,403
I see.

185
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:35,444
- It isn't just today.
- That's right.

186
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:39,414
- I have a favor to ask.
- Okay.

187
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:43,513
There's something I'm obsessed with these days.

188
00:07:43,514 --> 00:07:44,514
What is it?

189
00:07:44,515 --> 00:07:46,584
A queen's mindset.

190
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:49,754
- Do you know what it is?
- A queen's mindset.

191
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,623
(A queen's mindset?)

192
00:07:51,624 --> 00:07:52,723
Do you have an idea of what it is?

193
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,224
(What's that?)

194
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:56,234
- Do you mean the group, Queen?
- What?

195
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:58,564
- Do you mean the group, Queen?
- Rookie?

196
00:07:58,664 --> 00:08:00,663
- The group, Queen?
- He's talking about the rock band.

197
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:02,973
I see. No.

198
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,333
- Queen.
- Queen.

199
00:08:04,334 --> 00:08:05,703
- A queen's mindset.
- A queen's mindset.

200
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:07,873
- I see. A queen's mindset.
- Yes.

201
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:08,943
(He understands.)

202
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:11,874
It really helps when you're nervous.

203
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:13,813
Do you get treated like a queen?

204
00:08:13,814 --> 00:08:15,783
No. It's like this.

205
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:18,614
Even if something doesn't go well, you say, "Whatever. It's okay."

206
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:20,354
"I'm a queen."

207
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:22,024
It's like that.

208
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:23,853
(What's a queen's mindset? A Gen Z catchphrase about...)

209
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:25,623
(the mindset of enjoying yourself...)

210
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,424
(without worrying about what other people will think)

211
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:30,433
(The magical phrase...)

212
00:08:30,434 --> 00:08:34,034
(that makes you do something you don't want to do)

213
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:36,133
(A queen's...)

214
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:37,404
(mindset)

215
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:39,444
It's like that.

216
00:08:39,544 --> 00:08:41,973
- I understood perfectly.
- Right?

217
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:42,974
You have that mindset.

218
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:44,373
- I always do.
- A king's mindset.

219
00:08:44,374 --> 00:08:45,943
- You have a king's mindset.
- Yes.

220
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:48,413
- I like that.
- Really?

221
00:08:48,414 --> 00:08:51,253
- It isn't about the words.
- Okay.

222
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,284
There's a pose.

223
00:08:52,314 --> 00:08:53,424
- A pose?
- Yes.

224
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:54,883
What's the pose?

225
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:55,923
You need to do the pose,

226
00:08:55,924 --> 00:08:58,454
- not us.
- You need to do it to be funny.

227
00:08:58,694 --> 00:09:00,493
Then we can laugh and get energized.

228
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:01,494
(My Star has requested the queen's pose.)

229
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:02,894
- Don't you agree?
- Well,

230
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:05,033
you'll feel it even if I don't do the pose.

231
00:09:05,034 --> 00:09:06,633
I always have that mindset.

232
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:07,903
- No, you must do it.
- What's the pose?

233
00:09:07,904 --> 00:09:09,503
It's like this.

234
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:12,234
Do this.

235
00:09:12,744 --> 00:09:13,874
- No.
- So...

236
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:15,913
(His stiff fingers lack the edge.)

237
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:16,914
- No.
- So...

238
00:09:16,915 --> 00:09:19,074
It's like, "Come alive."

239
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:22,014
There you go. "Come alive." Do this.

240
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:24,453
Do this. Grab it.

241
00:09:24,454 --> 00:09:27,823
(Annoyed)

242
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:28,884
Like this.

243
00:09:29,824 --> 00:09:30,824
Like this?

244
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:32,764
- Like this.
- Like this?

245
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:34,094
Like this.

246
00:09:34,464 --> 00:09:36,063
Grab it like this.

247
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:37,234
Am I pulling it in?

248
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:40,064
My hand won't move the way I want.

249
00:09:40,834 --> 00:09:44,334
- My hand won't move the way I want.
- Otherwise, you can do this.

250
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:48,444
No. You lack the passion.

251
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:50,773
- I can't do it. I want to do it.
- Like this.

252
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,274
- Like this?
- That's right.

253
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:55,914
For example, you can say, "Yu Jin, you need to go out there."

254
00:09:56,854 --> 00:09:58,554
(Is this the I Am Ground Game?)

255
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,353
(He gets a reality check.)

256
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:01,484
It's fun.

257
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:03,424
We can laugh together.

258
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:06,723
I still don't know what that hand gesture is.

259
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:08,224
So I did it without thinking.

260
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:10,434
I tried different things.

261
00:10:11,534 --> 00:10:13,164
I did it because she liked it.

262
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:17,133
(Seo Jin is trying his best.)

263
00:10:17,134 --> 00:10:18,733
(Becoming a queen)

264
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:19,744
Also,

265
00:10:19,974 --> 00:10:22,644
I don't drink a lot of water.

266
00:10:23,344 --> 00:10:25,944
- Right. You didn't ask for water.
- If I don't think about it,

267
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,014
I don't drink a lot of water. So please give me water.

268
00:10:29,614 --> 00:10:31,014
Of course.

269
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:32,383
- Please do that.
- Okay.

270
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:34,684
(He has confidence when it comes to giving her water.)

271
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:36,654
Why am I so hungry?

272
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:38,524
Are you hungry?

273
00:10:38,894 --> 00:10:39,964
Oh, no.

274
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:42,864
I'm okay, but My Star is...

275
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,794
- hungry.
- I don't have much time to eat.

276
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:47,804
I have a routine for "SBS Gayo Daejeon."

277
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:52,034
I eat a brunch.

278
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:55,203
I eat a hearty brunch.

279
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:56,244
Do you eat a sandwich?

280
00:10:56,474 --> 00:10:58,443
If it's the morning...

281
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:01,184
If it's before 10am, I want to eat a sandwich.

282
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:03,314
If it's after that time, I want to eat Korean food.

283
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:05,114
Do you want to eat a sandwich then?

284
00:11:05,714 --> 00:11:06,924
You don't have it.

285
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:10,454
We'll go and buy it while you get your hair and makeup done.

286
00:11:11,694 --> 00:11:12,694
- That sounds great.
- What?

287
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,864
That sounds great.

288
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:16,494
I'm usually all about Korean food.

289
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,993
Yu Jin, which Korean food...

290
00:11:18,994 --> 00:11:20,364
do you like?

291
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:22,733
Braised kimchi with ribs.

292
00:11:22,734 --> 00:11:26,074
It's the dish my mom makes the best.

293
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:27,373
- Your mom?
- Yes.

294
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,804
So...

295
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:31,314
It's like the best Korean food for me.

296
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:32,843
Braised kimchi with ribs.

297
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:36,484
It's like what braised mackerel is for me.

298
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:38,483
- That's right.
- I like...

299
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:41,053
braised mackerel with kimchi the most.

300
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:42,584
I like it when it's tender.

301
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:46,464
And this is a combination my dad likes.

302
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:49,334
He loves eating gangdoenjang and seasoned radish.

303
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:51,733
I love to mix rice with seasoned radish...

304
00:11:51,734 --> 00:11:53,133
and eat it with gangdoenjang.

305
00:11:53,134 --> 00:11:55,364
(He and My Star seem to have the same taste in food.)

306
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:57,434
Talking about food makes me hungry.

307
00:11:58,804 --> 00:11:59,843
We're nearly there.

308
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,674
(They're near the venue.)

309
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:03,874
Gosh, it's me!

310
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,183
- Where?
- Here.

311
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,143
- Here.
- Is that you?

312
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,383
(My Star's banner is at the entrance of the venue.)

313
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:10,984
- It's An Yu Jin.
- There are many banners.

314
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:13,224
They must've done it for me since I'm an emcee.

315
00:12:13,854 --> 00:12:14,884
Oh, yes.

316
00:12:15,354 --> 00:12:17,353
- Who's the one on the right?
- A boy.

317
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:19,123
- The one on the right?
- It's a girl.

318
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:21,023
Isn't it me? It's me!

319
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:22,493
- Are both of them you?
- It's me.

320
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:24,563
It's me with my hair tied.

321
00:12:24,564 --> 00:12:25,593
But...

322
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:27,763
- Why are there only your photos?
- A boy?

323
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,633
Hey, how could you call her a boy?

324
00:12:30,634 --> 00:12:32,004
It's her with her hair tied.

325
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:33,773
You don't know me very well.

326
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:34,774
(Disappointed)

327
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:36,213
(Wary)

328
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,614
- Back in the day, - Okay.

329
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,443
- I was at a music award ceremony.
- A music award ceremony.

330
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:42,884
- It was the ending performance.
- Okay.

331
00:12:43,214 --> 00:12:45,753
I saw a girl dancing in the middle...

332
00:12:45,754 --> 00:12:47,854
who was very tall.

333
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:50,493
- Did I look taller than the others?
- You were very tall.

334
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:52,524
- You stood out.
- Okay.

335
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:55,594
I was like, "Who is that tall girl?"

336
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,404
They said, "She's An Yu Jin." I had watched "Earth Arcade" a lot.

337
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:01,833
You look totally different on a music show.

338
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:02,834
That's right.

339
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,204
You could dance very well.

340
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:05,633
(Happy)

341
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,304
You looked different.

342
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:10,414
I make a lot of effort to look different.

343
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:13,414
- That must be why.
- Yes.

344
00:13:13,644 --> 00:13:16,553
Hello. This Emcee An Yu Jin's van.

345
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:17,584
(7:52am, Arriving at the concert hall in Incheon)

346
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:24,994
(The area surrounding the venue is decorated in Christmas mood.)

347
00:13:26,324 --> 00:13:29,023
(And the much-anticipated "SBS Gayo Daejeon" will begin...)

348
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:33,834
(at a huge concert hall that's twice the size of a soccer field.)

349
00:13:33,864 --> 00:13:37,173
Hello, I'm an emcee of "The 2025 SBS Gayo Daejeon,".

350
00:13:37,174 --> 00:13:38,433
Yu Jin of IVE.

351
00:13:38,434 --> 00:13:42,004
(My Star will stand here soon!)

352
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,143
- Okay.
- Thank you.

353
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,284
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

354
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:49,014
Let's go. Go on in. It's cold.

355
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:54,654
The singers will be startled once they see the cameras.

356
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:56,893
(Following Yu Jin)

357
00:13:56,894 --> 00:13:58,894
They must be rehearsing.

358
00:14:00,024 --> 00:14:03,864
(They're running a soundcheck on the stage.)

359
00:14:05,534 --> 00:14:07,563
(My Star heads straight to the green room...)

360
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:08,704
(behind the busy stage.)

361
00:14:09,004 --> 00:14:10,103
Hello.

362
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:13,274
(She has gained experience by emceeing the event for 4 years.)

363
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:20,514
This is no joke. My goodness.

364
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:24,413
(The green room corridor is full of people.)

365
00:14:24,414 --> 00:14:26,483
The corridor is blocked from all these people.

366
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:29,224
There are so many people.

367
00:14:29,554 --> 00:14:30,593
Aren't there a lot of people?

368
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:32,724
Many teams will perform today.

369
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,363
This place has more suitcases than an airplane headed to the US.

370
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:37,394
You're right.

371
00:14:37,934 --> 00:14:43,204
(Concert equipment continues to enter.)

372
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,344
(They get nervous for no reason.)

373
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:49,713
Hello. No one is here.

374
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:50,744
(In a nervous state, they enter My Star's green room.)

375
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:52,413
Hello.

376
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:53,943
(The queen and IVE's green room is away from the hustle and bustle.)

377
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:55,484
It's my first time here.

378
00:14:56,614 --> 00:14:57,714
Hello.

379
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,954
- Hello.
- Hello.

380
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,354
Hello.

381
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:06,923
They're my staff members.

382
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,093
(The makeup room looks luxurious.)

383
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:09,224
My goodness.

384
00:15:09,494 --> 00:15:10,594
Is that a restroom?

385
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:14,263
Does this green room come with a restroom?

386
00:15:14,264 --> 00:15:17,203
Yes. That's where we usually change.

387
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:19,134
(The restroom is spacious for changing clothes.)

388
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:21,273
This restroom is huge.

389
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:23,014
(The secretaries are shocked by the size.)

390
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,773
There are lockers too.

391
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:26,343
It's like a golf course.

392
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:27,784
- What?
- It's like a golf course.

393
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:30,484
I guess these lockers work.

394
00:15:30,654 --> 00:15:32,184
- What?
- I guess they work.

395
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:34,354
They work.

396
00:15:35,754 --> 00:15:37,894
What? I locked it.

397
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:42,463
(He locks an empty locker.)

398
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,734
That wasn't the password.

399
00:15:44,434 --> 00:15:45,764
I entered the correct password.

400
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,133
Did you punch in 888 earlier?

401
00:15:48,134 --> 00:15:49,534
- Yes.
- It isn't opening.

402
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:51,804
I forgot.

403
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:53,674
What are you going to do?

404
00:15:55,174 --> 00:15:59,144
(Was it 999?)

405
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:01,643
Let's begin the makeup.

406
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:02,984
(8am, hair and makeup at the concert hall in Incheon)

407
00:16:03,114 --> 00:16:04,713
Kwang Kyu, shall we go?

408
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,223
- For a sandwich?
- Yes.

409
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:08,154
Ask if she wants coffee.

410
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:10,894
(He puts down the work bag for a second.)

411
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,893
- We're going to get coffee.
- Okay.

412
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:15,224
Do the staff members like coffee as well?

413
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,263
My Star, Yu Jin, wants iced Americano.

414
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:20,663
- If you give us your order...
- Who doesn't drink coffee?

415
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,064
Be honest.

416
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:23,674
- Okay.
- Two people.

417
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:25,534
- Okay.
- Iced chocolate? Iced tea?

418
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:27,243
Iced chocolate and iced tea.

419
00:16:27,244 --> 00:16:29,573
- What chocolate?
- Iced chocolate.

420
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:31,474
- Is there an iced chocolate?
- Yes.

421
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,413
Something like a chocolate latte.

422
00:16:33,414 --> 00:16:35,583
- Is there an iced chocolate latte?
- Yes.

423
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,084
- I've never heard of it.
- It exists.

424
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:39,214
Iced chocolate latte.

425
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:41,823
Iced chocolate latte. One?

426
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,224
One iced chocolate latte?

427
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:47,224
- Please relax.
- I'll relax.

428
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:50,333
Get us a mix of coffee, iced chocolate, and iced tea.

429
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:53,464
But there should be more coffee. You know what I mean, right?

430
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:55,004
Whose order is this?

431
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:57,173
The staff members.

432
00:16:57,174 --> 00:16:59,173
- So...
- One, two, three, four, five,

433
00:16:59,174 --> 00:17:00,844
- Is everyone getting this drink?
- six...

434
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:03,073
Is everyone getting an iced chocolate latte?

435
00:17:03,074 --> 00:17:04,374
No!

436
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:06,913
This is harder than CSAT. Hold on.

437
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:09,884
- Coffee is the basic order.
- Okay.

438
00:17:09,954 --> 00:17:12,484
Two iced tea and one iced chocolate latte.

439
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:14,884
- Iced tea?
- Two iced tea.

440
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,523
- Two peach iced tea.
- Okay.

441
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:20,323
So aren't you getting any coffee?

442
00:17:20,324 --> 00:17:22,594
(So aren't you getting any coffee?)

443
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:24,463
(Excuse me?)

444
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:26,504
Hey, please translate.

445
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:28,404
Have you heard of an iced chocolate latte?

446
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:29,774
I'm sure it exists.

447
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:31,873
- Yes.
- So...

448
00:17:31,874 --> 00:17:35,073
we want four coffee,

449
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:37,473
one iced chocolate, and one iced tea just in case.

450
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,474
Okay.

451
00:17:38,614 --> 00:17:40,284
Those are only five drinks.

452
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:44,554
Just come on out. For goodness' sake.

453
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:48,584
Why don't you understand what people are saying?

454
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:51,353
Hey, you need to pay attention to details.

455
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:52,653
It'll be bad to ask again.

456
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,364
Forget it. Hurry up.

457
00:17:54,994 --> 00:17:56,334
Where can we buy them?

458
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:58,433
Must you ask? We need to go out.

459
00:17:58,434 --> 00:17:59,434
(They finally set off.)

460
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:01,733
- It's just a rehearsal, right?
- I think so.

461
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,003
I think...

462
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:05,633
I need you to explain the deal with this iced chocolate latte.

463
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,844
Iced chocolate latte.

464
00:18:08,144 --> 00:18:11,073
(He's something else.)

465
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:13,513
- Okay.
- Does it contain iced tea?

466
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:14,684
- No.
- Then what?

467
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:15,843
(She gets a reality check.)

468
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,953
- Is it like coffee?
- Seo Jin.

469
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:18,253
Forget about him. Does it contain coffee?

470
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:19,884
Iced chocolate latte...

471
00:18:20,024 --> 00:18:21,723
and iced tea are different drinks.

472
00:18:21,724 --> 00:18:23,793
- Let's go. Do you still not get it?
- Did you get it?

473
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,294
- I got it. Let's go.
- Did you?

474
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:28,194
(He gets apprehended.)

475
00:18:28,594 --> 00:18:29,764
Really? Okay.

476
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:32,164
I was so shocked...

477
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,964
when he asked me what iced tea was.

478
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,503
He kept asking me if chocolate latte really existed.

479
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:42,504
It made me go, "What? It'll be hard if he has a problem with this."

480
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,943
The next one was...

481
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,473
- choosing the menu.
- Okay.

482
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:47,213
I thought, "If he has a problem with the coffee order,"

483
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,644
"the next one will be impossible."

484
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:50,484
I was so shocked.

485
00:18:51,514 --> 00:18:54,624
(They move to the hotel next to the concert hall.)

486
00:18:55,284 --> 00:18:57,023
They don't have sandwiches.

487
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,594
(They find the display stand.)

488
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,694
There's nothing.

489
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:04,693
- Seriously, there's nothing.
- What?

490
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,064
(At 8:10am, the display stand is empty since it hasn't opened.)

491
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:07,563
Now, she's having a table read.

492
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,704
At 10:30am, the rehearsal will begin.

493
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:13,874
Wouldn't it be better to go outside?

494
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:16,144
Kwang Kyu, let's look for it.

495
00:19:17,474 --> 00:19:18,973
(Hair and makeup at 8am, Table read at 9am)

496
00:19:18,974 --> 00:19:20,443
(Runthrough at 10:30am, Red carpet event 1pm)

497
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:21,983
- Was it a table read?
- A table read.

498
00:19:21,984 --> 00:19:23,754
- At 10am is the runthrough.
- It's at 10:30am.

499
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,453
The red carpet event begins right afterward, right?

500
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:27,723
Right after the runthrough.

501
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:28,984
- I think it's right afterward.
- Yes.

502
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,253
You'll be busy.

503
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:34,464
(If she doesn't eat now, she'll be hungry until 3pm.)

504
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:35,994
But...

505
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,534
it isn't open.

506
00:19:38,634 --> 00:19:40,234
Gosh, it isn't open.

507
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:42,703
(There's no time, but none of the places are open.)

508
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:44,574
None of the places is open.

509
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:46,943
(40 minutes before the table read)

510
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,044
What should we do?

511
00:19:49,844 --> 00:19:51,543
(They need to find a place that's open.)

512
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:52,714
None of the places is open.

513
00:19:56,684 --> 00:19:59,884
I'm hungry.

514
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,053
(Queen Yu Jin suppresses her hunger...)

515
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:04,254
(as she slaps her thighs.)

516
00:20:04,824 --> 00:20:07,893
(30 minutes before the table read)

517
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:10,633
No way. This place is open.

518
00:20:10,634 --> 00:20:12,463
(They spot a place that's open.)

519
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:13,864
- May we order?
- Yes.

520
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:18,004
- We'll order eight sets.
- Okay.

521
00:20:18,404 --> 00:20:20,444
We want six iced Americano,

522
00:20:20,544 --> 00:20:23,214
one chocolate latte, and one iced tea.

523
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,174
I'm sorry,

524
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,283
but would you put one iced Americano here?

525
00:20:27,284 --> 00:20:28,284
- Okay.
- Yes.

526
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:32,883
(Thankfully, they completed the order.)

527
00:20:32,884 --> 00:20:35,054
Once she goes in, we'll be done.

528
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:38,853
- Once she goes in...
- How will we be done?

529
00:20:38,854 --> 00:20:41,194
- We'll need to go back and forth.
- Really?

530
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:43,234
I can't believe him.

531
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:44,963
(It won't be an easy day.)

532
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:47,104
She needs to change many times.

533
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:50,274
What was the hand gesture Yu Jin wanted you to do?

534
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:53,643
I don't know.

535
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:56,714
Was it something like this? I don't know.

536
00:20:56,844 --> 00:20:59,413
I didn't really get it. A queen's mind?

537
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:00,784
What does it have to do with the hand gesture?

538
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:04,954
(Was this the hand gesture?)

539
00:21:06,654 --> 00:21:08,883
What's that? Did you swear at me?

540
00:21:08,884 --> 00:21:10,794
- She told me to do this at first.
- Really?

541
00:21:10,994 --> 00:21:12,053
She taught me this at first.

542
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:14,124
Isn't this hand gesture like picking a fight in the US?

543
00:21:14,294 --> 00:21:16,734
It's this.

544
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:20,203
You're unbelievable. Hey.

545
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,463
(Seo Jin shot at his face.)

546
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:24,133
You're only like this to me.

547
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:26,804
You're always gentle with everyone else.

548
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:29,673
(Seo Jin likes Kwang Kyu.)

549
00:21:29,674 --> 00:21:31,314
- I...
- This gesture...

550
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:33,014
She said to do it like this.

551
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:35,014
It's so cold.

552
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,053
(20 minutes before the table read,)

553
00:21:38,054 --> 00:21:39,884
(they're returning with sandwiches and coffee.)

554
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:42,183
Excuse me.

555
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:45,954
(They're in a hurry as they have to feed My Star.)

556
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:47,964
Oh, My Star.

557
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:49,993
- Thank you.
- No problem.

558
00:21:49,994 --> 00:21:51,494
(Oh, My Star. Here's your coffee.)

559
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:53,864
(Happy)

560
00:21:54,434 --> 00:21:57,703
(Fortunately, she can drink coffee while getting makeup done.)

561
00:21:57,704 --> 00:21:59,604
- The coffee for the staff... There?
- That way. Over there.

562
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:03,574
(They've served food to My Star and the staff members.)

563
00:22:04,744 --> 00:22:07,444
(Prowling)

564
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:08,883
Really? Will I receive it?

565
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:10,284
Are you almost done?

566
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,154
- Me?
- Are you almost done?

567
00:22:12,214 --> 00:22:13,253
- Me?
- Are you?

568
00:22:13,254 --> 00:22:14,383
You want to eat it now, right?

569
00:22:14,384 --> 00:22:16,624
No, I want you and the staff members to eat.

570
00:22:17,554 --> 00:22:19,654
I think I can eat after a little while.

571
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:23,224
(Okay. Got it.)

572
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:33,404
(Being on standby while gazing at her...)

573
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:37,343
ENFJ. Right, she's ENFJ.

574
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:38,474
She's the judging type.

575
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,984
Are you almost done?

576
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:42,414
She has a table read in 15 minutes.

577
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:43,913
Are you almost done?

578
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:46,784
(Seo Jin rushes them calmly and quietly.)

579
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:49,153
- Exactly.
- She needs to eat first.

580
00:22:49,154 --> 00:22:51,354
- Right. I'll be right there.
- Okay. We'll hurry up.

581
00:22:52,624 --> 00:22:55,164
(He's worried she might skip her meal.)

582
00:22:55,294 --> 00:22:56,634
- He's really like a father.
- Right.

583
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,264
(Checking the time)

584
00:23:01,604 --> 00:23:02,764
You should eat now.

585
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,573
- Eat first and then finish it.
- Pardon?

586
00:23:04,574 --> 00:23:05,704
Eat first and then finish the makeup.

587
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,544
- Eat before the table read.
- Father.

588
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:09,374
- Okay?
- Father, give me a minute, please.

589
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:11,944
- Let me just get my fringe done.
- Okay.

590
00:23:13,614 --> 00:23:15,983
Usually, our managers...

591
00:23:15,984 --> 00:23:18,514
wait right next to us.

592
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:21,484
But he was standing from afar...

593
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:25,194
while watching me.

594
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:28,023
He looked like a parent...

595
00:23:28,024 --> 00:23:30,994
watching his kid at an open day.

596
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:32,793
I'll be back.

597
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:33,963
(Her hair and makeup are done! Now, she'll go and eat!)

598
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:35,204
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

599
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,103
Come and eat now.

600
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:38,374
- Can we eat now?
- Yes.

601
00:23:38,604 --> 00:23:40,773
- I was talking to Yu Jin, not you.
- Oh, I see.

602
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:42,803
- Why would you think you can eat?
- I see.

603
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:43,913
- Have a seat.
- All right.

604
00:23:43,914 --> 00:23:45,313
- Staff members, please come.
- Thank you.

605
00:23:45,314 --> 00:23:46,343
- Here's chocolate latte.
- It will begin shortly.

606
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:47,443
(She lets her staff eat first even though she's in a hurry.)

607
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:48,884
- Thank you.
- Did you find yours?

608
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,554
- Thank you.
- Oh, my.

609
00:23:50,614 --> 00:23:52,313
Where did you get these? At the hotel?

610
00:23:52,314 --> 00:23:53,384
Yes, we went to the hotel.

611
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:55,253
But it wasn't open.

612
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:56,323
(Setting the food quickly)

613
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:57,624
- So we went to this food street.
- Oh, I see.

614
00:23:57,994 --> 00:23:59,393
She has to leave in three minutes.

615
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:00,693
- Come on. You're lying.
- Three minutes?

616
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:01,694
Did you say three minutes?

617
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:02,893
Why do I have only three minutes?

618
00:24:02,894 --> 00:24:04,133
Well... Then...

619
00:24:04,134 --> 00:24:06,134
- She'll leave in 5 minutes.
- She'll leave in 5 minutes.

620
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:08,334
- She'll leave in 5 minutes.
- She'll leave in 5 minutes.

621
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,134
(They are reliable.)

622
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:14,804
(I'll enjoy the food!)

623
00:24:14,844 --> 00:24:16,743
Eat it until he's back.

624
00:24:16,744 --> 00:24:18,274
- Right.
- Hold out until he's back.

625
00:24:20,384 --> 00:24:23,754
(Let's eat as much as I can.)

626
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:26,053
Won't you eat?

627
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,123
Don't worry about us and eat.

628
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:28,284
We have some food here too.

629
00:24:31,194 --> 00:24:35,164
(Grumpy Secretary eats hastily too as they're in a hurry.)

630
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:39,993
(He gobbles down the sandwich.)

631
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,463
- By the way, Father...
- Yes?

632
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:42,834
You know I'm the leader, right?

633
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,134
You're the leader?

634
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:49,904
She's the leader and the main vocalist.

635
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,714
Yes. That's right.

636
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:52,944
But...

637
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:55,184
it was written that Won Young was the leader too.

638
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:56,713
Really?

639
00:24:56,714 --> 00:24:58,613
There are not two leaders in our group.

640
00:24:58,614 --> 00:24:59,714
There's only one leader.

641
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,623
- I must be mistaken.
- Right.

642
00:25:01,624 --> 00:25:02,683
(I must be mistaken.)

643
00:25:02,684 --> 00:25:04,023
Why did you look for the information about Jang Won Young?

644
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:05,093
- Sorry?
- Exactly.

645
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:07,363
- You're Yu Jin's manager.
- You should've looked me up.

646
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:08,823
(He senses that he's in trouble.)

647
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:09,863
Yesterday,

648
00:25:09,864 --> 00:25:12,733
I did a search to find out how many members the group had.

649
00:25:12,734 --> 00:25:14,464
Actually, I thought it was a five-member group.

650
00:25:14,704 --> 00:25:15,903
But it turned out to be a six-member group.

651
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,373
(Blabbering)

652
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:18,773
You're banned from IVE's green room.

653
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:19,804
(You're banned from IVE's green room.)

654
00:25:21,204 --> 00:25:22,944
Exactly. Why did he search Jang Won Young?

655
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:24,544
I mean...

656
00:25:24,574 --> 00:25:27,143
Seo Jin doesn't even know the names of the members.

657
00:25:27,144 --> 00:25:28,144
You don't, do you?

658
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:29,644
All I need to know is Yu Jin.

659
00:25:30,014 --> 00:25:31,283
He's right about that.

660
00:25:31,284 --> 00:25:32,713
(Satisfied)

661
00:25:32,714 --> 00:25:33,984
Gosh, that brat.

662
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,624
He weaseled his way out.

663
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:42,563
Yu Jin, you should go now.

664
00:25:42,564 --> 00:25:43,663
(Seo Jin makes the queen gesture to let her know what to do next.)

665
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:45,294
- Should I go now?
- You should go now.

666
00:25:45,964 --> 00:25:50,173
(My Star is satisfied with Seo Jin.)

667
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,403
Let me have just one more bite.

668
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:52,733
- Am I doing it right?
- What?

669
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:54,273
"You should go now."

670
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:55,543
(Is it a workout move?)

671
00:25:55,544 --> 00:25:57,244
Please show him how it's done. That's not how he should do it.

672
00:25:58,114 --> 00:25:59,343
(She should go now.)

673
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,514
Does this mean she should go?

674
00:26:01,484 --> 00:26:03,013
(He's mastered the gesture for "You should go now.")

675
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,754
You should fold your fingers like this.

676
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,684
- Smoothly, like this.
- What does this mean?

677
00:26:07,554 --> 00:26:09,383
(Folding the fingers)

678
00:26:09,384 --> 00:26:11,623
It means, "Come here."

679
00:26:11,624 --> 00:26:13,153
(Folding the fingers means, "Come here.")

680
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,063
- To say something is delicious...
- Yes?

681
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:16,833
- Gaze at the food and point at it.
- Like...

682
00:26:16,834 --> 00:26:17,993
Like you're fishing?

683
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,133
(Point at it gracefully.)

684
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:20,333
Move your finger like this.

685
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:22,033
- Like this?
- Like this.

686
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,133
Like this.

687
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:25,534
And this is what you do to describe "delicious."

688
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:26,974
This is called a finger clap.

689
00:26:27,304 --> 00:26:28,403
It's called a finger clap.

690
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:29,404
(A finger clap means something is "delicious.")

691
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:30,614
What was it again?

692
00:26:30,644 --> 00:26:32,943
Women with long nails make a tapping noise...

693
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:34,344
by tapping their fingernails against other ones.

694
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:36,953
It's to praise the food. "My, it's delicious."

695
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:39,153
- "It's so good."
- Oh, I see. "It's delicious."

696
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:41,283
- "My, it's so good."
- Like this. "It's good."

697
00:26:41,284 --> 00:26:42,484
- "My, it's good."
- And...

698
00:26:43,224 --> 00:26:44,524
He's back already.

699
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,994
Let's go.

700
00:26:46,654 --> 00:26:47,823
(The intensive lesson about a queen's mindset ended.)

701
00:26:47,824 --> 00:26:48,964
I'll get going now.

702
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:54,664
(9am, concert hall in Incheon, table read)

703
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,004
- Hello.
- Oh, my. Hello.

704
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:02,404
(She gets into the MC mode with no problem.)

705
00:27:02,744 --> 00:27:06,884
(Young K, the host of "SBS Gayo Daejeon")

706
00:27:06,914 --> 00:27:10,384
(JAEMIN, the host of "SBS Gayo Daejeon")

707
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:16,754
(Queen Yu Jin is learning her lines while reading them clearly.)

708
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:23,894
(Her parents leave quietly so that she can focus.)

709
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:29,364
Manager Lee, what are you doing here?

710
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:31,874
- Hey, we...
- I see some people I know here.

711
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:33,104
- Today, we're from...
- I see some people I know here.

712
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,743
We're from STARSHIP Entertainment, not from SM Entertainment.

713
00:27:34,744 --> 00:27:35,943
(U-Know Yunho, former My Star)

714
00:27:35,944 --> 00:27:37,044
We're from STARSHIP Entertainment today.

715
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:38,843
I guess you couldn't hold out.

716
00:27:38,844 --> 00:27:40,014
(U-Know Yunho came to perform at "SBS Gayo Daejeon.")

717
00:27:40,344 --> 00:27:41,683
- I moved to STARSHIP Entertainment.
- To STARSHIP Entertainment?

718
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:42,944
Yes, I moved to that agency.

719
00:27:43,684 --> 00:27:45,653
- Come here.
- It was unexpected...

720
00:27:45,654 --> 00:27:47,524
(Come here.)

721
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,653
Kwang Kyu.

722
00:27:48,654 --> 00:27:49,654
Oh, my. Are you serious?

723
00:27:50,184 --> 00:27:51,594
The former My Star is here.

724
00:27:51,624 --> 00:27:53,023
Our former My Star.

725
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:54,794
You couldn't keep working at SM Entertainment.

726
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:57,293
We moved to STARSHIP Entertainment.

727
00:27:57,294 --> 00:27:58,394
(He's very happy to see him again.)

728
00:27:58,694 --> 00:28:00,094
Can you put on a mic for a bit?

729
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:02,163
- I'm so glad to see you again.
- Exactly.

730
00:28:02,164 --> 00:28:03,433
- Our former My Star.
- Oh, my.

731
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:05,404
- There are so many stars here.
- Our former My Star.

732
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:06,943
So, how did you...

733
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:08,343
We couldn't work at SM Entertainment anymore.

734
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:09,703
- We moved to THEBLACKLABEL.
- Right.

735
00:28:09,704 --> 00:28:11,414
- But it was too hard. We moved...
- To STARSHIP Entertainment.

736
00:28:12,514 --> 00:28:14,314
You guys are like migratory birds.

737
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,953
We used too much of our passion while working with you.

738
00:28:16,954 --> 00:28:18,313
(We used too much of our passion while working with you.)

739
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:19,713
- We...
- We used too much of our energy.

740
00:28:19,714 --> 00:28:21,583
- We're going to change our chant...
- Yes?

741
00:28:21,584 --> 00:28:23,793
into something that was inspired by you.

742
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:24,954
What is it?

743
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,623
"Let's show people why we're Grumpy Secretaries."

744
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:27,763
(Let's show people why we're Grumpy Secretaries.)

745
00:28:27,764 --> 00:28:28,863
Because of you...

746
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:30,933
"And why I am Kim Kwang Kyu."

747
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:32,034
- That one. Remember?
- Yes.

748
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:35,003
- Let's show them why we're TVXQ...
- TVXQ.

749
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,764
(U-Know Yunho's passionate comment to cheer everyone up)

750
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:38,903
(Grumpy Secretary was deeply inspired.)

751
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:41,644
- Go, U-Know Yunho! Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

752
00:28:41,844 --> 00:28:43,813
Let's show them why we're Grumpy Secretaries.

753
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:47,844
(They shouted the chant at every team get-together.)

754
00:28:48,344 --> 00:28:50,683
(They even shouted it at the entertainment awards ceremony.)

755
00:28:50,684 --> 00:28:54,324
(Is it their official chant now?)

756
00:28:54,854 --> 00:28:57,324
- Let's show them.
- You represent another agency.

757
00:28:57,394 --> 00:28:59,023
But assist the star you're working with well.

758
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:00,624
And show people why you're Grumpy Secretaries.

759
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:03,194
Why you're older and younger uncles.

760
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:05,334
Be sure to let people know that.

761
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:06,364
One, two, three.

762
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:07,703
- Go, My Grumpy Secretary!
- Let's do this!

763
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,964
I should go now.

764
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:10,473
He's such a passionate guy.

765
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:11,934
- Bye.
- Passion.

766
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,574
- Hello.
- Oh, the other members are here.

767
00:29:14,774 --> 00:29:16,743
- Hi.
- Hello.

768
00:29:16,744 --> 00:29:18,673
She... What was her name?

769
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,273
I'm LEESEO of IVE.

770
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:21,443
- LEESEO?
- Yes.

771
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:22,713
- I'm LIZ of IVE.
- LIZ?

772
00:29:22,714 --> 00:29:23,813
- LIZ?
- LIZ?

773
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,854
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

774
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:27,583
I'm Yu Jin's uncle.

775
00:29:27,584 --> 00:29:28,654
(I'm Yu Jin's uncle.)

776
00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:32,254
Feel free to let me know if you need anything.

777
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,924
You two are Tom and Jerry.

778
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:36,163
- Oh, you watched that episode?
- We were at THEBLACKLABEL then.

779
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:38,033
We're uncles at STARSHIP Entertainment.

780
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:40,194
- Oh, you're uncles?
- Yes.

781
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:43,133
- Thank you in advance.
- We'll do our best.

782
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:44,274
- Hi, Gaeul.
- Hi.

783
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,173
- You can leave and get ready now.
- Okay.

784
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:47,203
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

785
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:48,343
- Thank you for your help.
- Shall I give you back this?

786
00:29:48,344 --> 00:29:49,744
- Please give them back to us.
- I'll take this one.

787
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:51,274
Let's go.

788
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:55,784
Yu Jin, you should go now.

789
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:58,654
- Yu Jin, you should go now.
- What...

790
00:29:59,384 --> 00:30:00,854
- What took you so long?
- Sorry?

791
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:02,784
- I waited for you guys.
- You did?

792
00:30:03,024 --> 00:30:04,594
I was alone. I was lonely.

793
00:30:05,594 --> 00:30:08,023
Although I ate a small bite hastily, I'm full now.

794
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:09,063
- Are you?
- Yes.

795
00:30:09,064 --> 00:30:11,634
- I'm quite full.
- You have no time to eat now?

796
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:14,303
- You won't eat, right?
- I don't have time to eat,

797
00:30:14,304 --> 00:30:16,003
- and my dresses are too tight.
- You won't eat, right?

798
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:17,104
Why?

799
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:19,304
- They usually don't eat in a dress.
- That's right.

800
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:22,573
- You should change your clothes.
- I'm going to.

801
00:30:22,574 --> 00:30:24,314
(It's time to change into her dress for the rehearsal.)

802
00:30:24,644 --> 00:30:26,673
(Waiting for My Star who will come back in her dress)

803
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:28,884
All right. Here comes the princess.

804
00:30:29,384 --> 00:30:30,684
Here comes the princess.

805
00:30:31,754 --> 00:30:33,084
Here comes the princess.

806
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:40,353
(The real prince with a queen's mind appears.)

807
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:42,664
Why... What's with the reaction?

808
00:30:43,294 --> 00:30:45,433
(He smiles like a proud dad.)

809
00:30:45,434 --> 00:30:46,534
Thank you.

810
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:50,774
Am I doing this right?

811
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:53,874
Am I doing this right?

812
00:30:55,404 --> 00:30:56,544
Isn't this right?

813
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:57,974
Oh, like that?

814
00:30:58,944 --> 00:31:00,074
How do I look?

815
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,813
You look great in anything.

816
00:31:03,814 --> 00:31:05,984
I think you can eat some food in this dress.

817
00:31:06,084 --> 00:31:07,623
(She'll go and memorize her lines again.)

818
00:31:07,624 --> 00:31:09,983
- I have to memorize them.
- Memorize what?

819
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,924
Can you two read it from both sides?

820
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:14,923
- Read this?
- Won't there be a teleprompter?

821
00:31:14,924 --> 00:31:16,423
There won't be a teleprompter.

822
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:17,633
We'll use cue cards instead.

823
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:18,763
But it's so long.

824
00:31:18,764 --> 00:31:20,163
I know. It'll be hard, right?

825
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:22,063
- How will you memorize it all?
- I know, right?

826
00:31:22,064 --> 00:31:26,034
"Hello. I'm Yu Jin of IVE, the host of the 2025 SBS Gayo Daejeon."

827
00:31:26,304 --> 00:31:27,773
- I'll be Young K.
- Can you respond as well?

828
00:31:27,774 --> 00:31:29,243
Young K is the one who sings well.

829
00:31:29,244 --> 00:31:30,244
Cheer like this.

830
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:32,043
"This is my first time hosting this ceremony."

831
00:31:32,044 --> 00:31:34,143
"D-A-Y Six..."

832
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,614
It's DAY6.

833
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,514
I'm sorry.

834
00:31:37,554 --> 00:31:39,714
"D-A-Y Six..."

835
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:43,553
(We apologize for many reasons.)

836
00:31:43,554 --> 00:31:46,524
"Hello. I'm JAEMIN of NCT. It's nice to meet you all."

837
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:49,064
"The theme of 'The 2025 SBS Gayo Daejeon' is..."

838
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:52,933
"Golden..." Is it "lup?"

839
00:31:52,934 --> 00:31:54,334
- It's "loop."
- Oh, "golden loop."

840
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,973
"The theme of the ceremony is Golden Loop."

841
00:31:58,974 --> 00:32:01,603
"They will heat up the stage with their explosive energy."

842
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:03,303
"I..." Is it "ID?"

843
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:05,913
"With a wide spectrum, this mega root..."

844
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:06,914
It's "mega rookie."

845
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:09,384
- "This mega rookie band..."
- "Mega root?"

846
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:10,753
"APMP..."

847
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:13,554
- It's "I..." I mean, "AxMxP."
- "AxMxP."

848
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:16,284
"The princesses and the princes..."

849
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,793
"The monstrous rookie with limitless potential, AHOF."

850
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:19,794
(Cheerful)

851
00:32:19,795 --> 00:32:21,963
"I'll try to be a good leader with a sense of responsibility."

852
00:32:21,964 --> 00:32:23,023
"That's great."

853
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,793
"I, the lady of the house of 'The SBS Gayo Daejeon...'"

854
00:32:25,794 --> 00:32:26,794
Speak more cheerfully.

855
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:29,263
- "That's great." Good.
- "That's great."

856
00:32:29,264 --> 00:32:31,374
- "That's great." Good.
- "That's great."

857
00:32:31,434 --> 00:32:34,303
"I, the lady of the house of 'The SBS Gayo Daejeon...'"

858
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,073
"That's right. It's like a Christmas gift..."

859
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:37,573
"That's right."

860
00:32:37,574 --> 00:32:38,774
"That's right."

861
00:32:39,144 --> 00:32:41,884
- Don't tell her how to speak.
- Exactly.

862
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:43,583
- It's just that...
- I have my own style.

863
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:46,283
In the beginning, I think she should...

864
00:32:46,284 --> 00:32:47,623
- liven up the mood.
- But...

865
00:32:47,624 --> 00:32:50,793
- Since it's their first time, - That's true.

866
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:53,093
- Yu Jin should lead them.
- Oh, that's right.

867
00:32:53,094 --> 00:32:55,093
- She should liven up the mood.
- "That's right."

868
00:32:55,094 --> 00:32:56,363
- That's why I told her that.
- Oh, I see.

869
00:32:56,364 --> 00:32:58,064
Oh, right. I should do this too.

870
00:32:58,764 --> 00:32:59,834
- This...
- What?

871
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:02,803
How does a native English speaker pronounce "Toronto?"

872
00:33:02,804 --> 00:33:04,234
Is it "Toronto?" How do you pronounce it?

873
00:33:04,304 --> 00:33:05,903
You can ask Seo Jin.

874
00:33:05,904 --> 00:33:07,644
- He's fluent in English.
- Native pronunciation.

875
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:09,343
It's from a meme.

876
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:10,544
- A meme?
- You know what a meme is, right?

877
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,514
- A meme?
- Is there such a meme?

878
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:13,674
There's this meme...

879
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,583
(Young K's audition footage)

880
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:21,423
(I'm from Toronto, Canada.)

881
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:23,024
Oh, is he from Canada?

882
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,394
- Yes.
- The one from earlier?

883
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:25,623
- "Toronto."
- "Toronto."

884
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:27,594
- Why are you laughing?
- Did he live overseas?

885
00:33:27,994 --> 00:33:29,524
Is this a famous meme?

886
00:33:30,164 --> 00:33:31,333
It's famous enough.

887
00:33:31,334 --> 00:33:32,693
Then don't imitate him.

888
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:34,634
But the script says I should do it.

889
00:33:36,004 --> 00:33:38,473
The writer told me to do it.

890
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,533
You should imitate him if it's a really popular meme.

891
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:42,173
- But you don't have to...
- I won't do it.

892
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:43,903
(Her feelings are hurt.)

893
00:33:43,904 --> 00:33:44,914
I won't do it.

894
00:33:45,044 --> 00:33:47,143
- Do it. Imitate him.
- I won't do it.

895
00:33:47,144 --> 00:33:48,183
- Why?
- She's sulky.

896
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:49,184
Do it. Imitate him.

897
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:51,453
(Sulky)

898
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:53,584
- Do it. Look at me.
- You said it wasn't funny.

899
00:33:53,914 --> 00:33:56,653
- Yu Jin, look at me. Do it.
- How should I pronounce it?

900
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:58,223
(Infusing a queen's mindset)

901
00:33:58,224 --> 00:34:00,494
- How should I pronounce it?
- Look at me. Do it.

902
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,463
- That's not it. Do it like this.
- Hey.

903
00:34:02,464 --> 00:34:04,393
- You should point your finger.
- This isn't how you do it.

904
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:05,563
- Point your finger like this.
- All right.

905
00:34:05,564 --> 00:34:06,594
Just do it.

906
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:08,203
- "Toronto."
- Like this.

907
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:09,263
- "Toronto."
- "Toronto."

908
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:10,503
(My Star feels better now with a queen's mindset.)

909
00:34:10,504 --> 00:34:13,604
- You're doing well.
- I don't know how to do it.

910
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:15,804
You're doing great.

911
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:19,374
- "Toronto." You're doing great.
- You pronounced it well.

912
00:34:20,214 --> 00:34:22,444
- "Toronto."
- Yu Jin, the hosts should go now.

913
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:26,383
We'll begin the run-through rehearsal at 30.

914
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:27,653
(6 hours before the live broadcast, the run-through rehearsal begins.)

915
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:28,824
Let's check...

916
00:34:29,324 --> 00:34:30,993
the LED lights for the opening.

917
00:34:30,994 --> 00:34:32,053
(Run-through rehearsal: Continuous practice from start to finish)

918
00:34:32,054 --> 00:34:33,723
Please go up on the stage. Carry your mic, please.

919
00:34:33,724 --> 00:34:35,093
- Yes, he'll go next.
- Got it.

920
00:34:35,094 --> 00:34:36,563
(While the other stars are busy getting ready...)

921
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:37,664
Let's get ready now.

922
00:34:39,294 --> 00:34:41,864
(My Star is ready as well.)

923
00:34:42,104 --> 00:34:43,733
Goodness, I'm cold. Hello.

924
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,133
Are you cold?

925
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:47,974
- Yes, I'm cold.
- I'll bring you a blanket later.

926
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:51,714
Oh, goodness. Gosh, it's cold.

927
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:54,414
(He suddenly feels nervous.)

928
00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:59,714
(There's tension in the air as this is the last rehearsal.)

929
00:34:59,814 --> 00:35:03,054
(Grumpy Secretary became determined as well.)

930
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:09,264
(They arrive at the hall for the run-through rehearsal.)

931
00:35:10,364 --> 00:35:14,164
(The opening performance rehearsal is in progress.)

932
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:18,433
(Looking around)

933
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:19,934
Oh, my. It was huge.

934
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:24,744
I've been on many different stages before.

935
00:35:24,844 --> 00:35:26,773
The set seemed...

936
00:35:26,774 --> 00:35:29,084
several times bigger than the ones I had seen before.

937
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:32,614
"It must've been hard for them to build this set."

938
00:35:32,954 --> 00:35:34,323
That was the first thing that crossed my mind.

939
00:35:34,324 --> 00:35:36,484
(The grand scale of the stage overwhelms us.)

940
00:35:36,724 --> 00:35:39,124
"How do they hold a ceremony at such a huge venue like this?"

941
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:40,694
I was fascinated.

942
00:35:41,624 --> 00:35:44,234
(My Star will take over the enormous stage.)

943
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:48,664
(She moves to under the stage to prepare to make her entrance.)

944
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,573
(Going through the low, dark passage under the stage)

945
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:53,973
(They arrive at the standby spot.)

946
00:35:53,974 --> 00:35:56,144
Do you have any water? Can I get some water?

947
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,713
- Sorry?
- Can I have some water?

948
00:35:57,714 --> 00:35:58,714
- Water?
- I'll bring you water.

949
00:35:58,715 --> 00:35:59,743
I'll go get it.

950
00:35:59,744 --> 00:36:01,744
(Thank you)

951
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:05,214
(My Star has requested water.)

952
00:36:06,084 --> 00:36:09,854
(He has to come back before the rehearsal begins!)

953
00:36:10,954 --> 00:36:12,093
Why did I come here?

954
00:36:12,094 --> 00:36:13,594
Where is our green room?

955
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:15,394
I should hurry up.

956
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:18,934
(Worried and anxious)

957
00:36:19,394 --> 00:36:21,133
- Get ready now.
- Yes.

958
00:36:21,134 --> 00:36:22,733
Won't you be wearing in-ear earphones...

959
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,674
at the opening?

960
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:27,034
- It happened that way. Later on...
- I see.

961
00:36:27,334 --> 00:36:29,943
You can go ahead without them when you say the first line.

962
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:31,573
- You should wear them after that.
- Okay.

963
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:33,344
You won't be able to hear your voice at all.

964
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:35,084
Manager Lee,

965
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,484
can you bring her the in-ear earphones?

966
00:36:37,754 --> 00:36:40,383
- Where are they? Sorry?
- The manager has them.

967
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:43,484
(He calls the older bestie right away.)

968
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:48,864
(Right at that time, Kwang Kyu arrives at the green room.)

969
00:36:50,264 --> 00:36:51,793
- Here.
- Thank you.

970
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:53,364
(He picks up a bottle of water first.)

971
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,934
Do we have any blankets?

972
00:36:56,634 --> 00:36:59,034
Yu Jin needs a blanket...

973
00:37:00,474 --> 00:37:01,674
Thanks. Hello?

974
00:37:02,204 --> 00:37:04,844
She needs her in-ear earphones.

975
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:07,374
- In-ear earphones?
- Yes, we forgot to bring them.

976
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,183
In-ear earphones? Okay. Got it.

977
00:37:09,184 --> 00:37:11,013
- Bring the in-ear earphones too.
- Okay.

978
00:37:11,014 --> 00:37:12,583
(He has to deliver the in-ear earphones too.)

979
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:14,824
(1 minute before the MCs' opening)

980
00:37:15,754 --> 00:37:19,894
(The MCs make their entrance right after the clip ends.)

981
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:21,864
The MCs will go up on the stage now.

982
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:27,563
(The MCs should be on standby.)

983
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:29,663
(Glancing)

984
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,874
Will you be okay without in-ear earphones?

985
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:33,534
- I need them, but I have no choice.
- He's on his way with them.

986
00:37:37,914 --> 00:37:39,374
(Worried)

987
00:37:41,014 --> 00:37:43,384
(My Star came up on the stage without her in-ear earphones.)

988
00:37:44,354 --> 00:37:47,314
(Kwang Kyu, hurry up.)

989
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:52,193
(Finally, Kwang Kyu arrives.)

990
00:37:52,194 --> 00:37:53,294
He brought the in-ear earphones.

991
00:37:53,424 --> 00:37:54,494
Yes, I brought them.

992
00:37:54,594 --> 00:37:55,864
Give them to me for now.

993
00:37:57,794 --> 00:37:58,794
All three of them?

994
00:38:01,064 --> 00:38:05,234
(Seo Jin runs toward Yu Jin feeling rushed.)

995
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:10,604
(Did My Star put on her in-ear earphones?)

996
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:13,314
Now, shall we go to our spot?

997
00:38:14,944 --> 00:38:19,184
(The opening rehearsal begins.)

998
00:38:21,224 --> 00:38:24,894
(The MCs appear.)

999
00:38:25,354 --> 00:38:27,454
(He goes to the front of the stage to check.)

1000
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:32,533
(She put on her in-ear earphones.)

1001
00:38:32,534 --> 00:38:35,603
Hello, I'm one of the MCs of "The 2025 SBS Gayo Daejeon."

1002
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,203
I'm Yu Jin of IVE.

1003
00:38:37,204 --> 00:38:39,174
(Relieved)

1004
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:42,703
Captain Santa,

1005
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:45,673
when did you prepare such a great performance?

1006
00:38:45,674 --> 00:38:48,714
For a moment, I felt like I was at a jazz bar in Toronto.

1007
00:38:48,984 --> 00:38:50,984
(She pronounced the word perfectly just as she practiced.)

1008
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:54,353
(The dimples of satisfaction)

1009
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:56,053
- Into the loop.
- Into the loop.

1010
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:58,393
(Thanks to Grumpy Secretary, she finished the rehearsal well.)

1011
00:38:58,394 --> 00:39:00,424
- Please go down.
- Okay.

1012
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:04,024
(The MCs are on standby during the next performance.)

1013
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:10,603
(Singers including aespa...)

1014
00:39:10,604 --> 00:39:16,974
(and ALLDAY PROJECT rehearse their performances.)

1015
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:23,444
(Bring up the energy of the queen.)

1016
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:27,684
(4 hours before the live broadcast)

1017
00:39:28,084 --> 00:39:30,824
(While My Star is back on the stage for the rehearsal...)

1018
00:39:31,754 --> 00:39:34,094
(The IVE members are getting ready for their performance in Part 2.)

1019
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,563
- Hi.
- Hello.

1020
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:38,133
- Oh, hi.
- It's been a while.

1021
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:39,563
(Jang Won Young of IVE)

1022
00:39:39,564 --> 00:39:42,733
- Hello.
- I guess you two have met before.

1023
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:44,503
- Of course.
- Do you recognize him?

1024
00:39:44,504 --> 00:39:45,974
- Yes, we met...
- Before?

1025
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:49,643
- at a brand promotional event.
- Right.

1026
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:50,844
Oh, really?

1027
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,843
Won Young is the PR ambassador of that brand.

1028
00:39:53,844 --> 00:39:56,844
Won Young is the PR ambassador of that brand.

1029
00:39:57,014 --> 00:40:00,584
Most people just say "ambassador" in English.

1030
00:40:00,854 --> 00:40:01,854
Oh, I see.

1031
00:40:02,954 --> 00:40:04,493
- Is that so?
- I was just joking.

1032
00:40:04,494 --> 00:40:06,553
- That was funny.
- I heard you'd help us today.

1033
00:40:06,554 --> 00:40:07,823
That's right.

1034
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:09,524
(I'll help you a lot as the older uncle.)

1035
00:40:10,064 --> 00:40:11,064
Aren't you hungry?

1036
00:40:11,764 --> 00:40:13,263
- Coffee...
- Aren't you?

1037
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:14,833
- I'd like some coffee.
- Don't you need anything else?

1038
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:15,903
What kind of coffee?

1039
00:40:15,904 --> 00:40:17,103
- Americano.
- Iced Americano?

1040
00:40:17,104 --> 00:40:18,274
Yes, please.

1041
00:40:18,704 --> 00:40:21,073
Can I ask them a favor like this?

1042
00:40:21,074 --> 00:40:22,844
- Of course.
- You're supposed to give us tasks.

1043
00:40:23,244 --> 00:40:25,313
(Kwang Kyu reacts more enthusiastically than ever.)

1044
00:40:25,314 --> 00:40:27,014
Don't you need anything else? Aren't you hungry?

1045
00:40:28,084 --> 00:40:29,213
- I...
- You shouldn't eat anything?

1046
00:40:29,214 --> 00:40:31,614
That's not the case. Since it's Christmas,

1047
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:34,154
I'd like to have strawberry cake.

1048
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:36,283
Or since it's Christmas...

1049
00:40:36,284 --> 00:40:37,483
- We'll look for it.
- Thank you.

1050
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:39,123
There's a hotel next to this building.

1051
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:41,424
- Oh, I see. That's great.
- But since today's Christmas Day,

1052
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,794
- It must be crowded...
- they might've been sold out.

1053
00:40:43,924 --> 00:40:46,264
- But you have to figure it out.
- Yes?

1054
00:40:47,594 --> 00:40:48,734
You have to figure it out.

1055
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:51,704
- We have to find a strawberry cake.
- Yes.

1056
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,403
That's the only place in this neighborhood.

1057
00:40:54,404 --> 00:40:55,404
(He makes excuses habitually.)

1058
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:57,373
- I don't know where it could be.
- We'll try to find it.

1059
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:59,343
- All right. A strawberry cake?
- Yes.

1060
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,583
- Got it.
- I'll share it with the others.

1061
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:02,713
All right. I understand.

1062
00:41:02,714 --> 00:41:04,514
- Thank you.
- No problem.

1063
00:41:04,684 --> 00:41:07,284
- Then...
- I'm not a handful.

1064
00:41:07,854 --> 00:41:10,284
You're not? I think you're the hardest member to take care of.

1065
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,423
- Let's get going. Let's go.
- She thinks she's not a handful.

1066
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:15,224
- All right.
- Thank you in advance.

1067
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,293
Hi.

1068
00:41:18,294 --> 00:41:20,533
Look at their outfits. So these are their today's outfits.

1069
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:21,564
It's for the Christmas vibe.

1070
00:41:22,264 --> 00:41:24,233
- You look like different people.
- Are you done now?

1071
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,933
- Yes.
- Anything you want to eat?

1072
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:27,203
- A lot.
- I want a strawberry cake.

1073
00:41:27,204 --> 00:41:29,003
- Dubai chewy cookies.
- Dubai chewy cookies.

1074
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:30,074
- What?
- Dubai chewy cookies.

1075
00:41:30,374 --> 00:41:32,313
- Chewy cookies?
- Could you get Dubai chewy cookies?

1076
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:33,713
- What's that?
- Is that the name of a dog?

1077
00:41:33,714 --> 00:41:35,144
It's Dubai chewy cookies.

1078
00:41:36,514 --> 00:41:37,813
It's really nice.

1079
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,283
- Dubai dewy cookies?
- Dubai chewy cookies.

1080
00:41:39,284 --> 00:41:41,353
- Dubai dewy cookies.
- Could you get Dubai chewy cookies?

1081
00:41:41,354 --> 00:41:43,254
Do we have to go to Dubai?

1082
00:41:44,154 --> 00:41:45,853
We'll try and find them around here.

1083
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:47,423
- It's going to be hard.
- Right.

1084
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,694
It's going to be hard.

1085
00:41:48,794 --> 00:41:50,323
- Do you need anything to drink?
- Dubai chewy cookies.

1086
00:41:50,324 --> 00:41:52,434
- Okay.
- Hot chewy cookies?

1087
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,133
No. I got it.

1088
00:41:54,134 --> 00:41:55,264
Stop asking.

1089
00:41:55,864 --> 00:41:57,263
- All right.
- Please get them, thanks.

1090
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,303
- Okay.
- Okay.

1091
00:41:58,304 --> 00:42:00,173
- We'll try and get them.
- Okay.

1092
00:42:00,174 --> 00:42:01,174
Let's go get them.

1093
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:06,014
("Sold Out" signs everywhere... The Dubai chewy cookie syndrome.)

1094
00:42:06,674 --> 00:42:07,784
Wear this.

1095
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:10,114
The wind.

1096
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:11,214
Goodness.

1097
00:42:11,414 --> 00:42:12,753
(The Dubai chewy cookie expedition sets off with strong wind.)

1098
00:42:12,754 --> 00:42:14,824
The temperature is warmer than before.

1099
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,653
The wind is the problem.

1100
00:42:16,654 --> 00:42:18,393
The wind.

1101
00:42:18,394 --> 00:42:19,923
It would be fine for you since you don't have hair,

1102
00:42:19,924 --> 00:42:21,693
but for us, our hair is flying everywhere.

1103
00:42:21,694 --> 00:42:23,323
It's colder when you don't have hair.

1104
00:42:23,324 --> 00:42:25,094
- I said it's flying.
- What?

1105
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:26,933
- It's flying.
- It's flying?

1106
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:28,734
- Yes.
- I want mine to fly as well.

1107
00:42:30,304 --> 00:42:31,874
You wouldn't know.

1108
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:36,303
(They walk...)

1109
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,774
(and walk.)

1110
00:42:39,074 --> 00:42:45,054
(The Dubai chewy cookie expedition is on a rough journey.)

1111
00:42:49,624 --> 00:42:50,824
They sell bread here.

1112
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:53,794
(They finally arrived at a bakery.)

1113
00:42:54,524 --> 00:42:56,724
(Carefully looking)

1114
00:42:56,924 --> 00:42:57,994
This is the one.

1115
00:42:58,334 --> 00:42:59,994
- What?
- We have to buy this.

1116
00:43:00,094 --> 00:43:02,204
I want a strawberry cake.

1117
00:43:02,834 --> 00:43:04,134
- We do?
- Strawberry cake.

1118
00:43:04,634 --> 00:43:06,774
We could get...

1119
00:43:07,034 --> 00:43:09,074
two of these.

1120
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:12,914
What about the Dubai chewy cookies?

1121
00:43:13,614 --> 00:43:16,014
They wouldn't sell those here, right?

1122
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:20,214
Do you have Dubai chewy cookies?

1123
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:22,354
- We don't.
- Where can we get them?

1124
00:43:22,724 --> 00:43:24,994
Do you know a place around here?

1125
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:28,363
As far as I know, they don't sell it in here.

1126
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:30,093
The Dubai chewy cookies.

1127
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:32,064
All right.

1128
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:36,934
Could you check what's inside a Dubai chewy cookie?

1129
00:43:38,474 --> 00:43:40,673
The ingredients of a Dubai chewy cookie?

1130
00:43:40,674 --> 00:43:43,344
- Hold on.
- There are cookies here.

1131
00:43:43,574 --> 00:43:44,674
Over there as well.

1132
00:43:45,514 --> 00:43:48,714
(There are cookies,)

1133
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:54,084
(but they look nowhere close to Dubai chewy cookies.)

1134
00:43:54,484 --> 00:43:56,324
Over there.

1135
00:43:56,484 --> 00:43:58,124
I think those are similar.

1136
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:01,324
Dubai.

1137
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:02,564
(Did they find Dubai chewy cookies?)

1138
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:04,634
This one?

1139
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:07,294
It's this one. It's the one with chocolate chips.

1140
00:44:08,304 --> 00:44:09,404
Is that so?

1141
00:44:09,634 --> 00:44:10,833
Shall we take some of these?

1142
00:44:10,834 --> 00:44:12,803
- Let's do that.
- It can't be helped.

1143
00:44:12,804 --> 00:44:14,333
They don't have them.

1144
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:15,403
What's this?

1145
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:16,504
(Did they succeed in getting Dubai chewy cookies?)

1146
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:18,974
- This isn't the same.
- These are the cookies.

1147
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,354
(Is this a Dubai chewy cookie?)

1148
00:44:28,854 --> 00:44:30,883
It's too hard.

1149
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:32,393
- What?
- It's too hard.

1150
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:34,193
(The texture doesn't live up to the name.)

1151
00:44:34,194 --> 00:44:36,163
It will be soft when they chew it.

1152
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:37,824
Okay. Then these.

1153
00:44:38,064 --> 00:44:41,763
Could we have two of the strawberry cakes up there?

1154
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:43,064
Two strawberry cakes.

1155
00:44:43,104 --> 00:44:44,363
Where do we put the cookies?

1156
00:44:44,364 --> 00:44:46,473
- Give them to me.
- Okay.

1157
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:47,534
Okay.

1158
00:44:50,804 --> 00:44:52,044
Here. Strawberry cakes.

1159
00:44:52,244 --> 00:44:53,644
- We're here.
- Strawberry cakes.

1160
00:44:53,714 --> 00:44:55,443
- We're here.
- Strawberries.

1161
00:44:55,444 --> 00:44:57,983
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1162
00:44:57,984 --> 00:44:59,813
- Strawberry cakes.
- I want to take a picture.

1163
00:44:59,814 --> 00:45:01,184
- Here.
- Amazing!

1164
00:45:01,424 --> 00:45:02,723
It's...

1165
00:45:02,724 --> 00:45:04,894
And the Dubai cookies.

1166
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,253
Really?

1167
00:45:06,254 --> 00:45:07,323
Hold on.

1168
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:08,763
They just came from Dubai.

1169
00:45:08,764 --> 00:45:11,024
(They brought Dubai chewy cookies?)

1170
00:45:11,434 --> 00:45:13,064
They just came from Dubai.

1171
00:45:14,434 --> 00:45:16,034
We went all the way to Dubai.

1172
00:45:17,304 --> 00:45:18,603
- I'm serious.
- That's not a Dubai chewy cookie.

1173
00:45:18,604 --> 00:45:21,233
What? They were made in Dubai.

1174
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:22,344
(Dropping)

1175
00:45:23,504 --> 00:45:24,843
(She doesn't know what to say.)

1176
00:45:24,844 --> 00:45:26,043
Who? This one?

1177
00:45:26,044 --> 00:45:27,214
Me.

1178
00:45:27,774 --> 00:45:28,983
Okay.

1179
00:45:28,984 --> 00:45:30,643
- This was made in Dubai?
- Here's your straw.

1180
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,113
It was made in Dubai.

1181
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:33,884
- They made this in Incheon.
- What?

1182
00:45:34,454 --> 00:45:35,723
It's an Incheon cookie.

1183
00:45:35,724 --> 00:45:38,254
No. It's from Dubai. It came in today.

1184
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,123
Thank you so much.

1185
00:45:40,124 --> 00:45:42,394
- Right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1186
00:45:42,764 --> 00:45:44,763
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1187
00:45:44,764 --> 00:45:46,364
- Thank you.
- All right.

1188
00:45:47,064 --> 00:45:49,633
(Putting straws)

1189
00:45:49,634 --> 00:45:50,663
(Kwang Kyu takes care of Won Young with a fan's love.)

1190
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,503
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1191
00:45:52,504 --> 00:45:53,833
Enjoy.

1192
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,474
You're welcome.

1193
00:45:57,844 --> 00:45:59,873
(They return to My Star's green room...)

1194
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:02,714
(after taking care of the IVE members.)

1195
00:46:02,784 --> 00:46:04,813
This isn't so nice,

1196
00:46:04,814 --> 00:46:06,354
but wouldn't it be so pretty with that?

1197
00:46:06,454 --> 00:46:07,483
(He gives her some water first.)

1198
00:46:07,484 --> 00:46:09,084
Thank you.

1199
00:46:10,084 --> 00:46:11,853
(Drinking)

1200
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:13,994
Drink more.

1201
00:46:14,294 --> 00:46:15,294
Thank you.

1202
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,463
(Drinking)

1203
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:18,794
You're just pretending, aren't you?

1204
00:46:19,194 --> 00:46:20,564
One more time.

1205
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:22,933
(It's sweet, but also persistent.)

1206
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:24,304
Thank you.

1207
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,204
(He made My Star who doesn't drink get moisturized.)

1208
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:30,974
- Father.
- Yes?

1209
00:46:31,074 --> 00:46:32,844
Would you like some Dubai chewy cookies?

1210
00:46:32,944 --> 00:46:34,744
Where is it?

1211
00:46:35,144 --> 00:46:36,614
It's totally famous these days.

1212
00:46:38,614 --> 00:46:39,784
- This is it?
- Yes.

1213
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:43,253
It's very delicious. Eat that.

1214
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:44,523
I'll have my makeup done.

1215
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:46,794
This is why they didn't believe me.

1216
00:46:47,324 --> 00:46:49,494
They didn't even touch what you gave them.

1217
00:46:49,824 --> 00:46:51,163
Of course, they wouldn't.

1218
00:46:51,164 --> 00:46:53,633
It's totally different.

1219
00:46:53,634 --> 00:46:54,734
It's totally different.

1220
00:46:54,934 --> 00:46:57,634
I should take care of him.

1221
00:46:58,334 --> 00:46:59,774
It's my first time trying this.

1222
00:47:01,074 --> 00:47:02,904
The Dubai chewy cookie...

1223
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:05,214
that Yu Jin gave us.

1224
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:10,884
(He wants to treasure the gift from My Star.)

1225
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:12,013
(He tries the Dubai chewy cookie.)

1226
00:47:12,014 --> 00:47:13,954
Let's see what this tastes like.

1227
00:47:17,384 --> 00:47:18,494
How is it?

1228
00:47:19,194 --> 00:47:21,193
- I'm...
- He's stabbing it.

1229
00:47:21,194 --> 00:47:23,463
- Is this a rice cake?
- You have to chew it.

1230
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:25,133
I can't.

1231
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,464
Or else, it wouldn't be cut.

1232
00:47:26,934 --> 00:47:28,303
You have to chew it.

1233
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,204
- You have to chew it.
- Or you could cut it with a string.

1234
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:31,674
Chew it.

1235
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:33,474
But...

1236
00:47:34,074 --> 00:47:35,173
Just bite it.

1237
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:36,703
I wanted you to try it as well.

1238
00:47:36,704 --> 00:47:38,243
You're not going to eat it when I chew it.

1239
00:47:38,244 --> 00:47:39,444
First eat it.

1240
00:47:42,044 --> 00:47:45,514
(Chewing)

1241
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:49,584
This...

1242
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:52,953
This...

1243
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,054
(What do you think, Father? Isn't it tasty?)

1244
00:47:54,154 --> 00:47:56,464
It's like the bag of sand we had in elementary school.

1245
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:59,293
(A bag of sand?)

1246
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:01,763
It's like chewing sand.

1247
00:48:01,764 --> 00:48:04,103
I've never heard anyone comment on it like that.

1248
00:48:04,104 --> 00:48:05,904
(It's a unique taste review on the Dubai chewy cookie.)

1249
00:48:06,034 --> 00:48:08,473
If you say that to Won Young,

1250
00:48:08,474 --> 00:48:11,044
she'll get upset. She really loves them.

1251
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:14,814
(Is that so?)

1252
00:48:15,514 --> 00:48:17,714
It tastes good, but the texture...

1253
00:48:17,814 --> 00:48:19,514
- Why? I like the texture.
- It's...

1254
00:48:20,614 --> 00:48:25,294
You can hear the sound of walking on sand at the beach.

1255
00:48:25,724 --> 00:48:26,724
(Laughing)

1256
00:48:27,524 --> 00:48:29,124
(Exclaiming)

1257
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:31,264
It's a little like songpyeon.

1258
00:48:33,264 --> 00:48:36,834
(He tried a Dubai chewy cookie thanks to Yu Jin.)

1259
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:39,033
Let's start the reading, Yu Jin.

1260
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:40,234
- Okay.
- Okay.

1261
00:48:41,804 --> 00:48:44,774
(They quickly leave the room.)

1262
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:48,444
(They first head to the green room.)

1263
00:48:50,044 --> 00:48:51,683
Hello.

1264
00:48:51,684 --> 00:48:53,383
It's been a while.

1265
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:55,483
(KARINA of aespa)

1266
00:48:55,484 --> 00:48:57,453
- We were on "Synchro U."
- "Synchro U."

1267
00:48:57,454 --> 00:48:59,353
We met there.

1268
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,824
(They were on a show together.)

1269
00:49:01,924 --> 00:49:04,824
- I should take another photo.
- Sure.

1270
00:49:04,964 --> 00:49:07,594
Please take a picture of us, Manager.

1271
00:49:08,834 --> 00:49:09,903
Vertically.

1272
00:49:09,904 --> 00:49:13,474
(They take a picture since they met after a long time.)

1273
00:49:14,074 --> 00:49:16,203
- Thank you.
- You know who this man is, right?

1274
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:18,103
- Yes. He's Lee Seo Jin.
- Right.

1275
00:49:18,104 --> 00:49:20,844
I also know some idol members like her.

1276
00:49:21,684 --> 00:49:22,844
Thank you.

1277
00:49:23,184 --> 00:49:25,253
Good luck.

1278
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,753
Are you filming My Grumpy Secretary?

1279
00:49:26,754 --> 00:49:29,254
Yes. Let's meet again in My Grumpy Secretary.

1280
00:49:29,284 --> 00:49:30,753
How could I have you as my manager?

1281
00:49:30,754 --> 00:49:31,794
(Production crew: Please come as My Star.)

1282
00:49:33,724 --> 00:49:36,564
(A picture with our future My Star while waiting for My Star)

1283
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:43,034
Hello.

1284
00:49:44,204 --> 00:49:45,274
Hello.

1285
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:47,103
- Hello.
- Hello.

1286
00:49:47,104 --> 00:49:49,274
Hi. Hello.

1287
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:53,014
(Nodding)

1288
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:56,344
(Turning)

1289
00:49:56,414 --> 00:49:58,984
(Their heads turn at the same time.)

1290
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,424
(Among the people rushing by,)

1291
00:50:04,384 --> 00:50:09,464
(the Grumpy Secretary is stuck in the endless wait.)

1292
00:50:10,764 --> 00:50:11,993
It's YOUNGSEO.

1293
00:50:11,994 --> 00:50:14,663
- YOUNGSEO?
- Yes.

1294
00:50:14,664 --> 00:50:16,263
- Hello.
- It's TARZZAN.

1295
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,834
(Former My Star, ALLDAY PROJECT)

1296
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,273
- Hi.
- Hello.

1297
00:50:21,274 --> 00:50:22,344
(He smiles with a dimple after meeting someone he knows.)

1298
00:50:23,974 --> 00:50:25,244
Hi.

1299
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:28,143
- Have you been well?
- Hello.

1300
00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:29,414
Hello.

1301
00:50:29,884 --> 00:50:30,913
Hi.

1302
00:50:30,914 --> 00:50:32,083
(He's happy to meet his former My Stars here.)

1303
00:50:32,084 --> 00:50:33,854
It's a surprise to meet you here.

1304
00:50:34,254 --> 00:50:35,554
Hello.

1305
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:42,394
(He expresses his happiness with a shocking camera move.)

1306
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:44,663
All the best today.

1307
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:45,733
- Good luck.
- Where are you going?

1308
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:47,893
We have to prepare for the red carpet event.

1309
00:50:47,894 --> 00:50:50,033
You came out early in the morning, didn't you?

1310
00:50:50,034 --> 00:50:51,034
I did.

1311
00:50:51,604 --> 00:50:52,973
You must be tired.

1312
00:50:52,974 --> 00:50:54,233
Good luck.

1313
00:50:54,234 --> 00:50:55,943
All the best.

1314
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:57,374
(After the short meeting with the former My Stars...)

1315
00:50:57,774 --> 00:50:59,643
- Hello.
- Hello.

1316
00:50:59,644 --> 00:51:03,414
- Hi.
- Hi.

1317
00:51:03,884 --> 00:51:06,154
Hello. Hi.

1318
00:51:06,414 --> 00:51:08,254
Hi.

1319
00:51:08,354 --> 00:51:10,454
It's MEOVV.

1320
00:51:11,324 --> 00:51:15,294
(They did a challenge together.)

1321
00:51:15,494 --> 00:51:16,623
What brings you here?

1322
00:51:16,624 --> 00:51:18,593
- What else?
- Right.

1323
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:20,264
We came to perform.

1324
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:22,233
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

1325
00:51:22,234 --> 00:51:23,403
You look cool.

1326
00:51:23,404 --> 00:51:24,563
You look so cool.

1327
00:51:24,564 --> 00:51:25,834
You're not going to film a challenge today?

1328
00:51:26,134 --> 00:51:27,634
Shall we?

1329
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,903
- No.
- We can do that.

1330
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:30,303
I was just asking.

1331
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:31,544
Please take care of them well.

1332
00:51:32,374 --> 00:51:34,313
- They're all here.
- Hello.

1333
00:51:34,314 --> 00:51:36,013
Aren't you going to do a challenge?

1334
00:51:36,014 --> 00:51:37,183
- You should.
- Today?

1335
00:51:37,184 --> 00:51:38,853
- Do a challenge together.
- Today?

1336
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:40,084
- Are you ready?
- What?

1337
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,184
I'm ready.

1338
00:51:42,984 --> 00:51:44,484
I'll do whatever I can.

1339
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:45,993
Thank you.

1340
00:51:45,994 --> 00:51:47,424
You're so pretty.

1341
00:51:47,594 --> 00:51:49,294
Look at their outfits.

1342
00:51:49,594 --> 00:51:50,823
- You can go.
- Merry Christmas.

1343
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:52,163
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1344
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:53,333
Merry Christmas.

1345
00:51:53,334 --> 00:51:56,364
(They had a lively My Grumpy Secretary reunion.)

1346
00:51:57,234 --> 00:51:58,973
What's the worst affection...

1347
00:51:58,974 --> 00:52:00,274
in the world?

1348
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:05,113
What's the worst affection in the world?

1349
00:52:05,114 --> 00:52:06,314
Passion.

1350
00:52:07,214 --> 00:52:08,614
I was just so tired.

1351
00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:11,084
- It's a good trait.
- Not at all.

1352
00:52:11,144 --> 00:52:13,653
We're burning in passion again because of you...

1353
00:52:13,654 --> 00:52:15,254
in our 50s.

1354
00:52:15,554 --> 00:52:17,054
Let's go, My Grumpy Secretary!

1355
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:18,723
Let's do this!

1356
00:52:18,724 --> 00:52:20,193
- It's starting again.
- Let's do this!

1357
00:52:20,194 --> 00:52:21,323
Go now.

1358
00:52:21,324 --> 00:52:25,163
The reason why we're My Grumpy Secretary!

1359
00:52:25,164 --> 00:52:26,833
The reason why we're My Grumpy Secretary!

1360
00:52:26,834 --> 00:52:29,364
(He leaves with passion until the very end.)

1361
00:52:30,304 --> 00:52:32,903
(The lively reunion ends.)

1362
00:52:32,904 --> 00:52:35,034
He never gets tired.

1363
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:37,503
Doesn't your energy get drained...

1364
00:52:37,504 --> 00:52:39,044
every time you meet someone?

1365
00:52:41,314 --> 00:52:43,544
It's so hard to meet people.

1366
00:52:44,214 --> 00:52:46,084
- You have to bring up your energy.
- Manager.

1367
00:52:46,284 --> 00:52:47,454
Manager.

1368
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:51,384
- Do you need anything?
- I need to stick my nails.

1369
00:52:52,524 --> 00:52:53,823
(I was just going to get some rest.)

1370
00:52:53,824 --> 00:52:55,264
What?

1371
00:52:55,324 --> 00:52:56,593
Hold on. Nails?

1372
00:52:56,594 --> 00:52:57,823
We should stick them inside.

1373
00:52:57,824 --> 00:53:00,133
(My Star's request is above his tiredness.)

1374
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:01,533
(The nail-tip expert steps in.)

1375
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:04,004
Let's stick some nails.

1376
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:07,404
Do you like the bright ones or the dark ones?

1377
00:53:08,004 --> 00:53:10,174
Bright ones since I'm wearing a white dress.

1378
00:53:11,144 --> 00:53:12,744
There are these as well.

1379
00:53:13,444 --> 00:53:14,944
This and this.

1380
00:53:16,784 --> 00:53:18,013
Yes. Go with these.

1381
00:53:18,014 --> 00:53:19,613
- These?
- Yes. Go with these.

1382
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:22,683
(They quickly decide on the design.)

1383
00:53:22,684 --> 00:53:23,724
All right.

1384
00:53:24,954 --> 00:53:26,223
That's right.

1385
00:53:26,224 --> 00:53:27,923
(Now, he has to pick the right sizes and stick them.)

1386
00:53:27,924 --> 00:53:30,524
There are numbers behind the clear ones, right?

1387
00:53:30,924 --> 00:53:31,994
Here.

1388
00:53:32,534 --> 00:53:34,763
(Numbers?)

1389
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:35,863
Are there numbers?

1390
00:53:35,864 --> 00:53:38,133
(He looks at it again under the light.)

1391
00:53:38,134 --> 00:53:39,333
- It's there, right?
- Where are the numbers?

1392
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:40,404
Look.

1393
00:53:40,734 --> 00:53:41,873
Over here.

1394
00:53:41,874 --> 00:53:43,504
There's seven written on this.

1395
00:53:44,504 --> 00:53:45,643
Seven?

1396
00:53:45,644 --> 00:53:47,444
(Seven?)

1397
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:53,383
Then...

1398
00:53:53,384 --> 00:53:54,484
(Aged eyesight issue)

1399
00:53:54,554 --> 00:53:55,623
This...

1400
00:53:55,624 --> 00:53:56,854
I can't read it.

1401
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:58,894
It's okay. Then...

1402
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,453
I'll do this.

1403
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:01,964
(I'll do this.)

1404
00:54:02,224 --> 00:54:04,093
You could do this, then. You need to get this out.

1405
00:54:04,094 --> 00:54:06,364
You can remove the clear part like a sticker.

1406
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:08,434
- You can do that, right?
- What?

1407
00:54:08,904 --> 00:54:10,534
Like this. You remove it.

1408
00:54:12,304 --> 00:54:15,344
(Fidgeting)

1409
00:54:17,874 --> 00:54:18,974
(Laughing)

1410
00:54:20,114 --> 00:54:22,714
(Focusing)

1411
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:26,914
That's right. You press it hard.

1412
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:28,523
Like that.

1413
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:30,524
Your hands are very dry.

1414
00:54:31,854 --> 00:54:33,123
That's because it's winter.

1415
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:34,754
(That's because it's winter.)

1416
00:54:35,964 --> 00:54:37,394
I'll look for it.

1417
00:54:38,324 --> 00:54:39,434
Here.

1418
00:54:39,964 --> 00:54:41,093
Number seven..

1419
00:54:41,094 --> 00:54:42,104
(My Star with young pupils hands it to him.)

1420
00:54:42,964 --> 00:54:46,734
(Grumpy Secretary presses it with experience.)

1421
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:48,003
How is it? Is it done?

1422
00:54:48,004 --> 00:54:49,803
(He sounds tired.)

1423
00:54:49,804 --> 00:54:51,143
Shall we go with this?

1424
00:54:51,144 --> 00:54:52,214
Look at this.

1425
00:54:53,244 --> 00:54:54,343
Is this okay?

1426
00:54:54,344 --> 00:54:55,713
(He focuses with tight lips.)

1427
00:54:55,714 --> 00:54:57,184
- It fits.
- It looks nice.

1428
00:55:00,284 --> 00:55:04,484
(He presses the last nail and completes the job.)

1429
00:55:05,494 --> 00:55:06,623
- Is it done?
- Thank you.

1430
00:55:06,624 --> 00:55:07,754
You're really good.

1431
00:55:09,464 --> 00:55:10,523
Complete!

1432
00:55:10,524 --> 00:55:11,694
(He finally smiles with a dimple.)

1433
00:55:14,994 --> 00:55:17,604
(Sparkling)

1434
00:55:18,434 --> 00:55:20,334
(Meanwhile, Kwang Kyu...)

1435
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:23,603
(Pressing of another sort)

1436
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:24,773
It's almost over,

1437
00:55:24,774 --> 00:55:26,374
- so we have to part soon.
- Right.

1438
00:55:28,544 --> 00:55:31,684
(He's indulging his own selfish desires with the members.)

1439
00:55:35,254 --> 00:55:38,053
(Taking pictures)

1440
00:55:38,054 --> 00:55:39,453
Thank you.

1441
00:55:39,454 --> 00:55:40,593
(Taking 4 shots for his satisfaction)

1442
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:42,523
It would be the end for us when you go to the red carpet.

1443
00:55:42,524 --> 00:55:43,724
We'll move.

1444
00:55:45,294 --> 00:55:47,834
- I won't be seeing you when you go.
- Right.

1445
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:50,733
(Kwang Kyu feels extra sad today.)

1446
00:55:50,734 --> 00:55:52,434
Younger uncle and daughter.

1447
00:55:53,004 --> 00:55:54,104
I'm your bigger uncle.

1448
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:56,074
Bigger uncle.

1449
00:55:56,244 --> 00:55:57,343
Bigger uncle and the daughter.

1450
00:55:57,344 --> 00:55:59,213
Is your voice hoarse?

1451
00:55:59,214 --> 00:56:00,374
- Me?
- Yes.

1452
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:02,283
- I'm very worried.
- Father...

1453
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:03,443
- Bigger uncle.
- You sound like...

1454
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,143
you have a cold.

1455
00:56:05,144 --> 00:56:06,684
Father. Bigger uncle.

1456
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:08,084
Bigger uncle.

1457
00:56:08,384 --> 00:56:10,124
Senior!

1458
00:56:10,484 --> 00:56:12,024
Bigger uncle is...

1459
00:56:12,754 --> 00:56:15,593
taking selfies again.

1460
00:56:15,594 --> 00:56:16,893
(Feeling embarrassed)

1461
00:56:16,894 --> 00:56:18,764
- Selfies again.
- It's driving me crazy.

1462
00:56:18,994 --> 00:56:20,733
He's...

1463
00:56:20,734 --> 00:56:22,404
- lost it again.
- Right.

1464
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,603
You know him, right?

1465
00:56:23,604 --> 00:56:24,804
What should I do?

1466
00:56:26,004 --> 00:56:28,004
I think we need to move on to the fourth lesson.

1467
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,603
I told on you.

1468
00:56:30,604 --> 00:56:31,604
What did you say?

1469
00:56:31,605 --> 00:56:33,114
- I...
- What?

1470
00:56:33,214 --> 00:56:36,214
The light stick. It's the light stick.

1471
00:56:37,014 --> 00:56:41,814
(He glosses over the situation and takes a picture with My Star.)

1472
00:56:42,284 --> 00:56:45,124
(Bigger uncle is extra excited today.)

1473
00:56:45,594 --> 00:56:49,223
(The rehearsals are going on.)

1474
00:56:49,224 --> 00:56:52,834
(The rehearsals are going on.)

1475
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:55,564
- Let's move.
- Okay.

1476
00:56:56,134 --> 00:56:58,974
(The IVE members move as well.)

1477
00:56:59,674 --> 00:57:00,973
- Is that your outfit?
- Yes.

1478
00:57:00,974 --> 00:57:02,844
I said "let's go, LEESEO." Didn't you see me?

1479
00:57:03,074 --> 00:57:05,344
You said that? When?

1480
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:07,874
You were good.

1481
00:57:08,614 --> 00:57:10,643
You had a big flower here.

1482
00:57:10,644 --> 00:57:13,314
(The leader takes care of the youngest member.)

1483
00:57:14,354 --> 00:57:18,154
(The IVE members gather behind the stage.)

1484
00:57:18,994 --> 00:57:21,624
(Hands-on care on Yu Jin)

1485
00:57:23,564 --> 00:57:25,264
(Glancing)

1486
00:57:25,934 --> 00:57:29,363
Where is Kwang Kyu?

1487
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:31,604
(Did the bigger uncle disappear again?)

1488
00:57:32,304 --> 00:57:33,603
Only Won Young isn't out.

1489
00:57:33,604 --> 00:57:37,204
(Kwang Kyu is still lost.)

1490
00:57:38,504 --> 00:57:40,743
Did you miss something? Did something not work out well?

1491
00:57:40,744 --> 00:57:42,214
My in-ear earphones got tangled.

1492
00:57:43,214 --> 00:57:45,144
- The cord was tangled.
- Yes.

1493
00:57:46,714 --> 00:57:48,984
I think I had a misunderstanding.

1494
00:57:50,454 --> 00:57:52,793
My Star was Yu Jin.

1495
00:57:52,794 --> 00:57:54,624
(My Star was Yu Jin...)

1496
00:57:55,564 --> 00:57:58,493
I thought I was the manager of the entire IVE.

1497
00:57:58,494 --> 00:57:59,663
That's why I kept...

1498
00:57:59,664 --> 00:58:02,103
taking care of the entire team.

1499
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:03,364
(I kept taking care of the entire team.)

1500
00:58:04,534 --> 00:58:06,234
I'm Yu Jin's manager,

1501
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:08,744
but she's in a group.

1502
00:58:08,804 --> 00:58:09,944
Together.

1503
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:14,174
What should I do for the ending fairy pose?

1504
00:58:14,674 --> 00:58:15,783
Ending fairy.

1505
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,214
(Ending fairy)

1506
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:21,554
(The dimple fairy is embarrassed by the ending fairy request.)

1507
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:23,384
Don't do anything.

1508
00:58:24,054 --> 00:58:25,384
Doing nothing is the best.

1509
00:58:25,854 --> 00:58:27,054
Don't do anything.

1510
00:58:27,624 --> 00:58:29,064
Doing nothing is the best.

1511
00:58:29,194 --> 00:58:31,964
(He doesn't want me to do anything.)

1512
00:58:32,024 --> 00:58:33,293
Should I not do it?

1513
00:58:33,294 --> 00:58:34,464
Should I not do it?

1514
00:58:35,334 --> 00:58:36,733
Pretty girls just stay still.

1515
00:58:36,734 --> 00:58:39,504
(Pretty girls just stay still.)

1516
00:58:40,374 --> 00:58:41,703
I won't do anything.

1517
00:58:41,704 --> 00:58:42,743
(Nodding)

1518
00:58:42,744 --> 00:58:45,174
(Like this?)

1519
00:58:45,344 --> 00:58:46,574
Just blink once.

1520
00:58:46,614 --> 00:58:47,673
Blink?

1521
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:49,484
(Blinking)

1522
00:58:50,784 --> 00:58:52,714
IVE will go in!

1523
00:58:55,184 --> 00:58:59,094
(The IVE members are on stage.)

1524
00:59:00,054 --> 00:59:03,394
(They wait while watching LE SSERAFIM's performance.)

1525
00:59:05,364 --> 00:59:10,504
(She can't hold in her charm even as she waits.)

1526
00:59:12,774 --> 00:59:15,174
(Colorful)

1527
00:59:16,674 --> 00:59:19,674
(His eyes widen.)

1528
00:59:21,414 --> 00:59:23,483
It's no joke.

1529
00:59:23,484 --> 00:59:25,713
This is why they go crazy.

1530
00:59:25,714 --> 00:59:27,014
(They're amazed by the grand scale.)

1531
00:59:28,184 --> 00:59:30,183
How many dancers do they have?

1532
00:59:30,184 --> 00:59:31,284
(He's amazed.)

1533
00:59:32,524 --> 00:59:35,454
(LE SSERAFIM's rehearsal ends.)

1534
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:40,694
(My Star's rehearsal begins.)

1535
00:59:45,734 --> 00:59:49,404
(Her playful expression disappears.)

1536
00:59:50,544 --> 00:59:56,414
(She does her job professionally as the leader of IVE.)

1537
00:59:57,684 --> 01:00:00,584
(The Grumpy Secretaries focus on their job too.)

1538
01:00:01,614 --> 01:00:04,154
(Humming)

1539
01:00:05,454 --> 01:00:10,924
(The rehearsal goes on without any problem.)

1540
01:00:12,394 --> 01:00:16,334
(The next song begins.)

1541
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:26,674
(My Star smoothly leads the stage with confidence.)

1542
01:00:30,044 --> 01:00:31,443
It was my first time watching their show.

1543
01:00:31,444 --> 01:00:32,854
Their songs were nice.

1544
01:00:33,314 --> 01:00:35,724
It's a year-end event.

1545
01:00:36,154 --> 01:00:38,123
They would have practiced so many hours...

1546
01:00:38,124 --> 01:00:40,824
and had countless hardships...

1547
01:00:41,124 --> 01:00:43,064
to come here and perform this.

1548
01:00:43,424 --> 01:00:46,193
Even filming one scene is really tough.

1549
01:00:46,194 --> 01:00:49,364
For her to do that until the third part,

1550
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:53,034
it wouldn't be easy. Her energy would drain.

1551
01:00:58,974 --> 01:01:01,944
(The rehearsal almost ends.)

1552
01:01:02,584 --> 01:01:05,614
(What will My Star's ending pose be?)

1553
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:09,424
(Blinking)

1554
01:01:10,654 --> 01:01:11,924
Just blink once.

1555
01:01:13,154 --> 01:01:15,094
(Ending fairy)

1556
01:01:16,224 --> 01:01:20,334
(He smiles with a dimple after seeing her ending pose.)

1557
01:01:23,004 --> 01:01:25,163
Her dimples look similar to yours.

1558
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:26,374
- Right?
- Yes.

1559
01:01:26,504 --> 01:01:29,203
(Dimples popping out)

1560
01:01:29,204 --> 01:01:32,074
(They have the same dimples.)

1561
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:35,943
(As soon as the rehearsal ends,)

1562
01:01:35,944 --> 01:01:39,014
(she hurriedly changes into a dress.)

1563
01:01:39,454 --> 01:01:41,383
The camera panned to Yu Jin at the end.

1564
01:01:41,384 --> 01:01:42,384
What?

1565
01:01:42,554 --> 01:01:44,184
The camera panned to Yu Jin at the end.

1566
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:46,224
Yes.

1567
01:01:46,254 --> 01:01:48,193
She got a solo shot.

1568
01:01:48,194 --> 01:01:50,464
(He feels proud that My Star got a solo shot at the end.)

1569
01:01:51,194 --> 01:01:53,133
(She changed into a dress.)

1570
01:01:53,134 --> 01:01:54,264
I feel sleepy.

1571
01:01:57,264 --> 01:01:58,703
I'm glad to see you guys.

1572
01:01:58,704 --> 01:01:59,704
(Exhausted)

1573
01:02:01,034 --> 01:02:02,074
I...

1574
01:02:02,304 --> 01:02:04,204
(No more water, please.)

1575
01:02:05,104 --> 01:02:06,943
(Seeing how tired she looks, he insists that she drink some water.)

1576
01:02:06,944 --> 01:02:08,573
You didn't even drink.

1577
01:02:08,574 --> 01:02:11,614
I totally did. I shouldn't have said that.

1578
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:14,013
Okay.

1579
01:02:14,014 --> 01:02:15,313
(Drink it.)

1580
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,184
(Sipping)

1581
01:02:17,324 --> 01:02:19,024
- You didn't drink it, did you?
- Yes, I did.

1582
01:02:19,494 --> 01:02:20,624
I drank it.

1583
01:02:25,064 --> 01:02:27,334
(Father, this is enough.)

1584
01:02:28,134 --> 01:02:29,934
(It's suspicious.)

1585
01:02:30,434 --> 01:02:32,064
(Drink it.)

1586
01:02:32,504 --> 01:02:34,534
(Drinking with her eyes)

1587
01:02:35,944 --> 01:02:38,003
(Drink one more time!)

1588
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,444
(Drinking too much water)

1589
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:43,813
Finally.

1590
01:02:43,814 --> 01:02:45,713
(The bottom of the bottle is finally visible.)

1591
01:02:45,714 --> 01:02:49,084
Stop giving her water. Why do you keep making her drink water?

1592
01:02:49,484 --> 01:02:50,983
- He won't go until I finish it.
- You should drink a lot of water...

1593
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:52,523
when you talk a lot.

1594
01:02:52,524 --> 01:02:54,524
- Or her mouth will get dry.
- He's right. I needed it.

1595
01:02:55,224 --> 01:02:57,724
Anyway, in conclusion,

1596
01:02:58,224 --> 01:03:00,594
I finished a bottle of water.

1597
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,703
I thought my mom would've made me...

1598
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:05,563
drink water like this...

1599
01:03:05,564 --> 01:03:06,774
when I was little.

1600
01:03:07,004 --> 01:03:09,743
We all gathered for a read-through once,

1601
01:03:09,744 --> 01:03:11,973
and he suddenly gave me water like this.

1602
01:03:11,974 --> 01:03:14,143
The other seniors were laughing.

1603
01:03:14,144 --> 01:03:16,083
It was embarrassing.

1604
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,644
But it helped in the end.

1605
01:03:19,454 --> 01:03:22,314
(Younger uncle is the best.)

1606
01:03:23,024 --> 01:03:26,554
(Meanwhile,)

1607
01:03:27,324 --> 01:03:29,664
(the audience filled the venue.)

1608
01:03:30,864 --> 01:03:34,734
(The fans are waiting for the show to begin with excitement.)

1609
01:03:35,864 --> 01:03:40,074
(The stage My Star will step onto is ready.)

1610
01:03:41,474 --> 01:03:42,604
Please get ready.

1611
01:03:43,304 --> 01:03:44,304
Today...

1612
01:03:45,304 --> 01:03:46,843
- I'll go crush it.
- Good luck.

1613
01:03:46,844 --> 01:03:48,244
- Good luck.
- I'll go crush it.

1614
01:03:48,974 --> 01:03:50,183
Good luck.

1615
01:03:50,184 --> 01:03:52,484
(Giving the queen's energy to My Star)

1616
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:54,014
You got this.

1617
01:03:56,824 --> 01:03:58,383
- I'll get going.
- Yes. Good luck.

1618
01:03:58,384 --> 01:03:59,953
(Casting a spell)

1619
01:03:59,954 --> 01:04:03,024
We'll show them why you're IVE, and why you're An Yu Jin.

1620
01:04:03,324 --> 01:04:05,393
That's on her.

1621
01:04:05,394 --> 01:04:06,564
Yes. Yu Jin will do it.

1622
01:04:06,894 --> 01:04:08,964
Show them why I'm IVE.

1623
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:11,064
- And among them...
- Show them why you're IVE.

1624
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:13,004
Show them why you're An Yu Jin among them.

1625
01:04:13,204 --> 01:04:18,043
- The original creator is here.
- The original creator is here.

1626
01:04:18,044 --> 01:04:19,873
- The original creator is here.
- Among them...

1627
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:21,373
He came at the perfect moment.

1628
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:22,713
- Among them...
- Okay.

1629
01:04:22,714 --> 01:04:24,414
- Show her.
- I'll say it.

1630
01:04:24,814 --> 01:04:26,683
- Come here.
- You're at "SBS Gayo Daejeon."

1631
01:04:26,684 --> 01:04:28,114
Let's prove them...

1632
01:04:28,654 --> 01:04:30,784
why you're IVE,

1633
01:04:30,924 --> 01:04:33,423
- and why you're An Yu Jin...
- Right.

1634
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:34,753
among them.

1635
01:04:34,754 --> 01:04:36,093
- Yes.
- Count to three.

1636
01:04:36,094 --> 01:04:37,993
In 1, 2, 3, IVE,

1637
01:04:37,994 --> 01:04:39,334
- go!
- Go!

1638
01:04:41,434 --> 01:04:42,503
Congratulations, Yu Jin!

1639
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:46,004
(Congratulations on hosting the show!)

1640
01:04:47,104 --> 01:04:48,333
(She received overwhelming support.)

1641
01:04:48,334 --> 01:04:50,703
- My Old Star.
- Yes!

1642
01:04:50,704 --> 01:04:52,143
(It energized her more than a queen's mindset ever could.)

1643
01:04:52,144 --> 01:04:54,074
- Go. You can do it.
- You got this.

1644
01:04:54,314 --> 01:04:58,284
(5 minutes before the broadcast)

1645
01:04:58,844 --> 01:05:02,484
(The venue is packed.)

1646
01:05:03,084 --> 01:05:04,923
Please move quickly.

1647
01:05:04,924 --> 01:05:07,594
(My Star is going to the stage without Grumpy Secretaries.)

1648
01:05:08,854 --> 01:05:13,264
(With tension in the air, everything is ready.)

1649
01:05:15,664 --> 01:05:18,304
(The cue signaling the start of the broadcast)

1650
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:21,873
(3 seconds before the broadcast)

1651
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:22,943
(2 seconds before the broadcast)

1652
01:05:22,944 --> 01:05:23,944
(1 second before the broadcast)

1653
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:30,913
(My Queen appears...)

1654
01:05:30,914 --> 01:05:34,384
(among a crowd of tens of thousands.)

1655
01:05:34,554 --> 01:05:37,923
Hello, I'm Yu Jin of IVE,

1656
01:05:37,924 --> 01:05:39,224
the host of "2025 SBS Gayo Daejeon."

1657
01:05:40,154 --> 01:05:41,653
("SBS Gayo Daejeon" is now live.)

1658
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:43,223
He doesn't need flashy modifiers.

1659
01:05:43,224 --> 01:05:45,193
YEONJUN, an incredible solo artist whose presence alone...

1660
01:05:45,194 --> 01:05:48,193
defines a genre, opened the Golden Loop...

1661
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,063
with his performance.

1662
01:05:51,064 --> 01:05:53,173
We couldn't wait to show it.

1663
01:05:53,174 --> 01:05:54,934
We're revealing it right now.

1664
01:05:55,204 --> 01:05:57,704
We weren't sure what you'd like, so...

1665
01:06:03,414 --> 01:06:06,814
(Why is he suddenly blowing up a balloon?)

1666
01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:10,754
(Immersed)

1667
01:06:11,754 --> 01:06:15,154
(Whose living room is this?)

1668
01:06:16,364 --> 01:06:19,494
(And what is he doing?)

1669
01:06:19,664 --> 01:06:21,963
Filming isn't allowed...

1670
01:06:21,964 --> 01:06:23,963
during the live broadcast...

1671
01:06:23,964 --> 01:06:25,403
because of potential accidents.

1672
01:06:25,404 --> 01:06:26,433
(Filming isn't permitted due to the risk of accidents.)

1673
01:06:26,434 --> 01:06:28,504
- I think you should leave first.
- Okay.

1674
01:06:29,404 --> 01:06:31,973
- We'll get going now.
- We should cook now.

1675
01:06:31,974 --> 01:06:33,144
- Right.
- Yes.

1676
01:06:33,814 --> 01:06:34,844
I'm so hungry.

1677
01:06:35,414 --> 01:06:37,183
It doesn't seem like I'll get to eat anytime soon.

1678
01:06:37,184 --> 01:06:39,484
For My Star, Yu Jin,

1679
01:06:40,054 --> 01:06:41,183
we'll be preparing something.

1680
01:06:41,184 --> 01:06:42,354
I'm looking forward to it.

1681
01:06:42,924 --> 01:06:46,494
(Cutting)

1682
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:51,024
(Uncle Kwang Kyu is cutting radish.)

1683
01:06:51,524 --> 01:06:55,494
My Star said she wanted to have homemade food.

1684
01:06:56,204 --> 01:06:59,164
And my place happened to be very close.

1685
01:06:59,304 --> 01:07:01,403
So...

1686
01:07:01,404 --> 01:07:03,773
I heard you usually have dinner with the celebrity...

1687
01:07:03,774 --> 01:07:06,144
- after the shoot.
- Yes.

1688
01:07:07,074 --> 01:07:09,013
(Smacking her lips)

1689
01:07:09,014 --> 01:07:10,214
I'm craving Korean food.

1690
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,684
- Korean food.
- We'll prepare Korean food.

1691
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:13,784
- You will?
- Yes.

1692
01:07:13,785 --> 01:07:15,013
Kwang Kyu can cook.

1693
01:07:15,014 --> 01:07:16,023
Really?

1694
01:07:16,024 --> 01:07:17,484
- But...
- Yu Jin,

1695
01:07:17,924 --> 01:07:19,184
which Korean food do you like?

1696
01:07:19,694 --> 01:07:21,923
Braised kimchi with ribs.

1697
01:07:21,924 --> 01:07:24,894
It's the dish my mom makes the best.

1698
01:07:25,064 --> 01:07:26,393
- Your mom?
- Yes.

1699
01:07:26,394 --> 01:07:27,793
So...

1700
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,304
It's like the best Korean food for me.

1701
01:07:30,664 --> 01:07:31,703
Braised kimchi with ribs.

1702
01:07:31,704 --> 01:07:34,003
- This is my father's favorite.
- Your father's favorite?

1703
01:07:34,004 --> 01:07:36,743
He loves eating gangdoenjang and seasoned radish.

1704
01:07:36,744 --> 01:07:38,404
- Gangdoenjang...
- Gangdoenjang...

1705
01:07:38,574 --> 01:07:40,613
- with radish.
- mixed with rice and radish.

1706
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:42,544
(Gangdoenjang and seasoned radish, her father's favorite)

1707
01:07:43,344 --> 01:07:44,913
Like home-cooked food.

1708
01:07:44,914 --> 01:07:46,314
(I miss homemade food.)

1709
01:07:47,214 --> 01:07:49,113
(I, Royal Chef Eom the Mom,)

1710
01:07:49,114 --> 01:07:54,824
(will cook a home-cooked meal for my Queen.)

1711
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:59,194
(Slicing the radish first)

1712
01:08:01,294 --> 01:08:06,533
(He's good with a knife, just what you'd expect from Royal Chef.)

1713
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:08,203
Are you enjoying...

1714
01:08:08,204 --> 01:08:10,174
- "The 2025 SBS Gayo Daejeon?"
- It's Yu Jin.

1715
01:08:10,574 --> 01:08:12,473
It's too early to feel disappointed.

1716
01:08:12,474 --> 01:08:14,613
Part Two will be incredible.

1717
01:08:14,614 --> 01:08:16,313
Although Part Two will start soon,

1718
01:08:16,314 --> 01:08:19,383
for those who can't stand even a moment's wait,

1719
01:08:19,384 --> 01:08:21,084
shouldn't we show them something,

1720
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:23,484
rookie hosts?

1721
01:08:24,584 --> 01:08:26,223
Yes. Actually, a few days ago,

1722
01:08:26,224 --> 01:08:28,553
- I learned this ultimate skill...
- She's doing it effortlessly.

1723
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:30,593
from JAEMIN.

1724
01:08:30,594 --> 01:08:33,893
- Is this the moment?
- Is this the moment?

1725
01:08:33,894 --> 01:08:36,263
(By the way, what is Uncle Seo Jin doing?)

1726
01:08:36,264 --> 01:08:37,564
Let's do it.

1727
01:08:40,274 --> 01:08:44,804
(His strong diaphragm has been going nonstop for 20 minutes.)

1728
01:08:46,714 --> 01:08:51,214
(He keeps blowing up balloons without pause.)

1729
01:08:52,984 --> 01:08:56,784
(Why is he working so hard?)

1730
01:08:57,854 --> 01:09:00,524
I took out the Christmas tree last year.

1731
01:09:01,594 --> 01:09:04,193
But this year, I didn't feel like it,

1732
01:09:04,194 --> 01:09:05,593
and I was just too busy.

1733
01:09:05,594 --> 01:09:07,193
(She was too busy to enjoy Christmas this year.)

1734
01:09:07,194 --> 01:09:09,264
That's why...

1735
01:09:09,964 --> 01:09:12,564
today doesn't feel like Christmas at all.

1736
01:09:12,904 --> 01:09:15,373
I usually start listening to carols a month before Christmas.

1737
01:09:15,374 --> 01:09:16,404
(Sad)

1738
01:09:16,644 --> 01:09:18,043
(What's Christmas to you?)

1739
01:09:18,044 --> 01:09:19,814
It's just like any other day.

1740
01:09:22,214 --> 01:09:23,484
Nothing is different.

1741
01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:28,614
Christmas doesn't mean anything to me now.

1742
01:09:30,484 --> 01:09:34,154
(Even though Christmas means nothing to him,)

1743
01:09:35,054 --> 01:09:38,294
(he's giving it his all.)

1744
01:09:38,794 --> 01:09:41,864
(Christmas is meaningless to him.)

1745
01:09:42,934 --> 01:09:46,204
(He's preparing Christmas decorations just for My Star.)

1746
01:09:47,074 --> 01:09:48,634
I start feeling dizzy now.

1747
01:09:49,004 --> 01:09:52,774
We have enough time. Slow it down.

1748
01:09:54,274 --> 01:09:55,874
We might have to send you to a hospital.

1749
01:09:56,844 --> 01:09:59,283
(A plate of radish slices)

1750
01:09:59,284 --> 01:10:00,354
It's too much.

1751
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:06,593
(Is the Royal Chef tasting it?)

1752
01:10:06,594 --> 01:10:07,654
It tastes good.

1753
01:10:09,054 --> 01:10:10,864
(Glancing)

1754
01:10:13,694 --> 01:10:17,134
(He shares it with Seo Jin because it's good.)

1755
01:10:18,134 --> 01:10:19,233
Try it.

1756
01:10:19,234 --> 01:10:20,534
(Eating raw radish?)

1757
01:10:21,004 --> 01:10:23,904
(He eats it since he got it.)

1758
01:10:24,604 --> 01:10:27,013
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

1759
01:10:27,014 --> 01:10:28,273
It'd be even better with ssamjang.

1760
01:10:28,274 --> 01:10:30,214
(Approved)

1761
01:10:31,784 --> 01:10:32,814
Do you want ssamjang?

1762
01:10:33,314 --> 01:10:34,653
It'd be better with ssamjang.

1763
01:10:34,654 --> 01:10:36,224
(It means he wants ssamjang.)

1764
01:10:36,784 --> 01:10:38,053
(Here's ssamjang.)

1765
01:10:38,054 --> 01:10:39,153
Can I just dip it like this?

1766
01:10:39,154 --> 01:10:40,294
- Yes.
- Straight from the container?

1767
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:44,363
This is much better.

1768
01:10:44,364 --> 01:10:45,564
(Satisfied)

1769
01:10:46,294 --> 01:10:47,964
(Dipping in ssamjang)

1770
01:10:49,434 --> 01:10:53,204
(He continues working while chewing on radish.)

1771
01:10:54,234 --> 01:10:57,844
(Christmas decorations for My Star)

1772
01:10:58,374 --> 01:11:01,544
(He's putting up the balloons more precisely than expected.)

1773
01:11:01,814 --> 01:11:03,714
I don't even remember...

1774
01:11:04,744 --> 01:11:06,484
the last time I decorated a Christmas tree.

1775
01:11:06,854 --> 01:11:09,384
Not sure. I think the first time I did that was in elementary school.

1776
01:11:10,154 --> 01:11:11,424
Why would you do that?

1777
01:11:11,784 --> 01:11:15,224
Decorating isn't important. Removing them is a bigger hassle.

1778
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:17,563
You might feel good putting up those decorations,

1779
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:20,564
but removing them is so annoying.

1780
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,834
(He said removing them was a hassle.)

1781
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:28,734
(But he focused on it without saying a word.)

1782
01:11:30,174 --> 01:11:33,113
(The balloons alone give off a strong Christmas vibe.)

1783
01:11:33,114 --> 01:11:36,283
It's not easy to align them perfectly.

1784
01:11:36,284 --> 01:11:38,513
But he placed them so neatly that it looks like he used a ruler.

1785
01:11:38,514 --> 01:11:40,053
(Perfectly arranged as if he measured them with a ruler)

1786
01:11:40,054 --> 01:11:42,514
You can tell he graduated from New York University.

1787
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:46,183
I just tried changing the mood.

1788
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:48,994
(With his touch, the Christmas spirit comes alive.)

1789
01:11:49,024 --> 01:11:50,864
I think that's his charm.

1790
01:11:50,964 --> 01:11:52,193
He acts like he won't do it,

1791
01:11:52,194 --> 01:11:54,263
but when he does it, he actually does a good job.

1792
01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:56,804
(That's his trait.)

1793
01:11:57,064 --> 01:11:59,033
(Placing)

1794
01:11:59,034 --> 01:12:00,873
You worked hard.

1795
01:12:00,874 --> 01:12:03,674
Why complain when you're going to do it anyway?

1796
01:12:05,244 --> 01:12:09,314
(My Star is performing as IVE at 7:30pm.)

1797
01:12:11,984 --> 01:12:15,684
(Part 2 is coming to an end.)

1798
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:22,594
(Uncle Kwang Kyu, I'm going soon.)

1799
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:26,894
I haven't cooked for a while, so I don't know what to do first.

1800
01:12:28,264 --> 01:12:31,764
(Cutting the vegetables into cubes)

1801
01:12:31,834 --> 01:12:35,903
Onions, shiitake mushrooms, green onions, tofu.

1802
01:12:35,904 --> 01:12:37,504
You can put everything in it.

1803
01:12:37,544 --> 01:12:40,314
Just put everything in it with some doenjang and gochujang.

1804
01:12:40,644 --> 01:12:43,184
Simmer it slowly over low heat.

1805
01:12:44,384 --> 01:12:46,984
It looks quite legitimate.

1806
01:12:47,654 --> 01:12:50,224
(It already looks good.)

1807
01:12:51,324 --> 01:12:52,993
Gangdoenjang...

1808
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:54,393
(My Star's favorite homemade food, savory gangdoenjang)

1809
01:12:54,394 --> 01:12:56,224
I think I know how to make gangdoenjang.

1810
01:12:57,124 --> 01:12:59,864
So for the back ribs...

1811
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,634
The back ribs.

1812
01:13:03,364 --> 01:13:05,904
(He opens the fridge with a serious look.)

1813
01:13:07,734 --> 01:13:11,774
(The secret ingredient Royal Chef Eom the Mom prepared...)

1814
01:13:12,844 --> 01:13:16,114
(is his mother's homemade aged kimchi.)

1815
01:13:16,274 --> 01:13:17,614
Here's a tip.

1816
01:13:18,314 --> 01:13:20,283
Remove the seasoning...

1817
01:13:20,284 --> 01:13:21,914
from the kimchi.

1818
01:13:22,554 --> 01:13:24,784
Otherwise, it'll have a bitter taste.

1819
01:13:25,954 --> 01:13:27,953
Get rid of the seasoning...

1820
01:13:27,954 --> 01:13:30,164
before you boil it.

1821
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,064
It tastes much cleaner and tastier that way.

1822
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,294
This is it.

1823
01:13:34,734 --> 01:13:36,264
My last name is Eom.

1824
01:13:37,104 --> 01:13:38,534
Yes.

1825
01:13:38,604 --> 01:13:40,873
The ribs.

1826
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,573
(Blanched back ribs)

1827
01:13:42,574 --> 01:13:44,244
Let me put them over it.

1828
01:13:45,774 --> 01:13:47,943
(He puts the blanched back ribs...)

1829
01:13:47,944 --> 01:13:51,814
(on the onions.)

1830
01:13:54,414 --> 01:13:59,354
(Here's kimchi with no bitter taste.)

1831
01:13:59,994 --> 01:14:02,424
(Royal Chef Eom the Mom's special sauce)

1832
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:08,394
(Pour enough sauce to cover the ribs,)

1833
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:14,374
(and let them simmer slowly.)

1834
01:14:15,934 --> 01:14:20,074
(Braised kimchi with ribs, My Star's favorite, is coming soon.)

1835
01:14:21,614 --> 01:14:25,284
Cooking gives me a strange feeling.

1836
01:14:26,414 --> 01:14:29,754
It feels like making food...

1837
01:14:30,654 --> 01:14:33,724
for a son who's come home on his first leave from the military.

1838
01:14:34,254 --> 01:14:37,363
I'm sure everyone is like this,

1839
01:14:37,364 --> 01:14:40,564
but when I cook for myself, I get it done in 20 minutes.

1840
01:14:40,794 --> 01:14:43,563
I can't imagine cooking for 1 or 2 hours...

1841
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:44,734
just to make a single meal for myself.

1842
01:14:45,204 --> 01:14:46,534
But because it was for My Star,

1843
01:14:46,834 --> 01:14:48,774
I didn't mind cooking for several hours.

1844
01:14:49,504 --> 01:14:51,104
My last name is Eom.

1845
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:57,583
(Before long,)

1846
01:14:57,584 --> 01:15:01,814
(only the last performance of "SBS Gayo Daejeon" is left.)

1847
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:05,323
She let her hair down and got changed.

1848
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:06,384
You're right.

1849
01:15:06,524 --> 01:15:09,493
Thank you so much for staying with us for so long.

1850
01:15:09,494 --> 01:15:13,734
(My Star finished Part 3 without a single mistake.)

1851
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:16,063
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

1852
01:15:16,064 --> 01:15:18,533
(I'm going home now.)

1853
01:15:18,534 --> 01:15:20,534
- Bye.
- Bye.

1854
01:15:21,704 --> 01:15:24,444
The show is over. Yu Jin will be coming soon.

1855
01:15:25,874 --> 01:15:28,744
(Checking the braised kimchi with ribs one last time)

1856
01:15:29,614 --> 01:15:31,144
She's here.

1857
01:15:31,314 --> 01:15:32,484
No.

1858
01:15:32,784 --> 01:15:34,283
- Seo Jin, open the door for her.
- Okay.

1859
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:36,454
(Springing)

1860
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:43,824
(My Star came after the live broadcast.)

1861
01:15:47,964 --> 01:15:49,194
I'm starving.

1862
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:52,204
Today,

1863
01:15:53,604 --> 01:15:57,144
all I've eaten is snacks. I'm so hungry.

1864
01:15:57,544 --> 01:16:00,243
Before saying my last line,

1865
01:16:00,244 --> 01:16:01,673
I thought of braised kimchi with ribs,

1866
01:16:01,674 --> 01:16:03,114
and my mouth was watering.

1867
01:16:03,414 --> 01:16:09,014
(She was already thinking about K-food instead of K-pop.)

1868
01:16:09,454 --> 01:16:10,823
(Mouthwatering)

1869
01:16:10,824 --> 01:16:13,824
I think I'll enjoy it no matter how it tastes.

1870
01:16:15,424 --> 01:16:18,224
(She's exhausted after going 10 hours without eating.)

1871
01:16:18,994 --> 01:16:21,263
(Glancing)

1872
01:16:21,264 --> 01:16:22,734
I feel nervous.

1873
01:16:23,234 --> 01:16:24,704
I'm not sure if it tastes good.

1874
01:16:26,234 --> 01:16:27,604
The door is open.

1875
01:16:28,704 --> 01:16:32,773
(Uncle Seo Jin welcomes her warmly.)

1876
01:16:32,774 --> 01:16:34,373
- Yu Jin.
- Hi.

1877
01:16:34,374 --> 01:16:36,014
- Come on in quickly.
- "Yu Jin."

1878
01:16:37,114 --> 01:16:39,014
- Hi.
- Come on in. Why is the light off?

1879
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:41,583
- It smells good.
- What?

1880
01:16:41,584 --> 01:16:42,913
- My Star.
- I brought this.

1881
01:16:42,914 --> 01:16:44,083
Did you not eat it?

1882
01:16:44,084 --> 01:16:45,684
- I wanted to eat it with you.
- You did?

1883
01:16:46,024 --> 01:16:47,323
- It smells so good.
- Come on in.

1884
01:16:47,324 --> 01:16:48,993
- Come in.
- I had no time to eat.

1885
01:16:48,994 --> 01:16:50,463
- Come on in.
- I'm starving.

1886
01:16:50,464 --> 01:16:51,523
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

1887
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:52,693
The food is ready.

1888
01:16:52,694 --> 01:16:54,093
- You came at the perfect moment.
- It smells amazing.

1889
01:16:54,094 --> 01:16:55,363
It does? What a relief.

1890
01:16:55,364 --> 01:16:56,733
- I'm glad it smells good, at least.
- It's Christmas.

1891
01:16:56,734 --> 01:16:58,204
What a relief.

1892
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:01,533
(She's enjoying the smell of home-cooked food on Christmas.)

1893
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:02,674
Yu Jin.

1894
01:17:03,074 --> 01:17:05,974
As soon as I entered the house,

1895
01:17:06,644 --> 01:17:09,843
it smelled like homemade food,

1896
01:17:09,844 --> 01:17:12,444
just like when I tell my mom...

1897
01:17:12,484 --> 01:17:14,554
what I'm craving.

1898
01:17:14,654 --> 01:17:17,683
The moment I walked in,

1899
01:17:17,684 --> 01:17:19,084
a mouthwatering smell hit me.

1900
01:17:19,454 --> 01:17:20,553
(She's touched already.)

1901
01:17:20,554 --> 01:17:22,093
- It smells good.
- Take a seat.

1902
01:17:22,094 --> 01:17:23,363
- Can I sit here?
- Sure.

1903
01:17:23,364 --> 01:17:24,564
The rice is perfectly cooked.

1904
01:17:25,194 --> 01:17:26,793
The rice is perfectly cooked. Oh, my.

1905
01:17:26,794 --> 01:17:28,693
Shall we set the table?

1906
01:17:28,694 --> 01:17:30,864
(He quickly grabs a spoon and chopsticks for Yu Jin.)

1907
01:17:33,104 --> 01:17:34,174
Thank you.

1908
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,143
Do you need help?

1909
01:17:37,144 --> 01:17:38,573
No. Please sit.

1910
01:17:38,574 --> 01:17:40,173
- You even cooked for me.
- Stay seated.

1911
01:17:40,174 --> 01:17:42,644
- Stay seated. It's fine.
- Stay seated. Come on.

1912
01:17:45,684 --> 01:17:47,384
The Christmas decoration.

1913
01:17:48,014 --> 01:17:50,384
Did you put up the balloons yourself?

1914
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:54,023
It looked awful without the decoration.

1915
01:17:54,024 --> 01:17:55,193
(Seo Jin's Christmas decoration for My Star)

1916
01:17:55,194 --> 01:17:57,264
Seo Jin did a great job today.

1917
01:17:57,624 --> 01:17:58,863
It looks delicious.

1918
01:17:58,864 --> 01:18:00,264
I did it today.

1919
01:18:01,064 --> 01:18:02,094
- Why?
- Sorry?

1920
01:18:02,434 --> 01:18:04,063
- I put them up for you.
- Really?

1921
01:18:04,064 --> 01:18:05,064
Yes.

1922
01:18:05,065 --> 01:18:06,673
- I put them up for you.
- Really?

1923
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:07,703
Yes.

1924
01:18:07,704 --> 01:18:08,873
- The Christmas tree and all.
- Thank you.

1925
01:18:08,874 --> 01:18:10,774
Right. It's so cute.

1926
01:18:11,344 --> 01:18:13,674
I thought Kwang Kyu had decorated his place cutely.

1927
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:15,413
He decorated the tree too.

1928
01:18:15,414 --> 01:18:16,883
(The drinks to go with the meal are ready as well.)

1929
01:18:16,884 --> 01:18:18,743
Is that lemon soju?

1930
01:18:18,744 --> 01:18:20,184
- What?
- Is that lemon soju?

1931
01:18:20,854 --> 01:18:22,583
Yu Jin, I heard this is your favorite alcohol.

1932
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:24,084
Yes. It's my favorite.

1933
01:18:24,154 --> 01:18:25,723
- Yu Jin, you worked hard today.
- Thank you.

1934
01:18:25,724 --> 01:18:28,423
- Great job, My Star.
- Thank you.

1935
01:18:28,424 --> 01:18:29,793
- It looks good.
- You did a great job today.

1936
01:18:29,794 --> 01:18:33,993
(My Star's 23rd Christmas...)

1937
01:18:33,994 --> 01:18:38,104
(with Grumpy Secretaries)

1938
01:18:38,204 --> 01:18:39,604
It seems it has a whole grapefruit in it.

1939
01:18:39,804 --> 01:18:41,973
- This is unexpected.
- It's a new product.

1940
01:18:41,974 --> 01:18:42,974
I see.

1941
01:18:42,975 --> 01:18:45,043
- They only had lemon flavor before.
- The grapefruit tastes...

1942
01:18:45,044 --> 01:18:46,944
(A drink after work puts them in a good mood.)

1943
01:18:48,774 --> 01:18:50,414
It suits Yu Jin.

1944
01:18:51,044 --> 01:18:52,744
How can you be this pretty?

1945
01:18:52,914 --> 01:18:55,084
How can you be this pretty?

1946
01:18:55,454 --> 01:18:57,684
(Steaming)

1947
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,223
All right. This is braised kimchi with ribs.

1948
01:18:59,224 --> 01:19:01,293
- Is it okay to put it on the table?
- It's okay.

1949
01:19:01,294 --> 01:19:02,294
Really?

1950
01:19:03,024 --> 01:19:04,363
It looks amazing.

1951
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,063
A whole head of kimchi.

1952
01:19:06,064 --> 01:19:07,193
It looks so good.

1953
01:19:07,194 --> 01:19:09,134
- You put a whole head of kimchi.
- Is this your mother's kimchi?

1954
01:19:09,464 --> 01:19:10,504
Yes.

1955
01:19:11,034 --> 01:19:12,863
Do you have uncut kimchi at home?

1956
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:13,903
I know.

1957
01:19:13,904 --> 01:19:16,204
(Carefully braised kimchi with ribs)

1958
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:17,403
Seasoned radish.

1959
01:19:17,404 --> 01:19:18,943
(Royal Chef Eom the Mom's refreshing seasoned radish)

1960
01:19:18,944 --> 01:19:21,814
Gangdoenjang, which is something I've never made before.

1961
01:19:22,374 --> 01:19:25,013
- Did you make gangdoenjang too?
- Of course.

1962
01:19:25,014 --> 01:19:26,113
- It's like mapo tofu.
- It looks amazing.

1963
01:19:26,114 --> 01:19:28,083
The food looks fantastic.

1964
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:29,414
- It does?
- Yes.

1965
01:19:29,554 --> 01:19:30,783
Food tastes amazing...

1966
01:19:30,784 --> 01:19:32,023
- after working hard.
- Exactly.

1967
01:19:32,024 --> 01:19:34,224
- But don't expect too much.
- Okay.

1968
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:36,454
- I'm not excited at all.
- Lower your expectations a bit.

1969
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:38,363
- It looks bad.
- Right.

1970
01:19:38,364 --> 01:19:40,394
- I'm not excited at all.
- Lower your expectations a bit.

1971
01:19:40,594 --> 01:19:42,363
- It looks bad.
- Right.

1972
01:19:42,364 --> 01:19:45,163
There you go. That's the attitude.

1973
01:19:45,164 --> 01:19:47,073
- There you go. That's the attitude.
- It looks bad.

1974
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:48,673
Which one should I eat first? This or this?

1975
01:19:48,674 --> 01:19:49,803
- You should try this 1st.
- This one 1st.

1976
01:19:49,804 --> 01:19:51,043
- This has a strong flavor. Yes.
- This is the main dish.

1977
01:19:51,044 --> 01:19:52,073
- Okay.
- Yes.

1978
01:19:52,074 --> 01:19:53,243
(After happily debating what to eat, she tries the braised ribs first.)

1979
01:19:53,244 --> 01:19:54,513
- I'm sorry, - I'm nervous.

1980
01:19:54,514 --> 01:19:55,814
but please get the one deeper in the broth.

1981
01:19:56,174 --> 01:19:57,643
- Deeper in the broth.
- No.

1982
01:19:57,644 --> 01:19:58,983
- It's fine.
- This one.

1983
01:19:58,984 --> 01:20:01,283
- Deeper in the broth. That's it.
- The cute one.

1984
01:20:01,284 --> 01:20:03,423
Let me get a piece of kimchi too.

1985
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:05,623
(A warm dinner after going 10 hours without food)

1986
01:20:05,624 --> 01:20:06,824
I feel nervous.

1987
01:20:14,234 --> 01:20:16,803
(Nervous)

1988
01:20:16,804 --> 01:20:18,964
Is it too hot? Eat it slowly if it's too hot.

1989
01:20:20,034 --> 01:20:24,144
(Mother Kwang Kyu takes care of her, as if she were his daughter.)

1990
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:27,413
- Is it cooked?
- Yes.

1991
01:20:27,414 --> 01:20:29,144
- Is it okay?
- Yes, it's good.

1992
01:20:29,814 --> 01:20:31,443
- Is it okay?
- Yes, it's good.

1993
01:20:31,444 --> 01:20:32,784
- Is this what you wanted?
- Yes.

1994
01:20:32,844 --> 01:20:34,984
I'm glad to hear that.

1995
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:36,514
It tastes really good.

1996
01:20:36,854 --> 01:20:38,823
- The meat is perfectly cooked.
- It is?

1997
01:20:38,824 --> 01:20:40,153
- It's a little spicy.
- I was worried.

1998
01:20:40,154 --> 01:20:41,423
Try it. It's really good.

1999
01:20:41,424 --> 01:20:43,393
- Fortunately, I can cook.
- Yes.

2000
01:20:43,394 --> 01:20:45,324
I like spicy food.

2001
01:20:45,524 --> 01:20:46,594
I love it.

2002
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:48,134
I absolutely love it.

2003
01:20:49,294 --> 01:20:51,434
- I absolutely love it.
- You do? Oh, my gosh.

2004
01:20:52,004 --> 01:20:53,533
It's amazing.

2005
01:20:53,534 --> 01:20:55,404
Please add some sparkling effect.

2006
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:56,804
It tastes so good.

2007
01:20:56,904 --> 01:20:58,103
You're amazing at cooking.

2008
01:20:58,104 --> 01:21:01,014
How can your first attempt turn out so well?

2009
01:21:01,244 --> 01:21:04,043
- I'm not bad at cooking.
- It's...

2010
01:21:04,044 --> 01:21:05,144
(The braised kimchi with ribs turned out great.)

2011
01:21:05,984 --> 01:21:07,014
Next.

2012
01:21:08,014 --> 01:21:10,324
- You should mix it with rice.
- Yes.

2013
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:12,324
With seasoned radish...

2014
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:13,924
and dried laver.

2015
01:21:14,524 --> 01:21:16,593
Where did you find the recipe?

2016
01:21:16,594 --> 01:21:17,893
On YouTube.

2017
01:21:17,894 --> 01:21:20,663
I looked it up and dozens of recipes showed up.

2018
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:22,533
(Making a wrap with a piece of aged kimchi)

2019
01:21:22,534 --> 01:21:23,834
It looks delicious.

2020
01:21:24,464 --> 01:21:27,333
- Do you eat it as a set like that?
- Yes. Like this.

2021
01:21:27,334 --> 01:21:28,473
(Amazed)

2022
01:21:28,474 --> 01:21:30,574
- The standard of homemade food.
- Totally homemade food style.

2023
01:21:31,004 --> 01:21:32,504
Thank goodness the meat is cooked.

2024
01:21:32,774 --> 01:21:34,813
Meat should be boiled in water first.

2025
01:21:34,814 --> 01:21:35,874
(The gangdoenjang ssam is also good.)

2026
01:21:36,644 --> 01:21:38,014
I'm sorry, darling.

2027
01:21:38,544 --> 01:21:40,653
Great job, okay?

2028
01:21:40,654 --> 01:21:42,184
(Having homemade food on Christmas)

2029
01:21:42,554 --> 01:21:43,584
About what?

2030
01:21:44,254 --> 01:21:47,824
(Gnawing the meat off thoroughly)

2031
01:21:48,024 --> 01:21:51,823
(Royal Chef Eom the Mom is relieved.)

2032
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,494
Before going on tour,

2033
01:21:53,934 --> 01:21:56,493
I always have homemade food at home.

2034
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:58,633
Delivery food has that...

2035
01:21:58,634 --> 01:22:00,063
No, delivery food is missing...

2036
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,533
- that satisfying taste.
- Well...

2037
01:22:01,534 --> 01:22:02,834
- She is...
- It has to be homemade food.

2038
01:22:03,474 --> 01:22:05,573
(Eating)

2039
01:22:05,574 --> 01:22:06,943
Why speak in Japanese?

2040
01:22:06,944 --> 01:22:08,314
- She's on a show.
- It's a Japanese show.

2041
01:22:09,214 --> 01:22:12,583
(My Star is digging in as if it were a meal with her parents.)

2042
01:22:12,584 --> 01:22:15,984
(My Star is digging in as if it were a meal with her parents.)

2043
01:22:18,154 --> 01:22:19,754
- It's salty.
- Right?

2044
01:22:20,084 --> 01:22:21,994
I'm sorry, darling.

2045
01:22:22,594 --> 01:22:24,324
(Glaring)

2046
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:25,594
I'm sorry, darling.

2047
01:22:27,964 --> 01:22:29,364
I tried to do my best.

2048
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:33,364
Do you know how much he nagged at me for using the spicy chili powder?

2049
01:22:33,404 --> 01:22:35,974
You two were like an old couple who have lived together for years.

2050
01:22:37,104 --> 01:22:38,773
That's what I think too.

2051
01:22:38,774 --> 01:22:41,073
(That's what I think too.)

2052
01:22:41,074 --> 01:22:42,413
As long as we don't live together.

2053
01:22:42,414 --> 01:22:43,883
(Me too.)

2054
01:22:43,884 --> 01:22:45,283
I don't care about us being a couple...

2055
01:22:45,284 --> 01:22:46,584
as long as we don't live together.

2056
01:22:47,584 --> 01:22:49,483
Your dad is a real bully.

2057
01:22:49,484 --> 01:22:51,653
Dad must've really nagged at you.

2058
01:22:51,654 --> 01:22:52,724
Yes.

2059
01:22:52,824 --> 01:22:54,223
(A cheerful and chatty family full of love)

2060
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:55,294
Eat slowly.

2061
01:22:56,124 --> 01:22:58,464
What work do you have left for this year?

2062
01:22:58,494 --> 01:23:01,664
In a few days, I'm going to Japan and greet the New Year there.

2063
01:23:02,364 --> 01:23:03,804
Are you done with domestic work?

2064
01:23:03,904 --> 01:23:05,063
Domestic-wise, yes.

2065
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:06,233
That's a relief.

2066
01:23:06,234 --> 01:23:07,704
Only a meet-and-greet is left.

2067
01:23:07,934 --> 01:23:09,674
- I see.
- After that, I leave.

2068
01:23:10,074 --> 01:23:11,373
Are you popular among school kids?

2069
01:23:11,374 --> 01:23:13,473
Yes, we have many elementary school fans.

2070
01:23:13,474 --> 01:23:14,573
How come?

2071
01:23:14,574 --> 01:23:17,414
When we go to do a concert...

2072
01:23:18,044 --> 01:23:19,284
Are there school kids?

2073
01:23:19,344 --> 01:23:20,413
It's packed with them.

2074
01:23:20,414 --> 01:23:23,084
The elementary school fans answer with baby-like voices.

2075
01:23:23,554 --> 01:23:25,383
For example, if I asked, "Right?"

2076
01:23:25,384 --> 01:23:26,854
They'd be like, "Yes!"

2077
01:23:27,694 --> 01:23:28,923
(The viral concert video)

2078
01:23:28,924 --> 01:23:30,393
The stage was all blue, right?

2079
01:23:30,394 --> 01:23:31,594
- Yes!
- Yes!

2080
01:23:31,824 --> 01:23:34,363
Correct. Who just answered it?

2081
01:23:34,364 --> 01:23:35,394
- Me!
- Me!

2082
01:23:35,434 --> 01:23:36,933
I asked, "Who just answered it?"

2083
01:23:36,934 --> 01:23:39,563
And everyone was like, "Me!" Cute, right?

2084
01:23:39,564 --> 01:23:41,934
- I could tell from today.
- Tell what?

2085
01:23:43,074 --> 01:23:45,403
Fierce girl groups may be a little too scary...

2086
01:23:45,404 --> 01:23:47,973
for elementary school kids to like.

2087
01:23:47,974 --> 01:23:50,944
But IVE is mild and princess-like.

2088
01:23:51,344 --> 01:23:52,913
It's easy on the eyes for those kids...

2089
01:23:52,914 --> 01:23:54,714
and for us adults too.

2090
01:23:55,054 --> 01:23:56,153
Imagine how happy you'd be...

2091
01:23:56,154 --> 01:23:57,654
- with a daughter like her.
- I know, right?

2092
01:23:58,124 --> 01:23:59,853
- You'd be proud.
- Of course.

2093
01:23:59,854 --> 01:24:02,323
(My Star is motivating Seo Genie to get married.)

2094
01:24:02,324 --> 01:24:03,454
Do you want more rice?

2095
01:24:03,924 --> 01:24:05,093
No, I'm happy with how full I am.

2096
01:24:05,094 --> 01:24:06,193
- Good.
- I dug in like crazy.

2097
01:24:06,194 --> 01:24:07,663
- You did?
- Hey.

2098
01:24:07,664 --> 01:24:08,693
(Covering them up)

2099
01:24:08,694 --> 01:24:09,793
She really dug in.

2100
01:24:09,794 --> 01:24:11,763
When did you eat all of that...

2101
01:24:11,764 --> 01:24:12,904
while chatting with us?

2102
01:24:13,164 --> 01:24:15,834
You're incredible.

2103
01:24:16,534 --> 01:24:18,204
- I feel great.
- Yes.

2104
01:24:19,144 --> 01:24:20,473
(My Daughter has had a hearty meal.)

2105
01:24:20,474 --> 01:24:22,214
That was an amazing meal.

2106
01:24:23,609 --> 01:24:26,079
I've been wanting to ask, starting with Uncle Kwang Kyu.

2107
01:24:26,439 --> 01:24:28,279
You know how people...

2108
01:24:28,879 --> 01:24:32,379
constantly tease you about your hair?

2109
01:24:32,449 --> 01:24:35,149
I wanted to know if it's ever hurt you.

2110
01:24:35,249 --> 01:24:36,418
- Me?
- Yes.

2111
01:24:36,419 --> 01:24:39,318
People tease you by saying...

2112
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:41,729
your head is shining...

2113
01:24:41,829 --> 01:24:43,489
and things like that.

2114
01:24:43,959 --> 01:24:45,828
Have you really never been upset by it?

2115
01:24:45,829 --> 01:24:48,168
There was a time when I was.

2116
01:24:48,169 --> 01:24:50,639
But my favorite idiom is...

2117
01:24:50,839 --> 01:24:52,499
"a blessing in disguise."

2118
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,238
When I thought about it objectively,

2119
01:24:55,239 --> 01:24:56,508
that was actually...

2120
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:58,308
what boosted my career...

2121
01:24:58,309 --> 01:24:59,638
during a difficult time.

2122
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:02,449
It helped me land my first commercial.

2123
01:25:02,979 --> 01:25:07,888
(He started shooting commercials thanks to his hair loss.)

2124
01:25:07,889 --> 01:25:11,058
(He started shooting commercials thanks to his hair loss.)

2125
01:25:11,059 --> 01:25:12,788
If I held back once,

2126
01:25:12,789 --> 01:25:15,058
many people loved it.

2127
01:25:15,059 --> 01:25:16,629
That made me happy.

2128
01:25:17,929 --> 01:25:19,928
With that, I changed my way of thinking.

2129
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:21,629
Not many actors leave...

2130
01:25:21,969 --> 01:25:24,639
their hair as Kwang Kyu does.

2131
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:26,469
- Normally, they shave the hair off.
- True.

2132
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:29,508
But with his hair loss, Kwang Kyu...

2133
01:25:29,509 --> 01:25:30,978
(The secret behind the hair loss success)

2134
01:25:30,979 --> 01:25:32,579
- Taking the single path.
- Correct.

2135
01:25:32,739 --> 01:25:34,609
He's the one and only in Korea.

2136
01:25:34,809 --> 01:25:36,949
- That itself is extraordinary.
- Right?

2137
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,548
Here's what I always tell Kwang Kyu.

2138
01:25:39,549 --> 01:25:42,849
"The hair loss is what's helping you..."

2139
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:44,588
"make a living."

2140
01:25:44,589 --> 01:25:46,658
(The hair loss is what's helping you make a living.)

2141
01:25:46,659 --> 01:25:48,688
Don't you get hurt by words like those?

2142
01:25:48,689 --> 01:25:49,689
- Not one bit.
- Really?

2143
01:25:49,690 --> 01:25:50,698
It's the truth.

2144
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:52,699
I never lie.

2145
01:25:52,799 --> 01:25:55,729
- You two really bicker a lot.
- What?

2146
01:25:56,129 --> 01:25:59,099
Despite it, Kwang Kyu just goes with the flow.

2147
01:25:59,569 --> 01:26:01,369
He's stronger than I am.

2148
01:26:01,509 --> 01:26:02,709
He's also wealthier than me.

2149
01:26:03,339 --> 01:26:06,438
(All questions about Kwang Kyu have been answered.)

2150
01:26:06,439 --> 01:26:08,009
- Uncle Seo Jin.
- Yes?

2151
01:26:08,109 --> 01:26:10,748
You're known to be extremely stingy.

2152
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:12,218
- Yes.
- For real?

2153
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:14,448
I'm very frugal about...

2154
01:26:14,449 --> 01:26:16,689
- the monthly payments.
- I see.

2155
01:26:16,889 --> 01:26:19,058
Even with YouTube, I don't pay money to use it.

2156
01:26:19,059 --> 01:26:20,188
- No premium?
- No.

2157
01:26:20,189 --> 01:26:21,889
- You watch the commercials?
- I do.

2158
01:26:23,389 --> 01:26:27,828
(Impressed)

2159
01:26:27,829 --> 01:26:29,998
I save up when it comes to electricity bills.

2160
01:26:29,999 --> 01:26:31,338
How much did you pay for heating?

2161
01:26:31,339 --> 01:26:32,468
It's been really cold recently.

2162
01:26:32,469 --> 01:26:34,138
How much did you pay last month?

2163
01:26:34,139 --> 01:26:36,208
I left on December 3...

2164
01:26:36,209 --> 01:26:37,278
- and was abroad for two weeks.
- Okay.

2165
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:39,078
Before that, I didn't turn the heating on.

2166
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:40,849
(Before that, I didn't turn the heating on.)

2167
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:42,978
- Really?
- "I shall endure it until I leave."

2168
01:26:42,979 --> 01:26:44,078
My gosh.

2169
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:45,079
(Paid 0 dollars on heating last month)

2170
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,648
And the houses above and below me.

2171
01:26:46,649 --> 01:26:48,248
I hold out on the heating from those two houses.

2172
01:26:48,249 --> 01:26:50,189
(I hold out on the heating from those two houses.)

2173
01:26:50,389 --> 01:26:53,828
(A new concept, heating between houses)

2174
01:26:53,829 --> 01:26:55,288
- Heating between houses?
- Yes.

2175
01:26:55,289 --> 01:26:56,388
- Heating between houses.
- Correct.

2176
01:26:56,389 --> 01:26:58,299
That sort of makes my house warm.

2177
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:01,599
- I went over a few times.
- I see.

2178
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:03,369
His place is like Siberia.

2179
01:27:04,269 --> 01:27:06,169
It's so cold, far from what I prefer.

2180
01:27:06,299 --> 01:27:07,968
- Visiting him in winter is a no.
- That's what he's like.

2181
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:09,109
Listen.

2182
01:27:09,269 --> 01:27:11,379
It's not like I'm being frugal on purpose.

2183
01:27:11,739 --> 01:27:14,308
Think of it as a way of life...

2184
01:27:14,309 --> 01:27:15,779
that runs in the family.

2185
01:27:16,779 --> 01:27:18,649
At home,

2186
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,278
I normally only have one light on.

2187
01:27:20,279 --> 01:27:22,348
(At home, I normally only have one light on.)

2188
01:27:22,349 --> 01:27:25,059
I get so annoyed when I'm over at his house.

2189
01:27:25,519 --> 01:27:26,718
- I see.
- At Seo Jin's...

2190
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:28,888
Even when Kwang Kyu comes over for drinks at times,

2191
01:27:28,889 --> 01:27:30,698
I only have one light on.

2192
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:32,359
- I go home because I feel so cold.
- It must get cold.

2193
01:27:32,599 --> 01:27:33,628
- The cold makes me leave.
- Right.

2194
01:27:33,629 --> 01:27:35,968
- It's cold with only one light on.
- Yes.

2195
01:27:35,969 --> 01:27:37,268
(Laughing)

2196
01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:38,438
Either way,

2197
01:27:38,439 --> 01:27:40,339
I spend money on things I want to,

2198
01:27:40,439 --> 01:27:41,638
and save on areas I can save.

2199
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:43,709
I have a clear standard on it.

2200
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:45,439
- Here's what I really want to know.
- Okay.

2201
01:27:45,509 --> 01:27:48,878
It's not a question just for Seo Jin.

2202
01:27:48,879 --> 01:27:50,078
(Struck with a real dilemma)

2203
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:51,148
It's for both of you,

2204
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:52,578
as people with more life experience...

2205
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:53,918
and my uncles.

2206
01:27:53,919 --> 01:27:56,189
My manager got married not too long ago.

2207
01:27:56,449 --> 01:27:57,988
Unfortunately, IVE couldn't attend...

2208
01:27:57,989 --> 01:28:01,959
his wedding because we had an overseas schedule.

2209
01:28:02,189 --> 01:28:05,158
I have no idea how much congratulatory money to give...

2210
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:06,499
in such a situation.

2211
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:08,698
We've been working together for quite a long time.

2212
01:28:08,699 --> 01:28:09,768
How long?

2213
01:28:09,769 --> 01:28:10,798
(With your manager)

2214
01:28:10,799 --> 01:28:13,909
It's been about 2 to 3 years.

2215
01:28:14,309 --> 01:28:16,769
We'd love to show our appreciation and congratulations.

2216
01:28:17,139 --> 01:28:19,178
But how much wouldn't...

2217
01:28:19,179 --> 01:28:20,978
put pressure on either party...

2218
01:28:20,979 --> 01:28:22,978
while expressing...

2219
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:24,749
our gratitude and congratulations?

2220
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:27,648
If you're stuck, text me. I'll tell you.

2221
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:28,888
- Like how much?
- Ask me how much,

2222
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:30,659
- and I'll set the amount for you.
- A consult.

2223
01:28:30,689 --> 01:28:31,959
- A congratulatory money consult.
- Do it now.

2224
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:33,418
(The generous-by-occasion Seo Genie's...)

2225
01:28:33,419 --> 01:28:34,758
(congratulatory money consult)

2226
01:28:34,759 --> 01:28:36,528
- A congratulatory money consult.
- Do it now.

2227
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:38,359
- Set it for her now.
- You see,

2228
01:28:38,529 --> 01:28:40,998
- relationships differ for everyone.
- If...

2229
01:28:40,999 --> 01:28:42,568
Say that Kwang Kyu gets married.

2230
01:28:42,569 --> 01:28:44,238
- I've been wanting to ask.
- Okay.

2231
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,299
If Kwang Kyu were to marry, how much would you pay?

2232
01:28:47,169 --> 01:28:48,838
- How much...
- A lot.

2233
01:28:48,839 --> 01:28:50,009
(A lot.)

2234
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:51,638
How much?

2235
01:28:51,639 --> 01:28:54,048
(Let's hear it.)

2236
01:28:54,049 --> 01:28:55,179
How much?

2237
01:28:57,319 --> 01:28:59,618
I'd pay enough that he'd be in the top three.

2238
01:28:59,619 --> 01:29:01,048
(I'd pay enough that he'd be in the top 3.)

2239
01:29:01,049 --> 01:29:02,088
No?

2240
01:29:02,089 --> 01:29:04,119
I'd pay enough that he'd be in the top three.

2241
01:29:05,519 --> 01:29:07,728
No? He'd be in the top three.

2242
01:29:07,729 --> 01:29:09,528
I'll confirm it with news reports.

2243
01:29:09,529 --> 01:29:10,859
(To be continued...)

2244
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,309
Thank you for spending the day with me.

2245
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:15,920
I'm sure you didn't want to work on Christmas.

2246
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:17,950
- I actually prefer it.
- It...

2247
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:19,219
We've got nothing to do.

2248
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:22,259
But still, Christmas is a holiday. It's best to get some rest.

2249
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,759
We didn't even know...

2250
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,229
- Christmas was a holiday.
- Exactly.

2251
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,929
You're our Christmas present, Yu Jin.

2252
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:29,229
- But still, thank you.
- I'm serious.

2253
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,400
Thank you.

2254
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,240
(Returning the kindness with a Christmas carol)

2255
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:43,950
(Happy New Year, 2026!)

2256
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:46,950
Little did I expect to spend Christmas...

2257
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:49,979
with you two.

2258
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,219
- Let's apologize.
- We apologize.

2259
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:52,920
- No, it was fun.
- I'm sorry.

2260
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:54,960
- Was it fun?
- Totally.

2261
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,290
(How was it with My Star?)

2262
01:29:56,291 --> 01:29:57,330
Every time I saw her,

2263
01:29:58,230 --> 01:30:01,000
I thought, "Yu Jin, who ate my braised ribs, is doing a great job."

2264
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:03,059
I will watch her with a loving heart,

2265
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,670
like she's my daughter.

2266
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,330
Yu Jin is...

2267
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,270
just cute, like she's my niece.

2268
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,509
It's just like watching my niece.

2269
01:30:12,510 --> 01:30:13,510
And...

2270
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,779
I treat my niece very dearly...

2271
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,650
because I adore her.

2272
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:19,409
I want to treat Yu Jin the same.

2273
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,919
What's more, wouldn't a dad be very proud...

2274
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:23,850
if his daughter became successful like her?

2275
01:30:24,220 --> 01:30:25,549
(If you were to grade the Grumpy Secretary)

2276
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:28,190
When it comes to fun, full marks.

2277
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,990
But when it comes to work alone,

2278
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:35,130
we won't see each other again.

2279
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,939
First off, if I were to attend the Gayo Daejeon next year,

2280
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,340
I'd be reminded of them.

2281
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:46,069
"Last year,"

2282
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:48,779
"they treated me to food and packed me water."

2283
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:50,339
"I recall us having such a conversation."

2284
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,909
I'll really miss it.

2285
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:56,020
For real, it was a Christmas I'd never experience again.

2286
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:58,650
I mean it in a good way.

2287
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,520
(For 50 to 60 years)

2288
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:04,829
(Nam Jin, the Eternal Crush)

2289
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:07,399
(It's a fate connected by someone.)

2290
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:10,359
(Let's check out our old photos.)

2291
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,469
(The teenage girl fans,)

2292
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:15,269
(even after entering their 70s,)

2293
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:19,809
(are still with Nam Jin.)

2294
01:31:19,810 --> 01:31:22,479
(60th Anniversary Nationwide Tour Concert)

2295
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,479
(The Grumpy Secretary is off to take care of him.)

2296
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:29,879
(Boxed lunches prepped for My Star by the fans for 30 years)

2297
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,949
(How did you feel after seeing the boxed lunches?)

2298
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:33,490
We're having some hearty meals today.

2299
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:37,019
(Eating)

2300
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:39,089
(Getting caught eating nonstop)

2301
01:31:39,090 --> 01:31:41,829
(Take care of Nam Jin as much as they've eaten)

2302
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,200
(Everyone came prepared for the concert, right?)

2303
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,529
(Tapping)

2304
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:46,899
(- Go ahead, Kwang Kyu.
- Do what?)

2305
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:48,070
Just continue. Do something.

2306
01:31:48,240 --> 01:31:50,199
(Even with the bickering Grumpy Secretary,)

2307
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,270
(Nam Jin is simply happy.)

2308
01:31:53,140 --> 01:31:54,739
(The strong mentality behind My Star)

2309
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:57,179
(A bomb landed right next to me while I was having a meal.)

2310
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,109
(My left leg is weak.)

2311
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,510
(He was stabbed with a knife.)

2312
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:01,779
It was about...

2313
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:03,850
(A born cool guy)

2314
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:08,059
(Sung by the cool guy My Star,)

2315
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:13,260
(a song full of intense emotions)

2316
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:16,559
I cried the most when I didn't have money to go to the hospital.

2317
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:22,170
(My Grumpy Secretary at 11:10pm on Friday nights)
