1
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:13,490
(This program contains indirect advertisements.)

2
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,890
(My Grumpy Secretary)

3
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:20,577
(My Star awaits at the Gimpo International Airport.)

4
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:23,446
- My Star is already here.
- Let's go.

5
00:00:23,447 --> 00:00:26,477
(The Grumpy Secretaries go to meet My Star.)

6
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:29,147
(The dimples are ready.)

7
00:00:29,247 --> 00:00:30,916
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

8
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:33,586
- Hello. Long time no see.
- Goodness.

9
00:00:33,587 --> 00:00:35,326
- Hello.
- Hello.

10
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:36,687
(Does Kwang Kyu know today's My Star?)

11
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:39,956
(Today's My Star is Ahn Eun Jin.)

12
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,027
It's nice to see you.

13
00:00:41,227 --> 00:00:42,527
You asked me.

14
00:00:43,937 --> 00:00:47,706
(From historical dramas to fantasy, )

15
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:51,437
(she's the hottest star in every genre.)

16
00:00:53,307 --> 00:00:59,977
(With "Dynamite Kiss," she's taking on the role of a rom-com goddess.)

17
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:02,416
Goodness.

18
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:04,217
- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:05,916
It's nice to see you.

20
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,186
- Long time no see.
- It's been so long.

21
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:09,157
- Long time no see.
- Have you been well?

22
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:12,427
(Are they very close?)

23
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:15,266
How long has it been? Has it been about seven years?

24
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:17,496
- It's been ages.
- For real.

25
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:19,066
We never ran into each other since then.

26
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,307
I know.

27
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:23,237
Perhaps it was done deliberately?

28
00:01:26,007 --> 00:01:28,276
- Hello.
- I am her manager,

29
00:01:28,277 --> 00:01:29,647
Heo Jeong Mun.

30
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:32,317
Here's her schedule for the day.

31
00:01:32,617 --> 00:01:33,646
Okay.

32
00:01:33,647 --> 00:01:35,246
(What's My Star's schedule like?)

33
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,786
What's going to happen today?

34
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:37,917
There's nothing too special.

35
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:40,016
(Is her schedule clear?)

36
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,287
You don't have a drama shoot today, do you?

37
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:44,297
I don't. I have one tomorrow.

38
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:47,026
The call time is too early, so we're going there the day before.

39
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:48,967
Why are we here today when the shoot is tomorrow?

40
00:01:49,327 --> 00:01:52,097
We can't take the first flight tomorrow.

41
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:54,007
So we have to fly in today and spend the night there.

42
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:56,436
- And get ready.
- Since it's Jeju Island.

43
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:58,676
You are getting your hair and makeup done at 4:40am?

44
00:01:58,677 --> 00:02:01,677
Yes. The shoot begins with the sunrise.

45
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,007
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

46
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:04,347
Guys, the shoot tomorrow...

47
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:06,777
begins at sunrise.

48
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:10,287
- It's 4:40am?
- It takes a long time to get ready.

49
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:11,516
It takes a long time.

50
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:13,087
- It takes an hour.
- An hour.

51
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,387
- And I move to the location.
- The shoot begins at 6:20am?

52
00:02:15,887 --> 00:02:17,696
- That's my estimate.
- Right.

53
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:20,127
We will have to wait and see what the crew decides.

54
00:02:20,427 --> 00:02:22,297
It might rain tomorrow.

55
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,196
(When it rains, the schedule might fluctuate.)

56
00:02:25,197 --> 00:02:27,937
The shoot might even get called off.

57
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:30,407
- That would be sad.
- Right.

58
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:32,306
You can get a good rest.

59
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:33,677
You look very happy.

60
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,076
Here's something to remember.

61
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:37,647
- There is?
- I've got a corporate card here.

62
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:40,987
- Make sure to collect receipts.
- You heard that, right? Receipts.

63
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:43,046
- Last time, we forgot the receipt.
- I know.

64
00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:44,117
We got yelled at for it.

65
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:46,256
Do you want to keep it?

66
00:02:46,257 --> 00:02:47,387
(Corporate card)

67
00:02:47,657 --> 00:02:49,326
Okay.

68
00:02:49,327 --> 00:02:51,596
Anyway, please take good care of her today.

69
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:54,097
There's a fly on your head.

70
00:02:54,297 --> 00:02:55,427
A fly?

71
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:57,967
Wait.

72
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,506
(He was only catching a fly.)

73
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:01,707
- It's gone.
- Wait.

74
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:05,437
- I'm sorry. I should've ignored it.
- No.

75
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:08,147
You're fine.

76
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:11,576
- Why would the fly... Gosh.
- It slipped.

77
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:12,977
Hey!

78
00:03:13,147 --> 00:03:15,647
- There's a fly here too. Why...
- It slipped.

79
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,087
All right.

80
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:19,357
How long will you be staying on Jeju Island?

81
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,556
I will be there for 2 nights and 3 days.

82
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:21,687
Why do you have so much stuff?

83
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:23,826
Well... It's...

84
00:03:23,827 --> 00:03:25,296
(Passing it naturally)

85
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:27,026
I usually travel light,

86
00:03:27,027 --> 00:03:28,697
but for this show...

87
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:30,737
- You prepared something?
- I prepared some things.

88
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,597
I am the type who plans and prepares.

89
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:37,436
Are you okay with doing whatever I ask you to do?

90
00:03:37,437 --> 00:03:39,307
- Of course.
- Really?

91
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,707
Seo Jin here listens to actresses well.

92
00:03:43,247 --> 00:03:47,247
- Can I say whatever I want then?
- Go ahead.

93
00:03:48,147 --> 00:03:50,886
(I will do whatever My Star wants.)

94
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:52,057
- Really?
- Of course.

95
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:55,357
Let's go diving then.

96
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:57,227
- Diving?
- Yes.

97
00:03:58,627 --> 00:03:59,997
You're good.

98
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,526
I will hold it for you.

99
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,166
No, it's a must-have for a manager.

100
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,436
- All right.
- It's fine.

101
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,037
Think of me as your manager.

102
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:10,776
It's fun when you ask us to do a lot of things.

103
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:14,007
Ask Seo Jin to do a lot.

104
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:15,376
- And...
- Is the shoot...

105
00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:16,447
mostly happening on Jeju Island?

106
00:04:16,677 --> 00:04:18,276
No, we went there once in the early phase,

107
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:19,847
and we're going back again for the last time.

108
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:21,247
What's the title of the drama?

109
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:23,447
- "Dynamite Kiss." - Kiss...

110
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:25,786
- "Dynamite Kiss." - Kiss...

111
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,957
(Kiss?)

112
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:31,426
I guess the romance begins after a kiss?

113
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:32,827
I guess you kiss in the first episode then.

114
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:35,067
- Yes, in the first episode.
- It must begin with a kiss.

115
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:37,397
We kiss a lot in the drama.

116
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:39,967
It's a dopamine overload.

117
00:04:41,467 --> 00:04:43,507
- That's the story.
- I am jealous.

118
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:45,906
- You've never done a kissing scene?
- Never.

119
00:04:45,907 --> 00:04:47,006
- Really?
- Yes.

120
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:48,447
- No kissing scene?
- No.

121
00:04:48,677 --> 00:04:50,647
I've never experienced it.

122
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:52,947
I've never experienced it.

123
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,687
I heard we are taking Asiana Airlines.

124
00:04:56,787 --> 00:04:59,157
- Asiana Airlines.
- There it is.

125
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,087
- Counter 51 to 61.
- Wait.

126
00:05:01,187 --> 00:05:02,826
(I should be the one guiding her.)

127
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:05,857
- It's here.
- Shouldn't we have the tickets?

128
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,096
- This is where we get the tickets.
- Is that right?

129
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,127
(Is that right?)

130
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,396
- They will give you a ticket...
- Really?

131
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:13,807
- Will they?
- and load your bag.

132
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:16,007
This way, please.

133
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,106
Wait. I should be leading you.

134
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,176
You brought your ID, right?

135
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,377
I brought my ID.

136
00:05:22,507 --> 00:05:23,576
There you go.

137
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:25,946
(As always, My Star takes care of the Grumpy Secretaries.)

138
00:05:25,947 --> 00:05:27,546
- Hello.
- Hello.

139
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:28,647
We're going to Jeju Island.

140
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:31,587
- Can I have your ID, please?
- Yes.

141
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:35,357
Let's go.

142
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:39,657
- I think you two make a great team.
- What?

143
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,396
You two are a great team.

144
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,967
- But one person suffers.
- That's...

145
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,066
One person has to sacrifice himself.

146
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:47,167
He's....

147
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:48,207
(Rummaging through his pockets)

148
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,806
(Rummaging through his pockets)

149
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,977
(Flustered)

150
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,816
Did you lose something? Did you?

151
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,016
- Are you okay?
- Hold this.

152
00:05:59,017 --> 00:06:00,346
- What is it?
- Where is the corporate card?

153
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:01,347
What?

154
00:06:02,887 --> 00:06:04,486
- The corporate card.
- The corporate card?

155
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:06,787
- Wasn't it stuck here?
- I took it out.

156
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:08,156
Did you really?

157
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:10,056
- You put it in your pocket.
- I did. And it's gone.

158
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:12,226
(He received it well...)

159
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:14,897
(and put it straight into his pocket.)

160
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:17,696
- You put it in your pocket.
- I did. And it's gone.

161
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:18,766
What?

162
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:21,337
(It's gone.)

163
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,137
- When did you use it last?
- I didn't use it.

164
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,136
- You put it in your pocket.
- Did it fall out of my pocket...

165
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,647
when I was taking something out?

166
00:06:27,947 --> 00:06:28,977
When you were taking something out?

167
00:06:29,377 --> 00:06:31,576
- Or perhaps you have it?
- He didn't give it to me.

168
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,076
- Really?
- A while ago...

169
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:35,016
(They lost My Star's corporate card!)

170
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:36,046
Is this where you lost it?

171
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,117
(This has never happened before.)

172
00:06:37,657 --> 00:06:42,157
(They only have 30 minutes until the boarding time.)

173
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:43,897
Should we ask?

174
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:46,796
(Worried)

175
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:49,527
(Anxious)

176
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,166
There it is.

177
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:53,167
No way.

178
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:57,137
(Fortunately, she spotted the card!)

179
00:06:57,807 --> 00:06:59,276
- Bye.
- Hey.

180
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:00,506
Gosh.

181
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,906
- Why are you so surprised?
- I'm glad we found it now.

182
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:03,446
If you can't trust yourself with it, just give it to me.

183
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:05,447
- Should I keep it?
- No.

184
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,146
We acted quickly and found it.

185
00:07:08,147 --> 00:07:09,147
(Talking louder for no reason)

186
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:11,457
(Relieved)

187
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,687
You were really flustered there.

188
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:16,756
You should tell the truth.

189
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:17,757
(He's not around, is he?)

190
00:07:17,857 --> 00:07:19,026
This idiot is...

191
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,626
(He can't spit it out.)

192
00:07:20,627 --> 00:07:21,697
I saw it.

193
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:23,896
I saw his face right in front of him.

194
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:24,967
He was flustered.

195
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,607
I had never seen him so flustered.

196
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,337
He was totally panicking.

197
00:07:30,637 --> 00:07:32,307
I realised he panics too.

198
00:07:33,207 --> 00:07:35,707
If I did that, he would've cursed at me like crazy.

199
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,746
(Checking again)

200
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:38,977
Why do you keep checking if he's around?

201
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:42,287
I lost it, but I found it right back, so it doesn't matter.

202
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:44,217
But he never finds what he loses. That's his problem.

203
00:07:46,517 --> 00:07:48,387
I wondered if it's safe...

204
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:49,626
for me to trust you two today.

205
00:07:49,627 --> 00:07:51,196
You need something like this at the start...

206
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:53,497
- to build that tension. Yes.
- Right.

207
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:55,666
I got so tense that my palms sweated a little.

208
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,766
You can just report the missing card...

209
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:00,067
- and get a new card anyway.
- True.

210
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:03,137
(He's right.)

211
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:05,576
I think it's going to be an eventful day today.

212
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:06,607
(My Star is worried about today.)

213
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:09,977
- Do you want coffee?
- Let's get something to drink.

214
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:12,676
We need to test it, so buy a bottle of water.

215
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:13,716
- A bottle of water?
- Yes.

216
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,547
- We will try punching the hole.
- Bottled water. Right.

217
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:19,816
Did you prepare the hole puncher to put a straw through the cap?

218
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,057
- You are an actress after all.
- Goodness.

219
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,256
- So the makeup won't come off.
- Of course.

220
00:08:23,257 --> 00:08:24,527
- To preserve the makeup.
- Thank you so much.

221
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:25,926
What would you like to drink?

222
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:27,797
- I...
- Do you like the...

223
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:31,137
Do you please...

224
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:32,466
- Please...
- Drinks?

225
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,166
(Laughing)

226
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,336
What is that?

227
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:36,537
You?

228
00:08:36,867 --> 00:08:38,276
Water. Just get me water.

229
00:08:38,277 --> 00:08:39,837
- I only drink water, you know.
- Okay.

230
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:44,577
(Run, Secretary Kwang!)

231
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,387
Where is the convenience store?

232
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:51,217
How long has it been since you made your debut?

233
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:53,917
Since you started acting?

234
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:57,896
I debuted around 2018...

235
00:08:57,897 --> 00:09:00,197
through "Kingdom."

236
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,327
- "Kingdom." - Yes. Kim Eun Hee's work.

237
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,466
At the very start of my career,

238
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,967
I acted in "Diary of a Prosecutor" with Kwang Kyu.

239
00:09:08,837 --> 00:09:10,006
I sent a food truck there.

240
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,176
- Did you?
- Yes.

241
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:12,736
(Kwang Kyu wearing a wig took a photo of it.)

242
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:14,347
Sun Kyun was in it too,

243
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:15,706
so I sent the food truck.

244
00:09:15,707 --> 00:09:17,816
It was almost the first time I was playing...

245
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:20,246
a minor role that had a bit of a character.

246
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:22,417
I think it was my second time playing such a role.

247
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:23,916
Your role must have been bigger than Kwang Kyu's role.

248
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:25,556
- No, it was smaller.
- Smaller than Kwang Kyu's role?

249
00:09:25,557 --> 00:09:27,457
It was.

250
00:09:27,657 --> 00:09:29,987
- Do you want a receipt?
- Yes, I must have it.

251
00:09:30,797 --> 00:09:32,456
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

252
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:33,457
(Receipt is a big deal for the manager.)

253
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:36,596
- Right. It's there.
- Across it.

254
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:37,667
Right.

255
00:09:38,097 --> 00:09:40,167
- Thank you.
- Kwang Kyu, punch the hole.

256
00:09:40,637 --> 00:09:41,707
You punch the hole. Here.

257
00:09:42,307 --> 00:09:45,477
- That's professional equipment.
- Now, here's how it's done.

258
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:47,676
- You take that out first?
- And you press.

259
00:09:47,677 --> 00:09:50,607
(You press it down hard to punch.)

260
00:09:50,877 --> 00:09:52,177
Goodness.

261
00:09:52,747 --> 00:09:53,817
It's a heart straw too.

262
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:56,017
Goodness.

263
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:57,517
Thank you.

264
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:02,227
(Even a bottle of water is handled specially.)

265
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:04,927
(Caretaker Fairy is evolving each day.)

266
00:10:05,497 --> 00:10:06,896
Will you entertain her so that she can keep her energy high?

267
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,396
Of course I will.

268
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:09,397
I would love that.

269
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:10,397
- It will relax me.
- You can tell me.

270
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:11,736
When you feel down, tell me,

271
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,496
- and I will sing for you.
- I feel a little depressed.

272
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:16,436
- Right now.
- What?

273
00:10:16,437 --> 00:10:18,136
- I feel a little depressed.
- You want him to sing now?

274
00:10:18,137 --> 00:10:19,236
I need the energy.

275
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:20,407
What do you want me to do?

276
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:23,406
A dance break. Will that be okay?

277
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:24,916
(My Star asked him to dance.)

278
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,817
It's just that I feel too depressed.

279
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:28,217
Let's start with Seo Jin.

280
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:30,746
- That's your responsibility.
- Hey.

281
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:32,456
Singing is your responsibility. You released two albums.

282
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,087
- Wait.
- You danced too.

283
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:36,886
- Are they Tom and Jerry?
- You learned it.

284
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,326
He learned to dance. He's good.

285
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,397
- Is he really?
- You feel depressed?

286
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:42,127
- He's good.
- Is he really?

287
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,267
You feel depressed?

288
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:45,296
- This is crazy.
- He will be the first one...

289
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:46,967
to pull a dance break at Gimpo Airport.

290
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:48,837
Ask me anything.

291
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:50,066
- Really?
- Really.

292
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,307
Don't hesitate.

293
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:54,647
When our actress is feeling down,

294
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:57,407
- as her manager...
- He got a prop too.

295
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,777
Hold for one beat.

296
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:01,816
Now hold for two.

297
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:03,786
- Hold for three.
- Where is Seo Jin going?

298
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,486
One, two, three, four.

299
00:11:05,487 --> 00:11:12,696
(Open sesame)

300
00:11:12,697 --> 00:11:17,497
(Open the heart of our actress)

301
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:19,767
(The star is 10,000 percent satisfied.)

302
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:23,507
Yes. What is it?

303
00:11:23,937 --> 00:11:24,977
What?

304
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:27,777
(Loving the sesame)

305
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:30,477
- Open sesame - Look at those steps!

306
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,987
(Dancing machine)

307
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:40,217
(Flashy moves)

308
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:42,856
(If it's for My Star)

309
00:11:42,857 --> 00:11:44,226
(The star is 10,000 percent satisfied.)

310
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:45,657
There you have it.

311
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,727
(Doing an ending pose too)

312
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:50,297
I loved it.

313
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,397
Are you perked up now?

314
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:54,136
I feel like I can do anything now.

315
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:55,407
Great.

316
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:59,007
Make Seo Jin do things now.

317
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:01,876
How did my mom know to call at the perfect time?

318
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:03,647
(Thanks, Mom.)

319
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:15,656
- We're here.
- Welcome to...

320
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,627
- Jeju.
- Welcome to Jeju.

321
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:19,797
Where's the car?

322
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,667
- It's C9.
- C9?

323
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,266
- Get in.
- Okay.

324
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,537
(He sweetly opens the car as usual.)

325
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:29,737
Should I go in?

326
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:33,337
All right. Give that to me.

327
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:37,677
You should get in the back. Escort.

328
00:12:38,147 --> 00:12:39,417
- Me?
- Yes.

329
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:42,017
- Why?
- You rode in the back with Su Ji.

330
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,056
- That was for the sundae soup.
- Is that so?

331
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,356
When did I ride in the back?

332
00:12:46,357 --> 00:12:48,857
A couple is supposed to sit side by side.

333
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:51,027
A couple has to.

334
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:52,657
My gosh.

335
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:56,366
All right, now. Tell me...

336
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:59,567
when you're ready to hear me brief on where we're going.

337
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:00,897
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

338
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:02,836
We have to look at it together.

339
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:04,067
Do we?

340
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,877
Here we go. I will put it here.

341
00:13:06,137 --> 00:13:09,407
- What is that?
- I wrote them down yesterday.

342
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:10,707
Goodness.

343
00:13:11,077 --> 00:13:13,717
I am the type who plans.

344
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:16,047
We departed Gimpo.

345
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:18,356
- And we arrived in Jeju.
- We arrived.

346
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:19,587
We got delayed a bit.

347
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:21,426
- We will head for lunch now.
- Lunch?

348
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:22,687
Yes. Lunch.

349
00:13:23,087 --> 00:13:26,227
We're going to this restaurant.

350
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:27,997
And...

351
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,027
(Punching in the address right away)

352
00:13:29,028 --> 00:13:30,267
After lunch,

353
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,737
we will go to the hotel. I thought I would run after.

354
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,437
It's not raining now.

355
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:39,006
If it rains this much, I will go running.

356
00:13:39,007 --> 00:13:40,337
- If it rains about this much.
- Yes.

357
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,906
But if it rains, I don't know what I'll do.

358
00:13:42,907 --> 00:13:44,976
- We can play jacks then.
- I don't know.

359
00:13:44,977 --> 00:13:46,377
- Yes. We can play jacks.
- Yes.

360
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:48,846
Then we make dinner and eat it. And sleep.

361
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,317
- And sleep. Today?
- That's the schedule.

362
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:53,517
- Are you okay with the schedule?
- It sounds great.

363
00:13:53,657 --> 00:13:56,686
There's a lot of stuff going on.

364
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:57,926
There isn't much to do.

365
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:01,096
- Right.
- When is Ki Yong coming?

366
00:14:01,097 --> 00:14:02,326
He will join us for lunch.

367
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,596
- For lunch? I see.
- For lunch.

368
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:04,666
Lunch. Right.

369
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:08,437
(For the first time on the show, there will be two My Stars.)

370
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:11,506
(Another My Star, Jang Ki Yong)

371
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:12,637
I'm nervous.

372
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:17,777
Hello. I'm Jang Ki Yong.

373
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:21,147
I have never crossed paths...

374
00:14:22,087 --> 00:14:24,586
with Lee Seo Jin or Kim Kwang Kyu.

375
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:26,616
It's my very first time to meet them.

376
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:27,617
(It's Ki Yong's first time to meet the Grumpy Secretaries.)

377
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,827
I'm very excited to meet them.

378
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:34,567
Because it's raining and gloomy,

379
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:36,467
it feels like I'm on my way...

380
00:14:37,397 --> 00:14:39,037
to meet my first love.

381
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,337
Yes. I'm excited.

382
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:46,607
(He arrived at the restaurant first.)

383
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:51,007
(See you soon, guys.)

384
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,017
I guess it stopped raining.

385
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:55,547
- Right. It comes and goes.
- It stopped.

386
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,957
(Since the weather is bad, he focuses on driving.)

387
00:15:00,187 --> 00:15:03,226
(They arrive at the tollgate.)

388
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,257
What is it? Give me the card.

389
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:07,967
Will it give you a receipt?

390
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:09,226
I think so.

391
00:15:09,227 --> 00:15:10,867
There's a button to print the receipt.

392
00:15:11,637 --> 00:15:12,766
Here.

393
00:15:12,767 --> 00:15:13,767
(Passing the corporate card)

394
00:15:14,767 --> 00:15:17,436
(He stretches his arm as hard as he can, )

395
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:18,806
(but his arm won't reach it.)

396
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:20,236
Are you okay?

397
00:15:20,237 --> 00:15:21,877
(Laughing)

398
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:25,477
(He ends up opening the door and paying.)

399
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:27,076
He got up.

400
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:28,147
(Struggling)

401
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:32,817
(They make sure to get the receipt.)

402
00:15:34,427 --> 00:15:37,387
Is Ki Yong waiting at the restaurant?

403
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:39,296
- I guess so.
- Why don't you give him a call?

404
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,026
- Should I give him a call?
- Yes, give him a call.

405
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:42,497
I wonder what he's up to.

406
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,097
Running?

407
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:46,937
In this rain?

408
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,507
Doesn't he like running too? I saw that he ran a marathon.

409
00:15:49,767 --> 00:15:51,837
I think he loves that.

410
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:54,677
How do you know, Kwang Kyu?

411
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:56,506
He's our guest star,

412
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,917
so I followed him on Instagram yesterday and saw his posts.

413
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:00,676
I will give him a call.

414
00:16:00,677 --> 00:16:01,687
(He's amazed to see his older bestie so prepared.)

415
00:16:02,317 --> 00:16:03,447
Ki Yong.

416
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,156
Yes, sir.

417
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:07,517
- Hey.
- When will you arrive?

418
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:09,186
We are on our way.

419
00:16:09,187 --> 00:16:12,397
Before we meet, do you want to say hi to them?

420
00:16:14,227 --> 00:16:15,527
Yes.

421
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:18,097
Guys, this is Ki Yong.

422
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,167
Hi, Ki Yong.

423
00:16:20,597 --> 00:16:23,206
- Hello, Ki Yong. Nice to meet you.
- Hello. I'm Jang Ki Yong.

424
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:26,077
- Speak in English.
- Hello.

425
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:27,307
Hello.

426
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:30,247
That was Kwang Kyu. Here's Seo Jin.

427
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:31,847
Say hello.

428
00:16:31,947 --> 00:16:33,577
I will say hello when we meet.

429
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:35,047
Sounds great.

430
00:16:35,147 --> 00:16:36,286
(Shy)

431
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:37,787
Are you already there?

432
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:40,156
Yes. I just arrived.

433
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:42,256
- You must be starving.
- I'm starved.

434
00:16:42,257 --> 00:16:45,096
- I know. We will be there soon.
- Okay.

435
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:46,826
- All right.
- He's got a nice voice.

436
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:48,497
- He's got a nice voice.
- I will see you shortly.

437
00:16:48,627 --> 00:16:49,827
- Okay.
- Okay.

438
00:16:50,227 --> 00:16:52,196
Jeju Island's weather is so unpredictable.

439
00:16:52,197 --> 00:16:53,237
(Suddenly, it starts to rain harder.)

440
00:16:54,637 --> 00:16:56,036
(Looking)

441
00:16:56,037 --> 00:16:57,607
I think that's a famous place.

442
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:00,176
There?

443
00:17:00,177 --> 00:17:02,047
Is it a gimbap place?

444
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:04,107
Something like abalone gimbap.

445
00:17:04,277 --> 00:17:06,517
There's a famous gimbap restaurant on Jeju Island.

446
00:17:06,647 --> 00:17:08,787
I think it's Kim Man Bok, the name of the restaurant.

447
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,216
Their building is big too.

448
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:11,657
(Is this the famous gimbap place where every foodie visits?)

449
00:17:12,217 --> 00:17:14,217
- What is...
- I think it's Kim Man Bok.

450
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:15,586
- Kim Man Bok?
- Their building is big too.

451
00:17:15,587 --> 00:17:17,757
No, that's a memorial hall.

452
00:17:18,257 --> 00:17:20,097
- What?
- That's a memorial hall.

453
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:22,896
That's Kim Man Bok Memorial Hall.

454
00:17:22,897 --> 00:17:24,027
What is it for?

455
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,337
Kim Man Bok is a famous figure on Jeju Island.

456
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:29,107
What is she known for?

457
00:17:29,837 --> 00:17:31,137
I think people will blame you for not knowing him.

458
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,477
Really? Oh, dear.

459
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,506
It's okay to not know.

460
00:17:35,507 --> 00:17:36,507
(Anxious)

461
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:40,777
During the late Joseon Dynasty when things were tough,

462
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:43,347
she used up her fortune...

463
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:47,586
- and saved the islanders.
- I see.

464
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:48,757
(She's the person who saved the islanders of Jeju.)

465
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:50,127
I am sorry.

466
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,097
- Why would you be sorry?
- I didn't know.

467
00:17:52,227 --> 00:17:54,197
There was a drama about Kim Man Bok too.

468
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,897
- Really?
- I starred in it for a small role.

469
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:58,266
You starred in it?

470
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,866
I was a cameo actor. I acted in just one episode.

471
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:00,997
Who played Kim Man Bok?

472
00:18:01,097 --> 00:18:03,267
I think it was Lee Mi Yeon.

473
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:05,977
I didn't know. Let's look it up.

474
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,706
I see.

475
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,307
- There was a drama too.
- I didn't know.

476
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:13,546
But when I typed it,

477
00:18:13,547 --> 00:18:17,187
- I got "Jeju Kim Man Bok gimbap." - Really?

478
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,157
I got "Jeju Kim Man Bok gimbap."

479
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:20,817
Really?

480
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,527
- She's right then.
- That's what I got.

481
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:25,896
- I got "Jeju Kim Man Bok gimbap." - Really?

482
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,097
Was it a gimbap place?

483
00:18:27,527 --> 00:18:28,726
How can it be that big?

484
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:29,996
Who is that person then?

485
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:33,097
- The person from Jeju Island.
- Maybe it's another name?

486
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,106
- Is it Lee Man Bok?
- Lee Man Bok?

487
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:38,506
He's the dancer of Ink.

488
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:39,606
- No.
- Jeju.

489
00:18:39,607 --> 00:18:41,446
There's Kim Man Bok. Look her up.

490
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:43,546
Jeju, Kim Man Bok.

491
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:44,646
(She searches for Jeju Kim Man Bok again.)

492
00:18:44,647 --> 00:18:46,176
Kim Man Bok.

493
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:48,616
(His lips get dry.)

494
00:18:48,617 --> 00:18:52,357
To put it simply, she was like Chung Ju Yung of Jeju.

495
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:54,826
- Really?
- A great merchant.

496
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,627
I am not getting anything.

497
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:58,826
She was the great merchant. Yes.

498
00:18:58,827 --> 00:18:59,926
Jeju's...

499
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:00,997
A great merchant.

500
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:02,827
(Laughing)

501
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:05,036
(Why is she laughing?)

502
00:19:05,037 --> 00:19:06,137
A great merchant?

503
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,237
- A great merchant.
- It's Kim Man Deok.

504
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:11,737
- Kim Man Deok.
- Kim Man Deok? I'm sorry.

505
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,407
Was it Kim Man Deok?

506
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:16,006
Goodness. Let's edit this out.

507
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:20,147
Kim Man Bok is the owner of a gimbap restaurant.

508
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:23,047
So it was Kim Man Deok.

509
00:19:23,187 --> 00:19:24,286
I am sorry.

510
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,387
I starred in just one episode, that's why.

511
00:19:26,787 --> 00:19:29,727
- There's nothing he knows well.
- I am sorry.

512
00:19:29,957 --> 00:19:32,197
- I am sorry.
- That was hilarious.

513
00:19:32,697 --> 00:19:33,897
I am sorry.

514
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:35,326
I shouldn't have said anything.

515
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:36,666
- You embarrassed...
- I thought I was in big trouble.

516
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:38,867
- I thought it was a gimbap place.
- Eun Jin for no reason.

517
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,496
Kim Man Deok.

518
00:19:40,497 --> 00:19:42,467
I am sorry, Ms. Kim Man Deok.

519
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,436
- I apologise.
- We apologise.

520
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:45,737
(We are sorry, Ms. Kim Man Deok.)

521
00:19:46,007 --> 00:19:48,077
I am reflecting on myself.

522
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:51,577
I thought it was one thing I knew, so I went all in.

523
00:19:53,677 --> 00:19:56,047
Kim Man Deok? Kim Man Bok.

524
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:59,387
Don't they sound similar?

525
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:04,457
Please edit out the part where I talk about Kim Man Bok.

526
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,066
There it is.

527
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,096
- What?
- Man Bok Gimbap.

528
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:11,297
You startled me!

529
00:20:11,697 --> 00:20:13,396
I thought I took a wrong turn.

530
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:14,966
- She's a great merchant.
- Man Bok Gimbap.

531
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,007
(The word "Man" frightens Kwang Kyu.)

532
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:20,407
Roll it well

533
00:20:22,107 --> 00:20:23,277
You sing well.

534
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,077
Your voice is high-pitched.

535
00:20:26,847 --> 00:20:28,347
My voice? Yes.

536
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:30,947
You must be able to sing the popular song.

537
00:20:31,047 --> 00:20:32,416
I must be able to sing the popular song?

538
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:33,657
Yes, that song, you know.

539
00:20:34,057 --> 00:20:36,087
- You mean "Golden." - Yes, "Golden."

540
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:40,497
- That's something I can never sing.
- Is it?

541
00:20:40,627 --> 00:20:41,997
Did you watch "KPop Demon Hunters?"

542
00:20:42,297 --> 00:20:44,937
Who's KDH?

543
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:48,607
(Must I serve KDH as well?)

544
00:20:48,707 --> 00:20:51,267
(He doesn't know what it is, but he laughs anyway.)

545
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,936
(They can't breathe.)

546
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:56,046
- "Golden." - How do you know that song then?

547
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:58,146
Right. "Golden" is from that movie.

548
00:20:58,147 --> 00:21:00,176
("Golden" is from that movie.)

549
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,646
- "Golden" isn't the movie title?
- No.

550
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:05,457
- KD... Right.
- KDH. "KPop Demon Hunters."

551
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,217
- Right.
- Did you watch it?

552
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:11,457
I was watching it, and... I put it on to hear the song.

553
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:14,627
And it was a bit too long.

554
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,867
I believe that's less than two hours long.

555
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:23,306
I was just waiting for the song to come out.

556
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,806
How do the lyrics go?

557
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:27,007
(It's this song.)

558
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:28,747
- What?
- What's that?

559
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:31,446
(Kwang Kyu doesn't seem to know "Golden.")

560
00:21:31,447 --> 00:21:34,376
I mean... Eun Jin, you should sing it.

561
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:38,356
Kwang Kyu, you're so funny. Seriously.

562
00:21:38,357 --> 00:21:39,857
You know how it goes.

563
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:42,687
(I'm sure it goes like this.)

564
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:47,097
Kwang Kyu, I recognise the song.

565
00:21:47,357 --> 00:21:48,466
It's a different song.

566
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:50,566
Beautiful galaxy

567
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,196
- It's a song by IVE.
- That's right.

568
00:21:52,197 --> 00:21:54,066
("I AM" by IVE)

569
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,167
- Yes.
- Really?

570
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:57,706
- It's a different song.
- Really?

571
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,276
- Yes.
- Then what's that song?

572
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,847
- What kind of a question is that?
- What's "Golden?"

573
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:05,517
- Eun Jin, sing a bit of the song.
- That's right. Sing it.

574
00:22:06,817 --> 00:22:08,946
(This is "Golden.")

575
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:10,116
That's right.

576
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:11,347
(This is "Golden.")

577
00:22:12,617 --> 00:22:14,456
(I sang the right song!)

578
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:16,887
- Galaxy - It's a different song.

579
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,156
- That one.
- It's a different song.

580
00:22:19,157 --> 00:22:20,657
- I know that song too.
- Really?

581
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:23,497
- It's a song by IVE.
- Okay.

582
00:22:23,597 --> 00:22:25,736
You don't know anything properly.

583
00:22:25,737 --> 00:22:26,796
That isn't true.

584
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:29,037
Do you think he's acting?

585
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:30,807
He really doesn't know.

586
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,477
- He really doesn't know.
- But...

587
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:36,846
Let's edit out this part.

588
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:39,017
(Let's edit out this part as well!)

589
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:43,487
(Kwang Kyu's struggle)

590
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:47,517
- The notes are similar. "Golden." - They're similar.

591
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:51,726
Seo Jin, use this when you get off.

592
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:53,327
- I don't need an umbrella.
- Really?

593
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:55,626
- It's raining. Will you be okay?
- I'll be okay.

594
00:22:55,627 --> 00:22:56,697
Okay.

595
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,097
- Thank you.
- Come on.

596
00:23:00,697 --> 00:23:01,767
Thank you.

597
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:03,336
(He looks after My Star attentively...)

598
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:05,006
(so that she won't get wet.)

599
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,207
- Eun Jin, give me my bag.
- Your bag.

600
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:07,737
I'll grab it.

601
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:09,147
- Eun Jin, give me my bag.
- Your bag.

602
00:23:09,477 --> 00:23:12,147
(She grabs Kwang Kyu's bag.)

603
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:14,377
(She holds it in a caring manner.)

604
00:23:16,347 --> 00:23:17,417
Gosh.

605
00:23:17,717 --> 00:23:20,286
Eun Jin, I asked for a bag to cover myself.

606
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:21,386
Kwang Kyu, I'm sorry.

607
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:22,957
- I have it here.
- Just go.

608
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,996
I was looking after it.

609
00:23:25,997 --> 00:23:26,997
(No one kept him from getting wet.)

610
00:23:27,897 --> 00:23:29,467
Ki Yong must be waiting.

611
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,797
(Nervous fingers)

612
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:38,577
(My Star is excitedly waiting for the secretaries.)

613
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:40,877
(Cheering)

614
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:42,007
There he is.

615
00:23:42,947 --> 00:23:44,917
(They finally meet the second My Star.)

616
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:46,577
There he is.

617
00:23:46,817 --> 00:23:50,147
(Grinning)

618
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,387
- Hi.
- Hello.

619
00:23:53,287 --> 00:23:55,127
- Hello.
- Hello.

620
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:57,627
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

621
00:23:58,157 --> 00:23:59,927
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

622
00:24:01,157 --> 00:24:02,327
(He responds with his deep dimples.)

623
00:24:02,597 --> 00:24:03,697
Let's take a seat.

624
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:05,837
Let's take a seat.

625
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,506
(My Star sits up in a polite manner.)

626
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:10,266
It feels just like yesterday...

627
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,006
that I read articles about your military service.

628
00:24:12,007 --> 00:24:13,906
- Did you get discharged already?
- You're right.

629
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:14,947
Did you complete your military service?

630
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:17,347
- I got discharged two years ago.
- Is that so?

631
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:18,677
For how many months do people serve these days?

632
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,877
- Eighteen months.
- Eighteen months?

633
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,686
- It's too short.
- How long was it in your time?

634
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:25,887
- In my time...
- He was a career soldier.

635
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:27,586
- Really?
- He was a sergeant first class.

636
00:24:27,587 --> 00:24:28,786
- Really?
- Yes.

637
00:24:28,787 --> 00:24:30,327
I served for about 68 months.

638
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,426
- It was his profession.
- How cool.

639
00:24:33,427 --> 00:24:34,456
How cool.

640
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:36,766
So you spent your early 20s in the army.

641
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,466
I enlisted as soon as I graduated from high school.

642
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:40,536
Right afterward. Why did you enlist?

643
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:43,067
- He went to protect the country.
- That was one reason,

644
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:44,937
but I didn't have money for college tuition.

645
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:48,137
- So you enlisted right afterward.
- The Ministry of defence helped.

646
00:24:49,007 --> 00:24:51,207
Was college tuition the only issue? Did you have good grades?

647
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:53,477
I had neither college tuition nor good grades.

648
00:24:54,217 --> 00:24:55,486
Did you have to ask? Hey!

649
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:57,417
They're like Tom and Jerry.

650
00:24:58,147 --> 00:25:00,687
The roles keep changing, but they're like Tom and Jerry.

651
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:01,957
My goodness.

652
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:03,827
Aren't good grades more important?

653
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:06,597
I had no interest in studying.

654
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,157
Had I studied, I would've done well.

655
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,127
(He becomes less nervous thanks to Tom and Jerry.)

656
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,267
I'm hungry. Would you take our order?

657
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,566
- Hello.
- Hello.

658
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:16,907
- Hello.
- Hello.

659
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:18,507
We'll order the most famous item,

660
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,636
red-banded lobster and mackerel set.

661
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:23,506
Why don't we order braised hairtail and grilled hairtail as well?

662
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:25,677
- That's a good idea.
- That'll be our order.

663
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:27,916
- I'll prepare a tasty meal.
- Thank you.

664
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:29,047
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

665
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:30,487
All right.

666
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,517
- It'll be tasty.
- Did you have a meal today?

667
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,756
- I had breakfast.
- You had breakfast.

668
00:25:34,757 --> 00:25:36,786
- Well done.
- The two of them had breakfast.

669
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,627
- Only we didn't have breakfast.
- Seriously.

670
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:41,097
Why didn't you have breakfast this morning?

671
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:43,567
I was too nervous.

672
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:48,266
Jang Ki Yong is too much of a star.

673
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:49,506
Seriously.

674
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,367
- He dazzles.
- In the morning,

675
00:25:51,507 --> 00:25:53,976
- You're too kind.
- I followed him on Instagram.

676
00:25:53,977 --> 00:25:55,376
- Really?
- Yes.

677
00:25:55,377 --> 00:25:57,347
When I checked out his account... My goodness.

678
00:25:57,647 --> 00:25:59,846
(I'll follow you too.)

679
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:00,947
Really?

680
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:03,187
Here you go.

681
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:06,587
- Thank you.
- It's like giving an allowance.

682
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:08,986
They're eating utensils.

683
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:11,187
- Thank you. I'll use them well.
- They're eating utensils.

684
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:14,197
You brought one more chopstick.

685
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:16,897
You brought one more chopstick because you couldn't count well.

686
00:26:18,127 --> 00:26:21,367
(I blame my poor eyesight.)

687
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:26,977
It's okay.

688
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:28,907
Come on. I'll do it.

689
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:31,477
(Thank you.)

690
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,046
It's so funny.

691
00:26:33,047 --> 00:26:34,146
My goodness.

692
00:26:34,147 --> 00:26:35,216
(Glancing over)

693
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:36,917
The view is nice.

694
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:39,786
This place...

695
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:42,087
(The view of the Jeju sea spreads out outside the window.)

696
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:44,656
What do you call this view?

697
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:46,626
Hey, shall I say it in English?

698
00:26:46,627 --> 00:26:47,797
What do you call this view in English?

699
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:51,167
It's an ocean view.

700
00:26:52,337 --> 00:26:53,437
My goodness.

701
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:55,107
You study English these days.

702
00:26:56,607 --> 00:26:57,767
- No?
- I'm trying to get conversational.

703
00:26:58,607 --> 00:26:59,776
(Halting)

704
00:26:59,777 --> 00:27:04,006
Isn't the spelling B, Y, U?

705
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:05,117
- What?
- What?

706
00:27:05,647 --> 00:27:07,317
Isn't the spelling B, Y, U?

707
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:08,847
B, Y, U?

708
00:27:09,287 --> 00:27:10,516
- That's...
- I know what BYC is.

709
00:27:10,517 --> 00:27:11,586
- BYC.
- BYC.

710
00:27:11,587 --> 00:27:13,986
That's your underwear brand.

711
00:27:13,987 --> 00:27:15,586
(He failed to show off his English skills.)

712
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:18,026
My mom didn't buy me an English dictionary.

713
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:19,857
- English dictionary.
- English dictionary.

714
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,826
Before we proceed with our schedule,

715
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:25,666
we should decide on how we address each other.

716
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,036
- The title.
- Call us however you want.

717
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:29,037
What should we do, Ki Yong?

718
00:27:29,737 --> 00:27:31,536
Since they're here as our managers,

719
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:33,277
we need to come up with the titles or nicknames...

720
00:27:33,637 --> 00:27:35,806
that stay true to the concept.

721
00:27:35,807 --> 00:27:37,476
- I don't know what will be good.
- How did you address them...

722
00:27:37,477 --> 00:27:39,646
- on your way here?
- I addressed them as my seniors.

723
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:41,417
I'd be more comfortable with that.

724
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:43,787
- I'd be more comfortable with that.
- Do what makes you comfortable.

725
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:47,357
But you shouldn't do that since we're here as your managers.

726
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,556
Why don't you give us an idea?

727
00:27:49,557 --> 00:27:50,787
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

728
00:27:51,327 --> 00:27:52,857
Lee and Kim.

729
00:27:53,097 --> 00:27:54,427
(Lee is flustered.)

730
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:55,797
Lee and Kim.

731
00:27:57,597 --> 00:27:59,266
- Lee.
- Lee...

732
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:00,796
- Lee.
- and Kim. How's that?

733
00:28:00,797 --> 00:28:01,906
- Kim.
- How's that?

734
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:02,966
I'm okay with that.

735
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:04,336
- I'm okay with that as well.
- Shall we go with that?

736
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:05,737
- What's number two?
- What?

737
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:09,646
Did you only have number one?

738
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:11,576
- Is there number two?
- Yes.

739
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:13,276
What's number two? Where do the options stop?

740
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:14,747
- Where do the options stop?
- Number two.

741
00:28:16,087 --> 00:28:17,747
You just made up number two, right?

742
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:19,957
It was in my head, but I forgot because of you!

743
00:28:21,317 --> 00:28:22,386
Lee.

744
00:28:22,387 --> 00:28:23,487
What's number two?

745
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:26,927
Bro Kim and Bro Lee.

746
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:28,766
- What?
- Bro Kim.

747
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:29,897
- Bro Kim and Bro Lee.
- Yes.

748
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:31,827
- Bro Kim.
- Bro Lee.

749
00:28:32,097 --> 00:28:33,596
How's this for number three?

750
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:35,806
- What?
- Mr. Lee and Mr. Kim.

751
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:37,707
Mr. Kim. That's a good one.

752
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,606
Mita Lee and Mita Kim.

753
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:40,706
It's "Mister."

754
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:42,977
You can't pronounce S.

755
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:44,746
Do it again.

756
00:28:44,747 --> 00:28:46,077
- Mita Lee.
- What? What was that?

757
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,317
- Hey.
- It isn't "Mita."

758
00:28:49,817 --> 00:28:51,816
You don't even know the spelling for "ocean view."

759
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,016
Aren't they like a married couple?

760
00:28:53,017 --> 00:28:54,317
- It's a concept.
- Tom and Jerry.

761
00:28:54,457 --> 00:28:56,556
It's a concept. I just pretend not to know.

762
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:57,656
They're like Mom and Dad.

763
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,357
- As for me...
- What's your idea?

764
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:01,727
I do this once I get closer to the manager.

765
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:03,867
Let's say his name is Ki Yong.

766
00:29:03,967 --> 00:29:06,397
Then I like to shorten it.

767
00:29:06,967 --> 00:29:08,097
Yong.

768
00:29:08,867 --> 00:29:09,937
Kyu.

769
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,737
Jin.

770
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:14,707
- It's good.
- Isn't it a bit cute?

771
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:15,946
How about this?

772
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:17,777
Bro Jin and Bro Kyu.

773
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:19,616
Bro Kyu and Bro Jin.

774
00:29:19,617 --> 00:29:20,676
- That's a good one.
- Bro Kyu and Bro Jin.

775
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:21,946
- That's a good one.
- Bro Kyu and Bro Jin.

776
00:29:21,947 --> 00:29:23,587
- Okay. Good.
- Good.

777
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:25,087
Bro Kyu and Bro Jin.

778
00:29:25,657 --> 00:29:27,516
- Our food is here.
- It's here.

779
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:28,587
(Food gets served after they decide on the nicknames.)

780
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:32,226
(Their eyes...)

781
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:34,597
(go wide.)

782
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,296
Red-banded lobsters.

783
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:37,297
(Red-banded lobsters are in season.)

784
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:39,497
There's so much mackerel sashimi.

785
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:42,366
It's as tall as you.

786
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:43,867
(A grilled hairtail that's as tall as a giant)

787
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:45,237
There are no bones.

788
00:29:45,337 --> 00:29:47,036
There are no bones. It's much better for eating.

789
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:49,307
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

790
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:50,546
Eat up.

791
00:29:50,547 --> 00:29:52,676
Do you eat mackerel sashimi?

792
00:29:52,677 --> 00:29:53,746
- Of course.
- Yes, I like it.

793
00:29:53,747 --> 00:29:54,877
You're the only one who can't eat it.

794
00:29:55,487 --> 00:29:58,116
- How about red-banded lobsters?
- I can eat them.

795
00:29:58,117 --> 00:29:59,987
We need to put rice on top.

796
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:02,557
Show me how you eat it.

797
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:05,927
You put this on top.

798
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:08,967
Then you put rice on top.

799
00:30:09,897 --> 00:30:11,067
It's like sushi.

800
00:30:11,697 --> 00:30:13,036
Then you put pickled onion on top.

801
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:14,166
(Pickled onion)

802
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:16,707
Chilli pepper and garlic as well.

803
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,976
Then you put rice on top.

804
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:21,437
(The tasty mackerel sashimi wrap is complete.)

805
00:30:22,207 --> 00:30:25,377
(Seo Jin tries it first.)

806
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:26,617
How is it?

807
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:31,317
- Is it good?
- There must be the right order.

808
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:32,686
- It isn't fishy.
- Isn't it fishy?

809
00:30:32,687 --> 00:30:33,717
Try it.

810
00:30:34,657 --> 00:30:36,157
You add the onion first.

811
00:30:36,557 --> 00:30:37,856
(Staring)

812
00:30:37,857 --> 00:30:40,297
Kwang Kyu, add more ssamjang and garlic.

813
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:44,227
- Okay. Then...
- Yes.

814
00:30:45,227 --> 00:30:46,366
It isn't fishy at all.

815
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:47,367
(He tries mackerel sashimi for the first time.)

816
00:30:47,537 --> 00:30:48,636
Did you add a lot of ssamjang?

817
00:30:48,637 --> 00:30:49,766
(He looks after his older bestie.)

818
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:51,737
- Did you add a lot of ssamjang?
- It isn't fishy at all.

819
00:30:53,637 --> 00:30:54,737
It's tasty.

820
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:58,306
We're eating sashimi on a rainy day.

821
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:00,777
(Eun Jin takes a bite.)

822
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:09,226
I can eat two bowls of rice with dishes like these.

823
00:31:09,227 --> 00:31:10,887
(Moved)

824
00:31:12,557 --> 00:31:14,327
- Ki Yong, give me some water.
- Okay.

825
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,697
(They fight to give her water.)

826
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:23,007
(Struggling)

827
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:25,977
(My Star should sit still.)

828
00:31:25,978 --> 00:31:27,536
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

829
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:29,047
Here. I'll do it.

830
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:31,047
(Thank you.)

831
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:33,247
All right.

832
00:31:36,147 --> 00:31:37,287
Thank you.

833
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:43,757
(Enjoy it, My Star.)

834
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:46,557
It'll rain tomorrow as well.

835
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:48,657
What should we do?

836
00:31:48,967 --> 00:31:50,196
It'll rain until tomorrow morning.

837
00:31:50,197 --> 00:31:52,337
The weather forecast earlier didn't predict rain.

838
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:54,567
The weather was so nice yesterday.

839
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,966
I want to swim in the sea.

840
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,107
Same here.

841
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:00,836
(Chuckling)

842
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:01,937
Look at the two of them.

843
00:32:02,037 --> 00:32:03,447
(They look in the same direction.)

844
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:08,247
(What?)

845
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:10,646
You know that we share one fate, right?

846
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,187
If we do something,

847
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:13,886
- everyone has to do it.
- Of course.

848
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,257
- Of course.
- After all, we're a team.

849
00:32:16,557 --> 00:32:17,626
Of course.

850
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:19,727
- We're a family.
- We're a team.

851
00:32:19,797 --> 00:32:21,257
Right, Bro Jin?

852
00:32:22,427 --> 00:32:23,767
As for me,

853
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,166
I like to run.

854
00:32:25,167 --> 00:32:26,367
- Run?
- Yes.

855
00:32:26,897 --> 00:32:29,806
Running is nice when it's sunny, but it's especially nice...

856
00:32:29,807 --> 00:32:31,567
when it's rainy.

857
00:32:32,537 --> 00:32:35,176
(When it's rainy?)

858
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:36,706
So it'd be nice...

859
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:39,316
to do a rainy run together.

860
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:41,177
A palace run?

861
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:46,717
(Do you want to run in a palace?)

862
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:49,926
- A rainy run.
- A rainy run.

863
00:32:49,927 --> 00:32:51,327
- Yes.
- A rainy run.

864
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:53,797
- What did you say? "A palace run?" - A palace run sounds charming.

865
00:32:53,897 --> 00:32:55,357
Did you say "palace?"

866
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:57,166
A palace run.

867
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:59,697
(My Star laughs thanks to Kwang Kyu.)

868
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:02,067
You have more clothes, right?

869
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:04,536
- What? No.
- You have more clothes, right?

870
00:33:04,537 --> 00:33:06,506
Should we go shopping first?

871
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:08,077
- I'll give you my clothes.
- Okay.

872
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:09,806
I have big clothes.

873
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:11,647
(It won't be easy.)

874
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:13,846
I'd be able to run in this weather.

875
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:15,417
It wouldn't be too bad.

876
00:33:15,547 --> 00:33:17,416
They won't run.

877
00:33:17,417 --> 00:33:18,746
- They'll walk.
- Exactly.

878
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,586
- You...
- The speed will be like...

879
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:21,716
- that of walking.
- Slowly.

880
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:23,356
- Can you walk?
- I knew that.

881
00:33:23,357 --> 00:33:25,087
"Can you walk?"

882
00:33:25,157 --> 00:33:27,727
He can't walk well because of his knees.

883
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:29,467
I mean...

884
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:32,597
It's just that I can't walk for a long time.

885
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:33,937
I can walk.

886
00:33:36,967 --> 00:33:39,477
Running slowly won't be a problem.

887
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:40,877
- It's more like walking.
- Slowly.

888
00:33:41,377 --> 00:33:44,646
The promotion team has asked you to do something.

889
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,677
Okay.

890
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:48,276
It's a promotional video for the drama.

891
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:50,486
- Okay.
- Would you film it now?

892
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,717
- Okay.
- Okay.

893
00:33:52,787 --> 00:33:54,517
(Kwang Kyu will be the cameraman today as well.)

894
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:57,927
(Seo Jin will be the host.)

895
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:00,397
You can do it at once.

896
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,766
(He has brought a hand mirror.)

897
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,967
Hey, check yourself in the mirror.

898
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:07,897
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

899
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:12,506
(My Stars check their appearances.)

900
00:34:12,507 --> 00:34:13,836
- Okay.
- Okay.

901
00:34:13,837 --> 00:34:15,236
You can ask me whenever you need a mirror.

902
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,447
- Okay.
- Thank you.

903
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:17,746
- Are you done?
- Yes.

904
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:19,076
(They begin filming a promotional video.)

905
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:21,147
The angle is great right now.

906
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:23,217
(Let's see.)

907
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:25,516
Kwang Kyu, how could you say that the angle is great...

908
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:27,216
when that camera is in the frame?

909
00:34:27,217 --> 00:34:28,686
The camera doesn't matter.

910
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:30,226
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does.

911
00:34:30,227 --> 00:34:31,586
Go over there...

912
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:32,957
and film them from this angle.

913
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:35,867
This side should be the background.

914
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:41,066
(Wary)

915
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,966
- Should we go over there?
- Should we do that?

916
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:44,607
- Please do that.
- Okay.

917
00:34:45,437 --> 00:34:49,047
(My Stars move for the peace between the secretaries.)

918
00:34:49,477 --> 00:34:51,847
(Is it good?)

919
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:54,716
Wouldn't they look better if you film from above?

920
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,947
- You're filming from the bottom.
- Okay.

921
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,486
Film from above.

922
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:00,956
- Do this.
- It's too...

923
00:35:00,957 --> 00:35:02,216
- It's too...
- They look good.

924
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:03,527
- Okay.
- Right?

925
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,596
- Okay.
- Right?

926
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:06,957
- It's better.
- Okay.

927
00:35:07,097 --> 00:35:09,196
- Let's begin.
- Shall we look at Bro Jin?

928
00:35:09,197 --> 00:35:10,296
Of course.

929
00:35:10,297 --> 00:35:12,266
Currently, two people in the same company are dating.

930
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:13,567
- They're Da Rim...
- Yes.

931
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:15,036
- and Ji Hyeok.
- Yes.

932
00:35:15,037 --> 00:35:16,767
Please introduce...

933
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:18,337
your character.

934
00:35:18,437 --> 00:35:22,177
Da Rim is a woman who lies about her background and gets a job.

935
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:25,576
She's a member of the Mother TF team.

936
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:27,276
For livelihood,

937
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:30,387
she hides her identity and works hard.

938
00:35:30,617 --> 00:35:32,786
And Ji Hyeok...

939
00:35:32,787 --> 00:35:34,116
is very cool-headed.

940
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:36,687
Usually, he's very cold.

941
00:35:36,957 --> 00:35:38,857
But he meets Go Da Rim.

942
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,457
With a single kiss,

943
00:35:40,957 --> 00:35:42,397
he becomes a fool.

944
00:35:43,697 --> 00:35:45,167
- He's a loving man.
- I guess...

945
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:46,667
- I guess...
- Yes?

946
00:35:46,797 --> 00:35:48,236
the woman was...

947
00:35:48,237 --> 00:35:51,567
a good kisser.

948
00:35:52,407 --> 00:35:53,536
I think she was.

949
00:35:53,537 --> 00:35:55,407
- My goodness.
- I think so.

950
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:56,877
I think she was.

951
00:35:57,377 --> 00:35:58,847
- My goodness.
- I think so.

952
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:01,547
Why are you so happy?

953
00:36:02,347 --> 00:36:03,887
Why are you so happy?

954
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,186
- It isn't like that.
- He turned his head away...

955
00:36:06,187 --> 00:36:07,856
- from the camera.
- No.

956
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:09,057
No.

957
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,186
What's better than...

958
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:13,426
the first kiss?

959
00:36:13,427 --> 00:36:15,227
Now, on my lips

960
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:17,667
Park your lips

961
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:20,267
I...

962
00:36:21,767 --> 00:36:24,167
(Moist)

963
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:28,006
Are you laughing at me?

964
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:29,146
(Shaking his head)

965
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:30,647
They laugh at me whenever I say something.

966
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:32,946
He's covering his mouth.

967
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:34,047
No.

968
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:36,447
In that case... What's this?

969
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:38,347
The two characters' dating style...

970
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:40,157
What's "Egen" and "Teto?"

971
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,426
What's "Egen?"

972
00:36:42,427 --> 00:36:44,256
How could you not know it?

973
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:45,796
- Do you know, Bro Kyu?
- Of course.

974
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:47,826
- Please explain it to Bro Jin.
- "Egen..."

975
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:48,856
and "Teto."

976
00:36:48,857 --> 00:36:50,396
- "Egen?" - Yes.

977
00:36:50,397 --> 00:36:52,837
People use terms like Teto Man and Egen Man.

978
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:55,906
They describe femininity and masculinity.

979
00:36:55,907 --> 00:36:57,706
- Toughness.
- What do they stand for?

980
00:36:57,707 --> 00:36:58,906
How would I know?

981
00:36:58,907 --> 00:37:00,507
Estrogen.

982
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:02,376
Estrogen.

983
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,046
- Estrogen.
- Estrogen?

984
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,276
- Te...
- Te...

985
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:07,847
- Tetris.
- Te...

986
00:37:07,947 --> 00:37:09,187
Testosterone.

987
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:11,286
(Moving)

988
00:37:11,287 --> 00:37:12,586
- Testosterone.
- Testosterone.

989
00:37:12,587 --> 00:37:13,787
Te...

990
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:14,957
What?

991
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:16,187
Testosterone.

992
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:17,556
- Testosterone.
- What...

993
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:19,127
(Resting his elbow)

994
00:37:19,627 --> 00:37:23,167
(Kwang Kyu's arm hurts.)

995
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:29,107
He keeps using more equipment.

996
00:37:29,837 --> 00:37:32,336
- I want to make things comfortable.
- It's okay.

997
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:33,477
I'm set now.

998
00:37:33,707 --> 00:37:36,006
May I ask you a question as someone who hasn't done...

999
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:37,007
any kissing scene?

1000
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:38,177
Okay.

1001
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:40,377
Have you ever asked...

1002
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,416
for a kissing scene that seemed necessary...

1003
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:44,847
even if it wasn't in the script?

1004
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:46,056
I've done it once.

1005
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:47,087
- Really?
- Yes.

1006
00:37:48,087 --> 00:37:49,726
Did the director say yes?

1007
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,086
I just said to Ki Yong,

1008
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:53,727
"Ki Yong, let's just kiss toward the end."

1009
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,267
- When we created a montage.
- That's right.

1010
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:59,337
Leading actors can kiss like that.

1011
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:00,496
Yes. I thought...

1012
00:38:00,497 --> 00:38:03,106
it'd be nice to have a kiss in the montage.

1013
00:38:03,107 --> 00:38:04,266
It made a pretty picture.

1014
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:06,336
So I made that suggestion.

1015
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:08,877
Without knowing what she was doing...

1016
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:13,747
(Scratching)

1017
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:16,746
I'm sorry.

1018
00:38:16,747 --> 00:38:18,717
(This interviewer has a unique attitude.)

1019
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:22,457
(They've never had such a natural interview.)

1020
00:38:23,327 --> 00:38:24,526
What are you going to do?

1021
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:26,226
If you're going to scratch some more, do it now.

1022
00:38:26,227 --> 00:38:27,426
- May I scratch your leg for you?
- What?

1023
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,656
It's okay.

1024
00:38:28,657 --> 00:38:30,127
- Put some saliva on it.
- No.

1025
00:38:30,727 --> 00:38:31,967
It's okay.

1026
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,237
You're so disgusting.

1027
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:36,407
I'm sorry.

1028
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:38,367
Here comes the most important question.

1029
00:38:39,177 --> 00:38:41,577
It's a balance quiz on dating.

1030
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:44,107
You kissed your crush by mistake while drinking together.

1031
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,677
Do you apologise or confess your love for a relationship?

1032
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,417
Gosh, I need to think...

1033
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,487
about this one.

1034
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:54,816
- Then...
- It must be someone I like.

1035
00:38:54,817 --> 00:38:55,987
That's right.

1036
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,726
I think I'll confess my love in that situation.

1037
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,397
- Right.
- I think I'll do that.

1038
00:39:00,427 --> 00:39:02,766
For a kiss to happen,

1039
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:05,766
I must've gotten drunk alone with him.

1040
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,067
It shows...

1041
00:39:07,467 --> 00:39:08,666
that he's someone I like.

1042
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:10,066
When you're drunk, you can kiss in front of other people.

1043
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:11,266
You don't have to be alone.

1044
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,107
What kind of a life have you led?

1045
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:15,736
Seriously.

1046
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:16,776
(They become curious of Seo Jin's past.)

1047
00:39:16,777 --> 00:39:19,517
I don't think I'm on that level.

1048
00:39:21,377 --> 00:39:22,587
I apologise.

1049
00:39:24,147 --> 00:39:25,646
A lover who goes on an overnight trip...

1050
00:39:25,647 --> 00:39:26,957
with an opposite-sex friend...

1051
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:30,127
versus a lover who drinks with an ex all night long.

1052
00:39:30,227 --> 00:39:31,326
All night long?

1053
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,427
What's this? "Marriage Clinic, Love and War?"

1054
00:39:34,097 --> 00:39:36,827
Is the drama R-rated?

1055
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:38,826
No, not at all.

1056
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:40,296
- Our drama isn't like that.
- All the questions are...

1057
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:41,436
It's a beautiful drama.

1058
00:39:41,437 --> 00:39:43,036
- Yes. It's lighthearted.
- Lighthearted.

1059
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:44,306
- It's for 12 years and older.
- Yes.

1060
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:45,906
- For 12 years and older?
- Yes.

1061
00:39:45,907 --> 00:39:47,207
- For 12 years and older.
- Then why did they add...

1062
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,247
so many dirty questions?

1063
00:39:50,447 --> 00:39:52,676
But I'm drawn to such questions.

1064
00:39:52,677 --> 00:39:53,816
(He's addicted to dopamine.)

1065
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:54,916
("Dynamite Kiss" is for 12 years and older.)

1066
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:56,986
I'm drawn to dirty questions.

1067
00:39:56,987 --> 00:39:58,547
(Please look forward to it.)

1068
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:00,956
- Let's get in the van.
- Okay.

1069
00:40:00,957 --> 00:40:02,257
Thank you.

1070
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:04,186
- Where's Ki Yong?
- Ki Yong...

1071
00:40:04,187 --> 00:40:06,227
- needs to ride this van now, right?
- Exactly.

1072
00:40:06,357 --> 00:40:07,456
Get in.

1073
00:40:07,457 --> 00:40:09,197
(Ki Yong is here.)

1074
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:12,327
Thank you.

1075
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:13,367
All right.

1076
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,036
(Escorting until the end)

1077
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,507
It's so humid.

1078
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:19,636
(Looking around)

1079
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:21,276
- Here are the cameras.
- Yes.

1080
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:22,407
- It's fascinating, right?
- Yes.

1081
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:23,706
(Glancing over)

1082
00:40:23,707 --> 00:40:25,577
Didn't you film some variety shows?

1083
00:40:25,707 --> 00:40:27,346
(Taking care of the male lead)

1084
00:40:27,347 --> 00:40:28,816
That's right. You were on "Fresh Off the Sea."

1085
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,186
You were on that show.

1086
00:40:30,187 --> 00:40:31,286
- I filmed some variety shows.
- Yes.

1087
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,346
That's right.

1088
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,517
This is my first variety show.

1089
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:35,056
- Is this your first one?
- Yes.

1090
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,426
Are the cameras filming now?

1091
00:40:36,427 --> 00:40:37,526
- Yes.
- Of course.

1092
00:40:37,527 --> 00:40:38,587
Look.

1093
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:43,627
(The cameras are filming well.)

1094
00:40:44,927 --> 00:40:46,097
You can go now.

1095
00:40:47,097 --> 00:40:48,697
Okay. You're set.

1096
00:40:51,237 --> 00:40:52,906
Shall we order fried chicken later?

1097
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:54,436
It'll be tasty.

1098
00:40:54,437 --> 00:40:55,537
Sure.

1099
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:58,407
Do you like fried chicken?

1100
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:00,777
I only eat boneless fried chicken.

1101
00:41:01,147 --> 00:41:03,517
- Same here. I like it better.
- Boneless fried chicken.

1102
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:05,016
I hate deboning the most.

1103
00:41:05,017 --> 00:41:06,186
It's so much work.

1104
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:07,287
(Both of them prefer boneless fried chicken.)

1105
00:41:07,887 --> 00:41:09,156
If you can eat...

1106
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:11,256
one dish before death,

1107
00:41:11,257 --> 00:41:12,587
what would it be?

1108
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:14,827
(My Star has many questions.)

1109
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:18,397
It'd be my mom's braised mackerel.

1110
00:41:18,427 --> 00:41:20,836
It'd be my mom's braised mackerel.

1111
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:22,366
(My goodness)

1112
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,167
- Suddenly, things became sad.
- Suddenly,

1113
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:26,636
- you ruined the atmosphere.
- I mean...

1114
00:41:26,637 --> 00:41:28,206
It wasn't a serious question.

1115
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:30,276
Eun Jin asked the question excitedly.

1116
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:31,576
Why did you do that?

1117
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:32,976
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

1118
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:34,016
It's just a mackerel dish.

1119
00:41:34,017 --> 00:41:35,847
Can't I pick the braised mackerel?

1120
00:41:36,747 --> 00:41:39,217
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

1121
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:40,617
You answer the question.

1122
00:41:40,618 --> 00:41:42,087
What's yours?

1123
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,927
Your dad's...

1124
00:41:43,957 --> 00:41:45,126
- Kimchi stew.
- My dad...

1125
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,296
passed away 20 years ago.

1126
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,496
Why did you bring up my dad?

1127
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:50,627
- What's going on?
- Seriously.

1128
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:52,266
- For goodness' sake.
- Hey.

1129
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:53,766
You aren't the only one without a dad.

1130
00:41:53,767 --> 00:41:55,236
My dad passed away too.

1131
00:41:55,237 --> 00:41:57,706
You knew my dad had passed away. Why did you bring him up?

1132
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:59,776
You might miss his dish.

1133
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:00,876
I'll take a nap.

1134
00:42:00,877 --> 00:42:03,407
(It was just a question on the favourite dish.)

1135
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,746
Let's resume the conversation.

1136
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:06,617
Okay, I'm back.

1137
00:42:08,647 --> 00:42:10,117
They're like Mom and Dad.

1138
00:42:10,787 --> 00:42:12,957
It's like watching Mom and Dad from the back seat...

1139
00:42:13,357 --> 00:42:14,787
when the family drives to the countryside..

1140
00:42:15,487 --> 00:42:16,857
It's so funny.

1141
00:42:17,887 --> 00:42:19,286
Isn't it cold in the back?

1142
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,326
- We're okay.
- We're okay.

1143
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:21,457
I raised the temperature.

1144
00:42:23,097 --> 00:42:24,697
Can't we listen to that song?

1145
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:25,966
- What song?
- Bro Kyu's song?

1146
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:28,497
Open sesame

1147
00:42:28,697 --> 00:42:30,266
(My Star has requested my song.)

1148
00:42:30,267 --> 00:42:31,436
(Smiling)

1149
00:42:31,437 --> 00:42:32,536
I'd love to do that,

1150
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:33,677
but Seo Jin will kick up a fuss.

1151
00:42:34,537 --> 00:42:36,007
I won't. Go ahead.

1152
00:42:37,307 --> 00:42:39,106
Can you sing while driving?

1153
00:42:39,107 --> 00:42:40,817
Of course.

1154
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:42,446
You usually can't multitask.

1155
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:43,947
- Shall we play it?
- Yes.

1156
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:45,816
I thought you wanted Kwang Kyu to sing.

1157
00:42:45,817 --> 00:42:46,987
You just wanted to play the song?

1158
00:42:47,687 --> 00:42:49,587
- Thank you.
- Come on.

1159
00:42:49,627 --> 00:42:51,927
Thank you.

1160
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:53,596
I'm a national actor...

1161
00:42:53,597 --> 00:42:55,597
and a singer with two albums under his belt, Kim Kwang Kyu.

1162
00:42:57,027 --> 00:43:00,897
(This is fun.)

1163
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:03,236
(I like your sparkling eyes)

1164
00:43:03,237 --> 00:43:04,267
Aren't you going to sing?

1165
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,376
Are you lip-syncing?

1166
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:07,437
I'm lip-syncing.

1167
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:10,107
(Whispering)

1168
00:43:11,577 --> 00:43:14,777
(Satisfied)

1169
00:43:16,817 --> 00:43:17,987
Bro Kyu...

1170
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,887
is smiling with his eyes.

1171
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:23,956
Open sesame

1172
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:24,987
Bang!

1173
00:43:25,387 --> 00:43:27,596
(He's highly satisfied with looking after My Stars.)

1174
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:33,136
(I hope My Stars' hearts will open wide)

1175
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:35,036
- It's a great song.
- Will it open or not?

1176
00:43:35,037 --> 00:43:36,837
Will it open or not?

1177
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:38,037
There's one more song.

1178
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:39,606
What was the title...

1179
00:43:39,607 --> 00:43:40,937
- of the other song?
- There's one more song.

1180
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:42,406
"Parkingman of Love."

1181
00:43:42,407 --> 00:43:44,276
It suits the drama.

1182
00:43:44,277 --> 00:43:45,447
Please use it.

1183
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:47,576
- "Parkingman of Love." - It doesn't suit the drama.

1184
00:43:47,577 --> 00:43:48,847
- "Parkingman of Love." - Don't be ridiculous.

1185
00:43:48,977 --> 00:43:50,887
The last line goes like this.

1186
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,956
Now, on my lips

1187
00:43:52,957 --> 00:43:55,286
Park your lips

1188
00:43:55,287 --> 00:43:56,727
That's the song.

1189
00:43:56,757 --> 00:43:58,756
Which kiss does the song capture?

1190
00:43:58,757 --> 00:43:59,757
What?

1191
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:01,527
In what year and with whom did the kiss happen?

1192
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,826
- It captures a future kiss.
- A future kiss.

1193
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:04,867
(Hopeful)

1194
00:44:05,997 --> 00:44:07,736
(Today as well, I thought of you and had a glass of liquor)

1195
00:44:07,737 --> 00:44:09,506
A glass of liquor

1196
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:10,537
Good.

1197
00:44:11,867 --> 00:44:14,037
(He's excited.)

1198
00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:17,146
- Boom, boom.
- Half of the people in the world

1199
00:44:17,147 --> 00:44:20,276
Are women

1200
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:22,376
- But you're the only one for me - But you're

1201
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:23,546
Tonight

1202
00:44:23,547 --> 00:44:25,016
You know this song.

1203
00:44:25,017 --> 00:44:26,986
- What? Of course.
- Make a U-turn to my embrace

1204
00:44:26,987 --> 00:44:27,987
I like this song.

1205
00:44:27,988 --> 00:44:30,226
Ki Yong is singing along.

1206
00:44:30,227 --> 00:44:31,227
Ki Yong.

1207
00:44:31,228 --> 00:44:33,727
I like Kwang Kyu's songs a lot.

1208
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:36,497
I've always liked trot.

1209
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:38,467
I listen to songs...

1210
00:44:38,727 --> 00:44:40,496
by Kim Bum Ryong and Na Hoon A...

1211
00:44:40,497 --> 00:44:42,767
on a regular basis.

1212
00:44:42,967 --> 00:44:45,967
Then Kwang Kyu released his albums...

1213
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:48,176
and his songs stuck to my ears.

1214
00:44:48,177 --> 00:44:50,347
Open sesame

1215
00:44:50,547 --> 00:44:52,677
I love that melody.

1216
00:44:54,247 --> 00:44:55,646
It's such a feel-good song.

1217
00:44:55,647 --> 00:44:57,517
(It's such a feel-good song.)

1218
00:44:57,787 --> 00:45:00,216
Ki Yong is singing along.

1219
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:01,316
Ki Yong.

1220
00:45:01,317 --> 00:45:05,086
(When I was 20, I got dumped for being poor)

1221
00:45:05,087 --> 00:45:06,426
(Twitching)

1222
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:08,126
- It's your story.
- It's my story.

1223
00:45:08,127 --> 00:45:10,666
(When I was 30, I got dumped for not having a house)

1224
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,166
I got dumped many times.

1225
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,336
It's a sad song.

1226
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:14,337
(The lyrics are depressing.)

1227
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:16,267
Now, I'm

1228
00:45:18,937 --> 00:45:20,607
You're Teto Man.

1229
00:45:20,877 --> 00:45:22,406
I'm Teto Woman.

1230
00:45:22,407 --> 00:45:23,906
- Teto Woman.
- I'm a woman.

1231
00:45:23,907 --> 00:45:24,946
I'm sorry.

1232
00:45:24,947 --> 00:45:26,817
- I'm sorry.
- I'm a woman.

1233
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:32,816
(Now, park on my lips)

1234
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,187
All right.

1235
00:45:35,887 --> 00:45:37,087
We're here already.

1236
00:45:37,557 --> 00:45:39,727
We were absorbed in chit-chatting.

1237
00:45:40,257 --> 00:45:41,497
We're here.

1238
00:45:42,227 --> 00:45:43,726
Let's get off.

1239
00:45:43,727 --> 00:45:45,366
- We're here.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1240
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,796
Well done.

1241
00:45:46,797 --> 00:45:48,237
Thankfully, the rain stopped.

1242
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:49,467
Yes, it did.

1243
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:51,106
Let's go.

1244
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:53,407
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1245
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:56,376
(The 1-on-1 umbrella service)

1246
00:45:56,377 --> 00:45:57,646
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1247
00:45:57,647 --> 00:45:58,907
- Bro Kyu.
- Don't mention it.

1248
00:45:59,077 --> 00:46:00,747
Bro Kyu, thank you.

1249
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:02,017
Thank you.

1250
00:46:02,247 --> 00:46:05,817
(They enter the lodging.)

1251
00:46:08,187 --> 00:46:09,517
We're here.

1252
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:11,057
It's pretty.

1253
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:12,756
It's pretty.

1254
00:46:12,757 --> 00:46:13,927
(Grumpy Secretary's house on Jeju Island)

1255
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:15,657
They have a second floor.

1256
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:17,466
- A second floor?
- Yes.

1257
00:46:17,467 --> 00:46:19,227
(You can see the green leaves outside the wide window.)

1258
00:46:19,797 --> 00:46:20,797
Isn't that the sea?

1259
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:22,636
If we go out this way, we'll reach the sea.

1260
00:46:22,637 --> 00:46:23,867
(They're only a few steps away from the sea.)

1261
00:46:26,437 --> 00:46:27,537
So,

1262
00:46:28,007 --> 00:46:29,706
the sea...

1263
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:32,806
is calling us right now.

1264
00:46:32,807 --> 00:46:34,776
Since the weather has improved,

1265
00:46:34,777 --> 00:46:36,447
why don't we change into new clothes quickly...

1266
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:38,386
and go for a walk?

1267
00:46:38,387 --> 00:46:41,257
(My Star has suggested a walk.)

1268
00:46:42,357 --> 00:46:43,487
It's raining.

1269
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:46,297
It's only a light rain.

1270
00:46:46,457 --> 00:46:47,557
It's nothing.

1271
00:46:49,527 --> 00:46:51,766
I don't have additional clothes...

1272
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:52,867
I can change into.

1273
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:55,297
He has them.

1274
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:57,737
- I'm sure you've brought some.
- I'm sure of it.

1275
00:46:58,807 --> 00:47:00,307
(An excuse doesn't work on My Star.)

1276
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,837
I don't know. Let's sit down.

1277
00:47:02,977 --> 00:47:04,747
I hate running the most.

1278
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:07,816
I avoided such an activity.

1279
00:47:07,817 --> 00:47:10,017
I excluded myself.

1280
00:47:11,387 --> 00:47:13,557
(Glancing over)

1281
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:18,957
(My Stars come up with a strategy.)

1282
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:21,156
(Whining)

1283
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:23,267
- Bro Jin.
- There's Bluetooth.

1284
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:25,327
(Grabbing tight)

1285
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:27,096
- Bro Jin.
- What? There's Bluetooth.

1286
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,796
Let's go outside.

1287
00:47:28,797 --> 00:47:30,036
(He cuts them off.)

1288
00:47:30,037 --> 00:47:31,467
Let's go outside.

1289
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,237
- Bro Jin.
- Kwang Kyu.

1290
00:47:34,307 --> 00:47:35,536
- Get ready.
- What?

1291
00:47:35,537 --> 00:47:36,647
They want to go outside.

1292
00:47:37,177 --> 00:47:38,376
- Get ready.
- What?

1293
00:47:38,377 --> 00:47:39,477
They want to go outside.

1294
00:47:39,717 --> 00:47:40,946
I'm ready!

1295
00:47:40,947 --> 00:47:42,276
(I'm ready!)

1296
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:43,716
- No, you aren't.
- Will you go out like that?

1297
00:47:43,717 --> 00:47:45,146
I just need to get changed.

1298
00:47:45,147 --> 00:47:46,217
Do you have clothes?

1299
00:47:46,757 --> 00:47:49,086
You've prepared everything.

1300
00:47:49,087 --> 00:47:51,156
- You have sneakers too.
- Seriously.

1301
00:47:51,157 --> 00:47:52,957
I thought I didn't bring them.

1302
00:47:54,657 --> 00:47:57,626
(He doesn't want to run, but he comes out first.)

1303
00:47:57,627 --> 00:48:00,297
You don't look very happy.

1304
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:02,537
Why would I be happy?

1305
00:48:03,837 --> 00:48:05,467
- The weather is bad.
- This place is beautiful.

1306
00:48:06,537 --> 00:48:07,737
I hate running the most.

1307
00:48:08,577 --> 00:48:10,076
Had it rained a lot, you would've run.

1308
00:48:10,077 --> 00:48:13,077
The rain stopped at the perfect time.

1309
00:48:13,217 --> 00:48:14,976
It's nice. The weather is nice too.

1310
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:16,387
(The rain stopped.)

1311
00:48:17,047 --> 00:48:19,647
I've always wanted to run...

1312
00:48:19,887 --> 00:48:22,287
on Jeju Island.

1313
00:48:22,687 --> 00:48:24,686
Why does it have to be today? The weather isn't even good.

1314
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:26,657
- I really want to run with you.
- What?

1315
00:48:27,257 --> 00:48:28,556
The weather isn't even good.

1316
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:30,766
But the rain stopped.

1317
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:32,226
- This is...
- I think it's fate.

1318
00:48:32,227 --> 00:48:33,436
the perfect weather for running.

1319
00:48:33,437 --> 00:48:34,636
- It's the coolest.
- The sunset.

1320
00:48:34,637 --> 00:48:36,097
- It's incredible.
- Yes.

1321
00:48:37,137 --> 00:48:39,167
- Ki Yong, don't we need to warm up?
- What?

1322
00:48:39,637 --> 00:48:40,736
Shall we warm up?

1323
00:48:40,737 --> 00:48:43,377
- Ki Yong is the instructor.
- Really?

1324
00:48:44,307 --> 00:48:46,777
- One... Okay.
- Let's turn our wrists and ankles.

1325
00:48:48,277 --> 00:48:50,017
Seo Jin, your wrists too.

1326
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:52,047
Why are we turning our wrists?

1327
00:48:52,587 --> 00:48:54,157
Just because. They're joints.

1328
00:48:54,357 --> 00:48:55,587
They're joints.

1329
00:48:56,627 --> 00:48:59,087
- Knees.
- Turn your knees.

1330
00:48:59,127 --> 00:49:00,256
- Turn your knees.
- Kwang Kyu, will you be okay?

1331
00:49:00,257 --> 00:49:01,556
Of course.

1332
00:49:01,557 --> 00:49:02,956
(Of course.)

1333
00:49:02,957 --> 00:49:04,126
Worry about yourself.

1334
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:06,097
Gosh, why are there so many flies?

1335
00:49:06,227 --> 00:49:07,836
Why are there so many flies?

1336
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:09,236
Let's sit down and stand up.

1337
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,567
One, two.

1338
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:12,666
(People groan.)

1339
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:13,676
One, two.

1340
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:14,677
(Groaning)

1341
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:22,017
(Cracking)

1342
00:49:22,977 --> 00:49:27,417
(The secretaries' health is worrisome.)

1343
00:49:27,987 --> 00:49:29,686
I think we'll need to walk.

1344
00:49:29,687 --> 00:49:31,427
- My cruciate ligament.
- We'll need to walk.

1345
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:36,327
(He continues to fight against the flies.)

1346
00:49:37,027 --> 00:49:38,296
I mean...

1347
00:49:38,297 --> 00:49:40,067
Why do all the flies come to me?

1348
00:49:41,067 --> 00:49:42,396
Shall we go?

1349
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:43,466
Shall we do that?

1350
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:44,767
Let's go slowly.

1351
00:49:45,637 --> 00:49:47,076
The nine-minute pace.

1352
00:49:47,077 --> 00:49:49,007
- Now? Okay.
- Let's go very slowly.

1353
00:49:49,777 --> 00:49:50,877
There you go.

1354
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,546
Are we running?

1355
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:55,746
- We'll run to your walking speed.
- I see.

1356
00:49:55,747 --> 00:49:57,717
- Okay.
- Walk as fast as you want.

1357
00:49:58,217 --> 00:50:01,286
- Our pacemaker is Bro Jin.
- Bro Jin.

1358
00:50:01,287 --> 00:50:02,756
We'll run to Bro Jin's walking speed.

1359
00:50:02,757 --> 00:50:03,986
I'm fast.

1360
00:50:03,987 --> 00:50:05,756
- Really? Then walk fast.
- Really?

1361
00:50:05,757 --> 00:50:06,927
We'll follow.

1362
00:50:07,427 --> 00:50:08,656
Is the beach far?

1363
00:50:08,657 --> 00:50:10,026
It's close. About 2km.

1364
00:50:10,027 --> 00:50:11,127
About 2km?

1365
00:50:13,067 --> 00:50:16,397
(Their destination is the beach that's 2km away.)

1366
00:50:16,907 --> 00:50:18,007
All right.

1367
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,677
(I'll take the lead.)

1368
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:22,677
Gosh, Ki Yong.

1369
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,307
Ki Yong, go ahead.

1370
00:50:24,747 --> 00:50:26,577
- You're cool.
- I'll go with the bros.

1371
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:30,186
His limbs are so long.

1372
00:50:30,187 --> 00:50:31,246
Our two steps will be like...

1373
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:32,317
- his one step.
- That's right.

1374
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,416
- Who was...
- Two steps versus one step.

1375
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:36,926
Who was that marathoner...

1376
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,627
with this ceremony?

1377
00:50:39,027 --> 00:50:40,097
What is he saying?

1378
00:50:40,857 --> 00:50:42,026
- I don't know.
- I'm sorry.

1379
00:50:42,027 --> 00:50:43,157
What is he saying?

1380
00:50:44,727 --> 00:50:46,796
These days, people jog to the walking speed...

1381
00:50:46,797 --> 00:50:49,237
without raising the heart rate.

1382
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:51,466
- People jog...
- My heart is about to burst.

1383
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:53,067
very slowly.

1384
00:50:53,537 --> 00:50:54,636
(Give me your bag.)

1385
00:50:54,637 --> 00:50:55,676
- I'll carry it.
- No.

1386
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,006
- I'll carry it.
- It's okay.

1387
00:50:57,007 --> 00:51:00,416
- It's okay.
- Run comfortably.

1388
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:01,477
It's okay.

1389
00:51:02,617 --> 00:51:03,917
Good.

1390
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:05,587
(Panting)

1391
00:51:07,087 --> 00:51:08,087
(Panting)

1392
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,187
(Glancing over)

1393
00:51:12,287 --> 00:51:13,297
(Sighing)

1394
00:51:14,357 --> 00:51:15,826
I can only laugh.

1395
00:51:15,827 --> 00:51:17,766
(He struggles from the start.)

1396
00:51:17,767 --> 00:51:19,297
He keeps panting behind me.

1397
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:20,467
(Sighing)

1398
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:23,307
(Meanwhile, Ki Yong)

1399
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:24,737
It's so nice.

1400
00:51:25,437 --> 00:51:26,506
Yes.

1401
00:51:26,507 --> 00:51:27,507
(Happy)

1402
00:51:28,177 --> 00:51:31,076
(Actually, My Star is a well-known runner.)

1403
00:51:31,077 --> 00:51:33,247
When we film a drama,

1404
00:51:33,977 --> 00:51:35,317
we often...

1405
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:38,217
run out of energy.

1406
00:51:39,017 --> 00:51:40,487
I try to run...

1407
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:42,717
twice a week.

1408
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,957
If I run until I sweat...

1409
00:51:45,527 --> 00:51:46,997
and take a cold shower...

1410
00:51:47,497 --> 00:51:48,827
at home,

1411
00:51:49,227 --> 00:51:50,427
I feel very refreshed.

1412
00:51:50,927 --> 00:51:52,997
People who have done it...

1413
00:51:53,437 --> 00:51:55,167
would know what I'm talking about.

1414
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:56,567
Yes.

1415
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,267
It's the sea.

1416
00:51:59,637 --> 00:52:03,377
(He runs along the beach as he films a commercial alone.)

1417
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:06,007
(His lips are pursed in determination.)

1418
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:10,387
(He begins to speed up.)

1419
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,187
I walk fast.

1420
00:52:13,617 --> 00:52:15,387
(Actually, Bro Jin...)

1421
00:52:15,517 --> 00:52:16,957
Wait for Kwang Kyu.

1422
00:52:16,987 --> 00:52:18,727
He'll come on his own.

1423
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,456
- Is it this way?
- It's this way.

1424
00:52:20,457 --> 00:52:21,527
(Walking fast)

1425
00:52:21,657 --> 00:52:24,126
One person needs to take the lead.

1426
00:52:24,127 --> 00:52:25,696
(He's the type to take the lead.)

1427
00:52:25,697 --> 00:52:27,536
Is he race-walking?

1428
00:52:27,537 --> 00:52:28,866
(His walking speed and their running speed are the same.)

1429
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:30,206
His speed is similar to ours.

1430
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:31,637
- I know.
- Yes.

1431
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,237
(Taking big steps)

1432
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:36,647
I hate running the most.

1433
00:52:37,907 --> 00:52:39,676
- How is he so fast?
- You're running well.

1434
00:52:39,677 --> 00:52:41,247
How does he walk so fast?

1435
00:52:42,817 --> 00:52:43,917
For goodness' sake.

1436
00:52:43,947 --> 00:52:45,316
You're slow.

1437
00:52:45,317 --> 00:52:46,587
(Laughing)

1438
00:52:46,957 --> 00:52:49,556
The pace dropped from 10 minutes to 9 minutes.

1439
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:50,587
What...

1440
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:52,686
Bro Jin is our pacemaker.

1441
00:52:52,687 --> 00:52:55,427
(They speed up thanks to Bro Jin's lead.)

1442
00:52:56,597 --> 00:52:58,196
Let's take a break on the bench.

1443
00:52:58,197 --> 00:52:59,527
- Come on.
- No.

1444
00:52:59,767 --> 00:53:01,866
- If it gets hard, run more slowly.
- Okay.

1445
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:02,936
Run more slowly.

1446
00:53:02,937 --> 00:53:04,106
Run more slowly.

1447
00:53:04,107 --> 00:53:05,666
(Above the running Kwang Kyu is the walking Seo Jin.)

1448
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:07,407
How does he walk so fast?

1449
00:53:08,137 --> 00:53:09,406
(Laughing)

1450
00:53:09,407 --> 00:53:10,807
He's our pacemaker.

1451
00:53:11,277 --> 00:53:12,607
On a treadmill,

1452
00:53:13,077 --> 00:53:15,617
my walking speed is about 6.5km per hour.

1453
00:53:15,977 --> 00:53:17,316
That's the perfect speed for running.

1454
00:53:17,317 --> 00:53:18,816
- It's slow.
- Hey, go back to the army.

1455
00:53:18,817 --> 00:53:21,956
If it's 6.5km per hour, it's faster than the marching speed.

1456
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:23,487
(It's faster than the marching speed.)

1457
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:24,726
Had I run,

1458
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:26,027
Kwang Kyu would've died.

1459
00:53:26,557 --> 00:53:29,357
Had I run, Kwang Kyu would've died for real.

1460
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,726
I thought it was running really fast.

1461
00:53:31,727 --> 00:53:34,237
But at that speed,

1462
00:53:34,337 --> 00:53:35,696
I can walk all day long.

1463
00:53:35,697 --> 00:53:37,367
(But at that speed, I can walk all day long.)

1464
00:53:37,537 --> 00:53:38,966
This is the 1km point. High-five.

1465
00:53:38,967 --> 00:53:40,176
- High-five.
- Good.

1466
00:53:40,177 --> 00:53:41,676
- My heart...
- Good.

1467
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:42,836
It's about to burst.

1468
00:53:42,837 --> 00:53:44,507
High five. This pace is good.

1469
00:53:44,807 --> 00:53:46,147
- Bro Jin.
- Yes?

1470
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,417
This is the 1km point.

1471
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:49,076
High-five. Good.

1472
00:53:49,077 --> 00:53:50,547
(High-five!)

1473
00:53:50,717 --> 00:53:53,287
I can't even catch a glimpse of Ki Yong.

1474
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:55,517
Ki Yong has no loyalty.

1475
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,287
You must stay healthy.

1476
00:53:59,457 --> 00:54:00,697
Dear viewers.

1477
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:02,426
(While at it, )

1478
00:54:02,427 --> 00:54:03,597
The top priority is being healthy.

1479
00:54:04,097 --> 00:54:05,296
The second is also being healthy.

1480
00:54:05,297 --> 00:54:06,737
(he promotes good health to everyone.)

1481
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:08,867
Only when you have good stamina...

1482
00:54:09,597 --> 00:54:10,867
do you have...

1483
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:12,837
the strength...

1484
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:14,507
to do anything.

1485
00:54:17,777 --> 00:54:19,477
(Ki Yong's cameraman is struggling.)

1486
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:22,817
(Promotion failed)

1487
00:54:23,147 --> 00:54:24,916
He's working out with enthusiasm.

1488
00:54:24,917 --> 00:54:26,687
- Ki Yong is already coming back.
- Here he comes.

1489
00:54:27,257 --> 00:54:28,486
What is he doing?

1490
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:29,557
Shooting a commercial?

1491
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:31,257
He's cool.

1492
00:54:31,327 --> 00:54:32,427
Above everything else...

1493
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:34,726
Is someone shooting a commercial?

1494
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:36,726
- He's cool.
- You're cool.

1495
00:54:36,727 --> 00:54:38,027
How cool.

1496
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:39,597
Let me join.

1497
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:41,497
Right now...

1498
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,066
Since that spot is pretty,

1499
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:45,337
- let's run to there...
- Okay.

1500
00:54:45,637 --> 00:54:46,707
- and then return.
- Okay.

1501
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:48,137
Are we taking a break?

1502
00:54:48,437 --> 00:54:49,437
- A break...
- No?

1503
00:54:49,438 --> 00:54:50,507
Right away without a break?

1504
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:51,876
Your heart has adjusted...

1505
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:53,147
- to this pace now.
- Okay.

1506
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:55,777
I'm okay, but Seo Jin might be tired.

1507
00:54:57,287 --> 00:54:58,887
Are you okay, Bro Jin?

1508
00:54:59,387 --> 00:55:00,616
- Seriously, Kwang Kyu.
- I bet he's also tired.

1509
00:55:00,617 --> 00:55:02,457
Aren't you walking for the first time in a while?

1510
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:03,926
Bro Jin has good basic physical strength.

1511
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:06,427
Don't you know that I walk with 10kg every day?

1512
00:55:06,627 --> 00:55:07,656
Where?

1513
00:55:07,657 --> 00:55:09,896
I walk from my house to the gym...

1514
00:55:09,897 --> 00:55:11,267
- You do?
- with a 10kg bag.

1515
00:55:12,097 --> 00:55:13,667
What's in there to be 10kg?

1516
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:15,097
Five water bottles.

1517
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:16,967
Five of the 2L water bottles.

1518
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:18,536
(Unbelievable.)

1519
00:55:18,537 --> 00:55:19,637
That's amazing.

1520
00:55:21,037 --> 00:55:23,676
That means you have good basic stamina.

1521
00:55:23,677 --> 00:55:24,947
(Bro Jin's fast walking is the result of training.)

1522
00:55:25,347 --> 00:55:26,576
Nice. Let's go.

1523
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:27,617
Give it to me.

1524
00:55:28,217 --> 00:55:29,346
Thanks.

1525
00:55:29,347 --> 00:55:31,717
(The manager's bag is being passed around My Stars.)

1526
00:55:31,987 --> 00:55:33,147
We should carry it.

1527
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:36,557
He's having a tough time.

1528
00:55:37,227 --> 00:55:38,787
I should carry it.

1529
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:41,926
(Hush.)

1530
00:55:41,927 --> 00:55:43,026
(When were you taken aback?)

1531
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:44,127
Taken aback?

1532
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:47,197
When I had to run with the clutch bag.

1533
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:49,936
Didn't it look weird...

1534
00:55:49,937 --> 00:55:51,537
with my running outfit?

1535
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,906
(A shameful past of Jang Ki Yong's fashion)

1536
00:55:53,907 --> 00:55:54,977
Bro Kyu's bag.

1537
00:55:55,337 --> 00:55:56,736
It was a flaw...

1538
00:55:56,737 --> 00:55:57,846
in my outfit.

1539
00:55:57,847 --> 00:56:00,617
The bag shouldn't have become part of it.

1540
00:56:02,017 --> 00:56:03,416
But I was carrying it.

1541
00:56:03,417 --> 00:56:05,147
(But I was carrying it.)

1542
00:56:08,017 --> 00:56:09,717
What a nice place.

1543
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:11,586
- Kwang Kyu.
- He really wants...

1544
00:56:11,587 --> 00:56:13,427
- Kwang Kyu.
- to take a break.

1545
00:56:13,927 --> 00:56:15,096
Kwang Kyu.

1546
00:56:15,097 --> 00:56:16,926
- Let's go.
- They have whole chicken soup.

1547
00:56:16,927 --> 00:56:18,527
Whole chicken soup, you know?

1548
00:56:19,267 --> 00:56:20,636
Let's have a meal...

1549
00:56:20,637 --> 00:56:21,767
and go to bed early.

1550
00:56:21,837 --> 00:56:24,537
Today is tiring.

1551
00:56:25,437 --> 00:56:26,906
(It's my first running request.)

1552
00:56:26,907 --> 00:56:28,537
Being a manager is...

1553
00:56:28,637 --> 00:56:30,876
- Being a manager is a no.
- Being a manager is a no.

1554
00:56:30,877 --> 00:56:32,606
What now?

1555
00:56:32,607 --> 00:56:33,777
(A stamina problem)

1556
00:56:33,817 --> 00:56:35,216
I'm running 2km for the 1st time...

1557
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:36,616
- in a while.
- Right?

1558
00:56:36,617 --> 00:56:39,746
(The running request must be tiresome for Bro Jin as well.)

1559
00:56:39,747 --> 00:56:42,087
Seo Jin is sweating.

1560
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:44,986
Wait for us, Bro Jin.

1561
00:56:44,987 --> 00:56:46,226
(Wait for us, Bro Jin.)

1562
00:56:46,227 --> 00:56:48,226
- Bro Jin!
- Hey, Genie!

1563
00:56:48,227 --> 00:56:49,457
Hey, Genie!

1564
00:56:50,327 --> 00:56:51,596
Seo Genie!

1565
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:55,437
(Working out has put him in a good mood.)

1566
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:56,937
(Breathing heavily)

1567
00:56:57,037 --> 00:56:58,767
It's not GiGA Genie.

1568
00:56:59,237 --> 00:57:00,237
(Breathing heavily)

1569
00:57:00,238 --> 00:57:03,007
Kwang Kyu, stop struggling so much.

1570
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:05,147
Seriously.

1571
00:57:05,207 --> 00:57:06,706
Let's go, Bro Kyu.

1572
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:09,617
(Just wait until you become my age.)

1573
00:57:10,047 --> 00:57:11,516
Open

1574
00:57:11,517 --> 00:57:13,187
- Sesame - Come on!

1575
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:15,456
- Come on.
- Open

1576
00:57:15,457 --> 00:57:17,487
- My stamina - My stamina?

1577
00:57:18,057 --> 00:57:19,756
It's opening up.

1578
00:57:19,757 --> 00:57:20,796
It's opening up.

1579
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:22,056
- My heart is opening up.
- Come on.

1580
00:57:22,057 --> 00:57:23,526
- Let's go.
- It's opening up.

1581
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,397
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1582
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:28,797
It was a shocking experience.

1583
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:31,767
All my pores were opening up.

1584
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:33,806
However...

1585
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:35,436
(However!)

1586
00:57:35,437 --> 00:57:36,877
My knees hurt right now.

1587
00:57:37,807 --> 00:57:39,407
(In pain)

1588
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,777
But as the manager,

1589
00:57:41,817 --> 00:57:43,077
I couldn't give up.

1590
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:45,747
Stop.

1591
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:49,587
It's 3km. Pausing exercise.

1592
00:57:50,187 --> 00:57:52,227
Yes, 3km!

1593
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:53,996
We did it.

1594
00:57:53,997 --> 00:57:55,756
It was my first time after getting discharged from the military.

1595
00:57:55,757 --> 00:57:57,367
We did it. Nice.

1596
00:57:57,967 --> 00:57:59,496
- We ran 3km.
- A round of applause.

1597
00:57:59,497 --> 00:58:00,696
(Even Bro Jin is happy.)

1598
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:02,696
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1599
00:58:02,697 --> 00:58:04,106
(My Star is also happy.)

1600
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:05,407
I really appreciate it.

1601
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:07,936
I'm sure...

1602
00:58:07,937 --> 00:58:09,207
it was tough on them.

1603
00:58:10,077 --> 00:58:12,207
I've always liked working out,

1604
00:58:12,377 --> 00:58:14,317
so I run before any shoot.

1605
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:15,916
Only when I recharge myself...

1606
00:58:15,917 --> 00:58:18,286
do I find that I'm able...

1607
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:20,556
to work long hours at the shooting site...

1608
00:58:20,557 --> 00:58:22,316
with good energy.

1609
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:23,957
That's what I think.

1610
00:58:24,027 --> 00:58:27,956
I have this gut feeling that I'll have good energy...

1611
00:58:27,957 --> 00:58:30,597
during tomorrow's shoot.

1612
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:32,827
- You're really cool.
- Gosh.

1613
00:58:33,497 --> 00:58:35,197
I was about to die at 1km.

1614
00:58:35,697 --> 00:58:37,337
(Glancing)

1615
00:58:37,837 --> 00:58:38,906
We ran 3km.

1616
00:58:38,907 --> 00:58:41,107
- You ran 3km without a break.
- It's no joke, right?

1617
00:58:41,337 --> 00:58:44,207
(Overflowing with friendship after the run)

1618
00:58:44,447 --> 00:58:46,806
- That's really amazing.
- The best.

1619
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:48,517
- The best.
- Really.

1620
00:58:48,577 --> 00:58:50,277
You two opened up my heart.

1621
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:52,216
Thank you.

1622
00:58:52,217 --> 00:58:54,656
Guess how good dinner will taste...

1623
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:56,117
- after the run.
- Aren't you sleepy?

1624
00:58:56,857 --> 00:58:58,327
- I'm fine.
- Really?

1625
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:02,697
I'm beat.

1626
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:04,996
- Kwang Kyu.
- Goodness.

1627
00:59:04,997 --> 00:59:06,227
It's only natural.

1628
00:59:06,967 --> 00:59:09,297
That was my first run in a while.

1629
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:12,207
Aren't you sleepy? I'm suddenly sleepy.

1630
00:59:14,337 --> 00:59:16,376
- My stamina must be good.
- What?

1631
00:59:16,377 --> 00:59:17,847
My stamina must be good.

1632
00:59:18,207 --> 00:59:19,377
You...

1633
00:59:20,347 --> 00:59:22,376
must've had some good things during your childhood.

1634
00:59:22,377 --> 00:59:23,617
(You must've had some good things during your childhood.)

1635
00:59:28,217 --> 00:59:30,157
It's like I've used up a month's worth of stamina.

1636
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,626
You worked out...

1637
00:59:31,627 --> 00:59:33,157
and even came to Jeju Island.

1638
00:59:34,257 --> 00:59:35,696
I didn't bring a massager.

1639
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,297
It would've been great for your back.

1640
00:59:37,997 --> 00:59:39,066
Where is it?

1641
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:40,936
We can massage him ourselves.

1642
00:59:40,937 --> 00:59:42,866
- Shall I? Do it now?
- I'll do it.

1643
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:43,936
- Do what?
- I...

1644
00:59:43,937 --> 00:59:45,006
Did you learn how to do it?

1645
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:47,237
- No.
- He's got a firm grip.

1646
00:59:48,377 --> 00:59:49,477
This is...

1647
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:51,477
You're super strong.

1648
00:59:52,747 --> 00:59:54,476
He has the strength of a horse.

1649
00:59:54,477 --> 00:59:57,017
(My Star's grip is no joke.)

1650
00:59:58,647 --> 01:00:00,456
Right? Isn't it a legendary massage?

1651
01:00:00,457 --> 01:00:01,757
(Massaging)

1652
01:00:02,587 --> 01:00:04,226
What does your dad do for a living?

1653
01:00:04,227 --> 01:00:05,486
What does your dad do for a living?

1654
01:00:05,487 --> 01:00:07,656
- What does your dad do?
- It's this one, right?

1655
01:00:07,657 --> 01:00:08,857
What does your dad do for a living?

1656
01:00:09,057 --> 01:00:10,466
Get in a fight with you,

1657
01:00:10,467 --> 01:00:11,726
and nobody would survive.

1658
01:00:11,727 --> 01:00:13,297
What does your dad do for a living?

1659
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,666
His father was an athlete.

1660
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:18,107
What does your dad do for a living?

1661
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:20,136
You're incredible.

1662
01:00:20,137 --> 01:00:21,607
You must be good at arm wrestling.

1663
01:00:23,777 --> 01:00:25,646
Do you need to wake up early, Eun Jin?

1664
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:26,807
- Me?
- Yes.

1665
01:00:26,907 --> 01:00:29,846
I need to get up around 5:20am tomorrow.

1666
01:00:29,847 --> 01:00:31,287
- To get ready?
- Yes.

1667
01:00:32,347 --> 01:00:33,587
What should we do, Kwang Kyu?

1668
01:00:34,017 --> 01:00:35,116
What?

1669
01:00:35,117 --> 01:00:36,587
What time will you head out for the shoot?

1670
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:39,426
I'm sure the call is at 8am.

1671
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:42,597
We should leave at 7:20am from here.

1672
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,466
- It's not bad.
- Really?

1673
01:00:44,467 --> 01:00:46,466
I thought it'd be an hour earlier...

1674
01:00:46,467 --> 01:00:47,767
since it's a sunrise shoot.

1675
01:00:48,637 --> 01:00:50,296
(What time do we leave if it's an 8am shoot?)

1676
01:00:50,297 --> 01:00:51,336
Kwang Kyu.

1677
01:00:51,337 --> 01:00:52,966
- The manager has to take her...
- Of course.

1678
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,337
- to the shoot.
- Right.

1679
01:00:54,677 --> 01:00:56,506
Is Ki Yong getting up at the same time?

1680
01:00:56,507 --> 01:00:58,747
- No, later.
- My call is at lunch.

1681
01:00:59,477 --> 01:01:00,616
That's good.

1682
01:01:00,617 --> 01:01:02,076
(Both in the morning and afternoon, )

1683
01:01:02,077 --> 01:01:03,717
(tomorrow is packed full of shoots.)

1684
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:06,117
We have about ten episodes left.

1685
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:08,257
- Ten episodes.
- You're almost done.

1686
01:01:08,817 --> 01:01:10,216
"Dynamite Kiss."

1687
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:11,257
So true.

1688
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:12,357
That was unnecessary.

1689
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:14,497
How many times did you do it in the drama?

1690
01:01:14,997 --> 01:01:16,056
A lot.

1691
01:01:16,057 --> 01:01:17,096
Ten times?

1692
01:01:17,097 --> 01:01:18,326
- Looks good.
- Over ten times.

1693
01:01:18,327 --> 01:01:19,526
- Over ten times?
- Yes.

1694
01:01:19,527 --> 01:01:20,836
- Gosh.
- That's a lot.

1695
01:01:20,837 --> 01:01:22,166
- That's a lot.
- It's good to see you.

1696
01:01:22,167 --> 01:01:23,536
That's a lot.

1697
01:01:23,537 --> 01:01:24,736
It's good to see you.

1698
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:26,107
It's like one kiss per episode.

1699
01:01:26,607 --> 01:01:27,937
We started with a kiss.

1700
01:01:28,437 --> 01:01:29,437
- In episode one?
- Yes.

1701
01:01:29,438 --> 01:01:30,607
When you two were awkward?

1702
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:32,907
A drama...

1703
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,917
with so much kissing is a first.

1704
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:37,076
- It was awkward back then.
- You already kissed in episode one.

1705
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:38,287
- Yes.
- Right?

1706
01:01:38,587 --> 01:01:40,517
- Is it an indoor shoot tomorrow?
- Yes.

1707
01:01:41,057 --> 01:01:43,157
The restaurant at a hotel.

1708
01:01:44,787 --> 01:01:46,927
- I heard you were in it.
- In what?

1709
01:01:47,297 --> 01:01:48,626
Are you joining our drama, Kwang Kyu?

1710
01:01:48,627 --> 01:01:49,956
(The main character is surprised.)

1711
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,927
As what? Weren't you just a manager?

1712
01:01:53,427 --> 01:01:56,296
Many times, managers appear in dramas as cameos...

1713
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:57,736
because there aren't enough...

1714
01:01:57,737 --> 01:01:59,567
actors or actresses on the set.

1715
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:02,276
Sometimes, the manager and stylist...

1716
01:02:02,277 --> 01:02:04,777
have to act as a couple.

1717
01:02:04,907 --> 01:02:07,446
Or a passerby in a historical drama...

1718
01:02:07,447 --> 01:02:09,016
with a fake moustache on.

1719
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,277
Those things are common.

1720
01:02:10,517 --> 01:02:12,347
(Can he really be in the drama?)

1721
01:02:12,587 --> 01:02:14,856
- Our first scene together tomorrow.
- Yes.

1722
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:15,857
- At the hotel.
- In the back...

1723
01:02:15,858 --> 01:02:18,057
A scene where we're dining at the hotel restaurant.

1724
01:02:18,757 --> 01:02:20,086
He and I can be eating...

1725
01:02:20,087 --> 01:02:21,727
at the restaurant in the back.

1726
01:02:21,927 --> 01:02:22,996
That's not bad.

1727
01:02:22,997 --> 01:02:24,566
(To be in the frame with the main characters)

1728
01:02:24,567 --> 01:02:26,766
- Right?
- What a good idea.

1729
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:28,096
- It sounds fun.
- Nice.

1730
01:02:28,097 --> 01:02:29,567
The role of enjoying breakfast.

1731
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:31,036
Getting into a fight...

1732
01:02:31,037 --> 01:02:32,207
while digging in.

1733
01:02:33,267 --> 01:02:34,376
Isn't it much better?

1734
01:02:34,377 --> 01:02:36,136
- That sounds really fun.
- Totally.

1735
01:02:36,137 --> 01:02:37,776
- I agree.
- I bet it'd be hilarious.

1736
01:02:37,777 --> 01:02:39,677
It'll be in episode one.

1737
01:02:39,707 --> 01:02:41,446
The scenes will be interesting...

1738
01:02:41,447 --> 01:02:44,047
starting from episode one.

1739
01:02:44,847 --> 01:02:46,486
- I'm loving it.
- I'm worried that...

1740
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:47,686
us being in it might ruin...

1741
01:02:47,687 --> 01:02:49,217
- the drama.
- No way.

1742
01:02:49,317 --> 01:02:51,987
(My Grumpy Secretary's dream comes true.)

1743
01:02:52,087 --> 01:02:53,157
Let's do it.

1744
01:02:54,027 --> 01:02:55,426
- Ready.
- Ready.

1745
01:02:55,427 --> 01:02:56,697
(My Grumpy Secretary's cameo request)

1746
01:02:56,727 --> 01:02:58,026
- Here.
- No.

1747
01:02:58,027 --> 01:02:59,397
(Throwing)

1748
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:01,836
(Cussing)

1749
01:03:01,837 --> 01:03:03,167
It would be a bad take if it got on camera.

1750
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,267
The scenes don't connect at all.

1751
01:03:07,607 --> 01:03:09,136
Food shot out of my mouth. Is that okay?

1752
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:10,476
Are you mad?

1753
01:03:10,477 --> 01:03:11,977
Don't you dare touch my head.

1754
01:03:12,447 --> 01:03:15,417
(Things aren't going smoothly as expected.)

1755
01:03:16,147 --> 01:03:18,046
(With My Grumpy Secretary's acting career on the line, )

1756
01:03:18,047 --> 01:03:20,957
(how will their first cameo experience go?)

1757
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:23,016
(My Star's Schedule:)

1758
01:03:23,017 --> 01:03:24,926
(5:20am, hair and makeup at the hotel)

1759
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,986
(Day 2 of My Grumpy Secretary's business trip)

1760
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:28,856
(8am, drama shoot at the "Stranger" shooting site)

1761
01:03:28,857 --> 01:03:30,496
(The drama shoot starts early morning.)

1762
01:03:30,497 --> 01:03:32,367
Are we on time? Won't we be late?

1763
01:03:32,397 --> 01:03:33,727
Let's hurry.

1764
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:36,797
The directing team...

1765
01:03:36,867 --> 01:03:38,107
What about the directing team?

1766
01:03:38,467 --> 01:03:39,836
- The directing team...
- Yes?

1767
01:03:39,837 --> 01:03:41,376
said the call was at 7am,

1768
01:03:41,377 --> 01:03:45,606
but they misinformed us as 8am.

1769
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:46,776
- For real?
- Yes.

1770
01:03:46,777 --> 01:03:48,246
- What now?
- Exactly.

1771
01:03:48,247 --> 01:03:49,947
- That's why...
- We should hurry up?

1772
01:03:50,517 --> 01:03:51,586
That's what happened.

1773
01:03:51,587 --> 01:03:52,747
Are they waiting?

1774
01:03:53,187 --> 01:03:55,616
I heard they were getting ready.

1775
01:03:55,617 --> 01:03:57,187
(Call time: 7am, Current time: 7:15am)

1776
01:03:57,827 --> 01:04:03,627
(Setting up the shooting site without Eun Jin)

1777
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:05,797
Starting at 8am...

1778
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:08,197
at a location shoot is absurd.

1779
01:04:08,797 --> 01:04:12,737
I should've checked the schedule as your manager yesterday.

1780
01:04:13,207 --> 01:04:14,676
By calling the directing team.

1781
01:04:14,677 --> 01:04:15,776
Exactly.

1782
01:04:15,777 --> 01:04:17,776
(The secretary is nervous because he knows what a drama shoot is like.)

1783
01:04:17,777 --> 01:04:21,146
A drama shoot has a call time.

1784
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:23,716
The floor director calls the manager...

1785
01:04:23,717 --> 01:04:26,346
and tells the actor to arrive by 6am, for example.

1786
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:31,527
The floor director said an hour late by mistake.

1787
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:34,357
The floor director must be on eggshells.

1788
01:04:35,697 --> 01:04:37,726
I bet he'll be roasted after the shoot today.

1789
01:04:37,727 --> 01:04:38,727
(Worried)

1790
01:04:39,027 --> 01:04:41,366
- He told us the wrong call time.
- Oh, no.

1791
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:42,537
(Restless)

1792
01:04:44,607 --> 01:04:46,237
How nice.

1793
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:48,536
- How nice of him.
- Right.

1794
01:04:48,537 --> 01:04:50,477
I should compliment him.

1795
01:04:50,707 --> 01:04:51,806
You got to sleep.

1796
01:04:51,807 --> 01:04:52,807
(I got to sleep for 1 more hour thanks to him.)

1797
01:04:54,247 --> 01:04:55,876
- You got to sleep for an hour more.
- Yes.

1798
01:04:55,877 --> 01:04:56,977
(Seo Jin's joke is making My Star smile.)

1799
01:04:57,487 --> 01:04:59,616
- Since we're late, I'll speed up.
- Okay.

1800
01:04:59,617 --> 01:05:01,757
- Fasten your seatbelt.
- Okay.

1801
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:05,827
The weather is getting worse.

1802
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:08,026
You're right.

1803
01:05:08,027 --> 01:05:10,726
- It's dark ahead.
- Gosh.

1804
01:05:10,727 --> 01:05:11,867
(Will they be able to shoot today?)

1805
01:05:12,697 --> 01:05:13,827
What's going on?

1806
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:15,237
I can't help but laugh.

1807
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:18,437
- We're not late.
- We'll still be there by 8am.

1808
01:05:18,637 --> 01:05:20,637
- We just have to be there by 8am.
- Right.

1809
01:05:21,537 --> 01:05:23,307
- The shoot must go on.
- The lead role...

1810
01:05:23,537 --> 01:05:25,006
must not be impatient.

1811
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:27,177
- Is that so?
- Really?

1812
01:05:27,517 --> 01:05:28,817
I'm impatient every day.

1813
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:32,217
"What time is it? When will we get there?"

1814
01:05:33,087 --> 01:05:35,687
"There's so much traffic. Let's leave early."

1815
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:37,726
(Thinking)

1816
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:39,257
When I was your age,

1817
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:41,897
I was extremely sensitive about going to the set.

1818
01:05:42,227 --> 01:05:43,227
What do you mean?

1819
01:05:43,927 --> 01:05:46,696
You know how one can be very sensitive about everything?

1820
01:05:46,697 --> 01:05:47,936
(Seo Jin in his 30s was sensitive on set.)

1821
01:05:47,937 --> 01:05:48,997
- About everything?
- Yes.

1822
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:51,967
As if I was about to explode.

1823
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:54,237
Really?

1824
01:05:56,037 --> 01:05:59,646
I think that tension was gone after "Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

1825
01:05:59,647 --> 01:06:00,647
Really?

1826
01:06:00,847 --> 01:06:03,776
Because it was shot for such a long time.

1827
01:06:03,777 --> 01:06:05,586
It was one of the tough ones.

1828
01:06:05,587 --> 01:06:06,686
It was taken day and night.

1829
01:06:06,687 --> 01:06:07,717
(Seo Jin the Lee San rather became laid-back.)

1830
01:06:08,857 --> 01:06:12,287
(Now I have given up.)

1831
01:06:13,087 --> 01:06:14,957
I haven't visited a drama set for such a long time.

1832
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,796
(Kids these days think Seo Jin is a comedian.)

1833
01:06:18,797 --> 01:06:20,096
I hope...

1834
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:22,237
a lot of people on set recognise you today.

1835
01:06:23,337 --> 01:06:24,437
Really? Who's there?

1836
01:06:24,607 --> 01:06:28,737
The assistant director directed "Lovers in Paris."

1837
01:06:29,507 --> 01:06:30,536
"Lovers in Paris?"

1838
01:06:30,537 --> 01:06:32,077
- Yes.
- "Lovers in Paris" is...

1839
01:06:32,307 --> 01:06:35,877
They're from that generation.

1840
01:06:36,247 --> 01:06:39,646
Gosh, "Lovers in Paris." That was so long ago.

1841
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:40,686
(Kwang Kyu also starred in "Lovers in Paris.")

1842
01:06:40,687 --> 01:06:42,486
- Exactly.
- They'd recognise you.

1843
01:06:42,487 --> 01:06:43,816
You starred in many dramas.

1844
01:06:43,817 --> 01:06:46,286
Exactly. At least one person will recognise you.

1845
01:06:46,287 --> 01:06:48,297
The thing is, I don't remember them.

1846
01:06:48,957 --> 01:06:50,327
I don't even remember the director.

1847
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:53,567
Maybe because you appeared only briefly.

1848
01:06:54,027 --> 01:06:55,237
Is that so?

1849
01:06:57,937 --> 01:06:59,766
(Staring)

1850
01:06:59,767 --> 01:07:03,007
A road like this appears in a horror story, doesn't it?

1851
01:07:03,607 --> 01:07:04,676
A road like this.

1852
01:07:04,677 --> 01:07:05,906
(Passing a road that'd appear in a horror story)

1853
01:07:05,907 --> 01:07:07,277
You'd see nothing in the end.

1854
01:07:07,477 --> 01:07:08,547
It feels strange.

1855
01:07:08,617 --> 01:07:10,047
It's a mysterious forest.

1856
01:07:10,987 --> 01:07:16,087
(Entering a foggy forest trail)

1857
01:07:17,157 --> 01:07:20,257
Do we have to go all the way in to see the production crew?

1858
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:24,127
What's with the road unpaved?

1859
01:07:27,227 --> 01:07:31,837
(A spooky unpaved road appears when they're already late.)

1860
01:07:32,437 --> 01:07:33,606
Is this...

1861
01:07:33,607 --> 01:07:35,036
(Rattling)

1862
01:07:35,037 --> 01:07:36,777
There are so many paddles.

1863
01:07:37,977 --> 01:07:39,446
Drive on this side.

1864
01:07:39,447 --> 01:07:40,477
On the edge.

1865
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:45,446
(The road is too rough to expect a filming set.)

1866
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:46,617
We're hitting the grass as we go.

1867
01:07:47,587 --> 01:07:48,617
That...

1868
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:53,087
Are we going in the right direction?

1869
01:07:54,127 --> 01:07:55,497
According to the GPS, yes.

1870
01:07:57,457 --> 01:07:58,797
Is it here?

1871
01:08:01,197 --> 01:08:02,966
Because my phone says...

1872
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:04,866
- It's not here?
- It's lost.

1873
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:05,907
- What?
- It's lost.

1874
01:08:07,437 --> 01:08:12,177
(If they get lost when they're already late, they can't go back.)

1875
01:08:12,947 --> 01:08:17,317
(Her fingers are in a rush.)

1876
01:08:18,217 --> 01:08:23,057
(It's an endless desolate forest trail.)

1877
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:28,297
I see something blinking.

1878
01:08:28,957 --> 01:08:30,827
- You see something blinking?
- There it is.

1879
01:08:32,427 --> 01:08:34,796
Blinking... You see me? Okay.

1880
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:36,267
(The production crew's car in the distance)

1881
01:08:36,937 --> 01:08:38,236
What if we turned out to be at a wrong place?

1882
01:08:38,237 --> 01:08:39,267
(Laid-back enough to joke)

1883
01:08:39,607 --> 01:08:40,706
Gosh.

1884
01:08:40,707 --> 01:08:42,507
(Relieved to find the right place)

1885
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:44,906
Oh, it's a big shoot.

1886
01:08:44,907 --> 01:08:46,607
(A little nervous)

1887
01:08:47,007 --> 01:08:49,046
- Let's hop off first.
- Let's get there first.

1888
01:08:49,047 --> 01:08:50,576
Only then I'll be relieved.

1889
01:08:50,577 --> 01:08:51,716
Thank you.

1890
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:55,617
(Quickly opening the door for My Star)

1891
01:08:57,857 --> 01:08:59,326
It'll be done soon, right?

1892
01:08:59,327 --> 01:09:01,096
(Eun Jin in a rush quickly follows the staff to the set.)

1893
01:09:01,097 --> 01:09:03,356
- I'll explain the route on the way.
- Sounds good.

1894
01:09:03,357 --> 01:09:05,326
- You have to start from here.
- Okay.

1895
01:09:05,327 --> 01:09:08,966
While walking, you'll see the tourists.

1896
01:09:08,967 --> 01:09:11,536
Then grab your phone...

1897
01:09:11,537 --> 01:09:14,876
(The secretaries enter the set after her.)

1898
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:16,607
Get ready for the rehearsal.

1899
01:09:18,577 --> 01:09:19,577
- Why...
- They're shooting already?

1900
01:09:19,747 --> 01:09:21,046
- We...
- When we just arrived?

1901
01:09:21,047 --> 01:09:22,277
It's a rehearsal.

1902
01:09:22,877 --> 01:09:24,046
Here we go.

1903
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:25,516
(Upon Eun Jin's arrival, )

1904
01:09:25,517 --> 01:09:27,756
- Ready!
- Action.

1905
01:09:27,757 --> 01:09:29,117
(the rehearsal begins.)

1906
01:09:30,217 --> 01:09:33,587
(Rehearsing the scene for today)

1907
01:09:35,427 --> 01:09:36,696
Okay.

1908
01:09:36,697 --> 01:09:39,897
- Hello.
- Hello.

1909
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:42,536
I had the rehearsal first. Hello.

1910
01:09:42,537 --> 01:09:43,637
(Director Kim Jae Hyeon, Scriptor Ha Hyeon Jeong)

1911
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,207
We might as well pass now.

1912
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:48,536
- I don't know.
- Seo Jin.

1913
01:09:48,537 --> 01:09:51,447
You can keep going straight.

1914
01:09:53,507 --> 01:09:56,047
(What are they doing here?)

1915
01:09:56,377 --> 01:09:59,717
(Awkward, embarrassed)

1916
01:10:00,187 --> 01:10:02,086
(It's their first time visiting the set as managers.)

1917
01:10:02,087 --> 01:10:03,587
(Reading the room)

1918
01:10:05,857 --> 01:10:07,057
Hello.

1919
01:10:07,897 --> 01:10:08,897
Hello.

1920
01:10:09,927 --> 01:10:12,067
- Hello.
- Hello.

1921
01:10:12,227 --> 01:10:14,636
Oh, my. Hello.

1922
01:10:14,637 --> 01:10:16,266
Hello.

1923
01:10:16,267 --> 01:10:17,366
Hello.

1924
01:10:17,367 --> 01:10:19,867
(Passing the camera awkwardly)

1925
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,506
She joined "Boys Over Flowers."

1926
01:10:23,507 --> 01:10:24,647
(She joined "Boys Over Flowers" in 2009.)

1927
01:10:25,077 --> 01:10:26,177
That's a long time ago.

1928
01:10:27,947 --> 01:10:29,216
We worked together.

1929
01:10:29,217 --> 01:10:31,086
See? I knew it.

1930
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:32,087
I knew you'd meet someone you worked together.

1931
01:10:32,088 --> 01:10:34,516
- We did "Oh! My Lady" together.
- What's that?

1932
01:10:34,517 --> 01:10:35,786
You did "Oh! My Lady" together.

1933
01:10:35,787 --> 01:10:38,327
"Oh! My Lady." Oh, you're old.

1934
01:10:38,727 --> 01:10:41,197
Hey, you were still alive?

1935
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:42,527
(He's glad to see her.)

1936
01:10:43,157 --> 01:10:45,066
(He doesn't remember her as just expected.)

1937
01:10:45,067 --> 01:10:46,327
I knew it.

1938
01:10:46,827 --> 01:10:50,497
Manager. Can you record the monitor?

1939
01:10:50,737 --> 01:10:51,867
Okay.

1940
01:10:53,307 --> 01:10:56,076
Can you check the monitor...

1941
01:10:56,077 --> 01:10:57,276
and give me advice on acting?

1942
01:10:57,277 --> 01:10:59,747
- Hey, you're the lead role...
- Thank you.

1943
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:01,447
Seo Jin should do it.

1944
01:11:03,577 --> 01:11:06,246
(Heading to watch the monitor)

1945
01:11:06,247 --> 01:11:07,347
Okay.

1946
01:11:08,117 --> 01:11:09,616
- Walk this way.
- Okay.

1947
01:11:09,617 --> 01:11:10,887
(What is Eun Jin filming here?)

1948
01:11:11,057 --> 01:11:14,956
Her sister disappeared with the rent deposit.

1949
01:11:14,957 --> 01:11:15,957
(Da Rim is out to find her sister who disappeared.)

1950
01:11:15,958 --> 01:11:18,197
She got a call after a year.

1951
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,096
"Your sister's here." So she's here to find her.

1952
01:11:21,097 --> 01:11:23,197
(The guide tells Da Rim where she can meet her sister.)

1953
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,306
(My Star is ready.)

1954
01:11:25,307 --> 01:11:26,307
Ready.

1955
01:11:26,807 --> 01:11:28,306
Out there, ready?

1956
01:11:28,307 --> 01:11:29,307
- Yes.
- Yes.

1957
01:11:29,308 --> 01:11:30,406
(Ready to film the monitor)

1958
01:11:30,407 --> 01:11:32,106
- One, two, action.
- Action.

1959
01:11:32,107 --> 01:11:33,507
It's for a picture.

1960
01:11:34,177 --> 01:11:36,077
(You have to film that.)

1961
01:11:37,477 --> 01:11:40,817
(Quickly switching to a video mode)

1962
01:11:42,957 --> 01:11:44,456
- Ready.
- Ready.

1963
01:11:44,457 --> 01:11:46,157
- One, two, action.
- Action.

1964
01:11:46,587 --> 01:11:49,757
Let's meet here after 30 minutes.

1965
01:11:49,997 --> 01:11:51,397
Make sure to be back on time.

1966
01:11:51,627 --> 01:11:52,727
- Okay.
- Okay.

1967
01:11:54,127 --> 01:11:55,167
Da Jung.

1968
01:11:55,197 --> 01:11:57,396
What's the matter?

1969
01:11:57,397 --> 01:12:00,767
I'm sorry.

1970
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:07,277
(When she realises it's not her sister, she goes back.)

1971
01:12:07,477 --> 01:12:09,076
- Good. Let's try one more time.
- One more time.

1972
01:12:09,077 --> 01:12:11,017
- Okay.
- Back to your positions.

1973
01:12:12,017 --> 01:12:14,047
No need to see it. You were good.

1974
01:12:14,217 --> 01:12:15,417
Oh, did you monitor it?

1975
01:12:16,417 --> 01:12:19,626
(Feeling proud to present the monitor recording)

1976
01:12:19,627 --> 01:12:20,756
Watch out for the equipment.

1977
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:23,026
(Monitoring thoroughly)

1978
01:12:23,027 --> 01:12:24,996
I think I could've done better. What do you think?

1979
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:27,727
Me? I think it was perfect.

1980
01:12:29,697 --> 01:12:31,306
I should work hard and...

1981
01:12:31,307 --> 01:12:32,307
(She could've done better?)

1982
01:12:32,637 --> 01:12:35,437
(His eyes are moving fast.)

1983
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:39,847
- The next scene...
- When you call Da Jung,

1984
01:12:41,517 --> 01:12:46,047
are you excited to see her?

1985
01:12:46,817 --> 01:12:49,486
- "You brat." - Or are you like, "Da Jung! You!"

1986
01:12:49,487 --> 01:12:50,816
- What? So I'm...
- Are you acting?

1987
01:12:50,817 --> 01:12:52,356
I'm asking about her emotion.

1988
01:12:52,357 --> 01:12:53,387
(That's not it.)

1989
01:12:53,887 --> 01:12:55,357
- "Here you are." - Even if it's just a name,

1990
01:12:55,657 --> 01:12:57,056
- You're right.
- it's...

1991
01:12:57,057 --> 01:12:58,227
I missed it.

1992
01:12:58,467 --> 01:13:01,697
You might be glad to see her and go, "Da Jung!"

1993
01:13:03,097 --> 01:13:05,467
- Or...
- Or you could go, "Da Jung."

1994
01:13:05,707 --> 01:13:08,676
- "Da Jung." - When you approach her...

1995
01:13:08,677 --> 01:13:09,706
(Why are you asking me for Da Jung?)

1996
01:13:09,707 --> 01:13:12,807
When you said sorry,

1997
01:13:15,617 --> 01:13:18,817
- you should've taken a break.
- I should've paused.

1998
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:21,586
- It's a bummer.
- You rushed to leave.

1999
01:13:21,587 --> 01:13:22,587
- You're right.
- Yes.

2000
01:13:25,827 --> 01:13:26,957
- Just as expected.
- So...

2001
01:13:27,657 --> 01:13:31,467
you have to make this scene yours before you leave the frame.

2002
01:13:31,797 --> 01:13:33,866
- Why don't you show us?
- What should I do?

2003
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,866
After you apologise...

2004
01:13:35,867 --> 01:13:38,036
(Itching)

2005
01:13:38,037 --> 01:13:39,736
You have to go find her.

2006
01:13:39,737 --> 01:13:40,866
- So you should pause...
- She knew it.

2007
01:13:40,867 --> 01:13:42,406
before you leave.

2008
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:43,407
(Nodding)

2009
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:44,776
Don't be impatient.

2010
01:13:44,777 --> 01:13:46,676
Even if you're in a rush...

2011
01:13:46,677 --> 01:13:49,276
- I need to show first...
- Leaving isn't a priority.

2012
01:13:49,277 --> 01:13:50,376
- before I leave.
- You need to show first...

2013
01:13:50,377 --> 01:13:51,517
before you leave.

2014
01:13:51,587 --> 01:13:52,686
- You're right.
- Yes.

2015
01:13:52,687 --> 01:13:55,187
Even in this brief scene?

2016
01:13:56,157 --> 01:13:58,487
Of course, Kwang Kyu. That's the point of the bust scene.

2017
01:13:59,927 --> 01:14:01,597
I wouldn't know.

2018
01:14:03,557 --> 01:14:05,167
(Smacking his lips)

2019
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:06,397
Isn't that ridiculous?

2020
01:14:07,227 --> 01:14:08,337
Who does he think he is?

2021
01:14:09,297 --> 01:14:10,366
(Glancing over)

2022
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:11,367
And...

2023
01:14:12,107 --> 01:14:14,706
Seo Jin wasn't like that before.

2024
01:14:14,707 --> 01:14:15,806
(He begins gossiping.)

2025
01:14:15,807 --> 01:14:19,477
Now that he's getting old, he sounds like an academic advisor.

2026
01:14:19,647 --> 01:14:21,717
He keeps trying to lecture.

2027
01:14:22,247 --> 01:14:24,046
I was surprised to see him showing examples.

2028
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,446
(He doesn't like how Seo Jin gives advice on acting.)

2029
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:26,987
I thought he was an acting professor.

2030
01:14:28,617 --> 01:14:31,087
(Waiting to monitor again)

2031
01:14:31,357 --> 01:14:33,256
One, two, three, and we go.

2032
01:14:33,257 --> 01:14:35,157
(Seo Jin is serious about giving tips on acting.)

2033
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:38,167
- Ready, action.
- Action.

2034
01:14:38,527 --> 01:14:40,097
Make sure to be back on time.

2035
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:44,867
Go Da Jung, you...

2036
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:47,367
Who are you?

2037
01:14:47,737 --> 01:14:50,476
I'm sorry.

2038
01:14:50,477 --> 01:14:53,447
(Pause before you leave the frame.)

2039
01:14:56,517 --> 01:14:57,816
Yes! Okay.

2040
01:14:57,817 --> 01:14:59,387
Good. Let's move on to the next scene.

2041
01:15:00,587 --> 01:15:02,216
- It's taken.
- Yes.

2042
01:15:02,217 --> 01:15:03,856
(Genie feels proud.)

2043
01:15:03,857 --> 01:15:05,427
Let's move on to the next scene!

2044
01:15:05,757 --> 01:15:07,286
You might start directing.

2045
01:15:07,287 --> 01:15:08,757
- What?
- You might start directing.

2046
01:15:09,757 --> 01:15:12,166
- Out.
- Run!

2047
01:15:12,167 --> 01:15:15,966
(With light steps, he goes to hold the umbrella for My Star.)

2048
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:18,407
How was it this time? Was it better?

2049
01:15:19,937 --> 01:15:22,337
- Give me some praise.
- You're doing really well.

2050
01:15:23,937 --> 01:15:25,007
I got a compliment.

2051
01:15:25,647 --> 01:15:27,676
(Showing his dimples)

2052
01:15:27,677 --> 01:15:30,447
It's like talking to a partner.

2053
01:15:30,977 --> 01:15:33,717
It's the most fun when you talk about this during filming.

2054
01:15:35,057 --> 01:15:36,057
Is it fun?

2055
01:15:36,058 --> 01:15:37,387
(My Star thinks my acting care is fun.)

2056
01:15:37,887 --> 01:15:38,926
Isn't it right?

2057
01:15:38,927 --> 01:15:40,527
(Feeling unhappy)

2058
01:15:40,987 --> 01:15:44,457
(Coming near)

2059
01:15:44,827 --> 01:15:46,796
Why are you slowly coming in?

2060
01:15:46,797 --> 01:15:49,196
I came to see if you need anything.

2061
01:15:49,197 --> 01:15:51,567
Stop lying. You came under the umbrella.

2062
01:15:52,307 --> 01:15:53,307
Hey.

2063
01:15:54,007 --> 01:15:56,236
It's natural for the manager to stay close to the star.

2064
01:15:56,237 --> 01:15:57,337
You can wear a raincoat.

2065
01:15:58,977 --> 01:16:01,146
Please say hi to the behind-the-scenes camera.

2066
01:16:01,147 --> 01:16:02,346
- Hi.
- Where?

2067
01:16:02,347 --> 01:16:03,417
- This one?
- Yes.

2068
01:16:03,877 --> 01:16:05,147
Hello.

2069
01:16:05,647 --> 01:16:06,946
I'm Kim Kwang Kyu,

2070
01:16:06,947 --> 01:16:08,257
- the singer with two albums.
- Two albums...

2071
01:16:09,157 --> 01:16:12,257
I'm here as Ahn Eun Jin's one-day manager.

2072
01:16:13,387 --> 01:16:15,997
This is my assistant.

2073
01:16:16,327 --> 01:16:17,427
- Lee Seo Jin.
- An assistant?

2074
01:16:17,997 --> 01:16:19,397
(He introduces him the way he wants.)

2075
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:21,567
Assistant! Hold the umbrella well.

2076
01:16:22,997 --> 01:16:24,937
(Moving)

2077
01:16:26,537 --> 01:16:28,737
(It's a childish fight between men with an average age of 55.5.)

2078
01:16:29,237 --> 01:16:30,736
(Da Rim hears the place where she can meet...)

2079
01:16:30,737 --> 01:16:32,246
(her sister from a fellow guide.)

2080
01:16:32,247 --> 01:16:34,146
Let's get ready. Let's begin.

2081
01:16:34,147 --> 01:16:36,016
Ready.

2082
01:16:36,017 --> 01:16:40,517
(Seo Jin is ready to take care of her acting.)

2083
01:16:42,587 --> 01:16:44,387
- Ready, action!
- Action!

2084
01:16:45,757 --> 01:16:46,787
Excuse me!

2085
01:16:47,687 --> 01:16:48,827
Yes.

2086
01:16:48,997 --> 01:16:51,697
Are you looking for Guide Go Da Jung?

2087
01:16:53,227 --> 01:16:54,897
Do you know my sister?

2088
01:16:54,997 --> 01:16:57,396
Yes. She's my colleague.

2089
01:16:57,397 --> 01:16:59,767
Then could you tell me her address?

2090
01:17:00,337 --> 01:17:01,506
I don't know where she lives.

2091
01:17:01,507 --> 01:17:02,537
(Focusing)

2092
01:17:04,677 --> 01:17:05,777
Cut!

2093
01:17:06,007 --> 01:17:07,606
Let's do it again.

2094
01:17:07,607 --> 01:17:08,916
Here.

2095
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,076
(The acting caretaker comes with an umbrella after every cut.)

2096
01:17:10,077 --> 01:17:11,447
Please move on.

2097
01:17:11,987 --> 01:17:12,987
You know,

2098
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:14,747
if you turn around as soon as she says, "Excuse me,"

2099
01:17:14,957 --> 01:17:18,057
it feels like you've been waiting for it. So when she calls you...

2100
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:21,086
(Not sure)

2101
01:17:21,087 --> 01:17:22,996
Act like you're saying, "Me?"

2102
01:17:22,997 --> 01:17:24,796
- Like that.
- Something like that.

2103
01:17:24,797 --> 01:17:27,097
Right? When she talks about Da Jung, you get shocked.

2104
01:17:28,197 --> 01:17:29,366
"Do you know Da Jung?"

2105
01:17:29,367 --> 01:17:30,797
"Do you also know her address?"

2106
01:17:31,737 --> 01:17:33,737
"All right." Like that.

2107
01:17:34,367 --> 01:17:38,406
Your emotion should keep moving like this.

2108
01:17:38,407 --> 01:17:41,046
It should keep going up and down. That way, the viewers...

2109
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:43,817
- Right.
- can also enjoy it.

2110
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:45,147
He's excited.

2111
01:17:45,947 --> 01:17:46,947
He's like...

2112
01:17:46,987 --> 01:17:47,987
(Laughing)

2113
01:17:48,817 --> 01:17:50,617
(He's not happy.)

2114
01:17:53,827 --> 01:17:55,096
Where's the monitor?

2115
01:17:55,097 --> 01:17:56,357
(Anyway)

2116
01:17:57,027 --> 01:17:59,767
(He heads to check the monitor.)

2117
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:02,597
(He found the monitor!)

2118
01:18:03,597 --> 01:18:05,307
(He puts down the umbrella for a moment.)

2119
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,937
(Looking for something)

2120
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:11,546
(He's ready to record the monitor.)

2121
01:18:11,547 --> 01:18:13,746
Please fold the umbrella.

2122
01:18:13,747 --> 01:18:14,846
Let's start.

2123
01:18:14,847 --> 01:18:17,316
- Please fold the umbrella.
- Fold the umbrella.

2124
01:18:17,317 --> 01:18:18,347
Let's start.

2125
01:18:19,187 --> 01:18:20,917
(Looking around)

2126
01:18:20,987 --> 01:18:23,756
(Are you talking about my umbrella?)

2127
01:18:23,757 --> 01:18:25,786
Okay. Ready!

2128
01:18:25,787 --> 01:18:27,556
(He moves it near him.)

2129
01:18:27,557 --> 01:18:28,657
- Action!
- Action!

2130
01:18:32,597 --> 01:18:34,937
(Click)

2131
01:18:35,097 --> 01:18:37,237
(Exclaiming)

2132
01:18:37,997 --> 01:18:40,937
(He tends to repeat the same mistakes.)

2133
01:18:41,607 --> 01:18:42,777
I was so flustered.

2134
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:44,407
(Laughing)

2135
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:47,647
I realised it was a photo.

2136
01:18:48,217 --> 01:18:49,317
(Feeling embarrassed)

2137
01:18:50,977 --> 01:18:54,517
(He quickly sets it to video recording.)

2138
01:18:56,957 --> 01:18:58,086
(He's startled.)

2139
01:18:58,087 --> 01:19:00,257
(Get it together.)

2140
01:19:00,757 --> 01:19:04,457
(It's his first time monitoring My Star's acting.)

2141
01:19:05,227 --> 01:19:09,197
(Kwang Kyu is still adjusting.)

2142
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:14,107
(11am, the location of the next scene)

2143
01:19:15,077 --> 01:19:17,076
Hello. I'm Jang Ki Yong.

2144
01:19:17,077 --> 01:19:18,136
(Ki Yong turned on his self camera.)

2145
01:19:18,137 --> 01:19:21,047
I just got my hair and makeup done.

2146
01:19:23,077 --> 01:19:24,446
This is Gong Ji Hyeok's outfit.

2147
01:19:24,447 --> 01:19:26,487
(From "Dynamite Kiss")

2148
01:19:29,357 --> 01:19:30,387
It looks very nice, right?

2149
01:19:30,887 --> 01:19:32,357
(Laughing awkwardly)

2150
01:19:33,187 --> 01:19:35,156
I hope you like it.

2151
01:19:35,157 --> 01:19:36,426
Bye.

2152
01:19:36,427 --> 01:19:37,457
(He'll head to the filming site.)

2153
01:19:38,157 --> 01:19:41,666
(My Grumpy Secretaries also arrive...)

2154
01:19:41,667 --> 01:19:45,207
(at the hotel lobby where people are busy preparing to film.)

2155
01:19:46,107 --> 01:19:48,506
(My Stars who are getting ready)

2156
01:19:48,507 --> 01:19:50,106
(Warm and friendly)

2157
01:19:50,107 --> 01:19:51,276
The atmosphere is nice.

2158
01:19:51,277 --> 01:19:52,947
- What?
- The atmosphere is nice.

2159
01:19:53,047 --> 01:19:55,877
(He finds My Grumpy Secretaries.)

2160
01:20:01,317 --> 01:20:02,386
(He's glad to see them.)

2161
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:04,017
- Did you eat?
- I did.

2162
01:20:04,157 --> 01:20:05,186
What did you eat?

2163
01:20:05,187 --> 01:20:06,927
I had seaweed soup with sea urchin.

2164
01:20:07,457 --> 01:20:08,957
- You ate well.
- You ate well.

2165
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:13,797
(Eun Jin is doing a final line check.)

2166
01:20:14,297 --> 01:20:18,337
(Peeking around)

2167
01:20:22,007 --> 01:20:23,007
(The Caretaker Fairy hands him some water.)

2168
01:20:23,008 --> 01:20:24,136
Thank you.

2169
01:20:24,137 --> 01:20:25,676
You should drink water.

2170
01:20:25,677 --> 01:20:29,977
(My Star smiles brightly.)

2171
01:20:30,517 --> 01:20:32,316
(Feeling proud)

2172
01:20:32,317 --> 01:20:34,987
Who prepared this mirror?

2173
01:20:35,287 --> 01:20:38,156
It's my designated mirror.

2174
01:20:38,157 --> 01:20:39,387
It's your mirror?

2175
01:20:39,657 --> 01:20:41,086
I've never seen a heart-shaped mirror.

2176
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:43,296
(My Star likes heart-shaped mirrors.)

2177
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:44,696
Is there anything you need?

2178
01:20:44,697 --> 01:20:45,697
(Asking politely)

2179
01:20:45,698 --> 01:20:47,067
I'll do it.

2180
01:20:48,597 --> 01:20:52,837
(Ki Yong feels like he should do everything himself again.)

2181
01:20:53,507 --> 01:20:55,177
- It's hot.
- It's hot.

2182
01:20:56,537 --> 01:20:58,307
(Glancing)

2183
01:20:58,707 --> 01:21:00,547
When this was on while I had a small role...

2184
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:04,246
(A fan care for My Star)

2185
01:21:04,247 --> 01:21:06,716
You should wear a suit even on regular days.

2186
01:21:06,717 --> 01:21:08,246
- Me?
- Yes.

2187
01:21:08,247 --> 01:21:09,817
Your back looks so great.

2188
01:21:11,017 --> 01:21:14,587
(A complimenting service for My Star)

2189
01:21:16,227 --> 01:21:17,357
Let's start.

2190
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,826
(The first scene at the hotel...)

2191
01:21:19,827 --> 01:21:21,266
One, two, action.

2192
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:22,596
(begins.)

2193
01:21:22,597 --> 01:21:24,366
Are you kidding me?

2194
01:21:24,367 --> 01:21:26,806
My heart may be warm, but my temper is fiery.

2195
01:21:26,807 --> 01:21:28,237
Do you want to see it?

2196
01:21:29,537 --> 01:21:31,337
Yes. Okay. That's good.

2197
01:21:31,977 --> 01:21:33,606
Yes. Okay. That's good.

2198
01:21:33,607 --> 01:21:34,706
(Thanks to their care, they finish the scene at once.)

2199
01:21:34,707 --> 01:21:37,477
Let's walk all the way.

2200
01:21:37,617 --> 01:21:41,857
It's Seo Jin and Kwang Kyu's scene.

2201
01:21:42,357 --> 01:21:44,587
When they leave...

2202
01:21:44,657 --> 01:21:47,556
(Full...)

2203
01:21:47,557 --> 01:21:50,557
(of anticipation)

2204
01:21:53,627 --> 01:21:55,167
You have to come in.

2205
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:57,736
You have to come in.

2206
01:21:57,737 --> 01:21:59,106
(Breathing out)

2207
01:21:59,107 --> 01:22:00,237
Come in.

2208
01:22:00,407 --> 01:22:02,176
(Even actors with a combined 52 years of experience...)

2209
01:22:02,177 --> 01:22:04,007
(get nervous when it comes to acting.)

2210
01:22:04,337 --> 01:22:06,047
I should at least do that. What else could I do?

2211
01:22:06,207 --> 01:22:07,477
I should at least do that.

2212
01:22:08,617 --> 01:22:09,717
You're working hard.

2213
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:13,646
I don't know if I'm working hard,

2214
01:22:13,647 --> 01:22:15,287
but I should at least do things like that.

2215
01:22:17,087 --> 01:22:18,857
I'm overwhelmed with emotions.

2216
01:22:20,627 --> 01:22:22,156
It reminds me of the past.

2217
01:22:22,157 --> 01:22:23,256
(Emotional)

2218
01:22:23,257 --> 01:22:24,927
Eun Jin used to be my junior.

2219
01:22:26,427 --> 01:22:29,397
(They awkwardly enter the set.)

2220
01:22:30,337 --> 01:22:31,807
Have you eaten?

2221
01:22:32,067 --> 01:22:33,366
- Hello.
- Have you eaten?

2222
01:22:33,367 --> 01:22:34,367
Yes.

2223
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,907
(Respected cameo actors with a combined 52 years of experience)

2224
01:22:37,237 --> 01:22:40,347
I heard many details were added.

2225
01:22:40,907 --> 01:22:44,147
(Details?)

2226
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:47,217
You two are a couple.

2227
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:51,387
(You two are a couple.)

2228
01:22:51,887 --> 01:22:53,356
- Yes.
- Are we gay?

2229
01:22:53,357 --> 01:22:54,427
Yes.

2230
01:22:54,587 --> 01:22:56,496
So you can just kiss if you want.

2231
01:22:56,497 --> 01:22:57,626
- Really?
- Yes.

2232
01:22:57,627 --> 01:22:58,767
He's flustered.

2233
01:22:58,997 --> 01:23:00,226
I'm counting on you.

2234
01:23:00,227 --> 01:23:01,227
(A love aspect was added to the shot without a script.)

2235
01:23:01,228 --> 01:23:04,897
(It's the first attempt in his acting career.)

2236
01:23:05,607 --> 01:23:08,876
("Dynamite Kiss")

2237
01:23:08,877 --> 01:23:10,236
(Hotel, in the morning)

2238
01:23:10,237 --> 01:23:11,736
(Da Rim, Ji Hyeok, and Grumpy Secretary...)

2239
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:13,277
(eat breakfast at the hotel.)

2240
01:23:13,647 --> 01:23:17,517
(The Seo Jin and Kwang Kyu couple bicker between Da Rim and Ji Hyeok.)

2241
01:23:17,977 --> 01:23:21,617
(Da Rim notices Ji Hyeok who is talking on the phone.)

2242
01:23:21,917 --> 01:23:25,056
(Seo Jin and Kwang Kyu leave while bickering.)

2243
01:23:25,057 --> 01:23:27,726
When the camera reaches this point,

2244
01:23:27,727 --> 01:23:29,226
you can leave.

2245
01:23:29,227 --> 01:23:31,156
Here? When it reaches the chair?

2246
01:23:31,157 --> 01:23:33,166
- Yes. Let's do a rehearsal.
- All right.

2247
01:23:33,167 --> 01:23:34,226
Okay.

2248
01:23:34,227 --> 01:23:35,267
(She watches it from the front row.)

2249
01:23:35,737 --> 01:23:38,507
(I'll be watching right in front of you.)

2250
01:23:39,767 --> 01:23:42,637
(He entertains My Stars for a bit.)

2251
01:23:43,137 --> 01:23:45,977
(She's very satisfied.)

2252
01:23:46,447 --> 01:23:49,617
(The shoot will be 100 percent improvised like this.)

2253
01:23:50,177 --> 01:23:52,947
- Let's go. Ready...
- Ready!

2254
01:23:53,817 --> 01:23:56,056
- Action!
- Action!

2255
01:23:56,057 --> 01:23:57,087
(Take 1, action)

2256
01:23:58,927 --> 01:24:00,557
Stop eating.

2257
01:24:00,727 --> 01:24:01,957
Honey.

2258
01:24:02,327 --> 01:24:03,457
Are you mad?

2259
01:24:04,927 --> 01:24:06,997
He's so grumpy.

2260
01:24:08,297 --> 01:24:12,107
(The couple act is being created on the spot.)

2261
01:24:13,707 --> 01:24:15,437
(He prepares to leave.)

2262
01:24:15,507 --> 01:24:16,507
(Hitting)

2263
01:24:17,277 --> 01:24:18,907
Get up.

2264
01:24:19,647 --> 01:24:21,917
(It gets spit out.)

2265
01:24:26,017 --> 01:24:29,157
(They're on a no-laughing challenge.)

2266
01:24:29,817 --> 01:24:32,356
(He's flustered.)

2267
01:24:32,357 --> 01:24:34,856
Honey.

2268
01:24:34,857 --> 01:24:37,697
(He continues acting until the end.)

2269
01:24:40,027 --> 01:24:44,097
(His excessive ad-lib caused trouble.)

2270
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:48,707
(He's worried that it would be a failed take.)

2271
01:24:49,737 --> 01:24:52,776
(Why did you hit me at that moment?)

2272
01:24:52,777 --> 01:24:55,647
(Laughing)

2273
01:24:56,747 --> 01:24:59,847
(Fortunately, Ki Yong didn't see him spit out the food.)

2274
01:25:00,787 --> 01:25:04,487
(He dominates the atmosphere with his steady acting.)

2275
01:25:05,957 --> 01:25:07,626
Okay.

2276
01:25:07,627 --> 01:25:08,627
We're good.

2277
01:25:09,797 --> 01:25:10,957
That was okay?

2278
01:25:11,597 --> 01:25:13,227
I spit out everything.

2279
01:25:14,627 --> 01:25:17,196
I don't think they'll be able to use it because of the food.

2280
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:18,197
(The cut received an okay sign, but it keeps bothering him.)

2281
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:19,937
I spit out the food. Is that all right?

2282
01:25:20,067 --> 01:25:21,067
It was amazing.

2283
01:25:21,068 --> 01:25:22,236
- It was amazing.
- What?

2284
01:25:22,237 --> 01:25:23,337
It was amazing.

2285
01:25:24,277 --> 01:25:28,377
(I received an okay sign from My Director.)

2286
01:25:29,047 --> 01:25:30,876
Acting like a couple wasn't hard, right?

2287
01:25:30,877 --> 01:25:35,586
I want it to be more caring and warm.

2288
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:37,487
I can't overcome that even with acting.

2289
01:25:38,757 --> 01:25:40,326
I can't overcome that even with acting.

2290
01:25:40,327 --> 01:25:41,356
(Even if it's acting, that's a bit...)

2291
01:25:41,357 --> 01:25:42,357
Why don't you feed each other?

2292
01:25:42,358 --> 01:25:43,496
No. I can't do that.

2293
01:25:43,497 --> 01:25:44,856
(Even if it's My Star's request...)

2294
01:25:44,857 --> 01:25:48,426
- One more time...
- Let's get ready now.

2295
01:25:48,427 --> 01:25:49,436
(The director surely said it was amazing.)

2296
01:25:49,437 --> 01:25:50,597
Let's begin.

2297
01:25:51,037 --> 01:25:52,366
(I'm still hungry for more.)

2298
01:25:52,367 --> 01:25:54,407
- Are we doing it again?
- Yes.

2299
01:25:55,137 --> 01:25:57,176
(What ad-lib should I do this time?)

2300
01:25:57,177 --> 01:25:58,306
- Okay.
- Let's get ready.

2301
01:25:58,307 --> 01:26:00,947
What if you feed me,

2302
01:26:02,317 --> 01:26:03,747
and I spit it out on you?

2303
01:26:04,947 --> 01:26:06,617
That would be a bad take.

2304
01:26:06,917 --> 01:26:09,256
(Between My Stars...)

2305
01:26:09,257 --> 01:26:12,187
(who trust their seniors, )

2306
01:26:12,387 --> 01:26:13,856
(what will Grumpy Secretaries show them?)

2307
01:26:13,857 --> 01:26:15,856
Give me the sausage.

2308
01:26:15,857 --> 01:26:17,656
Don't do it.

2309
01:26:17,657 --> 01:26:19,067
Ready!

2310
01:26:19,767 --> 01:26:22,167
- Two, action.
- Action!

2311
01:26:24,897 --> 01:26:25,967
Honey?

2312
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:28,107
(He bursts into laughter.)

2313
01:26:28,507 --> 01:26:29,536
(The ad lib keeps advancing.)

2314
01:26:29,537 --> 01:26:30,837
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

2315
01:26:32,077 --> 01:26:33,077
(Hitting)

2316
01:26:33,407 --> 01:26:35,347
(Right on target)

2317
01:26:35,617 --> 01:26:36,617
(Harsh words)

2318
01:26:36,618 --> 01:26:37,647
Seriously.

2319
01:26:39,447 --> 01:26:42,187
- He can't use swear words.
- He can't.

2320
01:26:42,757 --> 01:26:45,116
(His honest feeling came out because it hurt so much.)

2321
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:46,427
Let's go.

2322
01:26:49,757 --> 01:26:52,427
(Physical contact crisis)

2323
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:56,136
(Laughing)

2324
01:26:56,137 --> 01:26:59,637
(Thinking about something sad)

2325
01:27:00,307 --> 01:27:02,437
(He's happy.)

2326
01:27:03,137 --> 01:27:04,506
(Excessive display of affection of the couple)

2327
01:27:04,507 --> 01:27:05,647
Why are you hitting me?

2328
01:27:08,477 --> 01:27:11,147
(They leave for now so they don't get in the way of filming.)

2329
01:27:11,617 --> 01:27:15,186
(The calm before the storm)

2330
01:27:15,187 --> 01:27:16,487
Okay.

2331
01:27:16,817 --> 01:27:17,957
We're good.

2332
01:27:18,557 --> 01:27:21,057
Are you crazy? Why did you touch my head?

2333
01:27:21,187 --> 01:27:22,397
I had nothing to do.

2334
01:27:22,997 --> 01:27:25,296
Why did you hit my head?

2335
01:27:25,297 --> 01:27:27,097
(Seo Jin can't say anything.)

2336
01:27:27,627 --> 01:27:28,996
- Why did you do it?
- I was stroking your head.

2337
01:27:28,997 --> 01:27:30,797
Was that stroking?

2338
01:27:31,097 --> 01:27:33,537
(Grumpy Secretaries are on the verge of breaking up.)

2339
01:27:34,167 --> 01:27:35,367
Is he mad?

2340
01:27:37,777 --> 01:27:40,207
If it were the old days, I would have hit him.

2341
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:42,947
Okay, nice. Let's do it one more time.

2342
01:27:44,917 --> 01:27:48,517
(It's going to be the last take if no mistakes are made.)

2343
01:27:48,587 --> 01:27:49,816
(Jang Ki Yong)

2344
01:27:49,817 --> 01:27:51,486
(Gong Ji Hyeok)

2345
01:27:51,487 --> 01:27:52,586
(Ahn Eun Jin)

2346
01:27:52,587 --> 01:27:54,486
(Go Da Rim)

2347
01:27:54,487 --> 01:27:56,096
(Grumpy Secretaries)

2348
01:27:56,097 --> 01:27:58,867
(Same-sex couple)

2349
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:02,067
(He's getting full.)

2350
01:28:02,767 --> 01:28:03,967
This isn't easy.

2351
01:28:04,837 --> 01:28:06,007
It's not easy.

2352
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:09,337
(There are limits to improvising.)

2353
01:28:09,707 --> 01:28:11,676
This scene has many highlights.

2354
01:28:11,677 --> 01:28:12,977
(This scene has many highlights.)

2355
01:28:14,047 --> 01:28:16,076
(A cameo appearance for My Stars)

2356
01:28:16,077 --> 01:28:18,847
(Will it end well?)

2357
01:28:20,287 --> 01:28:21,647
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2358
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:24,287
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Ready...

2359
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:26,057
- Ready.
- Ready.

2360
01:28:26,287 --> 01:28:27,457
- Action.
- Action.

2361
01:28:32,297 --> 01:28:34,026
(Eun Jin joins them for this take.)

2362
01:28:34,027 --> 01:28:35,837
It looks good.

2363
01:28:36,097 --> 01:28:37,896
(A natural development)

2364
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:39,207
Goodness.

2365
01:28:39,967 --> 01:28:43,137
(Natural acting like an elderly couple)

2366
01:28:45,377 --> 01:28:47,947
(He looks at Eun Jin.)

2367
01:28:49,347 --> 01:28:52,077
(Da Rim notices Ji Hyeok.)

2368
01:28:54,147 --> 01:28:56,157
(Okay. Now's the time.)

2369
01:28:57,917 --> 01:28:59,026
Why?

2370
01:28:59,027 --> 01:29:00,226
(Get up quickly.)

2371
01:29:00,227 --> 01:29:01,357
Why?

2372
01:29:01,427 --> 01:29:02,996
Wait for me.

2373
01:29:02,997 --> 01:29:04,097
(Natural touch)

2374
01:29:05,697 --> 01:29:08,627
(Fiery ad-libbing)

2375
01:29:08,997 --> 01:29:10,297
Wait for me.

2376
01:29:10,837 --> 01:29:13,437
(He tries his best not to laugh.)

2377
01:29:14,537 --> 01:29:17,537
(The pain comes up after the intense acting.)

2378
01:29:17,907 --> 01:29:20,477
(I'm sorry.)

2379
01:29:20,677 --> 01:29:22,977
(Laughing)

2380
01:29:25,817 --> 01:29:29,357
(Is that a definite okay sign?)

2381
01:29:30,187 --> 01:29:33,587
(They did their best in case it was the last take.)

2382
01:29:35,057 --> 01:29:37,427
Why would I be at a hotel? I came to travel.

2383
01:29:37,927 --> 01:29:38,927
Hold on.

2384
01:29:39,527 --> 01:29:40,966
How do you know my name?

2385
01:29:40,967 --> 01:29:43,897
(It's become silent again.)

2386
01:29:44,237 --> 01:29:46,606
But still, there are things you shouldn't do.

2387
01:29:46,607 --> 01:29:48,907
(They're peeping behind My Stars who are acting.)

2388
01:29:49,777 --> 01:29:53,077
(The can rest, but their eyes stay on the filming.)

2389
01:29:54,107 --> 01:29:57,477
(His eyes seem lost in thought.)

2390
01:29:57,877 --> 01:29:58,987
Hey.

2391
01:29:59,587 --> 01:30:01,487
Hey. Come here.

2392
01:30:02,357 --> 01:30:03,357
Why?

2393
01:30:04,257 --> 01:30:05,887
If they see you, they'll make a mistake.

2394
01:30:06,157 --> 01:30:08,556
The cameras are filming that way.

2395
01:30:08,557 --> 01:30:09,757
How will they see you?

2396
01:30:09,857 --> 01:30:10,996
You're being ridiculous.

2397
01:30:10,997 --> 01:30:13,997
Eun Jin gets nervous when she sees you.

2398
01:30:14,227 --> 01:30:15,366
Sit down.

2399
01:30:15,367 --> 01:30:18,837
(In the end, he sits down for My Star.)

2400
01:30:22,337 --> 01:30:26,407
(He continues to look nostalgic even while sitting.)

2401
01:30:27,647 --> 01:30:28,806
It brings back old memories.

2402
01:30:28,807 --> 01:30:33,187
(In fact, he has very special memories of this place.)

2403
01:30:36,017 --> 01:30:39,386
(On the plane going to Jeju)

2404
01:30:39,387 --> 01:30:40,886
You're filming at Haevichi Hotel.

2405
01:30:40,887 --> 01:30:42,357
Yes. Tomorrow.

2406
01:30:42,427 --> 01:30:44,226
I filmed "Phoenix" at Haevichi Hotel.

2407
01:30:44,227 --> 01:30:45,227
"Phoenix?"

2408
01:30:47,097 --> 01:30:48,596
(Seo Jin's famous drama "Phoenix" was born here 21 years ago.)

2409
01:30:48,597 --> 01:30:51,037
"My heart is burning." That "Phoenix?"

2410
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:52,867
Goodness.

2411
01:30:53,637 --> 01:30:55,976
I probably said that line at Haevichi Hotel.

2412
01:30:55,977 --> 01:30:57,606
(Actor Lee Seo Jin bloomed here, with the iconic yacht scene.)

2413
01:30:57,607 --> 01:30:58,637
Goodness.

2414
01:30:58,907 --> 01:31:02,847
(He came back after 21 years.)

2415
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:09,087
(Are his eyes looking back 21 years ago?)

2416
01:31:11,817 --> 01:31:16,127
(The filming is coming to an end.)

2417
01:31:19,097 --> 01:31:20,767
Yes, okay. That was nice.

2418
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:25,067
- It's an okay sign.
- It's an okay sign. It's a relief.

2419
01:31:25,837 --> 01:31:27,107
- Take your bag.
- Right.

2420
01:31:27,807 --> 01:31:31,237
I couldn't hold my laughter when they left.

2421
01:31:32,007 --> 01:31:33,176
Would you like to monitor it?

2422
01:31:33,177 --> 01:31:34,276
No.

2423
01:31:34,277 --> 01:31:35,876
Why? Let's...

2424
01:31:35,877 --> 01:31:37,017
Let's go and watch it together.

2425
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:39,517
- Shall we?
- It's going to be fun.

2426
01:31:40,717 --> 01:31:44,256
I wanted to be sweet like you wanted,

2427
01:31:44,257 --> 01:31:46,156
but he didn't go with it.

2428
01:31:46,157 --> 01:31:48,386
- I hoped you would be sweet.
- Right.

2429
01:31:48,387 --> 01:31:50,896
- You seemed like an old couple.
- That's right.

2430
01:31:50,897 --> 01:31:52,566
(How did My Grumpy Secretary's old couple act?)

2431
01:31:52,567 --> 01:31:54,626
Could you see me trying not to laugh?

2432
01:31:54,627 --> 01:31:56,937
Everyone laughed.

2433
01:31:58,297 --> 01:31:59,667
Come this way.

2434
01:32:02,377 --> 01:32:04,076
He's looking at him.

2435
01:32:04,077 --> 01:32:05,137
(He's embarrassed but curious to see the okay cut.)

2436
01:32:06,507 --> 01:32:08,347
- Why does it look funny?
- I know, right?

2437
01:32:10,217 --> 01:32:11,946
You look like a couple married for many years.

2438
01:32:11,947 --> 01:32:13,017
Really?

2439
01:32:13,517 --> 01:32:16,687
(Let's have a sneak peek of "Dynamite Kiss.")

2440
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:18,587
Goodness.

2441
01:32:20,157 --> 01:32:21,257
This looks good.

2442
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:24,727
Stop eating.

2443
01:32:24,797 --> 01:32:26,127
Honey.

2444
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:27,927
Are you mad?

2445
01:32:29,137 --> 01:32:31,197
He's so grumpy.

2446
01:32:33,467 --> 01:32:34,736
They're getting up now.

2447
01:32:34,737 --> 01:32:35,807
(She's excited.)

2448
01:32:37,807 --> 01:32:40,477
(The problematic scene)

2449
01:32:42,477 --> 01:32:43,977
Goodness.

2450
01:32:46,247 --> 01:32:49,557
(The food fell faster than they thought.)

2451
01:32:52,387 --> 01:32:53,527
Hey.

2452
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:55,287
Honey.

2453
01:32:56,157 --> 01:32:59,967
(Check out their acting in "Dynamite Kiss.")

2454
01:33:03,797 --> 01:33:04,867
It's funny.

2455
01:33:06,407 --> 01:33:08,837
(It's funny.)

2456
01:33:11,277 --> 01:33:14,077
(He looks for something after he says that.)

2457
01:33:21,647 --> 01:33:22,716
(I don't have anything to give you, so maybe this...)

2458
01:33:22,717 --> 01:33:24,756
Suddenly?

2459
01:33:24,757 --> 01:33:26,456
I feel sorry.

2460
01:33:26,457 --> 01:33:27,756
(He suddenly appeases him with a handheld fan.)

2461
01:33:27,757 --> 01:33:28,857
Please edit it well.

2462
01:33:30,057 --> 01:33:32,967
(And just like that, another work has been added to his filmography.)

2463
01:33:34,067 --> 01:33:35,367
- Have some of this.
- Goodness.

2464
01:33:36,097 --> 01:33:37,396
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2465
01:33:37,397 --> 01:33:38,867
- It's not from me.
- Goodness.

2466
01:33:39,567 --> 01:33:41,367
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

2467
01:33:41,737 --> 01:33:44,677
(Grumpy Secretaries prepared snacks for the crew for My Stars.)

2468
01:33:45,007 --> 01:33:47,406
Hyun Jung. Please take care of my actors well.

2469
01:33:47,407 --> 01:33:48,906
Silence!

2470
01:33:48,907 --> 01:33:50,046
Silence.

2471
01:33:50,047 --> 01:33:51,377
(Closing his mouth)

2472
01:33:51,877 --> 01:33:52,986
(Please take good care of Da Rim and Ji Hyeok.)

2473
01:33:52,987 --> 01:33:54,517
"Dynamite Kiss."

2474
01:33:55,747 --> 01:33:59,056
The good thing was that they make a great pair.

2475
01:33:59,057 --> 01:34:01,326
The sweet and salty combination was nice.

2476
01:34:01,327 --> 01:34:04,326
Thanks to that combination,

2477
01:34:04,327 --> 01:34:06,696
I could have fun and be at ease.

2478
01:34:06,697 --> 01:34:08,727
That was the best part.

2479
01:34:08,897 --> 01:34:09,897
The difficult part...

2480
01:34:10,597 --> 01:34:11,997
was that they were really like family.

2481
01:34:13,367 --> 01:34:15,036
They have great chemistry.

2482
01:34:15,037 --> 01:34:16,807
They're complete opposites.

2483
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:20,646
When I saw them from the side,

2484
01:34:20,647 --> 01:34:22,077
I could tell that they love each other very much.

2485
01:34:23,447 --> 01:34:25,577
They would have been a married couple in their past lives.

2486
01:34:26,517 --> 01:34:28,446
They would have been lovers in their past lives.

2487
01:34:28,447 --> 01:34:29,887
That's my careful guess.

2488
01:34:31,017 --> 01:34:32,656
(What score would you give Grumpy Secretaries?)

2489
01:34:32,657 --> 01:34:33,827
What's the full score?

2490
01:34:33,927 --> 01:34:35,127
- One hundred.
- One hundred?

2491
01:34:35,327 --> 01:34:36,427
I'll give them both 100 points.

2492
01:34:36,527 --> 01:34:37,557
- Really?
- Yes.

2493
01:34:37,657 --> 01:34:40,166
If they really work with you as your manager,

2494
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:41,927
how many days do you think it will last?

2495
01:34:42,367 --> 01:34:43,597
One day is enough.

2496
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:48,106
- Well done.
- Take care.

2497
01:34:48,107 --> 01:34:50,336
- Bye.
- Take care.

2498
01:34:50,337 --> 01:34:51,876
(Please look forward to "Dynamite Kiss.")

2499
01:34:51,877 --> 01:34:53,747
- Jang Ki Yong.
- Bye.

2500
01:34:53,907 --> 01:34:55,176
Take care.

2501
01:34:55,177 --> 01:34:56,417
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

2502
01:34:56,447 --> 01:34:57,716
Bye!

2503
01:34:57,717 --> 01:34:59,316
(You seemed to have trouble talking to Grumpy Secretaries.)

2504
01:34:59,317 --> 01:35:02,387
(I'm going to be brave now.)

2505
01:35:02,955 --> 01:35:05,085
(No. Starting tomorrow.)

2506
01:35:05,585 --> 01:35:07,655
(My Star Doh Kyung Soo, My Star Ji Chang Wook)

2507
01:35:07,995 --> 01:35:09,995
(He's upset.)

2508
01:35:10,465 --> 01:35:11,864
(I actually couldn't express it...)

2509
01:35:11,865 --> 01:35:13,334
(There's a place that has really good salted bread.)

2510
01:35:13,335 --> 01:35:14,464
(Where is it?)

2511
01:35:14,465 --> 01:35:15,594
(It's near Gangnam-gu Office.)

2512
01:35:15,595 --> 01:35:17,004
(That's too far.)

2513
01:35:17,005 --> 01:35:18,405
(What?)

2514
01:35:18,465 --> 01:35:19,604
(It takes about 7 minutes.)

2515
01:35:19,605 --> 01:35:21,005
(He stubbornly stands his ground.)

2516
01:35:21,505 --> 01:35:23,605
(I was a bit annoyed.)

2517
01:35:23,945 --> 01:35:25,474
(Should we get the signature menu?)

2518
01:35:25,475 --> 01:35:27,344
(No.)

2519
01:35:27,345 --> 01:35:28,474
There's so much to eat.

2520
01:35:28,475 --> 01:35:29,614
(Was there...)

2521
01:35:29,615 --> 01:35:32,315
(anything I got to do my way today?)

2522
01:35:34,255 --> 01:35:35,255
(I waited for 40 minutes.)

2523
01:35:35,256 --> 01:35:36,285
(Acting like he doesn't know)

2524
01:35:36,485 --> 01:35:37,824
(You came late.)

2525
01:35:37,825 --> 01:35:39,025
(You came late today.)

2526
01:35:39,755 --> 01:35:41,995
(I'm Ji Chang Wook and Doh Kyung Soo's manager.)

2527
01:35:42,225 --> 01:35:45,424
(We're running late because of heavy traffic.)

2528
01:35:45,425 --> 01:35:46,594
(Exclaiming)

2529
01:35:46,595 --> 01:35:48,535
(How much longer will it take?)

2530
01:35:48,865 --> 01:35:50,604
(They're nervous because we're late.)

2531
01:35:50,605 --> 01:35:52,975
(You normally describe that as being angry.)

2532
01:35:53,335 --> 01:35:55,435
(The world's first self-centered manager appears.)

2533
01:35:55,575 --> 01:35:56,644
(It's the worst.)

2534
01:35:56,645 --> 01:35:58,144
(The worst care-taking attitude...)

2535
01:35:58,145 --> 01:35:59,874
(that even turned long time colleagues away)

2536
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:01,845
(- Did you sleep? - I didn't sleep.)

2537
01:36:02,075 --> 01:36:04,785
If you're uncomfortable, you can drive.

2538
01:36:05,085 --> 01:36:09,215
(My Grumpy Secretary)

2539
01:36:09,755 --> 01:36:15,755
(My Grumpy Secretary)
