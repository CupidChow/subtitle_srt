1
00:00:16,602 --> 00:00:19,601
(My Star awaits at an apartment on Mapo-gu.)

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,602
From here,

3
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,402
I can see what's happening in Korea.

4
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,511
I always read an English newspaper...

5
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:27,212
and drink a cup of espresso here.

6
00:00:30,012 --> 00:00:31,882
These clothes aren't very pretty, are they?

7
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:36,851
(My Star of the day, Kim Won Hun)

8
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:37,921
I'm a Gen Zer,

9
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,122
but today...

10
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:43,762
I don't have the Gen Z vibe at all.

11
00:00:44,692 --> 00:00:45,831
What should I do?

12
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:47,592
(Torn)

13
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:49,962
I need to show those old men...

14
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:51,301
what kind of a person I am.

15
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:53,262
(I need to show them what kind of a person I am.)

16
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:57,242
(He debuted as a KBS comedian through open recruitment in 2015.)

17
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:00,711
(He's runs "Shortbox," a channel with 3.7 million subscribers.)

18
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:04,442
(Every content he films becomes trendy.)

19
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:08,022
(The crown prince of YouTube)

20
00:01:09,322 --> 00:01:10,422
(Hitting)

21
00:01:12,092 --> 00:01:14,428
(His success rate is 100 percent when it comes to laughter.)

22
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:16,221
Just film YouTube videos in Japan.

23
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:18,261
Don't ruin the atmosphere here.

24
00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:20,691
(He is a popular all-around player...)

25
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:23,532
(who does well on every platform.)

26
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,472
(The comedian of the year, Kim Won Hun)

27
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:31,202
The flowers add to the atmosphere.

28
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:33,988
They're pretty even when they're dried up.

29
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,082
They're dried flowers.

30
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:36,412
Well,

31
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,641
I just scatter things...

32
00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:39,452
around the house,

33
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,882
and the interior design becomes perfect like this.

34
00:01:43,082 --> 00:01:45,321
(Meanwhile, at the parking lot)

35
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:46,921
You're wearing a pretty jacket.

36
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:48,291
(He came to work wearing a warm padded jacket.)

37
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:49,391
You should buy one.

38
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:50,962
(You should buy one.)

39
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:55,132
It suits you well.

40
00:01:57,932 --> 00:01:59,412
It's perfect for the current weather.

41
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,271
All of you should buy one.

42
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,472
(He highly recommends it.)

43
00:02:05,812 --> 00:02:07,348
Are you looking forward to today's shoot?

44
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:08,482
Not at all.

45
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:11,181
Today's shoot...

46
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:12,652
will be your big mistake.

47
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:16,981
(This secretary cares a lot about My Star's gender.)

48
00:02:16,982 --> 00:02:18,521
Today's celebrity...

49
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:19,651
is the worst.

50
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,722
(Today's celebrity is the worst.)

51
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,862
Can you say those words in front of Won Hun?

52
00:02:25,432 --> 00:02:26,792
What makes you think that I can't?

53
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,161
What makes you think that I can't?

54
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,301
Don't do that.

55
00:02:30,302 --> 00:02:32,172
(I need to protect My Star.)

56
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:33,501
Hello.

57
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:34,971
- Hello.
- Hello.

58
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:36,471
I'm Kim Won Hun's manager who will help...

59
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:38,311
with the transfer of duties, Jo Tae Kwon.

60
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:40,072
- Hello.
- I'm in your care.

61
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,141
Today is...

62
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:44,952
an important day where he'll film for "Shortbox."

63
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,381
(2pm, Short-form drama shoot at a middle school)

64
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:49,222
(He'll film for "Shortbox" today.)

65
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:51,351
So that his energy will remain high,

66
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:53,421
please refrain from making a cliched comment...

67
00:02:53,422 --> 00:02:54,892
or a boring joke.

68
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:56,761
- The two of us?
- That's right.

69
00:02:56,762 --> 00:02:57,762
We don't do that.

70
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:58,861
Don't worry.

71
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,861
Secondly,

72
00:03:00,862 --> 00:03:02,331
being a comedian...

73
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:05,172
makes him tell mischievous jokes to his managers.

74
00:03:05,372 --> 00:03:07,671
Please don't become sullen or angry.

75
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:09,201
I'll be grateful if you respond in a witty way.

76
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:11,102
- Okay.
- Okay.

77
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:12,872
- Also, - Anything else?

78
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:14,741
This is the company card.

79
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:16,482
- Please don't forget the receipts.
- Okay.

80
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:18,552
Don't forget the receipts!

81
00:03:20,052 --> 00:03:23,251
Why are you making a fuss in front of Won Hun's manager?

82
00:03:23,252 --> 00:03:25,122
Do it once he's gone.

83
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,352
- Don't forget them.
- Okay.

84
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:29,662
- All right.
- Anything else?

85
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:31,591
I think I've gone over everything.

86
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:33,432
- Really?
- Please remember those three.

87
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:36,962
- Hello.
- Hello.

88
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:39,601
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

89
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:40,772
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

90
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:42,771
Please hold my bag.

91
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,302
(Please hold my bag.)

92
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:47,472
(Won Hun begins playing around 1 second after meeting them.)

93
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:50,882
I have a hot pack right here. It's cold, right?

94
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:52,412
Thank you.

95
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:55,142
(He holds out a hot pack and takes it back.)

96
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,822
(He feels attacked.)

97
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:00,121
(Acting natural)

98
00:04:00,122 --> 00:04:01,491
This is a wig...

99
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,891
- he wears for "Yijin."
- Okay.

100
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:05,292
He always carries it around.

101
00:04:05,632 --> 00:04:06,891
(A wig?)

102
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:08,431
- It's...
- What is it for?

103
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:09,961
On my YouTube series,

104
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:13,602
I play a high schooler.

105
00:04:14,002 --> 00:04:16,342
This is a wig I wear for that series.

106
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:17,741
I always carry it around...

107
00:04:17,742 --> 00:04:19,542
because I don't know when I'll need it.

108
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:20,742
Isn't it...

109
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:22,681
- It's...
- too dishevelled?

110
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:24,281
It looks fine when you brush it.

111
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:25,352
Really?

112
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:27,612
You wouldn't know.

113
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:29,821
You haven't brushed hair before.

114
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:30,882
(Joking)

115
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:35,492
(Laughing)

116
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,061
I get it.

117
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,392
I get what you mean.

118
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:45,202
(As forewarned, My Star is mischievous.)

119
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,702
The thing is,

120
00:04:47,772 --> 00:04:50,941
- I joke around a lot.
- Okay.

121
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,812
Please don't be offended.

122
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:57,512
I'll be grateful if you keep the energy level high.

123
00:04:58,812 --> 00:04:59,981
- Okay.
- Yes.

124
00:04:59,982 --> 00:05:01,011
Don't bring down the atmosphere.

125
00:05:01,012 --> 00:05:03,122
- Okay.
- Okay.

126
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:08,052
The atmosphere is down.

127
00:05:09,362 --> 00:05:12,762
(The atmosphere is down already.)

128
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:15,332
- Is your nose better now?
- Yes.

129
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,402
What about your nose?

130
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,101
- I read an article about it.
- What happened?

131
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,731
- Extraction.
- Yes. Your skin treatment...

132
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:20,931
went wrong.

133
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:22,601
My skin treat didn't go wrong.

134
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:23,771
Because of extraction,

135
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,452
- my nose turned red.
- What's extraction?

136
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,171
- Extraction.
- I don't know what it is.

137
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:28,341
Pimple extraction.

138
00:05:28,342 --> 00:05:30,312
- You had a pimple.
- Yes.

139
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:32,251
I read an article about your nose.

140
00:05:32,252 --> 00:05:33,711
- Your nose is very big.
- You're right.

141
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:35,752
- And it's still red.
- You're right.

142
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:37,422
His nose...

143
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:39,921
My nose is pretty big.

144
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,991
I think...

145
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,461
- it's swollen.
- Yes.

146
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:43,791
- It has become bigger.
- Yes.

147
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:44,991
Bigger? This is our first meeting.

148
00:05:44,992 --> 00:05:46,262
- It looks fake.
- No.

149
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,972
I'm not wearing glasses with a fake nose.

150
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:49,461
That's what it looks like.

151
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,132
A little bit.

152
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,131
Is your birthday January 30?

153
00:05:53,132 --> 00:05:54,132
Yes, it is. How did you know?

154
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,201
I looked it up earlier.

155
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:56,442
It's January 30.

156
00:05:56,802 --> 00:05:58,042
What has gotten into you?

157
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,841
I looked it up upon arrival.

158
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:01,912
We have the same birthday.

159
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,188
- Is your birthday January 30?
- Yes, it's January 30.

160
00:06:04,212 --> 00:06:05,481
That's very fascinating.

161
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:06,688
(He found something he has in common with My Star.)

162
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:08,321
Which broadcasting station's open recruitment did you pass?

163
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,881
- KBS.
- KBS. Which term?

164
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:11,951
I'm from the 30th term.

165
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:13,198
(Comedian from the 30th term of KBS' open recruitment)

166
00:06:13,222 --> 00:06:14,652
KBS comedians are the best.

167
00:06:15,422 --> 00:06:16,861
KBS is like...

168
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,782
- the Seoul National University.
- That's right.

169
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,961
- SBS and MBC are...
- Were you on "Gag Concert?"

170
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:23,931
Yes. I was on "Gag Concert."

171
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,331
I love "Gag Concert."

172
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:26,572
"Omok Gosiwon."

173
00:06:27,602 --> 00:06:28,741
"Omok Gosiwon?" I don't know what it is.

174
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:30,072
"Must-Stop Visits."

175
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:32,472
"Hello."

176
00:06:33,312 --> 00:06:34,341
Back then...

177
00:06:34,342 --> 00:06:36,381
You were on "Gag Concert" when it was going downhill, right?

178
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,911
- That must be it.
- Right?

179
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,412
"Gag Concert" was going downhill.

180
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,251
- A little bit.
- That's why I don't know the skits.

181
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,692
It wasn't going completely downhill.

182
00:06:43,852 --> 00:06:45,968
- It was a bit of a slope.
- Then the show got cancelled.

183
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:47,721
- Yes.
- Then "Gag Concert" got cancelled.

184
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:48,792
I didn't cancel it.

185
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:51,372
You were on it when it was going downhill.

186
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,861
You began a YouTube channel when the show got cancelled...

187
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,102
and turned your life around.

188
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:58,772
I watched "Intimate Strangers..."

189
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:01,272
about 20 times.

190
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,942
- Really?
- I love the movie so much.

191
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,741
I especially loved the car scene.

192
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,271
"Honey, I really want to do it."

193
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:08,171
(Making a mischievous joke)

194
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:09,512
"Honey, I really want to do it."

195
00:07:09,982 --> 00:07:11,212
That scene made me think,

196
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:16,121
"Does he really want to do it?"

197
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:19,052
Your performance was so great.

198
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,551
It almost caused an accident.

199
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:21,552
(Annoyed)

200
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:22,792
It was so realistic.

201
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:25,232
I should watch "Intimate Strangers" again.

202
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:27,762
It's my first time meeting...

203
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,101
the two of you.

204
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,661
I know. How did we not meet before?

205
00:07:30,662 --> 00:07:33,831
I'm a part of the YouTube channel titled "Shortbox."

206
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:37,142
I contacted you about two times to invite you to the channel.

207
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:39,012
- Really?
- Yes.

208
00:07:39,112 --> 00:07:41,142
I didn't get a call from my office.

209
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:44,412
But you said that you wanted 10,000 dollars.

210
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:47,411
We couldn't do that for a YouTube video.

211
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:48,982
(Flustered)

212
00:07:49,022 --> 00:07:50,921
Kwang Kyu, you asked for a lot.

213
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:54,021
I thought, "He gets paid more than I expected."

214
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:56,391
- This is news to me.
- What?

215
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,761
This is news to me.

216
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:00,131
You couldn't fit it into your schedule,

217
00:08:00,132 --> 00:08:02,461
- so you turned down the offer.
- I'm sure of it.

218
00:08:02,462 --> 00:08:03,862
I'd take the job for gas money.

219
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:05,631
Please pay a visit when you have a chance.

220
00:08:05,632 --> 00:08:06,672
Of course.

221
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:09,442
What's "Shortbox?"

222
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,971
- "Shortbox?"
- What is it?

223
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,841
- Well...
- Is it similar to short-forms?

224
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,642
(An innocent and brutal question for My Star)

225
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,781
It's a YouTube channel that's run...

226
00:08:18,782 --> 00:08:20,111
by three comedians.

227
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:22,432
- Is that the name of the channel?
- Yes, it's "Shortbox."

228
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:25,292
(3.7 million subscribers)

229
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:28,152
(1.3 billion accumulated views)

230
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:32,762
(The YouTube channel is loved for its relatable contents.)

231
00:08:33,232 --> 00:08:34,661
Who are the two other comedians?

232
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:36,701
- There are Cho Jin Se...
- Cho Jin Se?

233
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:38,672
And Eom Ji Yoon.

234
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:40,371
Will you film for that channel today?

235
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:43,702
A "Shortbox" shoot is scheduled for today.

236
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:45,911
Where are we going now?

237
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:47,372
Our office.

238
00:08:47,472 --> 00:08:50,781
To prepare for the shoot,

239
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:52,481
we get props...

240
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:54,381
- and camera equipment.
- The "Shortbox" office?

241
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:55,522
Yes.

242
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:57,121
Let's go then.

243
00:08:57,122 --> 00:08:58,851
(They hit the road for the "Shortbox" office.)

244
00:08:58,852 --> 00:08:59,891
Get in.

245
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:02,221
- Shall I ride in the back?
- Of course. You're the star.

246
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:03,222
(You're My Star.)

247
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:04,691
Thank you.

248
00:09:04,692 --> 00:09:06,492
(Even a male star gets escorted perfectly.)

249
00:09:07,932 --> 00:09:10,701
We prepared a special vehicle for a special My Star.

250
00:09:10,702 --> 00:09:13,142
You know this vehicle, right? There are no side-view mirrors.

251
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:17,262
- Do you look at the screen?
- You look at the screen.

252
00:09:20,742 --> 00:09:21,771
That's incredible.

253
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,132
(How is the backseat for My Star?)

254
00:09:23,242 --> 00:09:26,552
(There's a massage function for My Star.)

255
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:33,391
I'm in your care today.

256
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:34,792
(Wary)

257
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,262
We're in your care.

258
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:38,632
Of course. You're a popular celebrity.

259
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,691
Kwang Kyu.

260
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:43,362
(The atmosphere is down already.)

261
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:46,632
- Did you fasten your seatbelt?
- Yes, I did.

262
00:09:47,032 --> 00:09:48,402
Here we go.

263
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:54,771
Please be understanding if I play around.

264
00:09:54,772 --> 00:09:55,912
Of course.

265
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:59,651
(Wary)

266
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:01,151
The seat is comfortable.

267
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,152
(He attempts to start a conversation.)

268
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:04,282
- There's a massage function.
- Where?

269
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:08,022
- I want to get a massage.
- Look for it in the back.

270
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,162
- Look for it. Is it working?
- It's working.

271
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:11,721
It's working, right?

272
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:12,832
(Exclaiming)

273
00:10:13,492 --> 00:10:14,762
It only works in the backseat.

274
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,201
This is insane.

275
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:17,202
(This is insane.)

276
00:10:17,203 --> 00:10:18,731
- I'm receiving a massage.
- Really?

277
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:19,771
Yes.

278
00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:20,971
(Unenthusiastic reactions)

279
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:22,202
Take a nap.

280
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:28,042
(Didn't we just begin shooting?)

281
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,842
I really enjoy watching My Grumpy Secretary.

282
00:10:31,212 --> 00:10:35,052
When I was a viewer, the secretaries seemed so cheerful.

283
00:10:35,282 --> 00:10:38,052
Everyone looked so happy. Now that I'm My Star,

284
00:10:38,992 --> 00:10:41,751
I feel like I'm floating alone...

285
00:10:41,752 --> 00:10:43,962
in the vast universe.

286
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:53,532
Was Su Ji's episode fun?

287
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:55,992
- Su Ji?
- It was the most fun, right?

288
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:58,971
It wasn't fun for us.

289
00:10:58,972 --> 00:11:00,212
It was fun for the viewers.

290
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:02,142
We don't know much.

291
00:11:04,212 --> 00:11:08,082
My sexy body is rare in Korea

292
00:11:08,212 --> 00:11:09,852
My body is my weapon.

293
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,881
(The unusual concept left him feeling confused.)

294
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:13,122
Your body is your weapon?

295
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:14,951
It was fun for the viewers.

296
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:17,392
(I see.)

297
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:23,862
I'll become absorbed in a concept from now on.

298
00:11:24,832 --> 00:11:27,231
- You don't need to do that.
- Still,

299
00:11:27,232 --> 00:11:28,672
viewers like that.

300
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,102
For goodness' sake.

301
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:32,472
- Do whatever you want.
- That's right.

302
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:33,988
Do whatever you want, but...

303
00:11:34,012 --> 00:11:36,181
Look ahead when you're driving.

304
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:37,911
(He takes on a new persona.)

305
00:11:37,912 --> 00:11:38,951
When you're driving.

306
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:40,351
I see. Is that his concept?

307
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:41,582
- Look ahead.
- Is that it?

308
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:45,051
When you're in the passenger seat,

309
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,291
you should help the driver.

310
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,091
You should give him the next destination...

311
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,021
and tell him how many meters he should go before turning right.

312
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,962
You shouldn't just sit still.

313
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:55,962
I can't explain every small thing to you, can I?

314
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:59,071
(They don't know how to react.)

315
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,272
You've filmed multiple episodes of My Grumpy Secretary.

316
00:12:02,342 --> 00:12:03,342
You know,

317
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:05,871
he won't be able to drive if I keep interfering.

318
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:07,212
(Giving a boring reaction)

319
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:12,852
(The reactions are neither fun nor touching.)

320
00:12:13,712 --> 00:12:15,922
- We're in Hongdae again.
- You're right.

321
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:17,681
We came here to eat with Su Ji.

322
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:19,152
You're right.

323
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:22,022
- Su Ji lives in Hapjeong too.
- Yes.

324
00:12:22,162 --> 00:12:23,621
Is Su Ji your senior?

325
00:12:23,622 --> 00:12:25,161
Yes. She's a senior by three years.

326
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,361
Of course, she is. She's much older than him.

327
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:29,932
But Won Hun looks old too.

328
00:12:30,262 --> 00:12:31,302
You too.

329
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:37,272
(Laughing)

330
00:12:37,273 --> 00:12:38,842
It was nice.

331
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:42,812
Won Hun has good comments.

332
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:44,842
"You too."

333
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:46,581
(My Star keeps the secretaries on their toes.)

334
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:49,382
My goodness.

335
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:52,922
Have you never watched "Shortbox?"

336
00:12:53,322 --> 00:12:55,092
- "Shortbox?"
- Yes.

337
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:56,461
It's our YouTube channel.

338
00:12:56,462 --> 00:12:57,902
- It's...
- How long are the videos?

339
00:12:58,022 --> 00:13:00,361
- Each video is about...
- About 8 to 10 minutes.

340
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,531
- About 8 to 10 minutes.
- I've watched it many times.

341
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,962
Between 7 and 10 minutes.

342
00:13:04,762 --> 00:13:07,572
(He looks it up belatedly.)

343
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,502
"Pre-Grading Mock Exam?"

344
00:13:10,742 --> 00:13:13,211
- That video was uploaded yesterday.
- Is it the most recent one?

345
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:15,411
- You saw a wig earlier, right?
- Yes.

346
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,412
- I wear it to play that character.
- Is this the series?

347
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:20,252
Will you do it or not?

348
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:23,222
Will you do it or not?

349
00:13:24,652 --> 00:13:25,952
Seo Jin. Will you do it or not?

350
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:29,222
- What's that?
- Will you do it or not?

351
00:13:29,592 --> 00:13:31,498
- "Will you do it or not?"
- Will you do it or not?

352
00:13:31,522 --> 00:13:32,791
- "Will you do it or not?"
- Will you do it or not?

353
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:33,991
(Do what?)

354
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:35,531
It'll be awkward not to do it.

355
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:36,532
(My Star's catchphrase)

356
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:39,172
That's a catchphrase young people copy these days.

357
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:42,772
(You don't know it, do you?)

358
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,171
They don't know the YouTube channel I'm running.

359
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,842
They don't know who I am.

360
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,342
Grabbing someone...

361
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:54,012
on the street to be my manager would be much more...

362
00:13:54,912 --> 00:13:58,382
(He can't even finish his sentence.)

363
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:01,892
Haven't you watched "Long-term Relationship?"

364
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,122
Is that on "Shortbox?"

365
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:06,332
It's what made "Shortbox" big.

366
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:08,132
- "Long-term Relationship?"
- Yes.

367
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:11,201
The first video we uploaded...

368
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:13,371
got 18 million views.

369
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,671
(The first episode of "Long-term Relationship")

370
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:17,141
The following 3 to 4 videos of "Long-term Relationship..."

371
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:19,772
got over ten million views.

372
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:24,081
We got one million subscribers in a month.

373
00:14:24,082 --> 00:14:25,111
(They got 1 million subscribers in a month.)

374
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:28,381
If you enjoyed the videos, please like and subscribe.

375
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:29,452
Okay.

376
00:14:29,882 --> 00:14:32,081
I'll press subscribe.

377
00:14:32,082 --> 00:14:33,391
(1 more subscriber)

378
00:14:33,392 --> 00:14:35,191
I need to boost my energy...

379
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:37,622
before filming for "Shortbox."

380
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:41,262
Gen Zers like our contents.

381
00:14:41,492 --> 00:14:45,162
Do you know the terms Gen Zers use?

382
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:48,401
No. Teach us.

383
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:49,741
One example is...

384
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:50,842
GMG.

385
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:53,512
GMG? It sounds familiar.

386
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:56,141
- GMG?
- G.

387
00:14:56,142 --> 00:14:57,512
GMG.

388
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:00,411
Do you think it's DMZ, Demilitarized Zone?

389
00:15:00,412 --> 00:15:01,712
- I know what DMZ is.
- DMZ?

390
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:04,152
- DMZ.
- I know what DMZ is.

391
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:07,622
GMG and HMH.

392
00:15:07,652 --> 00:15:08,862
HMH?

393
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:10,821
- HMH.
- Those are...

394
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:13,432
the two terms young people use often these days.

395
00:15:13,632 --> 00:15:14,991
GMG.

396
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:16,061
(They don't have a clue.)

397
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:18,432
HMH.

398
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:21,232
I'll give you a hint.

399
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:25,742
"Hey, do you want to go on a day trip today?"

400
00:15:26,242 --> 00:15:27,372
"GMG!"

401
00:15:28,142 --> 00:15:29,242
GMG?

402
00:15:29,382 --> 00:15:32,952
(Generation X members don't have a single clue.)

403
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:35,982
For goodness' sake.

404
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:39,922
GMG means, "We can go."

405
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,951
- "We can go."
- "We can go."

406
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:44,191
Does HMH means, "We can do it."

407
00:15:44,192 --> 00:15:45,192
That's right.

408
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,191
You're fast.

409
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:50,302
(Jealous)

410
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,872
Do you know what TMS means?

411
00:15:54,072 --> 00:15:55,232
- TMS?
- Yes.

412
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:57,772
Let's say...

413
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,872
I go shopping.

414
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:03,412
I see a product and go, "TMS!"

415
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:05,081
(This is TMS!)

416
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:06,582
Totally my style.

417
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:08,011
Correct.

418
00:16:08,012 --> 00:16:10,051
You learn fast.

419
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,081
(Despite being from Generation X, he gets used to the Gen Z terms.)

420
00:16:12,082 --> 00:16:13,522
I was focused on driving.

421
00:16:13,992 --> 00:16:15,691
Would you have gotten them right...

422
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,121
- if you weren't driving?
- Of course.

423
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:18,891
I can't multitask.

424
00:16:18,892 --> 00:16:20,861
Kwang Kyu, is your idea of a new term...

425
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:22,332
something like "MFR?"

426
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,432
What? MFR?

427
00:16:24,632 --> 00:16:26,272
Was it "Meju that fell from the rooftop?"

428
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,971
Correct.

429
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,271
It's an old term.

430
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:30,671
It's a term...

431
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:31,941
- from the 80s.
- That's right.

432
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:34,012
Weren't there a few other terms?

433
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,711
There were many.

434
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:38,982
One of the short forms from the past is CBS.

435
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:40,752
CBS?

436
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,322
It's very old.

437
00:16:43,882 --> 00:16:45,282
- CBS.
- What was it?

438
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:47,492
CBS.

439
00:16:47,922 --> 00:16:50,522
- C...
- CBS?

440
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:51,791
Charging a bus card.

441
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,262
That's right.

442
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,832
(Frustrated)

443
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:58,332
(I can't communicate with them.)

444
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:01,302
We aren't from the generation that used bus cards.

445
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:03,402
We used tokens and tickets.

446
00:17:04,802 --> 00:17:06,742
- You used tokens.
- Yes.

447
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,642
We used tokens and tickets.

448
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:09,881
- We didn't use bus cards.
- People smoked...

449
00:17:09,882 --> 00:17:11,141
on the bus back then,

450
00:17:11,142 --> 00:17:12,482
- right?
- That's right.

451
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,281
They sold separate cigarettes and matches...

452
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,781
at a bus stop back then.

453
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,822
Were there bus attendants?

454
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:20,392
There were at first.

455
00:17:20,722 --> 00:17:22,622
- That's right.
- They sold a combo...

456
00:17:22,992 --> 00:17:24,762
of a cigarette and a match.

457
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,191
Kwang Kyu, how were things...

458
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:29,001
during the time of enlightenment?

459
00:17:29,002 --> 00:17:30,231
- The time of enlightenment?
- Yes.

460
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,061
Things were tough...

461
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:34,632
because of Japanese people.

462
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,971
Did you see the March 1 Movement...

463
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,402
that was led by Yu Gwan Sun?

464
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,041
I was asleep when it happened.

465
00:17:41,042 --> 00:17:42,241
- You were asleep.
- So I couldn't see it.

466
00:17:42,242 --> 00:17:44,541
That's right. I was asleep.

467
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:45,988
(They started with GMG and reached the time of enlightenment.)

468
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:47,851
Won Hun, you were born in a nice period.

469
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,598
(My Star and the secretaries are worlds apart.)

470
00:17:49,622 --> 00:17:51,181
(They're near the "Shortbox" office.)

471
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,452
To go to the office,

472
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:56,091
you need to park on the left side.

473
00:17:56,092 --> 00:17:57,422
- Here?
- The left side.

474
00:17:58,092 --> 00:17:59,132
Okay.

475
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:00,962
They get nervous.

476
00:18:02,132 --> 00:18:04,132
- Is this an electric car?
- It's an electric car.

477
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:06,302
It's no wonder it's so quiet.

478
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,771
Get closer to the wall.

479
00:18:09,772 --> 00:18:10,802
Shall I go in further?

480
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:12,641
Kwang Kyu, you need to leave some space for me.

481
00:18:12,642 --> 00:18:14,142
Of course.

482
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,881
We're here.

483
00:18:16,882 --> 00:18:20,152
Even if you need to get out from the sunroof,

484
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,252
(The sunroof?)

485
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:23,651
give me more space.

486
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,522
- On this side? Okay.
- Yes.

487
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,921
If there's no space, get out through the passenger seat.

488
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:30,291
Isn't there enough space?

489
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,462
- What? There's enough space.
- Take a look.

490
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:36,132
- It's too tight.
- Is it too tight?

491
00:18:36,432 --> 00:18:37,561
It's too tight.

492
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:39,472
(Tight?)

493
00:18:39,602 --> 00:18:40,931
- Is it too tight?
- It's too tight.

494
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:42,131
- Shall I park again?
- It's too tight.

495
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:43,401
- Get out.
- Shall I do it again?

496
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,941
- It's too tight. I can't get out.
- You can.

497
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:45,942
(Flustered)

498
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:48,311
- Hurry up and get out.
- How am I supposed to do that?

499
00:18:48,312 --> 00:18:49,912
I barely got out.

500
00:18:50,942 --> 00:18:53,282
(He still can't get used to the concept.)

501
00:18:53,352 --> 00:18:55,252
- For goodness' sake.
- Gosh.

502
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:57,321
I'll ride a taxi instead.

503
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:58,452
(Method acting)

504
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,461
What's the use of having a nice car? The driver is no good.

505
00:19:02,462 --> 00:19:03,462
Kwang Kyu.

506
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:05,931
Kwang Kyu, this is a parking space...

507
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:06,991
for three cars.

508
00:19:06,992 --> 00:19:09,401
If you park at the front, do you expect people to park...

509
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:10,761
by dropping the car from the sky?

510
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:14,301
I parked the car like this to give you more space.

511
00:19:14,302 --> 00:19:15,601
You need to back the car more...

512
00:19:15,602 --> 00:19:17,671
to give room for other cars.

513
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:19,742
What will you do if people in the office complain?

514
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:21,342
All right.

515
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,611
Why are they so slow?

516
00:19:23,612 --> 00:19:26,112
Time is money and life.

517
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,212
You can pass.

518
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:30,082
Okay.

519
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:32,052
(Polite)

520
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:34,292
Kwang Kyu!

521
00:19:34,692 --> 00:19:35,821
What are you doing?

522
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:36,992
How do I turn off the engine?

523
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:39,591
Kwang Kyu, give me some mouthwash.

524
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:41,061
- Kwang Kyu, is it in the car?
- What?

525
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:42,902
- My mouth feels dirty.
- Mouthwash.

526
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:44,361
I have it.

527
00:19:44,362 --> 00:19:45,632
(He's all over the place.)

528
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,802
Put it in my hand.

529
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:54,142
Kwang Kyu, I want some mouthwash.

530
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,182
You're so impatient.

531
00:19:59,012 --> 00:20:00,381
- We don't have much time.
- Okay.

532
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:01,712
It's almost time for the shoot.

533
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:04,952
(Rinsing his mouth)

534
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:07,792
(Satisfied)

535
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:09,821
(Chuckling)

536
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:12,692
Kwang Kyu, take bigger steps so that we can hurry up.

537
00:20:14,332 --> 00:20:15,562
Seo Jin, hurry up.

538
00:20:17,402 --> 00:20:19,772
(They have no choice but to follow him.)

539
00:20:21,072 --> 00:20:22,202
Shake dirt off of your feet.

540
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:25,912
(Shaking off)

541
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,641
- Seo Jin, I'm sorry.
- What? It's okay.

542
00:20:28,642 --> 00:20:30,611
- Do what you want.
- That's right.

543
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,011
- Do what you want.
- I'm staying quiet...

544
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,851
because I don't know how to react, okay?

545
00:20:34,852 --> 00:20:35,852
That's right.

546
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:38,181
- You should show reactions.
- Okay.

547
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:39,951
- I don't know what to do.
- Okay.

548
00:20:39,952 --> 00:20:41,792
What kind of reactions am I supposed to show?

549
00:20:43,092 --> 00:20:44,622
I'm flustered too.

550
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:47,692
- We just don't know how to react.
- That's right.

551
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:49,131
Press the button for the third floor.

552
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:50,562
(He changes his tone.)

553
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:53,972
(His gets into the concept once more.)

554
00:20:55,902 --> 00:20:56,971
(He becomes wary again.)

555
00:20:56,972 --> 00:20:58,072
Then...

556
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:00,472
This is our office.

557
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:01,742
- Here?
- Yes.

558
00:21:01,942 --> 00:21:04,042
We use the 3rd and 4th floors.

559
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:06,181
(This is the office of the YouTuber with 3.7 million subscribers.)

560
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,381
This is our office.

561
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:10,222
Gosh, what's this?

562
00:21:11,222 --> 00:21:13,292
This is where we edit the videos.

563
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:14,951
That's...

564
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:16,891
where we have meetings.

565
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,062
How nice.

566
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:21,662
Gosh, what's this? Silver and Gold Play Buttons.

567
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:23,162
You received both of them.

568
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,431
- We...
- I've only heard of it.

569
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:26,831
- Gold Play Button.
- Gold Play Button.

570
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,271
For one million subscribers.

571
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:29,541
(Gold Play Button is the symbol of 1 million subscribers.)

572
00:21:29,542 --> 00:21:31,472
(For passing 1,000,000 subscribers)

573
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,971
We run "Shortbox" as well as...

574
00:21:33,972 --> 00:21:35,742
- What's "Ukimpyo?"
- "Ukimpyo."

575
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:37,311
- We run two YouTube channels.
- Two?

576
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:40,512
This channel has about 280,000 subscribers.

577
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:43,022
This channel has about three million subscribers.

578
00:21:43,152 --> 00:21:46,022
Now, we run two channels.

579
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:48,422
Take a look at the plaques as well.

580
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:50,262
Here.

581
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,391
(They're forced to look at the plaques as well.)

582
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:53,691
These are the awards...

583
00:21:53,692 --> 00:21:56,032
we've received at the Busan International Comedy Festival.

584
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,201
This is from the Brand Awards.

585
00:21:57,202 --> 00:21:58,682
(He sweeps various comedy festivals.)

586
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:01,871
(With his popularity, Kim Won Hun is a brand in and of himself.)

587
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,818
You haven't received the Grand Prize from the Brand Awards, right?

588
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:05,171
- No, I haven't.
- Do you want to touch it?

589
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,511
I think I've seen him on "Gag Concert."

590
00:22:07,512 --> 00:22:09,511
You're right. I run the channel with him.

591
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:11,542
- He was on "Gag Concert."
- Yes.

592
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:15,452
You can see the members in the photo behind you.

593
00:22:16,852 --> 00:22:19,251
The three of us work together.

594
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:20,812
(The "Shortbox" family is coming soon.)

595
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:22,991
What are you going to do now?

596
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:24,892
I need to get ready for the shoot.

597
00:22:25,492 --> 00:22:27,892
- Props are on the fourth floor.
- Okay.

598
00:22:28,592 --> 00:22:29,662
Here.

599
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:32,532
- Props are in here.
- Here?

600
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:36,901
What are these?

601
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,242
Do you make them yourself? Why are there so many props?

602
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,842
(Props are piled up.)

603
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:45,181
We film and edit the videos ourselves.

604
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:46,712
- Really? Who films the videos?
- Yes.

605
00:22:46,952 --> 00:22:48,681
We direct the videos...

606
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,598
- at the location. Yes.
- Do you do it yourself?

607
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:53,752
Do you film the videos I've watched earlier yourself?

608
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:54,922
That's right.

609
00:22:55,552 --> 00:22:57,991
- Do you act and film?
- We act and film.

610
00:22:57,992 --> 00:22:59,291
There are three directors.

611
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:01,631
Jin Se and I take care of the angles.

612
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,531
For the full shots, 1-person shots, and 2-person shots,

613
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:05,202
we give directions.

614
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,001
(Script meeting for "Shortbox")

615
00:23:08,002 --> 00:23:09,672
We write our own scripts.

616
00:23:10,342 --> 00:23:13,571
- Jin Se plays a timid character.
- You're right.

617
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:16,112
- Okay. He'll read the room then.
- Yes.

618
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,642
Shall we zoom out instead using a tight shot?

619
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:22,081
We give directions during the shoot.

620
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:23,151
After the full shot,

621
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,251
we need a shot of the flustered facial expression.

622
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:26,821
For this, I need to...

623
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,992
All right. Go.

624
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:31,192
We act ourselves.

625
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:33,862
Cut.

626
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:36,761
- Okay. Cut.
- We have meetings for editing...

627
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,161
- and watch the videos together.
- Cut.

628
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:39,162
Hold on.

629
00:23:39,532 --> 00:23:41,471
There are no other directors.

630
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:43,602
(Surprised by the production environment)

631
00:23:43,802 --> 00:23:44,872
- That's right.
- I see.

632
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:47,912
You guys do all the work.

633
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:51,081
It takes multiple meetings to get such ideas.

634
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:54,051
Turning ideas into scripts...

635
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:55,782
require planning...

636
00:23:56,022 --> 00:23:57,582
and writing.

637
00:23:57,922 --> 00:24:00,252
They also need to think about continuity...

638
00:24:00,492 --> 00:24:02,021
before filming.

639
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:03,522
It takes so much work.

640
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,962
He's successful because he works so hard.

641
00:24:07,492 --> 00:24:09,562
We need to wait for the car to get here...

642
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:11,802
to move the equipment.

643
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,631
There are so many items in here that we don't use.

644
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:15,872
- In here?
- Yes.

645
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:18,901
I thought hard about what to do with them...

646
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:21,541
and decided to sell them on Daangn.

647
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,542
(Daangn, a marketplace for used goods)

648
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:25,681
These items?

649
00:24:25,682 --> 00:24:27,552
There are a few items here.

650
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:30,151
- Will you sell them?
- These are the items...

651
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:32,122
I want to sell on Daangn.

652
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:34,721
Carrier, camera...

653
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:36,362
- What's this? PlayStation?
- Yes.

654
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,232
Kwang Kyu, do you know how to do it?

655
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:39,961
Do you use Bunjang or Daangn?

656
00:24:39,962 --> 00:24:41,592
I do use them.

657
00:24:42,632 --> 00:24:44,001
How do you do it?

658
00:24:44,002 --> 00:24:45,101
- What?
- So...

659
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:47,171
if you guys upload these items,

660
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,431
I'll give you five percent of sales.

661
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:49,842
- Five percent?
- Yes.

662
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:51,272
This is new.

663
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,912
There are clothes too.

664
00:24:54,472 --> 00:24:55,811
These are clothes we don't wear.

665
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:57,011
If there's anything you want...

666
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:58,112
This is new.

667
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,811
Kwang Kyu, I'll style your outfit today.

668
00:25:00,812 --> 00:25:02,752
- What? It's okay.
- Kwang Kyu.

669
00:25:03,082 --> 00:25:04,482
Why don't you wear warm pants?

670
00:25:05,222 --> 00:25:06,692
- It's okay.
- Kwang Kyu.

671
00:25:07,652 --> 00:25:09,521
(Rummaging)

672
00:25:09,522 --> 00:25:11,592
Kwang Kyu, you'll look cool in these pants.

673
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:13,731
(White jeans with blue paint for My Star)

674
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:15,662
Kwang Kyu, you'll look cool in these pants.

675
00:25:16,062 --> 00:25:17,162
Seriously.

676
00:25:17,862 --> 00:25:19,632
I don't think it'll fit my waist.

677
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,632
The size fits a 32 to 33-inch waist.

678
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:25,901
- It's too small.
- It suits you.

679
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:27,772
- Here.
- It's too small.

680
00:25:30,712 --> 00:25:33,282
I think this one suits you.

681
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:36,422
Recently, I...

682
00:25:38,022 --> 00:25:39,691
(He tries it on.)

683
00:25:39,692 --> 00:25:42,051
You totally look like Shin Chang Won.

684
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:43,162
You look so cool.

685
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,792
Seriously.

686
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,132
You look so cool right now.

687
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:47,462
The colours are great.

688
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:49,561
It has all of your personal colours.

689
00:25:49,562 --> 00:25:50,802
- Really?
- Yes.

690
00:25:50,862 --> 00:25:52,361
I'll wear it if that's what My Star wants.

691
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:54,601
If you wear this, you won't get hit by a car.

692
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:56,541
- But...
- Why not?

693
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,342
- You'll stand out too much.
- I see.

694
00:25:59,472 --> 00:26:01,712
- Kwang Kyu, aren't your pants cold?
- You look so cool.

695
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,581
They're a bit cold.

696
00:26:03,582 --> 00:26:05,511
A boxy fit is in vogue these days.

697
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:07,651
- Okay. But these are...
- The blue stripes stand out.

698
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:09,282
But... These?

699
00:26:10,322 --> 00:26:12,651
- I'll try them on.
- If you wear these,

700
00:26:12,652 --> 00:26:14,891
I think the sales of them will soar.

701
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:16,992
- These pants...
- A photo of you wearing them...

702
00:26:17,322 --> 00:26:19,338
We should take a photo of them while you're wearing them.

703
00:26:19,362 --> 00:26:20,661
(He changes into the pants right away.)

704
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,438
- I feel like I'm giving them away.
- Exactly.

705
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:23,862
Unexpectedly, they fit me.

706
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,032
Unexpectedly, they fit me.

707
00:26:26,902 --> 00:26:29,031
- Oh, my.
- Unexpectedly...

708
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:30,841
- They fit me perfectly well.
- Kwang Kyu, you look great.

709
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:32,742
I admit it. These are made for me.

710
00:26:32,772 --> 00:26:35,012
- You look amazing. I mean it.
- I'll buy these pants.

711
00:26:36,142 --> 00:26:37,312
The colour...

712
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:39,682
hurts my eyes so much right now.

713
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,511
If you need a blue screen,

714
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:43,992
you can pose in front of these pants.

715
00:26:45,452 --> 00:26:47,222
(The human blue screen)

716
00:26:47,452 --> 00:26:48,591
You really look good in them.

717
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:49,791
- But...
- Kwang Kyu, I think...

718
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:52,021
you can wear them all day long.

719
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:54,232
- I'll wear them.
- Okay.

720
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:56,601
Then Kwang Kyu, I'll sell your pants.

721
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:57,731
But these pants...

722
00:26:57,732 --> 00:26:58,802
They look nice.

723
00:26:59,462 --> 00:27:00,932
These pants...

724
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,301
- Seo Jin, you gave these to me.
- Yes.

725
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:07,072
- Put them in this bag and carry it.
- Right. Okay.

726
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,512
I must say, these pants...

727
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:09,981
- I really...
- They're nice, right?

728
00:27:09,982 --> 00:27:11,141
I really like them.

729
00:27:11,142 --> 00:27:12,281
(I like these pants so much.)

730
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:13,611
I tried them on just in case.

731
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:14,651
I mean, I intended to look funny.

732
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,011
- I wanted to make My Star laugh.
- I see.

733
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:17,151
So I tried them on.

734
00:27:17,152 --> 00:27:18,421
But I was really impressed...

735
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:20,592
They made my legs look so long.

736
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:22,551
I thought,

737
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:24,021
"Were my legs always this pretty?"

738
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:26,492
(Were my legs always this pretty?)

739
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:29,582
I thought these were made for me.

740
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:32,262
You could attend Fashion Week right now.

741
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:34,971
- I mean...
- When you walked out,

742
00:27:34,972 --> 00:27:37,101
I saw a shiny light behind you.

743
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:38,901
- Really?
- The light is even brighter now.

744
00:27:38,902 --> 00:27:40,271
(The light is even bright now.)

745
00:27:40,272 --> 00:27:42,141
All right. By the way,

746
00:27:42,142 --> 00:27:43,581
- did you paint these blue stripes?
- Yes?

747
00:27:43,582 --> 00:27:44,911
- Or were they designed this way?
- One of the contractors...

748
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:47,152
wore these pants when he worked in here.

749
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,651
- Oh, really?
- He got some paint on the pants.

750
00:27:49,652 --> 00:27:50,751
Really?

751
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,922
He accidentally painted on them with a roller.

752
00:27:53,122 --> 00:27:54,691
I think this cardigan comes as part of a set with the other one.

753
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:56,391
- Yes, it comes with this one.
- I mean, these two cardigans.

754
00:27:56,392 --> 00:27:58,321
- Sorry?
- Take it off and put this on.

755
00:27:58,322 --> 00:27:59,522
Oh, really? Shall I?

756
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:02,132
Kwang Kyu has a well-proportioned body.

757
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:04,361
It's not as bad as people think it is.

758
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:06,232
Kwang Kyu, I'll give you this one too.

759
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,601
- You don't have to.
- Kwang Kyu, you should...

760
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:11,402
- Take it while the star offers.
- All right.

761
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:14,571
- I should take My Star's gift.
- You look flashier in this.

762
00:28:14,572 --> 00:28:16,252
- Oh, my. You look insanely good.
- Right.

763
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:17,718
This one makes you look flashier.

764
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:20,182
- Because it has blue on it.
- It goes better with the pants.

765
00:28:20,682 --> 00:28:22,611
Kwang Kyu, you look dashing right now.

766
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:24,422
Don't look into the mirror.

767
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:26,951
- You look incredibly stylish.
- Do I?

768
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:28,292
- Really? Okay.
- Yes.

769
00:28:28,952 --> 00:28:30,521
I've never seen Kwang Kyu like this before.

770
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:31,621
All right.

771
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:32,761
(He transformed into a fashion leader with My Star's clothes.)

772
00:28:32,762 --> 00:28:33,831
(Grumpy Secretary's first task: Selling second-hand items)

773
00:28:33,832 --> 00:28:36,732
These are the items we're going to sell today.

774
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:39,601
- We should upload their photos.
- We should take photos of them.

775
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:41,478
How you take photos of items is very important.

776
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:42,732
First,

777
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:45,241
please take a few photos of this film camera...

778
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:47,588
in a way that makes it look nice and make people feel nostalgic.

779
00:28:47,612 --> 00:28:50,081
"It has not been used at all."

780
00:28:50,082 --> 00:28:53,011
"I'd like to sell it at a reasonable price..."

781
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:54,611
"to someone who wants to take sentimental photos."

782
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:55,612
(Tilting his head)

783
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:58,312
Will you take photos of it while holding it like that?

784
00:28:59,382 --> 00:29:01,221
- Should I not?
- Photos are very important.

785
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:02,251
You'll take photos of it while holding it?

786
00:29:02,252 --> 00:29:03,791
- Photos are really important.
- You do it.

787
00:29:03,792 --> 00:29:05,321
- I don't know how to do it.
- Or I should rather...

788
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:06,861
Can I take it with your face in it?

789
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:09,222
(Or I should rather... Can I take it with your face in it?)

790
00:29:09,732 --> 00:29:11,732
"It is with Mr. Lee Seo Jin."

791
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,301
I'll try to take a sentimental photo.

792
00:29:14,302 --> 00:29:16,101
- I'll put it on the sofa.
- Show us how to do it.

793
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:17,142
How should we take it?

794
00:29:17,972 --> 00:29:19,641
- Okay. This would work.
- Really?

795
00:29:19,642 --> 00:29:21,872
Now you have to write something about this item.

796
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:23,882
What should be the title?

797
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:26,481
A film camera with good vibes...

798
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,652
GV.

799
00:29:28,412 --> 00:29:31,822
- "GV?"
- A film camera with GV for sale.

800
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:34,392
- Oh, you use Cheonjiin?
- Sorry?

801
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:37,461
"Cheonjiin?"

802
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:38,761
- Yes.
- What is that?

803
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:40,732
This keyboard layout is called "Cheonjiin."

804
00:29:41,132 --> 00:29:43,802
- My grandpa uses it.
- Oh, I see.

805
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:45,561
I don't use Cheonjiin.

806
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:46,932
(Kwang Kyu lies to his face.)

807
00:29:47,132 --> 00:29:48,871
Now you have to write a description.

808
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,672
Yes.

809
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:53,612
I'll just do all the work.

810
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:55,512
Go and rest.

811
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:58,011
I'll just...

812
00:29:58,012 --> 00:29:59,318
(They're not helpful when it comes to second-hand transactions.)

813
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:01,312
"A film camera in like-new condition..."

814
00:30:01,982 --> 00:30:03,422
"is for sale."

815
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:07,021
Above all, the fact that he used Cheonjiin dumbfounded me.

816
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,021
They typed so slowly on top of that.

817
00:30:09,022 --> 00:30:10,591
I mean, it took them one minute...

818
00:30:10,592 --> 00:30:12,022
to type "hello."

819
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:14,861
That could make it hard to communicate with buyers.

820
00:30:14,862 --> 00:30:15,991
So I did all the work.

821
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:17,632
I had to play a leading role.

822
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:19,201
Then five dollars...

823
00:30:19,202 --> 00:30:21,002
How much would be reasonable?

824
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:22,671
Did you say it was worth 30 dollars?

825
00:30:22,672 --> 00:30:24,672
Yes, I think I paid 30 or 40 dollars.

826
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:25,802
In that case...

827
00:30:25,803 --> 00:30:27,803
- Sell it for at least ten dollars.
- Ten dollars.

828
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:29,071
Wait.

829
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:30,312
Should we raise the price?

830
00:30:31,082 --> 00:30:32,141
- How about 20 dollars?
- No.

831
00:30:32,142 --> 00:30:33,881
Even if we sell it for ten dollars...

832
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:35,351
Many people try to negotiate the price...

833
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:37,381
when they meet the seller in person.

834
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,022
- Then list it up for 15 dollars.
- So...

835
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:41,391
But if you list an item worth 30 dollars up for 15 dollars...

836
00:30:41,392 --> 00:30:42,491
- on Daangn, - It's a bit expensive, right?

837
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:44,391
- no one will be willing to buy it.
- Then how about 12 dollars?

838
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:46,808
He doesn't know how it works since he's never used it before.

839
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:48,031
- Daangn is... Yes.
- Twelve dollars, it is.

840
00:30:48,032 --> 00:30:49,131
Twelve dollars would be reasonable.

841
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:50,802
I listed one item up.

842
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,472
Shall we list PlayStation this time?

843
00:30:54,132 --> 00:30:55,331
- What is PlayStation?
- This one.

844
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:56,642
- "PlayStation?"
- Yes.

845
00:30:57,702 --> 00:30:59,402
Do you live in a mountain or something?

846
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:02,942
It's getting harder to speak with you.

847
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:04,841
I'll put this here... Can you move it aside?

848
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:07,042
(Seo Jin quickly places the game console on the table.)

849
00:31:07,112 --> 00:31:10,051
But the thing is... The HDMI cable...

850
00:31:10,052 --> 00:31:11,821
and the controller cable are missing.

851
00:31:11,822 --> 00:31:13,151
Can you get them separately?

852
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,922
Yes, you can buy them separately.

853
00:31:15,122 --> 00:31:16,762
- Then there will be no problem.
- Right.

854
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:18,062
In a full shot?

855
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:19,861
Someone commented, "I'd like to inquire about it."

856
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:20,932
Oh, my. That's awesome.

857
00:31:21,132 --> 00:31:22,361
Someone commented, "I'd like to inquire about it."

858
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:23,561
(Someone contacted him only 1 minute after he listed the camera up.)

859
00:31:23,562 --> 00:31:25,161
- It's about the camera.
- That's awesome.

860
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:27,101
- The camera. Hold on a second.
- Oh, my.

861
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,131
Hold on.

862
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:30,371
Should we have listed it up for 15 dollars?

863
00:31:30,372 --> 00:31:31,652
Oh, this person is interested...

864
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,141
(Thinking hard)

865
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,271
"The camera is pretty."

866
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:37,811
(- I'd like to inquire about it.
- Hello. The camera is pretty.)

867
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,911
That may make the person feel uncomfortable.

868
00:31:38,912 --> 00:31:40,381
Right. It could make the person feel uncomfortable.

869
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:42,111
Why did you say the camera was pretty?

870
00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:43,951
It's like when you go on a blind date and say,

871
00:31:43,952 --> 00:31:45,521
"Hello. You are very pretty."

872
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:46,791
- It's about the same situation.
- Right.

873
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:48,151
But it's a compliment. Why is it bad?

874
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:50,491
It sounds like I'm showing off my item.

875
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:52,261
It's like saying, "I'm handsome."

876
00:31:52,262 --> 00:31:53,431
- Exactly.
- It's like that.

877
00:31:53,432 --> 00:31:55,592
It's like saying, "I'm handsome, right?"

878
00:31:56,062 --> 00:31:57,762
- Oh, I get it now.
- For now...

879
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,432
If you reply too quickly...

880
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:03,131
You should reply quickly in a relationship, right?

881
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:04,171
- You've got a message.
- The buyer replied right away.

882
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,672
The buyer said, "Yes."

883
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:07,142
"Hello."

884
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:08,311
To my message, "The camera is pretty,"

885
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:09,341
- the buyer replied, "Yes."
- "Yes."

886
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:10,582
The buyer bit the bait.

887
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:12,941
- But wait.
- What?

888
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:15,051
(Will he succeed in selling it at the first attempt?)

889
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:16,381
The buyer definitely bit the bait.

890
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:18,262
- The buyer bit the bait?
- "It's available..."

891
00:32:18,952 --> 00:32:20,151
"Will you buy it?"

892
00:32:20,152 --> 00:32:21,822
- I'll ask directly.
- Good.

893
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:24,591
Is it like asking, "Will you date me?"

894
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:26,092
(Chuckling)

895
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:28,091
"Will you buy it?"

896
00:32:28,092 --> 00:32:29,232
(It's funny.)

897
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:31,731
"When can you meet me?"

898
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:32,908
(Everything seems fascinating to the Daangn beginner.)

899
00:32:32,932 --> 00:32:34,532
"I'd like to meet you now."

900
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:36,901
(Staring)

901
00:32:36,902 --> 00:32:38,202
But don't I look...

902
00:32:38,372 --> 00:32:40,071
- so desperate?
- What?

903
00:32:40,072 --> 00:32:41,371
- I look desperate, right?
- Exactly.

904
00:32:41,372 --> 00:32:43,982
- The buyer will probably say, - The buyer read my message.

905
00:32:44,012 --> 00:32:47,151
"Can you give me a discount?" Or something like that.

906
00:32:47,152 --> 00:32:48,611
- But... For us...
- That's possible.

907
00:32:48,612 --> 00:32:50,352
Selling the camera is what matters to us.

908
00:32:50,722 --> 00:32:53,082
The buyer is busy now and will be available in the evening.

909
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:55,652
That won't work.

910
00:32:56,252 --> 00:32:57,391
The buyer asked to contact him or her...

911
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,062
if it's still available in the evening.

912
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:00,492
"Yes, I'll do that."

913
00:33:00,962 --> 00:33:02,231
It's good. We're starting off well.

914
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,502
Yes, it's good.

915
00:33:04,462 --> 00:33:05,961
Now then... Did you take a photo of the game console?

916
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:07,101
The price... Yes, I took it.

917
00:33:07,102 --> 00:33:08,102
How much?

918
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,703
I'll list it up for 150 dollars for now.

919
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:11,001
A hundred and fifty dollars.

920
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,371
I'm done writing the description.

921
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:14,252
(Item 2, the game console, has been listed up.)

922
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:15,341
I listed one up.

923
00:33:15,342 --> 00:33:16,612
- Next up is this one.
- Okay.

924
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,092
- G-DRAGON's photo should be seen.
- Okay.

925
00:33:20,152 --> 00:33:21,951
(They displayed it thoughtfully to attract many buyers.)

926
00:33:21,952 --> 00:33:23,452
Oh, this is G-DRAGON's.

927
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:27,492
PlayStation! This is amazing.

928
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:30,882
The buyer asked if it was available. "Can you meet me now?"

929
00:33:31,062 --> 00:33:33,422
Say you have to go out of Seoul now right after selling it.

930
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:35,991
- "I'll buy it right now."
- "Right now?"

931
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:38,162
I listed it for a very low price.

932
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:40,271
- Isn't it too cheap?
- I'm impressed.

933
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:43,101
How do people know that as soon as you list items?

934
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:46,072
It's because it's much cheaper than what it's worth.

935
00:33:46,302 --> 00:33:48,272
I'll list G-DRAGON's cheering stick too.

936
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:49,841
- Are you giving it away?
- Yes.

937
00:33:49,842 --> 00:33:52,181
- I'll give it away.
- Okay.

938
00:33:52,182 --> 00:33:53,241
(This item is free of charge.)

939
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,851
You can find a buyer easily when it's free.

940
00:33:54,852 --> 00:33:56,011
(The probability of successful transaction is 100 percent.)

941
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:57,181
I listed it up.

942
00:33:57,182 --> 00:33:59,421
The PlayStation console is incredibly popular.

943
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:01,091
- Why?
- It's really...

944
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:02,891
I'm getting so many messages like Seo Jin did...

945
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:04,092
in the prime of his life.

946
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:08,591
- I wasn't that popular even then.
- It's because...

947
00:34:08,592 --> 00:34:10,301
this person knows that it's cheap.

948
00:34:10,302 --> 00:34:11,702
This buyer said,

949
00:34:12,402 --> 00:34:13,801
"Is it still available? Can I buy it?"

950
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:15,431
"If it's already sold, have a good weekend."

951
00:34:15,432 --> 00:34:17,642
The buyer thought it could've been sold already.

952
00:34:18,502 --> 00:34:20,111
The buyer asked, "Can we meet up 30 minutes later?"

953
00:34:20,112 --> 00:34:21,212
I'll say, "Sounds good."

954
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:23,002
- Did the buyer reply?
- "Sounds good."

955
00:34:23,072 --> 00:34:24,341
Okay.

956
00:34:24,342 --> 00:34:25,918
- The game console has been sold.
- Has it been sold?

957
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:26,982
Has it been sold?

958
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:29,152
The buyer will come in 30 minutes.

959
00:34:29,352 --> 00:34:32,052
- Then I'll close the deal.
- Right. Yes.

960
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:33,691
"I'll be on my way right now."

961
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:35,352
This buyer sounds so excited.

962
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:38,291
"Can you please hold it for me?"

963
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:39,621
(Won Hun is excited as he's bombarded with inquiries.)

964
00:34:39,622 --> 00:34:41,502
I'm getting so many messages. What should I do?

965
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:45,432
- We're rich now!
- Hey.

966
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:47,501
Hey, this must be...

967
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,672
This must be worth a lot.

968
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,971
What do I do?

969
00:34:51,972 --> 00:34:53,412
I got a message from another person.

970
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:55,242
"Yes, that's right."

971
00:34:55,243 --> 00:34:56,341
"Are you giving it away?"

972
00:34:56,342 --> 00:34:57,642
"Yes, that's right."

973
00:34:58,342 --> 00:34:59,581
This... Oh, my.

974
00:34:59,582 --> 00:35:01,381
"Gosh. Are you giving it away?" This person is surprised.

975
00:35:01,382 --> 00:35:02,781
"Yes, that's right."

976
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:03,822
(Yes, that's right.)

977
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:05,182
I'll put this aside.

978
00:35:05,952 --> 00:35:07,091
What do I do?

979
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:09,692
(The notification keeps going off.)

980
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,161
Hold on a second. I have a headache.

981
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:14,392
(I have a headache.)

982
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:18,102
There are eight of them. It's hard to communicate with them.

983
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,271
That's the fun...

984
00:35:20,272 --> 00:35:22,731
- of making deals on Daangn.
- I get it now.

985
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:24,771
Office workers run out of the office...

986
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:27,542
when they feel overloaded with work.

987
00:35:27,812 --> 00:35:29,241
I want to give up right now.

988
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:30,711
(Overloaded)

989
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,941
Which item do most of them ask about?

990
00:35:32,942 --> 00:35:35,011
- They're going wild.
- Are they inquiring...

991
00:35:35,012 --> 00:35:36,921
- about this one?
- With this momentum,

992
00:35:36,922 --> 00:35:38,581
even this cardigan...

993
00:35:38,582 --> 00:35:40,351
would be sold.

994
00:35:40,352 --> 00:35:42,091
- With this momentum.
- List it up.

995
00:35:42,092 --> 00:35:43,292
(List it up.)

996
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:45,191
- While you're at it.
- Shall I list it up just in case?

997
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,831
Then sell it with the other one as a set.

998
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:48,431
- With the other cardigan?
- Yes, as a set.

999
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:50,231
- Right. That's a good idea.
- Right?

1000
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,861
- I'll exclude your face.
- Okay.

1001
00:35:52,862 --> 00:35:54,342
- I'll put the other one on.
- Right.

1002
00:35:54,432 --> 00:35:57,102
- Take a photo of us together.
- Okay.

1003
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,141
Can someone reply to these messages?

1004
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:02,302
I really need your help. I'm too busy to talk to them.

1005
00:36:02,872 --> 00:36:04,811
I just got 11 messages.

1006
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:05,812
(I just got 11 messages!)

1007
00:36:06,342 --> 00:36:08,552
- The buyer's nibling loves it.
- Which one?

1008
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:12,152
Stop sending me messages!

1009
00:36:13,322 --> 00:36:14,322
We're ready.

1010
00:36:14,752 --> 00:36:16,722
Shouldn't we cover the mic?

1011
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:18,522
- We can hide it.
- Right?

1012
00:36:19,022 --> 00:36:20,361
- Let's hide it like this.
- Okay.

1013
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:23,561
This is driving me nuts. I can't do that.

1014
00:36:23,562 --> 00:36:26,401
It's already been sold.

1015
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:28,501
- Hurry up and take a photo of us.
- Take a photo of us.

1016
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:29,732
- I'm busy right now!
- What?

1017
00:36:30,142 --> 00:36:32,201
- You should list these up now.
- Give me just a minute.

1018
00:36:32,202 --> 00:36:33,942
- Hurry up.
- Just a second.

1019
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:35,842
(Feeling rushed)

1020
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:38,081
Hold on. Which item does this buyer want to buy?

1021
00:36:38,082 --> 00:36:39,581
- PlayStation?
- Hurry up and come.

1022
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:41,781
The game console has already been sold.

1023
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,422
(Focused)

1024
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:47,192
(Hurry up)

1025
00:36:47,752 --> 00:36:50,821
(Seo Jin's dimples are getting deeper.)

1026
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:52,761
- What's going on?
- Just a second.

1027
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,308
(He moves his fingers more quickly as time passes.)

1028
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:57,401
(Everyone is serious about the second-hand transaction.)

1029
00:36:57,402 --> 00:36:59,242
Make sure our faces aren't in the frame, okay?

1030
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:01,871
- I'll take a photo of you first.
- Okay.

1031
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:03,672
(Finally, he takes a photo of them together.)

1032
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:07,832
Then I'll just include the two cardigans in the frame.

1033
00:37:09,842 --> 00:37:11,681
(Smiling)

1034
00:37:11,682 --> 00:37:14,152
- Is it done?
- Both of you look good in them.

1035
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:17,682
All right. Now I should list them up...

1036
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:20,422
How much should I sell each of them for?

1037
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:23,052
- This cardigan?
- Yes.

1038
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:25,322
How about 30 dollars for the 2 of them?

1039
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:28,131
- That's too expensive.
- No one will buy them.

1040
00:37:28,132 --> 00:37:29,961
- Ten dollars for both.
- That sounds reasonable.

1041
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:32,602
- Ten dollars for both?
- "Ten dollars for both."

1042
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:35,931
If you were going to sell them for only ten dollars,

1043
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:38,902
I wouldn't have needed to pose in the cardigan.

1044
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:41,412
- That's how Daangn works.
- Right.

1045
00:37:43,272 --> 00:37:45,011
You see, on Daangn,

1046
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,011
people even give away the pickled radish...

1047
00:37:47,012 --> 00:37:48,312
that comes with tteokbokki.

1048
00:37:48,552 --> 00:37:51,151
- They sell all sorts of things.
- Even pickled radish?

1049
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:52,252
Yes.

1050
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,122
List up new items instead of replying to the messages.

1051
00:37:58,162 --> 00:37:59,921
Open the box and show the shoes.

1052
00:37:59,922 --> 00:38:01,832
Put one on top of the other.

1053
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:03,632
Take a photo of this.

1054
00:38:04,002 --> 00:38:06,032
- That's good. Yes.
- Oh, the size? Okay.

1055
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:08,331
Won Hun, what is this?

1056
00:38:08,332 --> 00:38:11,071
- This is a phone charger.
- Is it a charger?

1057
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:13,272
These two are for different models of phones.

1058
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:16,858
You can use both at the same time. It's worth about 150 dollars.

1059
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:18,611
- It's worth 150 dollars?
- Let's list this too.

1060
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:19,732
This is a very good product.

1061
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,111
This is a regular lamp, right?

1062
00:38:22,112 --> 00:38:23,381
- You should sell this too.
- Yes.

1063
00:38:23,382 --> 00:38:26,852
(Everything he sees increases his urge to sell more items.)

1064
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:29,252
(He might sell everything he sees.)

1065
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:31,932
Do you want to sell this chair?

1066
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:35,062
- That's a very expensive chair.
- Oh, is it very expensive?

1067
00:38:35,962 --> 00:38:37,061
This chair looks nice.

1068
00:38:37,062 --> 00:38:38,232
(He's addicted to selling.)

1069
00:38:39,302 --> 00:38:41,372
I'm quite good at selling things on Daangn.

1070
00:38:43,132 --> 00:38:45,742
I have so many unread messages.

1071
00:38:46,102 --> 00:38:48,041
- Let's just keep selling things.
- You have to meet a buyer...

1072
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:49,248
(Let's forget about your work schedule and keep doing this!)

1073
00:38:49,272 --> 00:38:50,481
This is fun.

1074
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:53,382
(He got hooked on Daangn deeply.)

1075
00:38:54,512 --> 00:38:56,612
That was fun. Selling things on Daangn was fun.

1076
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,581
- Do you want to sell anything?
- Do you have anything to sell?

1077
00:38:59,582 --> 00:39:01,452
- I have a lot at home.
- Like what?

1078
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:05,061
Almost everything I have at home.

1079
00:39:05,062 --> 00:39:06,521
I'm not so interested in material possessions.

1080
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:07,561
(He'll sell his stuff on Daangn soon.)

1081
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:09,431
- I'll tell you the current status.
- Okay.

1082
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:12,901
The console, the cheering stick, and the film camera have been sold.

1083
00:39:12,902 --> 00:39:14,902
- The buyers are coming. We're busy.
- Oh, okay.

1084
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:18,402
I have to go to meet the buyers...

1085
00:39:19,202 --> 00:39:21,448
- Did you bring all of these?
- Yes. I'll be waiting here...

1086
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:24,912
and give the buyers the items when they arrive.

1087
00:39:24,942 --> 00:39:27,312
The three buyers are on their way.

1088
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,511
Are you here for the Daangn deal?

1089
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:30,582
- No.
- No.

1090
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:32,982
When you wait for a buyer or a seller,

1091
00:39:33,482 --> 00:39:36,421
you can tell who is coming for a Daangn deal.

1092
00:39:36,422 --> 00:39:37,761
Ask if he or she is here for a Daangn deal.

1093
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:38,962
Will they be here shortly?

1094
00:39:39,492 --> 00:39:41,061
They'll send me a message. I haven't gotten any...

1095
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:42,132
You can wait inside.

1096
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:44,131
- Then let's go back inside...
- Okay.

1097
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,772
- and come back when they arrive.
- Okay.

1098
00:39:45,932 --> 00:39:47,212
- Let's go.
- It's cold outside.

1099
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,872
It's cold.

1100
00:39:55,672 --> 00:40:00,112
(A person who seems to be a buyer appears.)

1101
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,182
(Glancing)

1102
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:11,122
- I think she's one of the buyers.
- Sorry?

1103
00:40:11,462 --> 00:40:12,992
- Really?
- She's standing there.

1104
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:14,531
- She keeps checking her phone.
- Sorry?

1105
00:40:14,532 --> 00:40:16,491
(He's got a hunch!)

1106
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:18,362
- What?
- She's checking her phone. Look.

1107
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:21,032
- The one that's walking toward us?
- Yes.

1108
00:40:24,142 --> 00:40:25,202
Where did Won Hun go?

1109
00:40:29,872 --> 00:40:31,011
You can tell...

1110
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:34,412
(You can tell who's coming for a Daangn deal!)

1111
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:39,082
You can tell who's coming for a Daangn deal.

1112
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:43,351
- Are you here for the Daangn deal?
- Yes, I am.

1113
00:40:43,352 --> 00:40:45,121
Oh, really? Hello.

1114
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,561
- Are you here for the Daangn deal?
- Yes, I am.

1115
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:48,691
(Yes, I am!)

1116
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:50,092
Please wait for a while.

1117
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,431
What are you here to pick up?

1118
00:40:52,432 --> 00:40:53,931
What are you...

1119
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:55,431
- Me?
- What are you here to pick up?

1120
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:57,941
- I was so surprised.
- Are you here for that thing?

1121
00:40:57,942 --> 00:41:00,271
- For the cheering stick.
- Are you here for the camera?

1122
00:41:00,272 --> 00:41:04,682
Oh, the cheering stick? All right.

1123
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:06,711
- Seo Jin.
- Yes.

1124
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:08,011
- Is it there?
- Yes, it is.

1125
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:09,211
(She's here to pick up G-DRAGON's cheering stick.)

1126
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:11,222
- Which one? Is she here for a deal?
- Yes.

1127
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:13,181
- Hello.
- She's here for the cheering stick.

1128
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,292
Hello. Are you a fan of G-DRAGON's?

1129
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:16,951
She's a fan of G-DRAGON's.

1130
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:18,492
(Taken aback)

1131
00:41:19,322 --> 00:41:22,962
(Waiting from afar)

1132
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:24,461
We should ask her...

1133
00:41:24,462 --> 00:41:26,461
- if she's here for the Daangn deal.
- We already asked.

1134
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:27,772
- We already asked.
- Okay.

1135
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:30,202
- Daangn...
- We already asked her that.

1136
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,742
I used this cheering stick...

1137
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:37,181
at G-DRAGON's concert and have never used it since then.

1138
00:41:37,182 --> 00:41:38,612
- I have his photo too.
- Right.

1139
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,911
- In the box, - Can I hold it vertically?

1140
00:41:40,912 --> 00:41:44,222
There are the battery and the connector.

1141
00:41:44,822 --> 00:41:48,191
Also, I'm giving you the "Shortbox" key ring and socks.

1142
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:49,192
I put them in the box.

1143
00:41:49,193 --> 00:41:51,338
- Do you know what "Shortbox" is?
- Yes. I watch it often.

1144
00:41:51,362 --> 00:41:52,922
- Everybody knows.
- All right.

1145
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:54,862
Only you don't know.

1146
00:41:56,692 --> 00:41:58,531
Can you sing a song by G-DRAGON?

1147
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:00,332
(She has to prove that she's G-DRAGON's fan.)

1148
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,672
(Bang, bang, bang)

1149
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:09,172
(Kwang Kyu also proves that he's G-DRAGON's fan.)

1150
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:11,141
- Thank you for the deal.
- Thank you.

1151
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:12,541
- Have a happy day.
- Goodbye.

1152
00:42:12,542 --> 00:42:14,252
- Thank you.
- Go home safely.

1153
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:17,821
- This is how Daangn works.
- I see.

1154
00:42:17,822 --> 00:42:20,081
- My, Daangn is no joke.
- I just got another message.

1155
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:21,092
You got another message?

1156
00:42:21,592 --> 00:42:22,692
This buyer is calling me.

1157
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,672
The one who's buying the game console.

1158
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,092
Hello?

1159
00:42:26,322 --> 00:42:28,661
Yes. Right now,

1160
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:30,261
I'm in front of the guest house.

1161
00:42:30,262 --> 00:42:31,432
Oh, hello.

1162
00:42:33,162 --> 00:42:34,431
Hello, sir.

1163
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:36,331
(The buyer of the game console arrives.)

1164
00:42:36,332 --> 00:42:39,942
Your ID is this, right? You're here for PlayStation, right?

1165
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:42,641
I can't believe I'm making a deal with such a popular celebrity.

1166
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:45,612
- Please come here. It's here.
- Please come.

1167
00:42:45,812 --> 00:42:49,611
- When I bought this, - Yes.

1168
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:52,152
I paid between 500 and 600 dollars for it.

1169
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:54,551
I'm selling it at a low price...

1170
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:55,952
- because I have to sell it.
- I...

1171
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:57,661
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

1172
00:42:57,662 --> 00:43:00,321
Sir, you should know that the HDMI cable is missing.

1173
00:43:00,322 --> 00:43:01,391
That doesn't matter. I have one.

1174
00:43:01,392 --> 00:43:03,462
There's no controller cable either.

1175
00:43:03,762 --> 00:43:06,201
- Is this for you?
- No, it's for my child.

1176
00:43:06,202 --> 00:43:08,301
- I see. Thank you.
- You two are so famous.

1177
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:09,331
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1178
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,052
- Can I shake your hand?
- Sure. Thank you.

1179
00:43:11,502 --> 00:43:12,641
Thank you.

1180
00:43:12,642 --> 00:43:15,171
- Thank you, sir. Have a good day.
- Goodbye.

1181
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:16,511
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the business.

1182
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:18,941
Please leave a good review. Goodbye.

1183
00:43:18,942 --> 00:43:20,112
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1184
00:43:21,352 --> 00:43:24,081
(He earned 150 dollars in a blink of an eye.)

1185
00:43:24,082 --> 00:43:26,242
- This is for you.
- You don't have to give any money.

1186
00:43:26,952 --> 00:43:28,691
- Enjoy a meal with it.
- You don't have to do this.

1187
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,021
- Thank you for your help.
- Oh, come on.

1188
00:43:30,022 --> 00:43:32,791
- Seo Jin, thank you for your help.
- This is... Okay.

1189
00:43:32,792 --> 00:43:34,291
- Thank you.
- Let's eat something delicious.

1190
00:43:34,292 --> 00:43:36,368
- We earned 150 dollars.
- Let's eat something delicious.

1191
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:37,431
Which one is left now?

1192
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:40,202
We just sold the game console. We have the camera left.

1193
00:43:41,972 --> 00:43:44,072
Do you have anything expensive to sell?

1194
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:46,371
- You want to sell more, right?
- Yes.

1195
00:43:46,372 --> 00:43:48,641
(You want to sell more, right?)

1196
00:43:48,642 --> 00:43:51,012
(He chuckles as he says yes.)

1197
00:43:51,582 --> 00:43:53,641
That was fun. Selling things on Daangn was fun.

1198
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:55,011
What was fun about it?

1199
00:43:55,012 --> 00:43:56,532
You can get cash right then and there.

1200
00:43:57,952 --> 00:44:00,082
(Smiling with deep dimples)

1201
00:44:00,892 --> 00:44:02,552
This isn't bad at all. It's fun.

1202
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:06,138
- I want to keep listing items.
- It's not fun when it's not sold.

1203
00:44:06,162 --> 00:44:07,961
(Addicted)

1204
00:44:07,962 --> 00:44:09,162
Shall we list your jacket?

1205
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:12,378
If we list this jacket, it will be sold right away.

1206
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:14,501
- I guess so.
- We have to wait...

1207
00:44:14,502 --> 00:44:16,422
until it's completely sold out and then list it.

1208
00:44:16,872 --> 00:44:19,642
That's right. You did major in business administration.

1209
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:22,471
(Addict 1, Addict 2)

1210
00:44:22,472 --> 00:44:24,481
- Shall I go up and list more stuff?
- Yes, you should.

1211
00:44:24,482 --> 00:44:25,612
This is the most fun thing.

1212
00:44:29,212 --> 00:44:30,451
- Hello?
- Hello?

1213
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:32,122
Yes, hello.

1214
00:44:32,652 --> 00:44:36,151
- Hello.
- I'm calling regarding the camera.

1215
00:44:36,152 --> 00:44:37,262
When will you arrive?

1216
00:44:38,392 --> 00:44:41,661
I'm heading from Hapjeong to Hongdae right now.

1217
00:44:41,662 --> 00:44:44,131
- I'll be there in 15 minutes.
- Yes. I see.

1218
00:44:44,132 --> 00:44:46,032
I understand. Please call me when you get here.

1219
00:44:46,802 --> 00:44:48,532
- I'll do that.
- Yes. Thank you.

1220
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:50,002
Bye.

1221
00:44:50,003 --> 00:44:51,642
I'm Kim Won Hun from Shortbox.

1222
00:44:52,642 --> 00:44:54,542
- Pardon?
- I'm Kim Won Hun from Shortbox.

1223
00:44:56,412 --> 00:44:57,612
Oh, you... Pardon me?

1224
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:00,681
(Chuckling)

1225
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:02,682
Say, "I'm Kim Kwang Kyu from My Grumpy Secretary."

1226
00:45:04,252 --> 00:45:05,752
- Hello?
- Yes.

1227
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:08,291
(Chuckling)

1228
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:11,762
- Hello?
- Yes. Call me when you arrive.

1229
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:13,322
(The call ended.)

1230
00:45:13,323 --> 00:45:14,731
- The call ended.
- Hello?

1231
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:16,091
This is Won Hun's manager.

1232
00:45:16,092 --> 00:45:17,231
- The call ended.
- Okay.

1233
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:19,261
You should've introduced yourself as a cast member of this show.

1234
00:45:19,262 --> 00:45:20,982
- I was going to, but he hung up.
- Really?

1235
00:45:22,732 --> 00:45:23,732
Oh, gosh. This is...

1236
00:45:24,242 --> 00:45:25,242
(Chuckling softly)

1237
00:45:25,802 --> 00:45:27,872
My temperature rose by 2°C.

1238
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:29,072
What is it now?

1239
00:45:29,472 --> 00:45:31,111
- You measure a temperature there?
- Yes.

1240
00:45:31,112 --> 00:45:33,481
It's called "manner temperature."

1241
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:36,051
The higher your temperature is,

1242
00:45:36,052 --> 00:45:38,028
the better you are as a person to make a deal with.

1243
00:45:38,052 --> 00:45:40,051
My temperature isn't low either.

1244
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:42,612
- Let me check your temperature.
- So it's like a credit rating.

1245
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:45,692
Your body temperature is over 38°C.

1246
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:47,121
You should go home now.

1247
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:48,992
(Won Hun pranks him.)

1248
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,332
My manner temperature is 36.7°C.

1249
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:56,931
- That's a standard temperature.
- Is it?

1250
00:45:56,932 --> 00:45:58,541
- I haven't...
- Your temperature is normal.

1251
00:45:58,542 --> 00:45:59,972
I haven't used it in a while.

1252
00:46:00,142 --> 00:46:01,662
My manner temperature decreased a lot.

1253
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:03,342
You got another message.

1254
00:46:06,482 --> 00:46:09,112
The person is asking if I could also sell the white sneakers.

1255
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:10,982
- Yes. That's possible.
- Who?

1256
00:46:11,782 --> 00:46:13,552
The person buying the camera...

1257
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:16,791
asked if the sneakers could be bought as well.

1258
00:46:16,792 --> 00:46:17,821
Yes. That's possible.

1259
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:19,262
Two birds with one stone.

1260
00:46:19,322 --> 00:46:20,861
The person who called earlier.

1261
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:21,891
That's right.

1262
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,832
The person who will get here after ten minutes.

1263
00:46:24,232 --> 00:46:26,601
This person is very excited.

1264
00:46:26,602 --> 00:46:28,071
- Why?
- Excited to buy things.

1265
00:46:28,072 --> 00:46:29,072
Really?

1266
00:46:29,073 --> 00:46:31,502
The person was going to buy a film camera,

1267
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,741
but after seeing the sneakers,

1268
00:46:33,742 --> 00:46:35,442
they were added to the list.

1269
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:38,442
If I also give these 2 for 1 dollar,

1270
00:46:38,912 --> 00:46:40,212
that person might like it.

1271
00:46:40,282 --> 00:46:42,752
I'll sort it out on-site.

1272
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:44,282
Right.

1273
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:45,582
Just make the suggestion.

1274
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:47,521
"I'm in front of the building."

1275
00:46:47,522 --> 00:46:48,591
(The buyer has arrived.)

1276
00:46:48,592 --> 00:46:50,422
"I'm in front of the building."

1277
00:46:52,492 --> 00:46:53,732
"I'm in front of the building."

1278
00:46:53,862 --> 00:46:54,862
(Taking off his jacket)

1279
00:46:54,863 --> 00:46:56,632
"I'm in front of the building."

1280
00:46:56,692 --> 00:46:58,001
(The capitalist seal is extra enthusiastic today.)

1281
00:46:58,002 --> 00:46:59,332
It's today's last trade.

1282
00:47:00,362 --> 00:47:02,072
Just in case,

1283
00:47:02,172 --> 00:47:04,271
could you say,

1284
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:06,101
"The clothes are really pretty..."

1285
00:47:06,102 --> 00:47:07,471
from behind?

1286
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:09,971
- What?
- The texture is really nice...

1287
00:47:09,972 --> 00:47:11,981
- and the material is good.
- Okay.

1288
00:47:11,982 --> 00:47:14,282
You can go down first. We'll follow.

1289
00:47:14,482 --> 00:47:16,051
While you're talking...

1290
00:47:16,052 --> 00:47:17,521
- You'll come after?
- Yes.

1291
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:19,452
"Would you like to check out the clothes?"

1292
00:47:19,652 --> 00:47:22,292
"I also have sweaters. Couple sweaters."

1293
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:29,692
(The prospective buyer is waiting at the meeting spot.)

1294
00:47:30,802 --> 00:47:35,532
(I'm coming to meet you now.)

1295
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:45,042
- Daangn?
- Yes.

1296
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:46,482
Hello.

1297
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:49,251
Here.

1298
00:47:49,252 --> 00:47:50,652
Goodness.

1299
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:55,092
That's right. It was me.

1300
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,422
- Would you like to see the camera?
- Yes.

1301
00:47:57,822 --> 00:47:59,821
I never used it.

1302
00:47:59,822 --> 00:48:00,892
Right.

1303
00:48:01,532 --> 00:48:03,691
Film cameras have that nostalgic feeling.

1304
00:48:03,692 --> 00:48:05,172
- It's got the film as well.
- Right.

1305
00:48:05,432 --> 00:48:07,231
I checked the wrong size...

1306
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:10,102
for the shoes.

1307
00:48:10,502 --> 00:48:11,941
That's how I got size 230.

1308
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:13,402
Right. My shoe size is 230.

1309
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:15,271
Will you buy the shoes as well?

1310
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:17,271
Yes. I wanted them as well.

1311
00:48:17,272 --> 00:48:18,882
- Right.
- But...

1312
00:48:18,912 --> 00:48:21,652
Are you not interested in clothes?

1313
00:48:22,452 --> 00:48:24,552
Are you not interested in clothes?

1314
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:26,822
Have you seen the cardigans?

1315
00:48:27,122 --> 00:48:28,668
- I have.
- What do you think about those?

1316
00:48:28,692 --> 00:48:30,322
Would you like to check how they look?

1317
00:48:31,162 --> 00:48:33,192
Would you like to check how they look?

1318
00:48:33,262 --> 00:48:35,261
- What do you think?
- They look like this.

1319
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:36,632
- Hold on.
- It's...

1320
00:48:37,362 --> 00:48:41,072
(Grumpy Secretary walks out.)

1321
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,732
It's actually...

1322
00:48:43,802 --> 00:48:45,871
It may not look so because they're wearing them,

1323
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:47,942
but they're oversized.

1324
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:50,311
So they'd probably fall...

1325
00:48:50,312 --> 00:48:52,141
right on your thighs.

1326
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:54,652
You can wear pants like the ones you're wearing now...

1327
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:56,382
and wear the cardigan on top.

1328
00:48:56,452 --> 00:48:59,682
You'd become a Hongdae person. Gen Z.

1329
00:49:00,082 --> 00:49:02,252
Could you take one off?

1330
00:49:02,322 --> 00:49:03,821
Wear it for just a bit.

1331
00:49:03,822 --> 00:49:05,461
- Try it on.
- I'll just put it on you.

1332
00:49:05,462 --> 00:49:06,522
- Okay.
- Just on top.

1333
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:08,861
- If you don't like it...
- Hold on.

1334
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,162
Give it to me.

1335
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,561
It looks great the moment you wear it.

1336
00:49:13,562 --> 00:49:14,602
Seriously.

1337
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:16,431
It's perfect.

1338
00:49:16,432 --> 00:49:17,641
- No...
- It looks nice.

1339
00:49:17,642 --> 00:49:19,102
- It suits you.
- Seriously.

1340
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:20,671
It's perfect.

1341
00:49:20,672 --> 00:49:21,811
- No...
- It looks nice.

1342
00:49:21,812 --> 00:49:23,242
- It suits you.
- Seriously.

1343
00:49:23,572 --> 00:49:25,011
These two...

1344
00:49:25,012 --> 00:49:26,712
cost one dollar.

1345
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:29,012
- One costs 50 cents.
- Right.

1346
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:30,611
If you add one dollar...

1347
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:31,681
(Thinking)

1348
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:32,852
Hold on.

1349
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,902
- What should I do?
- Just give it to her.

1350
00:49:36,292 --> 00:49:37,491
It suits her.

1351
00:49:37,492 --> 00:49:38,891
- We'll just give it to you.
- No. Don't do that.

1352
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,862
- I'll give you one dollar.
- Please don't.

1353
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:42,691
- This...
- This...

1354
00:49:42,692 --> 00:49:44,492
- Just give this to her..
- is how you trade.

1355
00:49:45,802 --> 00:49:46,962
It suited her well.

1356
00:49:47,132 --> 00:49:49,902
The same outfit looks different on a young person...

1357
00:49:50,172 --> 00:49:52,742
and an older person.

1358
00:49:53,842 --> 00:49:56,372
It looked nice. She looked like a fashionist.

1359
00:49:57,312 --> 00:49:59,382
- This...
- Just give this to her.

1360
00:49:59,612 --> 00:50:01,452
Let her wear it. It's cold.

1361
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:03,811
Then I'll give you the shoes for 35 dollars,

1362
00:50:03,812 --> 00:50:05,181
together with the two cardigans.

1363
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:06,652
No. Don't give her this.

1364
00:50:06,782 --> 00:50:08,792
The price is different than the one you wrote.

1365
00:50:09,052 --> 00:50:11,061
Yes. I'm suggesting a counter-bargain.

1366
00:50:11,062 --> 00:50:13,262
Goodness. You're a punk.

1367
00:50:13,622 --> 00:50:16,732
Can I take it for the original price and pay one dollar for those?

1368
00:50:18,132 --> 00:50:19,202
Is that what you want?

1369
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:20,401
I do.

1370
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:21,771
Let's do this.

1371
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:24,301
- You can wear this.
- Okay.

1372
00:50:24,302 --> 00:50:26,902
I'll just give you this cardigan for free.

1373
00:50:26,972 --> 00:50:29,812
I'll give you the rest for the original price.

1374
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:31,781
- Will you pay by Daangn Pay?
- No.

1375
00:50:31,782 --> 00:50:33,311
- Then? Account?
- Bank transfer.

1376
00:50:33,312 --> 00:50:34,682
- Bank transfer.
- Yes.

1377
00:50:35,112 --> 00:50:36,152
KB Bank.

1378
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:39,982
- KB Bank.
- It's 816902...

1379
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:41,221
(If someone asks for a bank transfer in a secondhand transaction, )

1380
00:50:41,222 --> 00:50:42,351
(it's often a scam, )

1381
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:43,421
(so extra caution is required.)

1382
00:50:43,422 --> 00:50:45,162
- I'll just check if it came.
- Okay.

1383
00:50:46,462 --> 00:50:47,861
It was transferred.

1384
00:50:47,862 --> 00:50:50,831
The total balance is 8,200 dollars.

1385
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:52,462
- I see.
- Thank you.

1386
00:50:52,702 --> 00:50:54,631
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1387
00:50:54,632 --> 00:50:56,031
Take care.

1388
00:50:56,032 --> 00:50:57,302
Thank you.

1389
00:50:57,372 --> 00:51:00,142
(After the storm-like transaction)

1390
00:51:02,112 --> 00:51:03,211
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

1391
00:51:03,212 --> 00:51:06,242
There's dim sum in the freezer.

1392
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:07,512
Yes.

1393
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:09,512
Let's eat that.

1394
00:51:10,182 --> 00:51:11,251
We don't have time.

1395
00:51:11,252 --> 00:51:13,121
There's dim sum in the freezer.

1396
00:51:13,122 --> 00:51:14,321
(The Grumpy Secretary get along so well at such times.)

1397
00:51:14,322 --> 00:51:16,121
My hands are freezing because it's cold.

1398
00:51:16,122 --> 00:51:18,592
(They don't have time to eat in today's schedule.)

1399
00:51:19,122 --> 00:51:22,462
(Korea No.1 Dim Sum)

1400
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:23,532
Pour them.

1401
00:51:25,002 --> 00:51:26,962
Isn't this too much?

1402
00:51:27,532 --> 00:51:30,372
(We have to quickly eat now.)

1403
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:34,812
- How many minutes?
- Six minutes.

1404
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,982
(Singing)

1405
00:51:41,782 --> 00:51:44,782
(His energy goes up just thinking about eating dim sum.)

1406
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:49,522
Nice.

1407
00:51:50,952 --> 00:51:52,022
Try it.

1408
00:51:52,392 --> 00:51:53,922
You can eat it quickly and easily...

1409
00:51:54,022 --> 00:51:56,362
when you don't have time like right now.

1410
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:59,731
(Eating)

1411
00:51:59,732 --> 00:52:01,032
It looks nice.

1412
00:52:03,372 --> 00:52:04,772
The juice.

1413
00:52:09,412 --> 00:52:10,642
It's falling.

1414
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:11,881
The juice. Goodness.

1415
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:13,212
(He's eating with his face.)

1416
00:52:16,612 --> 00:52:17,612
Even the flavour.

1417
00:52:20,682 --> 00:52:22,392
(Eating)

1418
00:52:25,092 --> 00:52:26,522
It's good.

1419
00:52:30,632 --> 00:52:32,202
It doesn't feel like it was frozen.

1420
00:52:32,262 --> 00:52:34,502
It's like the ones they sell at the dim sum restaurants.

1421
00:52:36,132 --> 00:52:37,132
It's hot.

1422
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:40,872
(They're having a good-quality meal for the first time in a while.)

1423
00:52:42,012 --> 00:52:43,672
Now, with Daangn...

1424
00:52:47,312 --> 00:52:49,252
I can really smell them dumplings.

1425
00:52:49,952 --> 00:52:51,682
It wasn't dumplings. Dim sum.

1426
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:55,692
We have to get ready to shoot. There's no time to eat.

1427
00:52:56,192 --> 00:52:57,192
We're done.

1428
00:52:57,193 --> 00:52:58,561
(He's very unapologetic.)

1429
00:52:58,562 --> 00:53:00,491
I went to the fourth floor...

1430
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:02,161
with a citizen...

1431
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:04,861
- who was passing by.
- Did you sell something?

1432
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:06,102
I sold four pieces of clothing.

1433
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,701
- Clothes? Really?
- Four outfits and a charger.

1434
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:11,242
I earned 238 dollars today.

1435
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:13,701
That's nice.

1436
00:53:13,702 --> 00:53:15,448
(Grumpy Secretary has fallen into the charms of Daangn.)

1437
00:53:15,472 --> 00:53:17,881
- I have to go to the shooting.
- Yes.

1438
00:53:17,882 --> 00:53:20,041
There's an outfit over there.

1439
00:53:20,042 --> 00:53:21,382
Do we have to take all those?

1440
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,112
Two black outfits.

1441
00:53:23,612 --> 00:53:24,821
Not the jacket?

1442
00:53:24,822 --> 00:53:25,952
Not the jacket.

1443
00:53:26,282 --> 00:53:27,522
It's black.

1444
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:29,091
One jacket...

1445
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:31,961
- The pants.
- The pants and the shirt.

1446
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:33,122
- The shirt?
- Yes.

1447
00:53:33,492 --> 00:53:35,062
- Please take these.
- Okay.

1448
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:38,032
- This...
- This.

1449
00:53:38,102 --> 00:53:39,178
Should I give it to you as a gift?

1450
00:53:39,202 --> 00:53:40,762
- This?
- Yes.

1451
00:53:40,832 --> 00:53:42,102
No.

1452
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:45,201
Well... Give it to Seo Jin.

1453
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:46,642
Should I give this to you as a gift?

1454
00:53:48,372 --> 00:53:49,412
What is that?

1455
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:51,842
It's me.

1456
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:52,982
What is that?

1457
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:56,712
I wrote the mindset I should have...

1458
00:53:56,812 --> 00:53:58,721
when I'm doing comedy.

1459
00:53:58,722 --> 00:54:00,351
I wanted to do one crazy thing per day.

1460
00:54:00,352 --> 00:54:02,451
That's how I made the shirt.

1461
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:03,668
(1 crazy thing per day. Sometimes, it shouldn't make sense.)

1462
00:54:03,692 --> 00:54:06,322
I was mad to be excited when I saw it from a distance.

1463
00:54:08,092 --> 00:54:10,261
- Let's take this too.
- Shall we go?

1464
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:11,731
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1465
00:54:11,732 --> 00:54:12,932
(The lady who excited Seo Jin)

1466
00:54:20,102 --> 00:54:21,271
(Should I take everything?)

1467
00:54:21,272 --> 00:54:22,911
- Please bring it to the 1st floor.
- The 1st floor?

1468
00:54:22,912 --> 00:54:24,171
(They're moving the YouTube filming equipment.)

1469
00:54:24,172 --> 00:54:25,212
Why is this so heavy?

1470
00:54:26,442 --> 00:54:27,981
(They all help carry them.)

1471
00:54:27,982 --> 00:54:29,752
Thank you.

1472
00:54:31,522 --> 00:54:34,381
The space is tight,

1473
00:54:34,382 --> 00:54:35,952
so you have to fit them in well.

1474
00:54:37,922 --> 00:54:39,622
There's a lot of equipment.

1475
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:43,062
The filming set is quite large.

1476
00:54:43,692 --> 00:54:44,931
We're filming at a school.

1477
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:46,378
(They finish loading the filming equipment for Shortbox.)

1478
00:54:46,402 --> 00:54:48,202
- Turn left from here.
- You have to go left.

1479
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:50,048
The school has an underground parking lot.

1480
00:54:50,072 --> 00:54:52,071
Please gather around. Hurry up.

1481
00:54:52,072 --> 00:54:53,972
Are you going to go with that voice?

1482
00:54:55,212 --> 00:55:00,812
(People are serious before the filming.)

1483
00:55:01,312 --> 00:55:02,551
Please focus!

1484
00:55:02,552 --> 00:55:06,822
(With the fiery performance of My Star, the short-form idol, )

1485
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:09,921
(Grumpy Secretary, with a combined 52 years of acting experience, )

1486
00:55:09,922 --> 00:55:12,692
(will make a cameo appearance.)

1487
00:55:13,192 --> 00:55:16,031
(My Star and Grumpy Secretary arrive at the filming set.)

1488
00:55:16,032 --> 00:55:17,132
Hello.

1489
00:55:17,362 --> 00:55:19,532
- Ji Yoon.
- Hello.

1490
00:55:20,132 --> 00:55:21,432
- You're here.
- Hello.

1491
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:24,401
This is Ji Yoon. She works with me...

1492
00:55:24,402 --> 00:55:26,202
- at Shortbox.
- That's right.

1493
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:28,032
I think I've seen her on "Gag Concert."

1494
00:55:28,272 --> 00:55:29,441
- We were on "Gag Concert" together.
- Right.

1495
00:55:29,442 --> 00:55:30,771
- Right.
- All our members.

1496
00:55:30,772 --> 00:55:31,882
(He's seen her on TV.)

1497
00:55:31,982 --> 00:55:34,211
- Is he your managers today?
- Yes.

1498
00:55:34,212 --> 00:55:36,511
- Is he a secretary?
- Yes. My secretary.

1499
00:55:36,512 --> 00:55:38,482
He's my secretary and a butler.

1500
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:40,521
- Even a butler?
- Yes.

1501
00:55:40,522 --> 00:55:41,922
He also has to clean my room later.

1502
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:45,291
(Will he be Grumpy Butler after Grumpy Secretary?)

1503
00:55:45,292 --> 00:55:46,462
He works a lot.

1504
00:55:46,522 --> 00:55:47,562
Kwang Kyu!

1505
00:55:49,332 --> 00:55:50,532
Why is he so slow?

1506
00:55:51,462 --> 00:55:52,631
(Right. There was one more person.)

1507
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:53,662
The space is so tight.

1508
00:55:53,932 --> 00:55:57,402
(The colourful parking man)

1509
00:55:58,042 --> 00:55:59,201
Hello.

1510
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,141
- Hello.
- Hello.

1511
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:03,471
- He's very colourful.
- I...

1512
00:56:03,472 --> 00:56:05,141
This is in the Shortbox office...

1513
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:06,681
- as inventory.
- That's right.

1514
00:56:06,682 --> 00:56:08,781
- I gave them to him as a gift.
- She knew about it.

1515
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,311
The cardigan and the pants.

1516
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:11,581
He was looking...

1517
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:12,851
for someone to take those...

1518
00:56:12,852 --> 00:56:14,692
- for a year.
- These...

1519
00:56:14,852 --> 00:56:16,191
Honestly speaking,

1520
00:56:16,192 --> 00:56:18,061
- twelve people have tried those.
- Really?

1521
00:56:18,062 --> 00:56:19,091
But we couldn't find the owner.

1522
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:20,862
- We finally met the owner today.
- Really?

1523
00:56:21,692 --> 00:56:22,992
There was someone to take it.

1524
00:56:23,192 --> 00:56:24,431
No. I...

1525
00:56:24,432 --> 00:56:26,502
- Hello.
- Hello.

1526
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:27,831
This is Jin Se who works with us.

1527
00:56:27,832 --> 00:56:29,071
- Hello.
- I've seen him a lot.

1528
00:56:29,072 --> 00:56:30,102
Right.

1529
00:56:30,472 --> 00:56:31,571
I've seen him a lot on "Gag Concert."

1530
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:32,741
Thank you.

1531
00:56:32,742 --> 00:56:34,401
- Thank you.
- He's watched everything.

1532
00:56:34,402 --> 00:56:35,871
- "Gag Concert?"
- I really liked...

1533
00:56:35,872 --> 00:56:37,311
"Gag Concert" for a long time.

1534
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:38,982
- Really?
- Yes.

1535
00:56:39,682 --> 00:56:41,382
I've seen you.

1536
00:56:41,552 --> 00:56:43,011
They both have great skin.

1537
00:56:43,012 --> 00:56:44,428

1540
00:56:50,322 --> 00:56:51,792

- Let's start right away.

- Let's start right away.
- Yes.

- Let's try it.
- Let's start.

1551
00:57:19,652 --> 00:57:21,551
- You can be resting.
- You can rest.

1552
00:57:21,552 --> 00:57:22,552
- Okay.
- I'll call you if I need help.

1553
00:57:22,553 --> 00:57:24,252
Okay.

1554
00:57:24,722 --> 00:57:25,722
Like this?

00:57:56,452 --> 00:57:58,132
I can't believe I'm an illegitimate child.

1574
00:57:59,262 --> 00:58:00,421
(He's in spectator mode.)

1575
00:58:00,422 --> 00:58:01,491
I can't believe I'm an illegitimate child.

1576
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:02,762
Cut!

1577
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:07,461
(The scene ended just 10 seconds after they got up.)

1578
00:58:07,462 --> 00:58:08,602
Cut, cut.

1579
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:10,101
Cut. Hold on.

1580
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:12,601
(The scene ended just 10 seconds after they got up.)

1581
00:58:12,602 --> 00:58:13,671
Let's start.

1582
00:58:13,672 --> 00:58:16,212
Everyone on camera should act.

1583
00:58:16,642 --> 00:58:17,771
- Let's start.
- Okay.

1584
00:58:17,772 --> 00:58:19,041
Go.

1585
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:22,112
(Self-acting and directing?)

1586
00:58:22,712 --> 00:58:25,551
(Doing his signature frustrated expression)

1587
00:58:25,552 --> 00:58:26,721
Okay. Cut.

1588
00:58:26,722 --> 00:58:28,692
(He gives himself an okay.)

1589
00:58:30,652 --> 00:58:32,662
He acted and he confirmed it.

1590
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:34,932
(This was just the beginning.)

1591
00:58:35,462 --> 00:58:36,862
Please focus.

1592
00:58:37,362 --> 00:58:38,762
- Cut.
- Cut.

1593
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:40,601
(This isn't tag.)

1594
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:41,831
Until this point for now.

1595
00:58:41,832 --> 00:58:43,002
Go.

1596
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:45,872
It's tenfold, no, a hundredfold more precious.

1597
00:58:46,972 --> 00:58:48,111
Cut.

1598
00:58:48,112 --> 00:58:49,212
Nice.

1599
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:50,571
They film it so quickly.

1600
00:58:50,572 --> 00:58:52,212
(They film it so quickly.)

1601
00:58:52,682 --> 00:58:53,811
They film it so quickly.

1602
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:55,611
(Grumpy Secretary with a combined 52 years of experience...)

1603
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:56,851
(is unfamiliar with the new media.)

1604
00:58:56,852 --> 00:58:57,912
Cut.

1605
00:58:58,052 --> 00:58:59,052
- Cut.
- Cut.

1606
00:58:59,322 --> 00:59:00,351
Cut.

1607
00:59:00,352 --> 00:59:01,421
Cut.

1608
00:59:01,422 --> 00:59:02,591
Cut!

1609
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:04,472
(The dramatic actor with a confused expression)

1610
00:59:04,592 --> 00:59:05,861
People still like it...

1611
00:59:05,862 --> 00:59:07,362
even when it's made so casually.

1612
00:59:09,092 --> 00:59:10,732
That's interesting.

1613
00:59:11,702 --> 00:59:12,932
Isn't it interesting?

1614
00:59:13,532 --> 00:59:14,731
Isn't the filming set interesting?

1615
00:59:14,732 --> 00:59:16,772
How do you film it so quickly?

1616
00:59:17,002 --> 00:59:18,301
He's very flustered.

1617
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:19,641
What are you doing?

1618
00:59:19,642 --> 00:59:21,672
(The reason why Seo Genie is flustered...)

1619
00:59:22,542 --> 00:59:24,671
(On a drama set, the roles of a director...)

1620
00:59:24,672 --> 00:59:27,082
(and the actors are divided.)

1621
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:31,011
(The actors act according to the script and the movement plan.)

1622
00:59:31,012 --> 00:59:34,422
(The director watches the actors act and directs them.)

1623
00:59:34,622 --> 00:59:37,091
(But it's different in Shortbox.)

1624
00:59:37,092 --> 00:59:38,462
Go.

1625
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:40,221
Does anyone have any questions...

1626
00:59:40,222 --> 00:59:41,762
or anything they didn't understand?

1627
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:43,692
Yes.

1628
00:59:43,932 --> 00:59:45,562
How many professors are there?

1629
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:47,831
(Exclaiming)

1630
00:59:47,832 --> 00:59:49,532
You'll know when you get there.

1631
00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:51,841
Let's say, "That, you'll know..."

1632
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:53,271
(Shortbox's unique feature: 1. Immediate feedback...)

1633
00:59:53,272 --> 00:59:54,571
(during the acting)

1634
00:59:54,572 --> 00:59:56,512
That, you'll know when you get there.

1635
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:58,242
Okay. We'll keep that for now.

1636
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:01,342
Okay. Let's do it again from here.

1637
01:00:01,612 --> 01:00:04,211
(2. Even if the scene gets an OK, they volunteer to redo it.)

1638
01:00:04,212 --> 01:00:05,382
Nice.

1639
01:00:05,522 --> 01:00:08,391
- I think some should come forward.
- Yes. The bathroom.

1640
01:00:08,392 --> 01:00:11,022
(3. The movement plan changes on the spot.)

1641
01:00:11,422 --> 01:00:14,221
(The 26-year veteran is completely amazed by the sight.)

1642
01:00:14,222 --> 01:00:17,132
I was reminded of the time...

1643
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:20,001
when I shot a short movie when I first entered university.

1644
01:00:20,002 --> 01:00:21,972
That's why I smiled.

1645
01:00:22,102 --> 01:00:24,102
The amount they filmed today...

1646
01:00:24,432 --> 01:00:27,902
would normally take a day or two to film.

1647
01:00:28,042 --> 01:00:30,471
They shot that in five hours. I think that's amazing.

1648
01:00:30,472 --> 01:00:33,441
It's so fascinating that the end result...

1649
01:00:33,442 --> 01:00:36,612
comes out really funny.

1650
01:00:37,112 --> 01:00:38,551
We can just leave this.

1651
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,421
(How would the final version look like?)

1652
01:00:41,422 --> 01:00:42,821
Does anyone have any questions...

1653
01:00:42,822 --> 01:00:44,522
or anything they didn't understand?

1654
01:00:45,322 --> 01:00:47,121
- Yes.
- How many professors are there?

1655
01:00:47,122 --> 01:00:48,691
That, you'll know when you get there.

1656
01:00:48,692 --> 01:00:50,031
Couldn't you tell us?

1657
01:00:50,032 --> 01:00:52,231
What is the registration number of the person who just asked that?

1658
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:54,362
We will move in two lines.

1659
01:00:54,402 --> 01:00:56,632
(Watch the full clip on Shortbox.)

1660
01:00:56,702 --> 01:00:58,841
- Please focus!
- Focus!

1661
01:00:58,842 --> 01:01:01,911
(Shortbox keeps working for the fans.)

1662
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:03,212
Don't get nervous.

1663
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:07,512
(The Grumpy Secretary stays close to the three...)

1664
01:01:07,812 --> 01:01:12,622
(in shadow mode, ready to assist whenever needed.)

1665
01:01:13,182 --> 01:01:14,751
(Time goes by, )

1666
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:18,122
(and 2 hours have passed.)

1667
01:01:22,292 --> 01:01:25,002
(Getting his camera)

1668
01:01:26,862 --> 01:01:27,932
Look at him.

1669
01:01:30,002 --> 01:01:34,242
(Seo Jin is fighting with his sleep.)

1670
01:01:34,602 --> 01:01:39,541
(But his eyelids give up and drop.)

1671
01:01:39,542 --> 01:01:41,951
(The dimples move.)

1672
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:43,781
Seo Jin always said...

1673
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,481
he doesn't take naps.

1674
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:47,251
(He doesn't take naps.)

1675
01:01:47,252 --> 01:01:49,091
- He slept miserably.
- Miserably...

1676
01:01:49,092 --> 01:01:50,991
(He slept miserably.)

1677
01:01:50,992 --> 01:01:52,191
He slept like this.

1678
01:01:52,192 --> 01:01:54,022
(He slept like this.)

1679
01:01:54,462 --> 01:01:59,132
(The miserable world of napping uncomfortably)

1680
01:01:59,302 --> 01:02:01,061
I can't even wake him up.

1681
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:02,202
(He's flustered.)

1682
01:02:03,002 --> 01:02:06,541
(He looks like he's taken many short naps.)

1683
01:02:06,542 --> 01:02:09,111
I might also fall asleep.

1684
01:02:09,112 --> 01:02:11,371
(Cameraman)

1685
01:02:11,372 --> 01:02:12,741
I slept about three times...

1686
01:02:12,742 --> 01:02:14,182
while watching "Intimate Strangers."

1687
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:18,822
(He was offended.)

1688
01:02:20,652 --> 01:02:22,321
Where did Kwang Kyu go?

1689
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,792
(By the way...)

1690
01:02:25,562 --> 01:02:26,921
Seo Jin is really sleeping.

1691
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:28,791
(Kwang Kyu, who was taking pictures of Seo Jin sleep, )

1692
01:02:28,792 --> 01:02:30,331
Where is Kwang Kyu?

1693
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:32,262
(is gone.)

1694
01:02:32,902 --> 01:02:35,101
Where is Kwang Kyu?

1695
01:02:35,102 --> 01:02:36,701
(He's flustered.)

1696
01:02:36,702 --> 01:02:37,972
Kwang Kyu!

1697
01:02:39,472 --> 01:02:41,102
(Eating)

1698
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:49,281
Since I lack stamina,

1699
01:02:49,282 --> 01:02:51,381
(He's enjoying a meal at a nearby street food restaurant.)

1700
01:02:51,382 --> 01:02:52,942
I can't go by with only one meal a day.

1701
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:55,791
Even if I eat a little,

1702
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:58,562
I should eat three times a day.

1703
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:03,491
(There's no Seo Jin to nag him.)

1704
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:07,632
(His chopsticks move energetically.)

1705
01:03:07,832 --> 01:03:10,571
(It seems Kwang Kyu's fall appetite...)

1706
01:03:10,572 --> 01:03:12,702
(will last through the winter.)

1707
01:03:13,142 --> 01:03:16,311
(At the same time, Seo Jin woke up from his short nap.)

1708
01:03:16,312 --> 01:03:18,482
He went to have a meal alone.

1709
01:03:18,782 --> 01:03:20,482
He went out alone?

1710
01:03:20,742 --> 01:03:21,881
To eat again?

1711
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:23,382
(To eat again?)

1712
01:03:23,612 --> 01:03:25,351
Why is he eating so much these days?

1713
01:03:25,352 --> 01:03:26,922
(He's flustered.)

1714
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:28,792
Let's try this, Jin Se.

1715
01:03:29,022 --> 01:03:30,251
Jin Se?

1716
01:03:30,252 --> 01:03:31,622
Let's try this.

1717
01:03:32,122 --> 01:03:33,391
The cheongsimhwan.

1718
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,191
The cheongsimhwan...

1719
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:38,031
It's not a pill.

1720
01:03:38,032 --> 01:03:40,201
- No way.
- I know. So...

1721
01:03:40,202 --> 01:03:42,931
This is the extract. It's not the pill.

1722
01:03:42,932 --> 01:03:45,241
This doesn't bring out the feeling.

1723
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:46,741
Is this cheongsimhwan?

1724
01:03:46,742 --> 01:03:48,812
- It's the pure extract.
- It's cheongsimhwan.

1725
01:03:49,072 --> 01:03:51,271
- Are we going to open this now?
- As soon as we can...

1726
01:03:51,272 --> 01:03:52,942
(Seo Jin with keen hearing gets up.)

1727
01:03:53,142 --> 01:03:54,382
Should I get you cheongsimhwan?

1728
01:03:54,642 --> 01:03:55,982
- Hold on.
- No.

1729
01:03:56,712 --> 01:03:58,281
(Seo Genie volunteers to do errands.)

1730
01:03:58,282 --> 01:03:59,722
- Hold on.
- No.

1731
01:03:59,922 --> 01:04:01,162
Should I get you cheongsimhwan?

1732
01:04:01,452 --> 01:04:02,891
Our prop...

1733
01:04:02,892 --> 01:04:04,192
- Right. It's...
- Yes.

1734
01:04:04,322 --> 01:04:06,621
- It's supposed to be a pill.
- You want the pill.

1735
01:04:06,622 --> 01:04:07,761
I'll get it quickly.

1736
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:10,091
(I'll get it quickly.)

1737
01:04:10,092 --> 01:04:11,291
Is this really...

1738
01:04:11,292 --> 01:04:12,601
(They're dazed.)

1739
01:04:12,602 --> 01:04:13,762
Is this...

1740
01:04:16,802 --> 01:04:18,001
Props are very important...

1741
01:04:18,002 --> 01:04:19,602
in dramas too.

1742
01:04:19,672 --> 01:04:20,702
The details.

1743
01:04:21,342 --> 01:04:23,472
If the props team fails to prepare them,

1744
01:04:24,012 --> 01:04:27,041
things go crazy. That's how it normally is.

1745
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:28,482
But they...

1746
01:04:28,682 --> 01:04:30,882
were just discussing what to do with each other.

1747
01:04:31,782 --> 01:04:33,851
There were no staff members.

1748
01:04:33,852 --> 01:04:35,668
(It looks like he felt concerned because they were short on hands.)

1749
01:04:35,692 --> 01:04:37,921
(Seo Jin came out to get cheongsimhwan.)

1750
01:04:37,922 --> 01:04:39,692
Is Kwang Kyu back?

1751
01:04:40,822 --> 01:04:44,392
(The older bestie isn't coming.)

1752
01:04:45,032 --> 01:04:46,832
I'll wait for him downstairs and go with him.

1753
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:48,801
Is it basement level one?

1754
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,722
(It looks like he's going to scold him as well.)

1755
01:04:51,772 --> 01:04:55,271
(Meanwhile, Kwan Kyu is back from his secret meal.)

1756
01:04:55,272 --> 01:04:58,782
(The energetic parking man is turning the steering wheel.)

1757
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:01,042
Why is he here?

1758
01:05:01,412 --> 01:05:02,412
Why?

1759
01:05:02,413 --> 01:05:03,582
He's here.

1760
01:05:04,312 --> 01:05:08,821
(One man appears in front of him as soon as he gets back.)

1761
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:09,952
Kwang Kyu.

1762
01:05:10,192 --> 01:05:12,522
(Glancing)

1763
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:14,062
- Kwang Kyu.
- Why are you here?

1764
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:16,131
He was coming to me,

1765
01:05:16,132 --> 01:05:18,191
and I thought it was the Grim Reaper.

1766
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:19,562
"Is he here to get me?"

1767
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:23,072
(He still rambles from the shock.)

1768
01:05:23,332 --> 01:05:25,341
While coming back,

1769
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,201
I hoped Seo Jin would be sleeping...

1770
01:05:27,202 --> 01:05:29,012
until I got there.

1771
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:30,592
I thought he would be sleeping...

1772
01:05:30,842 --> 01:05:32,412
like this.

1773
01:05:32,742 --> 01:05:35,482
But he suddenly ran toward me at the parking lot.

1774
01:05:35,552 --> 01:05:38,012
There's an old movie called "Jaws."

1775
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:41,851
I thought it was "Jaws."

1776
01:05:41,852 --> 01:05:44,422
(Grim Reaper plus man-eating shark: Lee Seo Jin?)

1777
01:05:44,722 --> 01:05:45,861
- Kwang Kyu.
- Why are you here?

1778
01:05:45,862 --> 01:05:46,992
Let's go to a pharmacy.

1779
01:05:47,062 --> 01:05:48,191
Is someone sick?

1780
01:05:48,192 --> 01:05:49,362
To get a prop.

1781
01:05:50,292 --> 01:05:51,761
- A prop?
- Yes.

1782
01:05:51,762 --> 01:05:53,502
(He got scared.)

1783
01:05:54,032 --> 01:05:55,032
Kwang Kyu.

1784
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:56,102
Yes?

1785
01:05:56,732 --> 01:05:57,832
What?

1786
01:05:58,032 --> 01:05:59,502
I went to get some air.

1787
01:06:00,302 --> 01:06:01,741
You had udon, tteokbokki...

1788
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:04,542
- How could you eat so much?
- I mean...

1789
01:06:04,842 --> 01:06:06,112
Let's get going now.

1790
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:07,542
My goodness.

1791
01:06:08,242 --> 01:06:10,712
It's because you don't give me a moment to breathe.

1792
01:06:10,752 --> 01:06:12,452
We can just do it like this.

1793
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,532
- It's over there.
- It's over there.

1794
01:06:15,622 --> 01:06:16,622
(They found a pharmacy.)

1795
01:06:16,623 --> 01:06:17,863
I'll U-turn and come back here.

1796
01:06:22,362 --> 01:06:24,331
Hi, do you have cheongsimhwan?

1797
01:06:24,332 --> 01:06:26,462
- Cheongsimhwan?
- Yes. The pill version.

1798
01:06:27,732 --> 01:06:29,601
- How many do you need?
- Three, please.

1799
01:06:29,602 --> 01:06:31,301
(He got more than enough.)

1800
01:06:31,302 --> 01:06:32,341
How much is it?

1801
01:06:32,342 --> 01:06:35,412
It's 15 dollars each, so it's 45 dollars in total.

1802
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,711
(The shoot was put on hold while they waited for the cheongsimhwan.)

1803
01:06:37,712 --> 01:06:40,241
- Is it okay to drink this?
- Here it comes!

1804
01:06:40,242 --> 01:06:41,242
(The shoot was put on hold while they waited for the cheongsimhwan.)

1805
01:06:41,243 --> 01:06:42,711
Cheongsimhwan is here!

1806
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:45,011
(Cheongsimhwan is here.)

1807
01:06:45,012 --> 01:06:46,682
(Here it comes!)

1808
01:06:47,282 --> 01:06:49,892
(He came back like he's the main character.)

1809
01:06:50,652 --> 01:06:51,992
Okay.

1810
01:06:52,562 --> 01:06:54,821
(With great confidence)

1811
01:06:54,822 --> 01:06:56,591
Thank you. You got as many as three.

1812
01:06:56,592 --> 01:06:58,631
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1813
01:06:58,632 --> 01:07:00,361
You came back earlier than I had thought.

1814
01:07:00,362 --> 01:07:01,462
- I did?
- Yes.

1815
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:03,932
Is three enough?

1816
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:05,572
Yes. It's more than enough.

1817
01:07:05,642 --> 01:07:07,002
Actually, one would've been fine.

1818
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:09,722
You might have to take a tight shot, so...

1819
01:07:10,242 --> 01:07:12,541
(He has a different vibe that comes from experience.)

1820
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,211
- This is exactly what we needed.
- Yes.

1821
01:07:14,212 --> 01:07:16,011
He got three.

1822
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,681
One for the tight shot.

1823
01:07:17,682 --> 01:07:21,451
One for the other actor.

1824
01:07:21,452 --> 01:07:24,491
He considered all that and got three.

1825
01:07:24,492 --> 01:07:28,091
He's more attentive than I thought.

1826
01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:30,831
I was moved by it.

1827
01:07:30,832 --> 01:07:32,678
(He was touched by how well he took care of them.)

1828
01:07:32,702 --> 01:07:34,461
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

1829
01:07:34,462 --> 01:07:36,182
(The shoot has resumed with cheongsimhwan.)

1830
01:07:36,802 --> 01:07:38,102
Sir.

1831
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,101
"Sir."

1832
01:07:40,102 --> 01:07:42,272
Would it be okay for me to take this cheongsimhwan?

1833
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:44,141
(The cheongsimhwan I bought)

1834
01:07:44,142 --> 01:07:45,611
- Give it to me.
- Here it is.

1835
01:07:45,612 --> 01:07:47,311
(The shoot is going smoothly thanks to the cheongsimhwan.)

1836
01:07:47,312 --> 01:07:48,341
(They've finished shooting the gym scene at 4:30pm.)

1837
01:07:48,342 --> 01:07:51,212
- Is this all for this scene?
- Yes. We're done.

1838
01:07:52,252 --> 01:07:53,281
People take exams...

1839
01:07:53,282 --> 01:07:54,321
- in a place like this.
- They take the exam here.

1840
01:07:54,322 --> 01:07:55,951
People take tests in a place like this.

1841
01:07:55,952 --> 01:07:57,698
- This is where they take the exam.
- So we're going to film here.

1842
01:07:57,722 --> 01:08:00,092
The thing is...

1843
01:08:00,562 --> 01:08:04,031
this is where we take the exam.

1844
01:08:04,032 --> 01:08:06,032
The judges will be sitting here.

1845
01:08:06,762 --> 01:08:08,702
Since you came,

1846
01:08:09,232 --> 01:08:12,172
I wonder if you would be able to make a cameo.

1847
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:18,641
(My Star asked for a cameo appearance.)

1848
01:08:18,642 --> 01:08:20,182
- Can we just...
- Yes.

1849
01:08:20,342 --> 01:08:22,011
Sit here as judges?

1850
01:08:22,012 --> 01:08:23,251
- Without doing anything?
- Without any lines.

1851
01:08:23,252 --> 01:08:24,572
- Without doing anything.
- Okay.

1852
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:28,652
Kwang Kyu would be fine then. You can sit still.

1853
01:08:28,852 --> 01:08:31,522
We'll give you one shot in the scene.

1854
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:34,262
- Can you express your emotion?
- Yes.

1855
01:08:34,322 --> 01:08:35,961
Let's say you found an amazing talent.

1856
01:08:35,962 --> 01:08:39,061
(A situation where he found someone really talented)

1857
01:08:39,062 --> 01:08:40,801
- You can just grin.
- Yes.

1858
01:08:40,802 --> 01:08:42,071
You found a great talent.

1859
01:08:42,072 --> 01:08:46,942
(How will the veteran actor show his emotion?)

1860
01:08:48,302 --> 01:08:50,772
(Grinning)

1861
01:08:53,142 --> 01:08:56,881
It feels a bit shallow.

1862
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,051
Could you try adding more emotional depth to your acting?

1863
01:08:58,052 --> 01:08:59,521
- Emotional depth?
- Yes. Just a bit more.

1864
01:08:59,522 --> 01:09:02,321
Let's say you saw a student you don't like.

1865
01:09:02,322 --> 01:09:03,792
(A new situation)

1866
01:09:03,922 --> 01:09:06,122
(Adding depth)

1867
01:09:06,622 --> 01:09:08,892
(Anticipating)

1868
01:09:10,562 --> 01:09:11,592
(Sighing)

1869
01:09:15,702 --> 01:09:17,671
- You can't curse.
- "Darn it?"

1870
01:09:17,672 --> 01:09:21,141
- You can't curse in our videos.
- No, I didn't curse.

1871
01:09:21,142 --> 01:09:22,471
- You didn't curse?
- You didn't curse?

1872
01:09:22,472 --> 01:09:23,542
No.

1873
01:09:24,072 --> 01:09:26,242
I'll just brighten up the set.

1874
01:09:26,512 --> 01:09:27,542
Just as expected.

1875
01:09:27,782 --> 01:09:29,351
- He's a true actor.
- It's already bright.

1876
01:09:29,352 --> 01:09:30,681
My eyes are hurting.

1877
01:09:30,682 --> 01:09:31,952
(He's a shining judge.)

1878
01:09:32,012 --> 01:09:34,582
Actually, in the last scene...

1879
01:09:35,492 --> 01:09:38,452
It'd be nice if Seo Jin appeared in the last scene.

1880
01:09:39,162 --> 01:09:41,691
(My Star asked Seo Jin to appear at the end.)

1881
01:09:41,692 --> 01:09:43,392
This script...

1882
01:09:44,432 --> 01:09:47,302
- I'm not sure if it'll be funny.
- It'll be 100 percent funny.

1883
01:09:48,002 --> 01:09:51,472
Could you do this?

1884
01:09:52,472 --> 01:09:54,841
(Trying to read his face)

1885
01:09:54,842 --> 01:09:57,371
- So he's going to sit?
- Just in case...

1886
01:09:57,372 --> 01:09:58,911
I think Kwang Kyu should sit down.

1887
01:09:58,912 --> 01:10:00,441
I'll just sit still.

1888
01:10:00,442 --> 01:10:01,842
- There's another actor.
- Yes.

1889
01:10:02,412 --> 01:10:03,451
Are you going to sit?

1890
01:10:03,452 --> 01:10:06,582
I'll be here as a staff member.

1891
01:10:07,982 --> 01:10:09,291
- I...
- Seo Jin.

1892
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:12,321
Can you just say these lines?

1893
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:13,921
We'd really appreciate it...

1894
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:15,421
- if you could be in our video.
- Yes.

1895
01:10:15,422 --> 01:10:18,832
That's why we added these lines at the end.

1896
01:10:20,202 --> 01:10:22,572
(Let us tell you about the endings of Shortbox videos.)

1897
01:10:24,672 --> 01:10:27,571
(From the world-class soccer player Ronaldinho...)

1898
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:29,842
("Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman Appears in Shortbox")

1899
01:10:30,642 --> 01:10:32,481
(Lee Sang Yeob)

1900
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:35,882
(Unexpected stars closed out their videos.)

1901
01:10:38,212 --> 01:10:40,022
The movie is a huge hit.

1902
01:10:40,122 --> 01:10:41,951
- Really? It's incredible.
- It's incredible.

1903
01:10:41,952 --> 01:10:42,991
(Heo Sung Tae)

1904
01:10:42,992 --> 01:10:45,391
I'll go get a razor since you need to shave your eyebrows. Please wait.

1905
01:10:45,392 --> 01:10:49,291
(Seo Jin has a chance to close out the video this time.)

1906
01:10:49,292 --> 01:10:53,702
The ending is what the main characters care about the most.

1907
01:10:53,802 --> 01:10:56,972
Back in the day, the main character always showed up at the end.

1908
01:10:57,702 --> 01:11:00,672
For our generation, the ending...

1909
01:11:01,272 --> 01:11:03,112
is important.

1910
01:11:03,812 --> 01:11:05,241
That's why we add these lines at the end.

1911
01:11:05,242 --> 01:11:06,681
(My Star made an appealing offer.)

1912
01:11:06,682 --> 01:11:07,812
- Okay.
- Whatever it is...

1913
01:11:08,582 --> 01:11:10,381
Shall we begin then?

1914
01:11:10,382 --> 01:11:11,512
- Yes.
- Sure. Let's do it.

1915
01:11:11,712 --> 01:11:13,482
(This is great.)

1916
01:11:13,522 --> 01:11:14,522
- Yes.
- Sure. Let's do it.

1917
01:11:14,522 --> 01:11:15,522
(Ending Fairy Seo Jin is coming soon.)

1918
01:11:15,523 --> 01:11:18,962
You're going to play a judge.

1919
01:11:19,162 --> 01:11:20,421
- I'll just...
- Yes.

1920
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:21,822
(The exam hall just before filming)

1921
01:11:22,392 --> 01:11:23,761
We'll finish it like that.

1922
01:11:23,762 --> 01:11:27,101
Kwang Kyu wasn't supposed to do this,

1923
01:11:27,102 --> 01:11:28,601
but he agreed to make a cameo...

1924
01:11:28,602 --> 01:11:30,102
- today.
- Oh, my.

1925
01:11:31,702 --> 01:11:33,472
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

1926
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:37,471
(Awkward)

1927
01:11:37,472 --> 01:11:40,281
Could you please put something here?

1928
01:11:40,282 --> 01:11:41,541
(Even the veteran Kwang Kyu is nervous about the unexpected shoot.)

1929
01:11:41,542 --> 01:11:42,652
Paper and stuff.

1930
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,551
Don't put the light on Kwang Kyu's head.

1931
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,128
(He hasn't made a joke like this for a while.)

1932
01:11:48,152 --> 01:11:50,952
(He was nervous, but relaxed after his joke.)

1933
01:11:51,252 --> 01:11:54,991
(Seo Jin is changing into the exam outfit.)

1934
01:11:54,992 --> 01:11:56,062
It's amazing.

1935
01:11:57,862 --> 01:11:59,531
This is his day job.

1936
01:11:59,532 --> 01:12:01,161
(My Star is looking forward to seeing him work.)

1937
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:02,971
Do you need a rehearsal?

1938
01:12:02,972 --> 01:12:04,072
Thank you in advance.

1939
01:12:05,642 --> 01:12:07,842
(Laughing)

1940
01:12:08,172 --> 01:12:09,911
Do you need a rehearsal? Or do you want to start right away?

1941
01:12:09,912 --> 01:12:10,942
Let's just do it.

1942
01:12:11,242 --> 01:12:12,342
Oh, my. That's cool.

1943
01:12:13,012 --> 01:12:16,412
(Wearing a name tag)

1944
01:12:16,652 --> 01:12:20,182
(The older student is on standby.)

1945
01:12:21,052 --> 01:12:23,792
Okay. The actor who attracted 10 million viewers will act.

1946
01:12:25,792 --> 01:12:26,992
Should I go out and come back?

1947
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,412
Yes. Please go out and come back.

1948
01:12:28,492 --> 01:12:30,792
I'll let you know when we're ready.

1949
01:12:31,632 --> 01:12:36,201
(He's nervous about his short-form video debut.)

1950
01:12:36,202 --> 01:12:37,371
(With a total of 52 years of experience, what will they show?)

1951
01:12:37,372 --> 01:12:38,702
You'll see the red light.

1952
01:12:40,572 --> 01:12:42,241
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1953
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:44,842
- Okay. Go.
- Action.

1954
01:12:50,652 --> 01:12:54,622
(He walks in with confidence, showing his dimples.)

1955
01:12:55,082 --> 01:12:56,822
I'm temporary number 33.

1956
01:12:57,952 --> 01:12:59,662
Okay. Please do a free improvisation.

1957
01:13:00,892 --> 01:13:01,921
(Anticipating)

1958
01:13:01,922 --> 01:13:02,992
"A free improvisation?"

1959
01:13:03,292 --> 01:13:05,132
Why do I have to improvise in front of you?

1960
01:13:05,532 --> 01:13:07,708
Aren't you just ordinary middle-aged people outside this hall?

1961
01:13:07,732 --> 01:13:10,372
Okay. Fine.

1962
01:13:10,502 --> 01:13:12,572
I was acting.

1963
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:14,102
Yes. We know that.

1964
01:13:15,572 --> 01:13:18,012
Well... Is there anything else you want to see?

1965
01:13:18,642 --> 01:13:20,281
(Examinee number 33 was asked to leave.)

1966
01:13:20,282 --> 01:13:21,982
That's enough.

1967
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,512
Is there anyone who wants to see more?

1968
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:26,321
What's wrong with your nose?

1969
01:13:26,322 --> 01:13:27,322
(Ad-libbing his line)

1970
01:13:30,392 --> 01:13:31,421
What's wrong with your hair?

1971
01:13:31,422 --> 01:13:32,562
(Ad-libbing again)

1972
01:13:32,662 --> 01:13:34,991
(His ad-libs were unexpected.)

1973
01:13:34,992 --> 01:13:36,062
I saw Won Hun.

1974
01:13:37,532 --> 01:13:39,402
His face was tensing up.

1975
01:13:41,862 --> 01:13:46,502
Among the ad-libs I've heard in 2025...

1976
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:50,171
(Exclaiming)

1977
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:51,372
It was shocking.

1978
01:13:52,582 --> 01:13:54,082
That's what I thought.

1979
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:56,852
"Oh, he's crossing the line."

1980
01:13:58,582 --> 01:13:59,651
(My Star was stunned...)

1981
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:01,522
"But I won't say anything."

1982
01:14:01,722 --> 01:14:05,392
(by his shocking ad-libs.)

1983
01:14:06,022 --> 01:14:07,191
Let's go.

1984
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,952
(Seo Jin's ending scene continues smoothly.)

1985
01:14:09,592 --> 01:14:14,362
(Number 33 gets emotional as he can foresee the result.)

1986
01:14:14,462 --> 01:14:17,102
(Acting with depth)

1987
01:14:17,872 --> 01:14:21,471
(Number 33 leaves while crying in the end.)

1988
01:14:21,472 --> 01:14:22,911
It's over.

1989
01:14:22,912 --> 01:14:25,171
Don't you think we should edit this part?

1990
01:14:25,172 --> 01:14:26,242
What? Where do you mean?

1991
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,381
- "What's wrong with your hair?"
- "What's wrong with your nose?"

1992
01:14:28,382 --> 01:14:29,688
"What's wrong with your hair?" This part.

1993
01:14:29,712 --> 01:14:32,211
- It'd be better without it.
- Let's...

1994
01:14:32,212 --> 01:14:33,551
- just edit it out.
- It might be better to finish...

1995
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:34,872
by showing the professors' faces.

1996
01:14:36,052 --> 01:14:37,952
His ad-libs weren't that funny.

1997
01:14:38,022 --> 01:14:39,521
(Opening the door)

1998
01:14:39,522 --> 01:14:41,462
His ad-libs weren't that funny.

1999
01:14:41,592 --> 01:14:43,162
Yes. You're right.

2000
01:14:44,632 --> 01:14:46,461
- Let's cut it.
- Seo Jin, it was good.

2001
01:14:46,462 --> 01:14:47,532
It was nice.

2002
01:14:48,262 --> 01:14:50,872
(A quick response)

2003
01:14:51,372 --> 01:14:53,771
Do you want to try again?

2004
01:14:53,772 --> 01:14:54,772
(Teasing)

2005
01:14:54,773 --> 01:14:56,141
- Do you want me to do it again?
- No, it's good.

2006
01:14:56,142 --> 01:14:57,411
It's okay.

2007
01:14:57,412 --> 01:14:59,212
You only have one chance.

2008
01:15:00,842 --> 01:15:02,611
Only one chance to perform.

2009
01:15:02,612 --> 01:15:03,951
(Unfortunately, his short-form debut has come to an end.)

2010
01:15:03,952 --> 01:15:05,251
Then...

2011
01:15:05,252 --> 01:15:06,652
Let's do it.

2012
01:15:06,722 --> 01:15:07,851
Ready. Go.

2013
01:15:07,852 --> 01:15:08,852
(The next scene with the judges talking proceeds.)

2014
01:15:08,853 --> 01:15:11,392
Where did he study acting?

2015
01:15:12,322 --> 01:15:14,921
The dimples didn't form properly.

2016
01:15:14,922 --> 01:15:15,991
It looked awkward.

2017
01:15:15,992 --> 01:15:17,512
(He's itching to say something again.)

2018
01:15:17,592 --> 01:15:19,731
(Thinking hard)

2019
01:15:19,732 --> 01:15:21,132
Did he get it done at a hair salon?

2020
01:15:21,362 --> 01:15:22,532
Okay. Let's cut it.

2021
01:15:24,032 --> 01:15:25,432
Did he get it done at a hair salon?

2022
01:15:25,672 --> 01:15:29,001
(He cuts off any poor ad-libs immediately.)

2023
01:15:29,002 --> 01:15:30,711
(Kwang Kyu's ad-lib ended in complete failure.)

2024
01:15:30,712 --> 01:15:31,742
My gosh.

2025
01:15:32,242 --> 01:15:33,982
You can't have surgery at a hair salon.

2026
01:15:35,512 --> 01:15:36,512
I'm sorry.

2027
01:15:36,513 --> 01:15:37,911
(Apologising)

2028
01:15:37,912 --> 01:15:39,011
(How will their cameo turn out?)

2029
01:15:39,012 --> 01:15:40,622
He couldn't think of the word "quack."

2030
01:15:41,252 --> 01:15:43,722
Hello, I'm temporary number 31.

2031
01:15:45,722 --> 01:15:46,891
What does your father do?

2032
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:47,961
He goes to the hospital.

2033
01:15:47,962 --> 01:15:50,431
I guess he's very sick.

2034
01:15:50,432 --> 01:15:51,532
He's a doctor.

2035
01:15:55,632 --> 01:15:57,071
Okay. Please do a free improvisation.

2036
01:15:57,072 --> 01:15:58,072
"A free improvisation?"

2037
01:15:58,372 --> 01:16:00,101
Why do I have to improvise in front of you?

2038
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,801
Aren't you just ordinary middle-aged people outside this hall?

2039
01:16:01,802 --> 01:16:04,441
- Okay. Fine.
- I was acting.

2040
01:16:04,442 --> 01:16:05,742
Yes. We know that.

2041
01:16:05,942 --> 01:16:07,641
- Anything else you want to see?
- That's enough.

2042
01:16:07,642 --> 01:16:10,411
His dimple surgery went wrong.

2043
01:16:10,412 --> 01:16:12,821
- The dimples didn't form properly.
- Doesn't he walk a little weird?

2044
01:16:12,822 --> 01:16:14,298
I didn't like him the moment he walked in.

2045
01:16:14,322 --> 01:16:16,722
You can tell as soon as someone opens the door and walks in.

2046
01:16:17,422 --> 01:16:18,591
The shoot is over.

2047
01:16:18,592 --> 01:16:21,121
- Can we have some makgeolli?
- What kind?

2048
01:16:21,122 --> 01:16:22,692
- The usual?
- Yes.

2049
01:16:23,462 --> 01:16:24,731
This place has a unique atmosphere.

2050
01:16:24,732 --> 01:16:26,331
(They're at My Star's favourite place with a cool vibe.)

2051
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:27,862
I feel like drinking wine today.

2052
01:16:28,432 --> 01:16:29,472
Right.

2053
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:30,801
- Let's have a drink first.
- Well...

2054
01:16:30,802 --> 01:16:32,148
- Do you want to try this?
- Or...

2055
01:16:32,172 --> 01:16:34,242
- What's that?
- It's makgeolli.

2056
01:16:34,442 --> 01:16:36,311
This is the makgeolli I often have.

2057
01:16:36,312 --> 01:16:37,612
It's 55 dollars.

2058
01:16:38,412 --> 01:16:39,442
For makgeolli?

2059
01:16:39,642 --> 01:16:42,412
Let's drink the clear layer of the makgeolli at first.

2060
01:16:44,682 --> 01:16:46,963
- Would you like to try it?
- Why did you pour so little?

2061
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:48,382
- Just a little.
- Sorry?

2062
01:16:48,752 --> 01:16:49,991
It's expensive.

2063
01:16:49,992 --> 01:16:51,221
Fill the cup.

2064
01:16:51,222 --> 01:16:53,391
We should start by drinking the clear layer.

2065
01:16:53,392 --> 01:16:54,961
- Then...
- Then we're going to shake it.

2066
01:16:54,962 --> 01:16:56,268
- Is that how you drink it?
- Yes.

2067
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:58,061
- Thank you for your hard work.
- You did a great job.

2068
01:16:58,062 --> 01:17:00,132
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2069
01:17:00,962 --> 01:17:02,672
(Turning at the same time)

2070
01:17:03,102 --> 01:17:04,982
(My Stars are polite in front of older people.)

2071
01:17:05,432 --> 01:17:07,042
(He spots it.)

2072
01:17:07,702 --> 01:17:09,983
Just drink comfortably. You don't have to turn your body.

2073
01:17:12,642 --> 01:17:14,182
It's very sweet.

2074
01:17:14,642 --> 01:17:17,082
- Was it always sweet like this?
- It's sweet.

2075
01:17:17,282 --> 01:17:19,982
- Right?
- It's very sweet.

2076
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:22,621
What's really interesting is that we have the same birthday.

2077
01:17:22,622 --> 01:17:23,902
- Is it exactly the same?
- Yes.

2078
01:17:24,092 --> 01:17:25,492
- January 30?
- Yes. January 30.

2079
01:17:26,922 --> 01:17:29,262
What's even more interesting is that his father...

2080
01:17:29,592 --> 01:17:31,262
and my father share the same birthday.

2081
01:17:31,462 --> 01:17:33,031
- I think it's very interesting.
- Oh, my.

2082
01:17:33,032 --> 01:17:34,178
How many years apart are they?

2083
01:17:34,202 --> 01:17:36,101
- The age gap is quite big.
- Ten years.

2084
01:17:36,102 --> 01:17:38,201
- Is the age gap that big?
- My father was born in 1963,

2085
01:17:38,202 --> 01:17:39,541
- and his father was born in 1949.
- Yes.

2086
01:17:39,542 --> 01:17:40,842
How come your father is so old?

2087
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:42,812
I'm a late-born child,

2088
01:17:43,112 --> 01:17:46,211
so there's about a ten-year age gap between me and my oldest sister.

2089
01:17:46,212 --> 01:17:47,658
(He's the youngest of three siblings.)

2090
01:17:47,682 --> 01:17:49,252
How did you two become friends?

2091
01:17:50,152 --> 01:17:52,552
They were KBS comedians.

2092
01:17:52,782 --> 01:17:54,781
But there are many of them.

2093
01:17:54,782 --> 01:17:57,252
I'm from the 30th class, and he's from the 31st.

2094
01:17:58,322 --> 01:18:00,492
I debuted in 2015,

2095
01:18:00,662 --> 01:18:02,692
and he debuted in 2016.

2096
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:07,731
Comedians from the previous class...

2097
01:18:07,732 --> 01:18:09,571
assist those auditioning for the following year.

2098
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:11,731
- Like earlier?
- Yes.

2099
01:18:11,732 --> 01:18:12,801
Right.

2100
01:18:12,802 --> 01:18:14,972
When I saw him at that time,

2101
01:18:15,702 --> 01:18:17,712
I had a strong feeling that he'd make it.

2102
01:18:18,412 --> 01:18:20,012
He must've looked like a comedian.

2103
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:22,011
He looked even funnier back then.

2104
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:23,151
His chin...

2105
01:18:23,152 --> 01:18:24,581
used to be more pointed.

2106
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:26,081
I looked like a North Korean soccer player.

2107
01:18:26,082 --> 01:18:27,151
(He looked like he could pass the audition right away.)

2108
01:18:27,152 --> 01:18:28,651
You kind of look like Yu Oh Seong.

2109
01:18:28,652 --> 01:18:30,821
I get that a lot.

2110
01:18:30,822 --> 01:18:33,162
People say I look like Seol Ki Hyeon too.

2111
01:18:33,292 --> 01:18:34,392
He's a coach now.

2112
01:18:34,762 --> 01:18:36,892
So did you suggest working together?

2113
01:18:37,092 --> 01:18:38,732
We were doing "Gag Concert" together.

2114
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:42,731
Then we decided to start a YouTube channel.

2115
01:18:42,732 --> 01:18:45,201
At first, it wasn't Shortbox but a different channel.

2116
01:18:45,202 --> 01:18:46,372
Right.

2117
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:48,783
We had been running that channel for more than two years,

2118
01:18:49,002 --> 01:18:50,872
but it wasn't very successful.

2119
01:18:51,212 --> 01:18:54,281
So we decided to make one last channel,

2120
01:18:54,282 --> 01:18:55,941
which is Shortbox.

2121
01:18:55,942 --> 01:18:58,711
You had different channels before.

2122
01:18:58,712 --> 01:18:59,721
Yes. We tried many things.

2123
01:18:59,722 --> 01:19:01,122
- You tried many things.
- Yes.

2124
01:19:01,352 --> 01:19:02,522
I wondered...

2125
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:04,992
how you make your videos,

2126
01:19:05,252 --> 01:19:06,891
and seeing today's shoot,

2127
01:19:06,892 --> 01:19:08,392
it seemed all over the place.

2128
01:19:09,962 --> 01:19:11,331
There's a lot of directing.

2129
01:19:11,332 --> 01:19:13,132
We started with one camera.

2130
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:15,632
Using only one camera, I shot his scenes...

2131
01:19:15,832 --> 01:19:17,832
- while he shot mine.
- I filmed when he acted.

2132
01:19:18,032 --> 01:19:21,142
We didn't even buy the camera.

2133
01:19:21,442 --> 01:19:23,211
- We rented it.
- You rented it?

2134
01:19:23,212 --> 01:19:24,441
- Yes.
- At first...

2135
01:19:24,442 --> 01:19:26,481
We have a boom mic now,

2136
01:19:26,482 --> 01:19:28,381
but we didn't have one back then.

2137
01:19:28,382 --> 01:19:30,251
So we just taped a wearable mic...

2138
01:19:30,252 --> 01:19:33,482
to a mop handle...

2139
01:19:33,722 --> 01:19:35,752
- and used it as a boom mic.
- Right.

2140
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:38,192
We were holding it like a boom mic.

2141
01:19:38,392 --> 01:19:41,722
We made only a little money back then.

2142
01:19:42,562 --> 01:19:45,492
Each of us made around 300 dollars a month.

2143
01:19:46,062 --> 01:19:47,232
- From YouTube?
- Yes.

2144
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:49,931
- But you did make some money.
- We did,

2145
01:19:49,932 --> 01:19:51,732
- but it wasn't enough.
- Right.

2146
01:19:51,972 --> 01:19:54,942
We wanted to give up,

2147
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:57,211
but it felt like we'd make it...

2148
01:19:57,212 --> 01:19:58,711
if we worked just a bit harder.

2149
01:19:58,712 --> 01:20:00,281
- "Gag Concert" came to an end.
- Right.

2150
01:20:00,282 --> 01:20:03,251
- You had nowhere to go.
- YouTube was the only thing.

2151
01:20:03,252 --> 01:20:04,951
- It was the only thing we could do.
- Right.

2152
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:06,082
I see.

2153
01:20:06,322 --> 01:20:08,452
After holding on like that,

2154
01:20:08,882 --> 01:20:11,151
a day like this has finally come, which is amazing.

2155
01:20:11,152 --> 01:20:12,551
It's still amazing to me...

2156
01:20:12,552 --> 01:20:14,021
that we can do something like this...

2157
01:20:14,022 --> 01:20:16,562
- with you.
- I'm glad you held out.

2158
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:18,491
The thing is...

2159
01:20:18,492 --> 01:20:21,332
You've been acting consistently.

2160
01:20:21,502 --> 01:20:24,472
But we became famous overnight.

2161
01:20:25,072 --> 01:20:26,671
We became famous all of a sudden.

2162
01:20:26,672 --> 01:20:27,672
- Really?
- Yes.

2163
01:20:27,673 --> 01:20:29,041
- At once?
- Yes.

2164
01:20:29,042 --> 01:20:30,912
The views suddenly blew up.

2165
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:33,481
And the next day,

2166
01:20:33,482 --> 01:20:36,282
people who had never heard of us started recognising us.

2167
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,611
It was incredible.

2168
01:20:37,612 --> 01:20:39,111
- Did it make you feel proud?
- Yes.

2169
01:20:39,112 --> 01:20:40,181
It was mind-blowing.

2170
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:41,828
I didn't even have a moment to feel proud.

2171
01:20:41,852 --> 01:20:43,822
- I was too stunned.
- How did it happen?

2172
01:20:43,952 --> 01:20:46,122
You said it wasn't successful at first.

2173
01:20:46,422 --> 01:20:48,191
Jin Se and I were doing it, but it didn't really work out.

2174
01:20:48,192 --> 01:20:50,732
So we decided to recruit a female member.

2175
01:20:50,892 --> 01:20:53,161
- That's Ji Yoon you met earlier.
- Yes.

2176
01:20:53,162 --> 01:20:54,662
We started working with her.

2177
01:20:54,932 --> 01:20:58,732
She's a blessing to us.

2178
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:02,041
(After she joined them, )

2179
01:21:02,042 --> 01:21:04,041
(they started producing long-term relationship content.)

2180
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:05,741
(With realistic acting that resonates with many people, )

2181
01:21:05,742 --> 01:21:09,512
(their channel's popularity skyrocketed.)

2182
01:21:11,052 --> 01:21:12,352
Why...

2183
01:21:12,982 --> 01:21:15,022
- Let me do it.
- did it become successful?

2184
01:21:15,552 --> 01:21:17,222
You've been in a long-term relationship.

2185
01:21:17,252 --> 01:21:19,421
Right. Both Jin Se...

2186
01:21:19,422 --> 01:21:20,591
and I have that experience.

2187
01:21:20,592 --> 01:21:23,532
So we came up with ideas easily.

2188
01:21:23,632 --> 01:21:25,891
What is it about?

2189
01:21:25,892 --> 01:21:27,561
- Is it like what we did today?
- It's...

2190
01:21:27,562 --> 01:21:29,632
It's about...

2191
01:21:30,032 --> 01:21:31,331
a couple...

2192
01:21:31,332 --> 01:21:33,702
who've been together a long time.

2193
01:21:34,002 --> 01:21:36,142
They've grown so used to each other...

2194
01:21:36,542 --> 01:21:38,441
that their relationship...

2195
01:21:38,442 --> 01:21:40,111
- feels dull.
- I'm sorry,

2196
01:21:40,112 --> 01:21:41,812
but Seo Jin doesn't know much about it.

2197
01:21:41,942 --> 01:21:43,481
- It feels dull.
- I'm sorry,

2198
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:45,252
but Seo Jin doesn't know much about it.

2199
01:21:45,382 --> 01:21:47,502
- You should just talk to me.
- Why would I not know?

2200
01:21:47,922 --> 01:21:49,851
You've only dated for short periods.

2201
01:21:49,852 --> 01:21:51,372
(You've only dated for short periods.)

2202
01:21:52,052 --> 01:21:54,691
He's the epitome...

2203
01:21:54,692 --> 01:21:56,391
- of short-term dating.
- Right.

2204
01:21:56,392 --> 01:21:58,092
- Short-term dating.
- Short-term dating.

2205
01:21:58,492 --> 01:22:00,131
It lasts a week...

2206
01:22:00,132 --> 01:22:01,632
or even two hours.

2207
01:22:02,562 --> 01:22:05,132
What's the longest relationship you've had?

2208
01:22:06,472 --> 01:22:08,142
Less than two years.

2209
01:22:08,942 --> 01:22:12,472
It means you've never experienced real love.

2210
01:22:12,572 --> 01:22:14,711
A relationship has to last at least over two years...

2211
01:22:14,712 --> 01:22:16,382
to be considered real experience.

2212
01:22:16,452 --> 01:22:18,212
If it's less than two years,

2213
01:22:18,452 --> 01:22:20,481
you could say you don't really have dating experience yet.

2214
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:22,242
Let's say he's never been in a relationship.

2215
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:24,491
(They say he's never been in a relationship.)

2216
01:22:24,492 --> 01:22:25,492
- I've never been in a relationship?
- He's never dated anyone?

2217
01:22:25,492 --> 01:22:26,492
Never.

2218
01:22:27,292 --> 01:22:28,992
(Laughing)

2219
01:22:29,762 --> 01:22:31,191
- Never.
- We made content...

2220
01:22:31,192 --> 01:22:32,692
about long-term relationships.

2221
01:22:33,462 --> 01:22:35,161
If we were to make videos about short-term relationships...

2222
01:22:35,162 --> 01:22:37,231
Since you have some experience...

2223
01:22:37,232 --> 01:22:38,232
Yes.

2224
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:40,371
Do you have any ideas for our video?

2225
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,041
He must have a lot of ideas.

2226
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:43,571
About short-term relationships.

2227
01:22:43,572 --> 01:22:45,741
I don't know how people date in short-term relationships.

2228
01:22:45,742 --> 01:22:48,011
They must have different characteristics.

2229
01:22:48,012 --> 01:22:49,958
(My Star wants to learn about short-term relationships.)

2230
01:22:49,982 --> 01:22:51,812
I think short-term relationships...

2231
01:22:52,412 --> 01:22:53,882
(Curious)

2232
01:22:54,622 --> 01:22:57,192
start off with a lot of sparks.

2233
01:23:00,262 --> 01:23:03,232
- They fall deeply for each other.
- Yes.

2234
01:23:03,492 --> 01:23:05,192
They go crazy for each other at first.

2235
01:23:06,132 --> 01:23:07,332
Fire.

2236
01:23:07,362 --> 01:23:08,882
That's why the passion dies down fast.

2237
01:23:10,572 --> 01:23:13,302
You need to add the firewood little by little,

2238
01:23:13,702 --> 01:23:15,671
or the fire flares up and dies out quickly.

2239
01:23:15,672 --> 01:23:17,012
It's like kindling.

2240
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:18,542
It's like...

2241
01:23:19,942 --> 01:23:23,752
they meet each other as someone they're not.

2242
01:23:24,282 --> 01:23:25,782
I see.

2243
01:23:25,882 --> 01:23:28,382
Rather than their true self,

2244
01:23:28,722 --> 01:23:29,722
they become the version of themselves...

2245
01:23:29,723 --> 01:23:30,751
- that the other person desires.
- Yes.

2246
01:23:30,752 --> 01:23:33,491
They become different people because they like each other.

2247
01:23:33,492 --> 01:23:35,522
After a few months,

2248
01:23:35,862 --> 01:23:37,461
they go back to being themselves.

2249
01:23:37,462 --> 01:23:38,462
Right.

2250
01:23:38,463 --> 01:23:40,138
That's when they begin questioning each other.

2251
01:23:40,162 --> 01:23:42,462
"Why have you changed so much?"

2252
01:23:42,502 --> 01:23:45,231
People who fall in love quickly and intensely...

2253
01:23:45,232 --> 01:23:47,772
are more likely to have short-term relationships.

2254
01:23:48,072 --> 01:23:49,612
Once the fire dies down,

2255
01:23:49,912 --> 01:23:51,371
it's not easy for it to flare up again.

2256
01:23:51,372 --> 01:23:52,612
It's not easy.

2257
01:23:52,872 --> 01:23:54,441
Once it dies, it'll never come back.

2258
01:23:54,442 --> 01:23:55,712
- Right.
- Yes.

2259
01:23:55,942 --> 01:23:57,411
What are the most common things people say...

2260
01:23:57,412 --> 01:23:59,382
in short-term relationships?

2261
01:23:59,752 --> 01:24:02,052
For example, "I'm sick of you."

2262
01:24:02,352 --> 01:24:03,591
We never say something like that.

2263
01:24:03,592 --> 01:24:05,792
We express our love much more...

2264
01:24:06,692 --> 01:24:07,822
in short-term relationships.

2265
01:24:07,992 --> 01:24:09,461
I see.

2266
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:11,332
Do you break up for similar reasons then?

2267
01:24:12,032 --> 01:24:13,832
The reasons for breaking up would be obvious.

2268
01:24:14,062 --> 01:24:16,471
"I don't think I'm ready for a relationship yet."

2269
01:24:16,472 --> 01:24:18,301
- There'd be something like that.
- There'd be something like that.

2270
01:24:18,302 --> 01:24:19,641
- "Our personalities don't match."
- No. It's the woman...

2271
01:24:19,642 --> 01:24:21,002
who asks to break up first.

2272
01:24:21,202 --> 01:24:22,762
- It's usually the woman.
- Is that so?

2273
01:24:23,042 --> 01:24:24,602
- It's usually the woman.
- Is that so?

2274
01:24:24,912 --> 01:24:26,072
In short-term relationships?

2275
01:24:26,582 --> 01:24:28,382
That's how it is in short-term relationships?

2276
01:24:28,642 --> 01:24:30,112
Because the man has changed.

2277
01:24:30,282 --> 01:24:31,652
- I see.
- I see.

2278
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,452
After a few months,

2279
01:24:34,752 --> 01:24:37,152
the man goes back to being himself.

2280
01:24:37,792 --> 01:24:40,261
- He becomes a different man.
- "He seems a bit different."

2281
01:24:40,262 --> 01:24:42,221
He's not the same as he was at the start of the relationship.

2282
01:24:42,222 --> 01:24:43,991
(Clear short-term relationship insights drawn from his experience)

2283
01:24:43,992 --> 01:24:46,131
- I can see that happening.
- It's because...

2284
01:24:46,132 --> 01:24:48,102
they cram 2 years of dating into only 2 months.

2285
01:24:49,002 --> 01:24:51,402
There's nothing else to do then.

2286
01:24:51,472 --> 01:24:53,072
- I see.
- I see.

2287
01:24:53,602 --> 01:24:54,602
(He's been quiet.)

2288
01:24:54,603 --> 01:24:56,672
I understand.

2289
01:24:56,942 --> 01:24:58,982
Kwang Kyu, don't you have anything to say about it?

2290
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:03,052
Kwang Kyu, don't you have anything to say about it?

2291
01:25:03,112 --> 01:25:04,411
(Startled)

2292
01:25:04,412 --> 01:25:06,451
You don't talk much when we are talking about relationships.

2293
01:25:06,452 --> 01:25:07,482
I want to keep quiet.

2294
01:25:07,982 --> 01:25:11,551
He has striking features.

2295
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,891
His old photos...

2296
01:25:12,892 --> 01:25:14,292
- are floating around.
- Right.

2297
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:17,291
You didn't get a nose job, did you?

2298
01:25:17,292 --> 01:25:18,691
He has amazing skin too.

2299
01:25:18,692 --> 01:25:20,931
- Yes.
- His facial features are amazing.

2300
01:25:20,932 --> 01:25:22,632
- Have a drink.
- Yes.

2301
01:25:22,732 --> 01:25:24,071
If you just look at his forehead, he looks like a one-year-old.

2302
01:25:24,072 --> 01:25:25,902
It feels like he's going back in time.

2303
01:25:25,972 --> 01:25:27,072
He's Benjamin.

2304
01:25:27,572 --> 01:25:29,971
So you dated for a long time...

2305
01:25:29,972 --> 01:25:31,311
and married smoothly?

2306
01:25:31,312 --> 01:25:32,571
No, we had plenty of challenges.

2307
01:25:32,572 --> 01:25:33,781
You had difficulties?

2308
01:25:33,782 --> 01:25:36,041
I was unknown for a very long time.

2309
01:25:36,042 --> 01:25:37,181
So...

2310
01:25:37,182 --> 01:25:38,882
So your wife supported you?

2311
01:25:38,952 --> 01:25:41,621
Not financially.

2312
01:25:41,622 --> 01:25:44,621
But mentally, she helped me a lot.

2313
01:25:44,622 --> 01:25:46,662
- She helped me a lot.
- Your wife did?

2314
01:25:46,792 --> 01:25:49,122
She always said I was the funniest.

2315
01:25:49,762 --> 01:25:52,492
Even when things didn't work out,

2316
01:25:52,662 --> 01:25:54,761
she always supported me.

2317
01:25:54,762 --> 01:25:56,401
That's very important.

2318
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,531
Even now, she always leaves comments on our videos...

2319
01:25:58,532 --> 01:26:00,142
without telling us.

2320
01:26:00,472 --> 01:26:01,572
Without telling us.

2321
01:26:01,942 --> 01:26:04,541
Of course, his wife would leave supportive comments.

2322
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:05,782
As if he'd write rude comments.

2323
01:26:06,512 --> 01:26:07,941
- Aren't I right?
- True.

2324
01:26:07,942 --> 01:26:09,041
- MBTI-wise, - Writing comments...

2325
01:26:09,042 --> 01:26:10,512
Seo Jin is a true thinker.

2326
01:26:10,612 --> 01:26:12,751
(A clear thinker)

2327
01:26:12,752 --> 01:26:14,921
We can't really hold a conversation right now.

2328
01:26:14,922 --> 01:26:16,552
- Such a feeling is new.
- Right?

2329
01:26:16,652 --> 01:26:19,421
Little did I imagine he'd write a rude comment.

2330
01:26:19,422 --> 01:26:21,291
- Kind of like...
- He wouldn't write one.

2331
01:26:21,292 --> 01:26:22,861
It's like I've been enlightened.

2332
01:26:22,862 --> 01:26:24,291
"That could totally happen."

2333
01:26:24,292 --> 01:26:25,491
(Thinker Seo Jin's interesting way of thinking)

2334
01:26:25,492 --> 01:26:28,102
I was thinking of a counselling section...

2335
01:26:28,132 --> 01:26:29,261
- A thinker's comment?
- Yes.

2336
01:26:29,262 --> 01:26:31,101
- A thinker's consultation?
- Yes, a thinker's consultation.

2337
01:26:31,102 --> 01:26:32,472
Giving you...

2338
01:26:32,902 --> 01:26:34,971
- a reality check.
- Nice idea.

2339
01:26:34,972 --> 01:26:36,171
A counselling session sounds good.

2340
01:26:36,172 --> 01:26:38,042
- Tell him what worries you.
- Okay.

2341
01:26:38,312 --> 01:26:40,511
- Talking together...
- I'm not...

2342
01:26:40,512 --> 01:26:42,482
- all that interested in others.
- True.

2343
01:26:42,582 --> 01:26:43,851
I only stay at home.

2344
01:26:43,852 --> 01:26:45,051
He's a total homebody.

2345
01:26:45,052 --> 01:26:46,351
As a total homebody,

2346
01:26:46,352 --> 01:26:47,621
whether it's my day off...

2347
01:26:47,622 --> 01:26:49,121
or not,

2348
01:26:49,122 --> 01:26:50,851
I just stay home.

2349
01:26:50,852 --> 01:26:53,091
I'm slowly starting to lose...

2350
01:26:53,092 --> 01:26:55,061
the relationships I had.

2351
01:26:55,062 --> 01:26:56,161
- Relationships...
- And...

2352
01:26:56,162 --> 01:26:57,162
aren't that important.

2353
01:26:57,492 --> 01:26:59,561
If you succeed, relationships will end up following you.

2354
01:26:59,562 --> 01:27:02,931
(Succeed, and it will end up following you.)

2355
01:27:02,932 --> 01:27:04,371
(A golden saying)

2356
01:27:04,372 --> 01:27:06,172
Now that's a golden saying.

2357
01:27:06,902 --> 01:27:09,071
- Say it again.
- As expected.

2358
01:27:09,072 --> 01:27:10,272
When you succeed,

2359
01:27:10,312 --> 01:27:11,972
people will turn to you.

2360
01:27:12,142 --> 01:27:14,112
But they leave when you're not doing well.

2361
01:27:14,242 --> 01:27:16,212
Maybe it's because you mentioned it,

2362
01:27:16,312 --> 01:27:18,052
but this popped up in my head.

2363
01:27:18,382 --> 01:27:19,681
I've lent money to several people...

2364
01:27:19,682 --> 01:27:20,952
after succeeding.

2365
01:27:21,482 --> 01:27:23,221
My colleagues...

2366
01:27:23,222 --> 01:27:24,491
and people around me...

2367
01:27:24,492 --> 01:27:25,951
ask to borrow money.

2368
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,321
But I'm bad at turning favours down.

2369
01:27:27,322 --> 01:27:28,561
Did you lend them money?

2370
01:27:28,562 --> 01:27:31,461
Sum it up, and it's over several thousand dollars.

2371
01:27:31,462 --> 01:27:33,801
- You didn't get any back, right?
- For real.

2372
01:27:33,802 --> 01:27:34,802
Eight people borrowed money...

2373
01:27:34,803 --> 01:27:36,001
- from me.
- I see.

2374
01:27:36,002 --> 01:27:37,271
- I've written the names down.
- Okay.

2375
01:27:37,272 --> 01:27:38,831
- But none paid me back.
- None?

2376
01:27:38,832 --> 01:27:40,542
- None.
- Same here.

2377
01:27:40,842 --> 01:27:42,672
None. What a bunch of low-lives.

2378
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:45,280
To those who ask to borrow money,

2379
01:27:45,281 --> 01:27:46,441
tell them this from now on.

2380
01:27:47,081 --> 01:27:49,351
Say that they ask for 10,000 dollars.

2381
01:27:49,951 --> 01:27:51,750
"I'll give you 3,000 dollars,"

2382
01:27:51,751 --> 01:27:53,921
"so just have it."

2383
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:55,690
- Gosh.
- I've heard of this before.

2384
01:27:55,691 --> 01:27:58,061
- "And never contact me again?"
- Yes.

2385
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:00,560
If people get 3,000 dollars out of 10,000 dollars,

2386
01:28:00,561 --> 01:28:02,091
they'd thank you.

2387
01:28:02,291 --> 01:28:04,530
No one will say, "I don't need 3,000 dollars."

2388
01:28:04,531 --> 01:28:06,400
- "Give me 10,000 dollars."
- Right.

2389
01:28:06,401 --> 01:28:08,370
They'd accept 3,000 dollars and get lost.

2390
01:28:08,371 --> 01:28:10,131
Only then will you feel at ease.

2391
01:28:11,671 --> 01:28:13,111
Have you given away money like that?

2392
01:28:13,471 --> 01:28:14,841
Yes, of course.

2393
01:28:15,171 --> 01:28:16,640
Just give it and end it there.

2394
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:18,740
I'm turning favours down now.

2395
01:28:18,741 --> 01:28:20,680
- After all this time.
- What do you tell them?

2396
01:28:20,681 --> 01:28:21,880
I simply don't reply.

2397
01:28:21,881 --> 01:28:23,281
- Really?
- Yes.

2398
01:28:23,551 --> 01:28:25,650
This year,

2399
01:28:25,651 --> 01:28:29,790
in 2025, I was in many shows and worked hard.

2400
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:31,960
For the first time in my life,

2401
01:28:31,961 --> 01:28:33,990
I was nominated for the Baeksang Arts Awards...

2402
01:28:33,991 --> 01:28:36,530
and the Blue Dragon Series Awards.

2403
01:28:36,531 --> 01:28:38,200
That alone made me happy,

2404
01:28:38,201 --> 01:28:39,901
but I didn't win any awards.

2405
01:28:40,031 --> 01:28:42,131
Thankfully, my prediction was right.

2406
01:28:42,501 --> 01:28:43,931
Kian84!

2407
01:28:46,101 --> 01:28:47,570
Congratulations.

2408
01:28:47,571 --> 01:28:49,571
Kim Won Hun is looking kind of...

2409
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:51,610
Please hide your expression.

2410
01:28:51,611 --> 01:28:54,340
I'm attending the SBS Entertainment Awards...

2411
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:56,181
- for the show called "My Turn."
- I see.

2412
01:28:56,781 --> 01:28:58,350
In my head,

2413
01:28:58,351 --> 01:29:00,421
I have a list of what I'll say...

2414
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:02,390
if I ever win an award.

2415
01:29:02,391 --> 01:29:04,391
Is it only in your head, or did you write it down?

2416
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:06,591
I wrote it down, erased it, and cried...

2417
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:08,790
There are even tear stains.

2418
01:29:08,791 --> 01:29:10,860
(Looking forward to his first Entertainment Awards that much)

2419
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:12,500
What do you think about...

2420
01:29:12,501 --> 01:29:14,430
making an acceptance speech...

2421
01:29:14,431 --> 01:29:15,871
with teary eyes?

2422
01:29:16,131 --> 01:29:17,231
I hate it.

2423
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:19,300
- Then just make a happy face and...
- I think...

2424
01:29:19,301 --> 01:29:20,470
- Did you...
- awards are a festival...

2425
01:29:20,471 --> 01:29:22,441
and a happy day. Keep it happy.

2426
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:24,441
- I hate when tears get involved.
- I see.

2427
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:26,280
But keep it your style.

2428
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:28,450
Yes, carry it out with your style. Act natural.

2429
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:29,971
Have you ever won an award, Kwang Kyu?

2430
01:29:31,251 --> 01:29:32,580
(My Star is mean.)

2431
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:34,651
I'm currently asking...

2432
01:29:34,751 --> 01:29:36,250
the award winner.

2433
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:37,620
(I'm asking the tvN Grand Prize winner.)

2434
01:29:37,621 --> 01:29:38,690
What's...

2435
01:29:38,691 --> 01:29:40,990
the possibility of me winning an award?

2436
01:29:40,991 --> 01:29:42,191
You should win one this year.

2437
01:29:42,561 --> 01:29:43,861
- I...
- Your first award.

2438
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:45,730
- You can.
- Don't you think he'll win one?

2439
01:29:45,731 --> 01:29:47,030
- You do, right?
- How much...

2440
01:29:47,031 --> 01:29:48,931
can you bet on me winning an award?

2441
01:29:49,331 --> 01:29:50,501
- On you?
- Yes.

2442
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:54,271
If you win an award, I'll treat you to food that very day.

2443
01:29:55,071 --> 01:29:56,240
- Really?
- Yes.

2444
01:29:56,241 --> 01:29:57,410
- A get-together?
- Yes.

2445
01:29:57,411 --> 01:29:58,540
(The Grumpy Secretary will treat him to a get-together!)

2446
01:29:58,541 --> 01:29:59,781
- Seriously?
- Yes.

2447
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:01,141
I'll congratulate you.

2448
01:30:01,651 --> 01:30:02,980
When I win...

2449
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,511
- an award, - Yes?

2450
01:30:04,581 --> 01:30:06,581
- In return...
- I'll sit on your lap right away.

2451
01:30:06,881 --> 01:30:08,851
No, don't sit on my lap.

2452
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:12,190
The get-together is with our team.

2453
01:30:12,191 --> 01:30:13,790
- I'm in.
- What?

2454
01:30:13,791 --> 01:30:15,290
- You have to dump your team.
- I'm...

2455
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:17,161
(You have to dump your team.)

2456
01:30:17,761 --> 01:30:20,661
- But there's even Gyeong Gyu.
- I see.

2457
01:30:21,131 --> 01:30:23,131
I'll go back and forth between the two.

2458
01:30:23,371 --> 01:30:24,500
(Thinker Seo Jin's Consultation)

2459
01:30:24,501 --> 01:30:26,501
- Okay.
- I'll mention Kwang Kyu.

2460
01:30:27,941 --> 01:30:30,141
He's on a roll because of how hard he works.

2461
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:32,911
People who give it their all...

2462
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:36,981
reap a reward one way or another.

2463
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:40,351
People like them...

2464
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:44,651
make me happy.

2465
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:46,120
They succeeded...

2466
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:48,361
after all the ups and downs.

2467
01:30:49,061 --> 01:30:51,191
The two have made it this far.

2468
01:30:51,401 --> 01:30:53,001
That's something nice to see.

2469
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:54,700
Age-wise...

2470
01:30:54,701 --> 01:30:57,301
I think they're in the perfect age range...

2471
01:30:57,331 --> 01:30:59,371
when it comes to success.

2472
01:30:59,941 --> 01:31:02,341
If I were to review it in one sentence,

2473
01:31:02,571 --> 01:31:03,741
it was like...

2474
01:31:04,411 --> 01:31:06,381
a day filled with the smell of poop.

2475
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:09,181
It's nasty, but you want to smell it again.

2476
01:31:12,739 --> 01:31:13,868
Like,

2477
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:15,569
it wasn't all that great of a day.

2478
01:31:16,339 --> 01:31:18,139
But I'll end up missing it.

2479
01:31:18,839 --> 01:31:20,179
It was that kind of day.

2480
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:24,049
What would you like to say to the next My Star?

2481
01:31:24,809 --> 01:31:26,419
I hope this show...

2482
01:31:26,919 --> 01:31:28,519
continues because...

2483
01:31:29,019 --> 01:31:32,758
I'm sure some people aren't grateful...

2484
01:31:32,759 --> 01:31:35,318
for the team they have,

2485
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:37,028
since they've become a normal part of their lives.

2486
01:31:37,029 --> 01:31:38,888
In every moment...

2487
01:31:38,889 --> 01:31:40,429
and every second...

2488
01:31:41,759 --> 01:31:42,969
It's just...

2489
01:31:43,669 --> 01:31:45,168
What's wrong with me all of a sudden?

2490
01:31:45,169 --> 01:31:47,069
(Getting emotional)

2491
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:52,738
We must've really treated them well today.

2492
01:31:52,739 --> 01:31:53,739
What?

2493
01:31:53,739 --> 01:31:54,739
- We must've done a good job.
- Today...

2494
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,308
- For real.
- I've become thankful...

2495
01:31:56,309 --> 01:31:57,879
- What?
- for my current manager.

2496
01:31:57,909 --> 01:31:59,519
We've completed our mission today.

2497
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:01,419
We must've done too well.

2498
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:05,119
I've mentioned numerous times that she's my ideal type.

2499
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:07,219
She's been my ideal type since I was young,

2500
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:08,689
when I was living in Busan.

2501
01:32:08,889 --> 01:32:10,329
Between the two...

2502
01:32:10,729 --> 01:32:12,928
(Choi Hwa Jeong, the Grumpy Secretaries' ideal type)

2503
01:32:12,929 --> 01:32:14,629
- Baby.
- "Baby?"

2504
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,268
(A romantic day with the ideal type today?)

2505
01:32:17,269 --> 01:32:18,328
What do you think about me?

2506
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:19,869
My baby isn't bad.

2507
01:32:19,999 --> 01:32:22,039
That was another soulless answer.

2508
01:32:22,869 --> 01:32:25,068
Adjust it so that it's comfortable for you, honey.

2509
01:32:25,069 --> 01:32:26,379
- "Honey?"
- Yes.

2510
01:32:27,009 --> 01:32:30,008
(The beginning of a love triangle)

2511
01:32:30,009 --> 01:32:32,279
(There's only one winner.)

2512
01:32:33,349 --> 01:32:36,718
(Eventually, they end up at a taro place to check their compatibility!)

2513
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,789
If things go well, it'll be a perfect score.

2514
01:32:39,049 --> 01:32:40,389
(Sighing)

2515
01:32:40,419 --> 01:32:42,018
For Kwang Kyu, even as soon as tomorrow...

2516
01:32:42,019 --> 01:32:43,158
(All tangled up, )

2517
01:32:43,159 --> 01:32:44,965
(how will the love triangle of the solos end?)

2518
01:32:44,989 --> 01:32:46,329
Did a menu come to mind?

2519
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:49,428
(Changing according to the day's climate and humidity...)

2520
01:32:49,429 --> 01:32:53,939
(is My Star's menu.)

2521
01:32:54,269 --> 01:32:55,938
I can't handle situations...

2522
01:32:55,939 --> 01:32:57,068
- like that...
- Yes?

2523
01:32:57,069 --> 01:32:58,238
Cheongdam Sundae Soup incident.

2524
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,638
(Take care of My Star's appetite!)

2525
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:00,678
(My Star is a real foodie.)

2526
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:01,708
(Slurping)

2527
01:33:01,709 --> 01:33:02,909
Did you finish it by yourself?

2528
01:33:03,179 --> 01:33:04,349
(Flustered)

2529
01:33:04,449 --> 01:33:06,149
The green onion rice is good.

2530
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:08,349
Is there anything you don't like?

2531
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,789
(My Grumpy Secretary)
