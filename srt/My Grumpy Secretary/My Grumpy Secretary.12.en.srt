1
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:22,565
(Somewhere in Bangbae-dong where My Star lives)

2
00:00:23,205 --> 00:00:26,435
(An unfamiliar car has arrived sooner than the secretaries)

3
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:28,475
- Hello.
- Hello.

4
00:00:28,675 --> 00:00:30,605
- Hello.
- Hello.

5
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:32,144
Thank you. You're so...

6
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:33,145
(My Star of the day, Han Ji Min)

7
00:00:33,146 --> 00:00:35,145
- Thank you for visiting the show.
- You're so beautiful.

8
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:37,844
- May we film you?
- Sure.

9
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:40,514
- We'll do an interview over there.
- Okay.

10
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:42,454
- Let's go over there.
- Okay.

11
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:43,555
(A preliminary interview gets held for the first time.)

12
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:46,354
You'll be filming a drama all day long today.

13
00:00:46,355 --> 00:00:48,155
- How are you feeling?
- Exactly.

14
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:50,065
I have chronic fatigue.

15
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:52,495
You have a demanding shoot...

16
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:54,235
- today, right?
- Yes.

17
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:56,034
- She needs to move a lot.
- That's right.

18
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,434
So,

19
00:00:57,435 --> 00:00:59,374
- from the beginning of the show, - Okay.

20
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,975
we've received many comments.

21
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,904
- We brought some of them.
- Really?

22
00:01:03,905 --> 00:01:05,144
(What comments are these?)

23
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,675
So many viewers wanted to see you...

24
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:10,785
on the show.

25
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,485
"Lee Seo Jin doesn't work much."

26
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:19,494
"I want Han Ji Min to visit and establish some discipline."

27
00:01:19,495 --> 00:01:22,054
"Han Ji Min is the only one who can whip him into shape."

28
00:01:22,055 --> 00:01:25,634
(Han Ji Min is the only one who can whip him into shape.)

29
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:28,295
"It'll be funny if Han Ji Min scolds Lee Seo Jin for real."

30
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:31,165
Let's say...

31
00:01:31,205 --> 00:01:33,135
I scolded him for real.

32
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:34,904
Don't criticize me.

33
00:01:34,905 --> 00:01:36,445
(Let's say I scolded him for real. Don't criticize me.)

34
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:40,114
"Lee Seo Jin bullies Han Ji Min a lot."

35
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:41,215
"She should have her revenge."

36
00:01:41,445 --> 00:01:42,644
By the way,

37
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,345
how do people know that he bullies me?

38
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:46,514
What was shown on TV...

39
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:48,284
was only a tip of the iceberg.

40
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,784
How do people know that?

41
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:52,124
- Someone made a compilation...
- Okay.

42
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,955
and posted it on the internet.

43
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,264
There were many more instances that didn't get filmed.

44
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,494
- My goodness.
- That means he bullies you a lot.

45
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:02,264
He bullied me the entire time we filmed a drama together.

46
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:03,765
He only rested when he bought me meals.

47
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:05,064
- When he bought you meals?
- Yes.

48
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:07,535
I think it's an ill-fated relationship...

49
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,274
from my past life.

50
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:10,805
(An ill-fated relationship from her past life?)

51
00:02:11,405 --> 00:02:12,414
That's what I think.

52
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:16,245
The way he bullies you is very childish.

53
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:17,414
That's right.

54
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:20,715
When I was passing the hallway in the MBC building,

55
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,424
he suddenly tripped me.

56
00:02:22,425 --> 00:02:23,655
I was in hanbok.

57
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:25,495
Then he dragged me.

58
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:26,725
He didn't care that people were watching.

59
00:02:27,425 --> 00:02:29,695
I really like snacks in a bag.

60
00:02:30,865 --> 00:02:35,395
I often ate popular Korean snacks because I liked them.

61
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,165
He teased me for eating them.

62
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:40,204
When he opened his car trunk,

63
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:41,775
it was full of American snacks.

64
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:43,404
- Imported snacks.
- I see.

65
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,174
He bragged about those snacks.

66
00:02:45,175 --> 00:02:48,114
- Imported snacks.
- He showed me those snacks...

67
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:50,145
and said, "You should eat snacks like these."

68
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:51,984
He was like an elementary schooler.

69
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:53,185
He really was. That's right.

70
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:56,054
"Section TV" came and filmed us...

71
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:57,155
during the shoot of the last episode.

72
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,324
We held hands and walked together in the last scene...

73
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:01,325
with the beautiful scenery.

74
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:03,925
He suddenly opened a door of the hanok...

75
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:06,234
and pushed me inside.

76
00:03:06,235 --> 00:03:07,264
He shoved me inside.

77
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,504
My legs weren't inside yet, but he shut the door.

78
00:03:09,505 --> 00:03:11,535
I think it got aired on "Section TV."

79
00:03:12,035 --> 00:03:13,934
Lee San and Song Yeon hold hands...

80
00:03:13,935 --> 00:03:15,804
and run into the palace.

81
00:03:15,805 --> 00:03:17,775
(Seo Jin and Ji Min smile affectionately at each other.)

82
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,145
(Something doesn't seem right!)

83
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:23,285
(Affectionate behaviour 1. Pulling with strength)

84
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,785
(2. Dragging up the stairs)

85
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:32,694
(He shoves her inside...)

86
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,955
(and shuts the door.)

87
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:36,725
(Feeling disappointed, Ji Min complains to Seo Jin.)

88
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:41,265
(The director told me to do that. I had no choice!)

89
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:45,164
- He's such a strange man.
- He really is.

90
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,404
In front of all the reporters during the press conference,

91
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,734
he called me a hobbit.

92
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,204
("Seo Jin Calls Ji Min a Hobbit During the Press Conference")

93
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:51,905
He isn't that tall either.

94
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:54,945
He called me a hobbit.

95
00:03:55,075 --> 00:03:56,244
When other people do such things,

96
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:57,445
they get criticized for their bad character.

97
00:03:57,815 --> 00:03:58,914
- That's right.
- It's fascinating.

98
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:00,884
- That's right.
- Everyone goes,

99
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:03,524
"Apparently, so-and-so is like that."

100
00:04:03,525 --> 00:04:04,555
The public criticizes such people.

101
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,995
I don't understand why Seo Jin doesn't get criticized.

102
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:09,164
Seriously.

103
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,364
Perhaps he was born in the right time...

104
00:04:12,365 --> 00:04:16,034
because he became successful early in his career.

105
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:18,235
On one hand, I'm very jealous.

106
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:21,574
I wonder if he has any stress. Right?

107
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:24,005
He only thinks about himself and does what he wants.

108
00:04:24,675 --> 00:04:27,145
He doesn't do much, but earns money.

109
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:28,415
His life is like that.

110
00:04:28,545 --> 00:04:31,315
On "Three Meals a Day," he only caught flies.

111
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:35,054
I was like, "You earn money so easily."

112
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,055
So easily!

113
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:39,625
(October 2025)

114
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:42,895
(I will be your secretary.)

115
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,735
(This man claimed to be the master of caring.)

116
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:48,935
(Why is there no water in the car?)

117
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:50,934
(Blaming Kwang Kyu)

118
00:04:50,935 --> 00:04:52,504
(May we go to Gangnamgu Office?)

119
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:53,705
(It's too far.)

120
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,645
(Skirting his duties all the time)

121
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,104
(I think I made a mistake with the sundaeguk order.)

122
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:58,105
(Messing up the order)

123
00:04:58,106 --> 00:04:59,674
(Where did the company card go?)

124
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,545
(Losing the company card)

125
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,314
(My Stars had to walk on eggshells...)

126
00:05:05,315 --> 00:05:08,185
(because of the bad secretary.)

127
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:10,024
(What's the intent...)

128
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,225
(of My Grumpy Secretary?)

129
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,664
(The stars will know how precious their managers are.)

130
00:05:15,665 --> 00:05:19,095
(We're doing a great job as per the program intent.)

131
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,635
(The natural enemy of the shameless secretary is here.)

132
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:23,904
(Who are you close to?)

133
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:25,004
(You!)

134
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,904
(Lee Seo Jin's best friend)

135
00:05:26,905 --> 00:05:27,905
(Spotting that Seo Jin is slacking off)

136
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:31,344
(Kicking)

137
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:32,374
(She just kicked me.)

138
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:33,375
(She kicks Seo Jin.)

139
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,415
- Film it up close!
- When did I do that?

140
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,745
(Stop being idle and get up.)

141
00:05:37,945 --> 00:05:40,085
(Getting up)

142
00:05:40,515 --> 00:05:46,655
(A true friend who makes Lee Seo Jin work and laugh)

143
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:51,195
(Will she be able to make Seo Jin work today?)

144
00:05:51,565 --> 00:05:53,434
In the drama, I played a character who threw away coffee...

145
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:54,635
that didn't have the right temperature.

146
00:05:57,165 --> 00:06:00,035
(The perfect secretary brings coffee.)

147
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,115
The secretary I need...

148
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:10,645
(In the drama, she's strict to even the perfect secretary.)

149
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:13,855
(Get out.)

150
00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:16,825
(The perfect secretary has left.)

151
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,355
Good morning.

152
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,154
Why did you come to my house?

153
00:06:21,155 --> 00:06:23,225
(He's already being bad.)

154
00:06:23,895 --> 00:06:25,324
You guys are suffocating me.

155
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:26,535
(Flippant)

156
00:06:27,195 --> 00:06:28,864
Isn't it nice to start in your neighbourhood?

157
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,235
What's nice about it? You guys are suffocating me.

158
00:06:31,735 --> 00:06:33,134
You guys came to my house.

159
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,505
(A Bangbae-dong resident is happy to see the production crew.)

160
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,044
Aren't you worried about anything?

161
00:06:37,045 --> 00:06:38,175
- About Ji Min?
- Yes.

162
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:39,815
Why would I worry about Ji Min?

163
00:06:40,245 --> 00:06:41,614
She does everything well on her own.

164
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:42,644
(She does everything well on her own without a manager.)

165
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:43,714
Do you feel more comfortable?

166
00:06:43,715 --> 00:06:44,885
I feel more comfortable around Ji Min.

167
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,185
(Not knowing how Ji Min feels, he's relaxed.)

168
00:06:49,525 --> 00:06:50,525
Where's Ji Min?

169
00:06:50,526 --> 00:06:51,924
- She's having an interview.
- What?

170
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:53,125
She's having an interview.

171
00:06:54,195 --> 00:06:55,994
Why is she having an interview before the shoot?

172
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:56,995
(Unhappy)

173
00:06:56,995 --> 00:06:57,995
Where is she?

174
00:06:58,465 --> 00:06:59,465
- Where is she?
- In the alley.

175
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,194
- She's in the alley.
- She's in the alley.

176
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:04,004
(Something doesn't seem right.)

177
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:05,335
Today,

178
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:09,644
you don't need to treat him as the way you treat your manager.

179
00:07:09,645 --> 00:07:11,105
- Okay.
- You can be more forceful.

180
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,945
- You can have your revenge.
- I mean...

181
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,144
It won't be easy to have my revenge...

182
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:18,345
for those countless days in a single day.

183
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,055
Is it too short?

184
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,855
It's short. It's too short. It's very short.

185
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,794
(The entire nation has hoped...)

186
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,424
(to see her have her revenge on Lee Seo Jin.)

187
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:30,465
What are you guys doing?

188
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:34,335
(The prologue begins.)

189
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,064
Why did you come so late?

190
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:38,304
(It's the first thing she says.)

191
00:07:38,305 --> 00:07:40,305
I told you not to come late yesterday.

192
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,875
I didn't come late, okay?

193
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,205
What time is it?

194
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,575
- It's 2 minutes before the time.
- I came here at 10am.

195
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:49,544
- Did you walk here?
- What?

196
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:50,685
- Did you walk here?
- Yes.

197
00:07:51,585 --> 00:07:52,914
- We live close.
- What?

198
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,285
- We live close.
- Yes.

199
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:57,225
Today, we began with an interview.

200
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:59,124
Why? Why did you have an interview before the shoot?

201
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,324
Let's show them to Seo Jin.

202
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:02,695
These are the viewers' comments.

203
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,825
Was I the only one who had the preliminary interview?

204
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:06,164
- Yes.
- Really?

205
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:07,165
(What comments?)

206
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,234
(Han Ji Min is the one who'll make Lee Seo Jin uncross his arms!)

207
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:09,364
There were too many stories.

208
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:10,704
(Lee Seo Jin bullies Han Ji Min a lot.)

209
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:11,964
(She should have her revenge.)

210
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,234
(Lee Seo Jin doesn't work much.)

211
00:08:13,235 --> 00:08:14,705
(I want Han Ji Min to visit and establish some discipline.)

212
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,474
(Throwing)

213
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:18,505
Let's go.

214
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:20,844
Shall we go?

215
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:21,975
You can do whatever you want.

216
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,115
I'll do whatever I want.

217
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,254
- So...
- Was this your mom's place?

218
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:30,424
- Hello.
- Hello.

219
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:31,524
Have you been well?

220
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:33,554
(He's wearing his microphone.)

221
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,625
I need some time.

222
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:36,065
- I'm sorry.
- I need some time.

223
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,064
Why are you suddenly embarrassed?

224
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:39,065
Come on.

225
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:41,335
- Gosh.
- My skin will get filmed.

226
00:08:41,765 --> 00:08:42,905
Do you know Ji Min?

227
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,904
We filmed one scene together...

228
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:47,375
for "Our Blues."

229
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:49,005
Were you on that drama?

230
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:51,004
- Of course. Hey.
- Seriously,

231
00:08:51,005 --> 00:08:52,404
you were on all sorts of dramas.

232
00:08:52,405 --> 00:08:53,514
I was on most dramas.

233
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,575
(Kwang Kyu is a supporting actor who appears in every work.)

234
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:56,345
Hello. Have you been well?

235
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:58,584
My Star, you're wearing...

236
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:00,114
a tracksuit.

237
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,314
You should wear a tracksuit on the set.

238
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:02,955
- You should do that on the set.
- Yes.

239
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:04,225
Ji Min, which one is your vehicle?

240
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:06,895
- That one. Genesis.
- The black one?

241
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:08,724
- Do you ride a sedan?
- Yes.

242
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:09,894
Kwang Kyu, what will you do?

243
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:11,794
- Hey.
- You should drive.

244
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,594
(What are you talking about?)

245
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,904
- No, Kwang Kyu is the driver.
- You should drive.

246
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,404
Hey, that's what My Star wants.

247
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:20,634
I'll need to say something if you don't go fast enough.

248
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:22,434
- That's right.
- I can't do that to Kwang Kyu.

249
00:09:22,435 --> 00:09:24,174
- That's right.
- I drive very fast.

250
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,744
- You won't get to complain.
- Drive fast then.

251
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:26,844
You'll tell me to go slower.

252
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:29,715
Then I'll tell you to go slower in a relaxed manner.

253
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:31,014
That's right. The two of you...

254
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:33,414
Also, I only added Lee Seo Jin to my car insurance.

255
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:34,484
- Really?
- Yes.

256
00:09:34,485 --> 00:09:36,784
(I only added Lee Seo Jin to my car insurance.)

257
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,024
- Really?
- Yes.

258
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:41,024
Well done. Ji Min, you don't disappoint.

259
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,395
- I only added one person.
- You don't disappoint.

260
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,994
- We were on "Our Blues" together.
- You should rest today.

261
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:48,034
(Seo Jin's struggles are coming soon.)

262
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:49,094
You should rest today.

263
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:50,405
- I'll rest today.
- Yes.

264
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,705
My goodness.

265
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:54,034
Writer Noh Hee Kyung, thank you.

266
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:56,305
(Writer Noh Hee Kyung of "Our Blues," thank you.)

267
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:58,104
All right.

268
00:09:58,105 --> 00:09:59,105
(Disappointed)

269
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:01,874
He's my manager, Assistant Manager Kwak Seok Jun.

270
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,884
Nice to meet you.

271
00:10:02,885 --> 00:10:04,244
I'm Han Ji Min's manager, Assistant Manager Kwak Seok Jun.

272
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:05,285
Hello.

273
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:07,814
I'll relay the duties. Nice to meet you.

274
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,985
(What's My Star's schedule of the day?)

275
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:15,994
Today, she has drama shoots.

276
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:17,324
(She has drama shoots all day today.)

277
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,865
We're visiting four locations today.

278
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,664
Why are you moving too much?

279
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:22,134
That's why you need to drive fast.

280
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,434
Gosh, we need to go from Gangnam to Jongno...

281
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:25,904
- and come back to Gangnam.
- Please don't swear.

282
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:26,905
(They'll be on the road a lot.)

283
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,775
Here's some information to know.

284
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,374
If you don't drink much water,

285
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,304
why do I need to give it to you constantly?

286
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:35,144
I asked my manager to do that since I didn't drink much water.

287
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:36,184
(She doesn't drink much water, so give it to her constantly.)

288
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:37,544
- Give it to me constantly.
- Check from time to time.

289
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:38,714
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

290
00:10:38,715 --> 00:10:39,855
(Stopping)

291
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:42,354
It should go in the bag.

292
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,354
- There's another bag.
- What?

293
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:46,154
- Put it in there for now.
- I'll put it in here for now.

294
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:48,025
Is there another bag?

295
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:50,065
Four locations.

296
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:51,795
Here's the script.

297
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,565
- Is this the first scene?
- Yes.

298
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,465
You need to tell me if I ask, "What's the next scene?"

299
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:58,234
I don't know much.

300
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,235
(Sniffling)

301
00:10:59,236 --> 00:11:01,604
Make sure you contact the floor director...

302
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:03,175
before arrival.

303
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:04,444
My makeup needs to be fixed whenever we move.

304
00:11:04,445 --> 00:11:06,044
Yes. Her makeup needs to be fixed.

305
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:07,744
- So there's more information.
- You have...

306
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,244
- Listen!
- You have staff for that.

307
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:11,384
- Listen!
- Okay. What is it?

308
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:12,984
I'll give you more information...

309
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:14,454
when we go to the trunk.

310
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,654
- The car?
- Yes.

311
00:11:15,655 --> 00:11:17,855
(Seo Jin is flustered from the start.)

312
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,255
- It's...
- You're doing great.

313
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,464
Why do you let him walk all over you?

314
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:27,334
- What?
- You let him walk all over you.

315
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,365
- He's strong.
- You're older.

316
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,304
Age doesn't matter in this industry.

317
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:32,305
(Kwang Kyu has gained a strong ally.)

318
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:34,005
The leading actor has seniority.

319
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:36,475
You should get some rest.

320
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:40,914
- Does it have a long body?
- What?

321
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,445
- Does it have a long body?
- Yes, it's a limousine.

322
00:11:42,985 --> 00:11:45,245
(30 points have been added to the difficulty level of driving)

323
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,715
Here are the scripts.

324
00:11:48,085 --> 00:11:50,854
Episodes 11 and 12 will be filmed today.

325
00:11:50,855 --> 00:11:52,284
(Checking My Star's trunk)

326
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:53,555
Later, you can take...

327
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,625
the scripts from here.

328
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,465
This is the chair she uses on the set.

329
00:11:58,795 --> 00:12:01,534
She sits in this chair on the set.

330
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:03,635
Every time she moves and films the next scene,

331
00:12:05,835 --> 00:12:06,835
we use this...

332
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:07,934
(My Star's mirror)

333
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,205
- on the set.
- For her face?

334
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,745
(He listens to the duties without any complaint.)

335
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,014
He'll learn the duties.

336
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,574
You don't even need to know them.

337
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,785
- Really?
- Yes.

338
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,345
Your car is big.

339
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:21,414
Seriously, your car...

340
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:22,554
(Kwang Kyu enjoys freedom in an awkward way.)

341
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:23,855
- Kwang Kyu!
- Yes?

342
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:25,684
Are you here to play?

343
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:27,724
- We're talking.
- Come here.

344
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,054
- Come here.
- Ji Min told me...

345
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,825
- that I didn't need to know.
- Hurry over here.

346
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,035
Hurry over here.

347
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:35,265
Gosh, that punk.

348
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,735
(His tone is tough, but his body moves.)

349
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,134
- What?
- Every time she moves,

350
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,574
- This is the mirror she uses.
- this is the mirror she uses.

351
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:44,345
Why is the mirror so big?

352
00:12:44,475 --> 00:12:47,914
- It's for fixing the makeup.
- When we film outside,

353
00:12:47,915 --> 00:12:50,384
- Her hair gets pressed.
- there are no mirrors.

354
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,614
That's when you set up this mirror. Make sure you do that.

355
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:53,615
(Her tone changes.)

356
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:54,685
Seo Jin.

357
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:55,885
Make sure you do that.

358
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,525
Seo Jin.

359
00:12:57,725 --> 00:12:58,985
- Put it inside.
- I mean,

360
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:00,494
he needs to carry it too.

361
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:01,525
(Intimidated)

362
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:02,895
- Kwang Kyu, get in the car.
- Okay.

363
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,394
Do you sit at the front or...

364
00:13:05,395 --> 00:13:07,134
- I sit in the back.
- You sit in the back.

365
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:08,534
Do you want to sit next to me?

366
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:10,504
- No, I'll sit...
- Sit here.

367
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:12,104
- at the front.
- Okay.

368
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:13,175
Are we going right away?

369
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:14,604
- Seo Jin, take these.
- What?

370
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:15,904
Inside Kwang Kyu's bag...

371
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:17,844
The car key and company card. Please take good care of her.

372
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:19,774
- Okay.
- Don't give him the company card.

373
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,645
He'll lose it.

374
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,215
Seo Jin, hurry up and give it back.

375
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:26,785
Aren't you going to go?

376
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:28,485
Thank you.

377
00:13:28,655 --> 00:13:30,184
- Please get in, My Star.
- Bye, Seok Jun.

378
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:31,424
- Okay, Ji Min.
- My Star.

379
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:34,895
This car is very big.

380
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:39,325
- It's so long.
- It's a limousine.

381
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:41,864
- A limousine?
- Yes, it has a long body.

382
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,305
It has a very long body.

383
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:44,635
It'll be hard to drive.

384
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,735
This car is so spacious.

385
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:52,445
The car had a long body,

386
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,575
so I was a bit nervous.

387
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:58,484
But Ji Min...

388
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,985
made Seo Jin drive.

389
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:04,155
That really saved me.

390
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:09,665
(The first schedule is a salon in Nonhyeon-dong.)

391
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:11,495
Gosh.

392
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:14,795
I'll take a photo of Seo Jin while he's driving.

393
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:18,405
Why would you take a photo?

394
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:20,205
I mean...

395
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:25,575
(Today, he'll be in the driver's seat.)

396
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:28,574
You're good at driving.

397
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:30,415
Why didn't you drive sooner?

398
00:14:32,185 --> 00:14:33,614
You're good at driving.

399
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,254
- You're really good.
- Yes.

400
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:36,425
(The compliments make him smile with his dimples.)

401
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,355
Has a close friend of yours visited this show?

402
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,125
- A close friend of mine?
- Yes.

403
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,125
Never.

404
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:45,895
- So people felt uncomfortable...
- I don't have many close friends.

405
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:49,035
and didn't order you around.

406
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:50,664
(She got me.)

407
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:53,635
- Hey.
- The secretary didn't do much.

408
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,004
I did so much work.

409
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:57,905
The guests served you instead.

410
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:02,215
You're right. Seo Jin didn't do much.

411
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:06,084
We meet on the set...

412
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,315
- after lunch.
- Okay.

413
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:10,485
So I'll message you...

414
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:13,825
what I want to eat for lunch.

415
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,194
Hey, we... Will you message me?

416
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:21,794
Yes. Who else will I message? I don't know anyone else's number.

417
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:23,334
- Really?
- Yes.

418
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,435
Okay.

419
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,135
Do you know his number?

420
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:29,574
Of course. He sends me a poop emoji.

421
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:30,944
My goodness.

422
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,404
One time, a toilet at her place...

423
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:33,974
Don't say strange things.

424
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,614
You're banned from saying strange things.

425
00:15:35,615 --> 00:15:37,544
- I didn't say anything strange.
- You're banned from saying...

426
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:40,015
useless and private things, okay?

427
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,484
You treat me however you want.

428
00:15:41,485 --> 00:15:43,154
- Why won't you let me say a thing?
- I don't disclose...

429
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,885
- private stories.
- What?

430
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,324
You won't let me say a thing.

431
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,595
(The siblings bicker from the start.)

432
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:51,094
Did you guys fight while filming a drama?

433
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:53,095
- It isn't like that.
- No, I treated her very well.

434
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,834
(Round 2, Younger sister versus Older brother)

435
00:15:54,835 --> 00:15:57,464
We filmed a 77-episode drama, "Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

436
00:15:57,465 --> 00:16:00,404
- Okay.
- He bullied me so much.

437
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,374
- When did I bully you?
- What are you saying?

438
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,974
Don't you remember throwing me down...

439
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,004
- on the floor of the MBC building?
- When did I do that?

440
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,244
When did I throw you down?

441
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:09,074
- What are you talking about?
- She's an actress.

442
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:10,245
(He feigns ignorance.)

443
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:13,214
I thought you were in a critical situation,

444
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,514
so I pulled you just in case.

445
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:19,024
Have you turned forgetful with age?

446
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,694
You can't throw down an actress...

447
00:16:20,695 --> 00:16:22,924
- just because she's a newbie.
- I didn't throw her down.

448
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:25,625
While filming the last episode,

449
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:27,434
he opened the door of the building...

450
00:16:27,435 --> 00:16:28,834
and shoved me inside.

451
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,264
Don't you remember? My feet weren't even inside,

452
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:31,304
but he closed the door.

453
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:32,434
I didn't shove you in.

454
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:34,134
- You...
- You couldn't cross the threshold,

455
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:36,404
- so I helped you.
- I didn't need to do that.

456
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:38,075
We just needed to walk for the last scene.

457
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,175
- Don't you remember?
- No.

458
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:41,744
(I don't remember.)

459
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:43,615
I told you...

460
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,944
that the two of us were close...

461
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:49,154
- when we filmed "Our Blues."
- Yes.

462
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:50,454
Did you tell me that?

463
00:16:50,455 --> 00:16:52,085
When I told you that, you said,

464
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,025
"Don't even bring up that mister!"

465
00:16:56,325 --> 00:17:00,234
(Lee Seo Jin is about to get knocked out.)

466
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:02,035
- Really?
- Yes.

467
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:06,374
"You and Seo Jin filmed 'Lee San, Wind of the Palace.'"

468
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:09,275
"Don't even bring up that mister!"

469
00:17:11,505 --> 00:17:13,344
I usually speak respectfully.

470
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:16,145
Calling him "Mister" was a small revenge.

471
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,785
(This mister reminisces about the past.)

472
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,515
Seo Jin, do you remember this?

473
00:17:20,785 --> 00:17:23,824
- I...
- You remember so many things.

474
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:24,924
This is like a hearing.

475
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:27,724
When I sprayed perfume, you went, "What's this smell?"

476
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:29,455
You said that it was a smell you hated...

477
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:33,765
and made me do a read-through as I looked outside the window.

478
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:39,165
You mistreated and looked down on the female lead.

479
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:41,134
- Come on.
- I had to turn around...

480
00:17:41,135 --> 00:17:42,834
- and look outside the window.
- Wasn't it more comfortable?

481
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:44,875
The weather was nice outside.

482
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:46,675
It was late at night!

483
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:51,284
- For goodness' sake.
- You needed to look outside.

484
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:53,385
She remembers everything from her rookie days.

485
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,014
Why do you only remember the bad things?

486
00:17:56,015 --> 00:17:57,684
- Just remember the good things.
- The good things?

487
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,595
There was only one good thing. You paid for the meals often.

488
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,724
(The generous man who gives you a hard time and meals)

489
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,364
Seo Jin pays for meals often.

490
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:10,435
He buys meals for everyone.

491
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:13,274
He doesn't get stingy about those things.

492
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,505
That's right.

493
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:18,245
(The difficult man who picks up the tab often)

494
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,345
The leaves are colourful.

495
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:26,115
They're so pretty.

496
00:18:27,855 --> 00:18:30,084
People who are walking by look happy.

497
00:18:30,085 --> 00:18:31,255
You're right.

498
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:34,455
Aren't you always happy?

499
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:36,995
(What is she going to say this time?)

500
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:38,794
When you go to bed,

501
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:41,395
do you ever regret what you've said...

502
00:18:41,865 --> 00:18:43,404
- or...
- Why would I regret things?

503
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,164
- feel bad about what you've done?
- What?

504
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,404
To whom?

505
00:18:46,405 --> 00:18:48,775
I don't do anything that makes me have regrets or feel bad.

506
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,315
Do you even know what regret is?

507
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,815
- Regret?
- Yes.

508
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,484
- Why would I have regret?
- Regret and self-reproach.

509
00:18:57,485 --> 00:18:59,315
Don't have regret about what has already happened.

510
00:18:59,445 --> 00:19:00,515
How about self-reproach?

511
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:01,955
Why have self-reproach? It has already happened.

512
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:07,394
- It's water under the bridge.
- I'm jealous of his personality.

513
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:08,524
- I'm so jealous.
- Yes.

514
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,065
In my next life,

515
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,294
I want to be Seo Jin.

516
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:14,034
What? You're my rival.

517
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,335
- Right? You know what I mean.
- Yes.

518
00:19:16,935 --> 00:19:18,565
- He's stress-free.
- Yes.

519
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:20,735
That's why he doesn't lose hair.

520
00:19:21,675 --> 00:19:23,905
- Where did that come from?
- I'm sorry, Kwang Kyu.

521
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:25,804
I shouldn't have said that. Forget it.

522
00:19:25,805 --> 00:19:27,774
- You suddenly brought up hair.
- I take it back.

523
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:31,215
- "Forget it?"
- Forget it. I take it back.

524
00:19:31,415 --> 00:19:32,744
Please edit this out and pretend it never happened.

525
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:34,155
It's okay.

526
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,755
I eat an apple in the morning.

527
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,224
Where is the apple?

528
00:19:39,225 --> 00:19:41,194
No, not you.

529
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:42,224
Where is the apple?

530
00:19:42,225 --> 00:19:44,765
- No, not you.
- What?

531
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:45,965
Assistant Manager Lee?

532
00:19:46,225 --> 00:19:47,495
- Assistant Manager Lee.
- Manager Lee?

533
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:48,735
Manager Lee.

534
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:50,705
(Happy)

535
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:52,205
Assistant Manager Lee?

536
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,005
Manager Lee?

537
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:55,905
I eat an apple in the morning.

538
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:59,075
Slice it and deliver it in a paper cup, okay?

539
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:00,314
Where is the apple?

540
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:02,015
You need to buy it.

541
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:04,085
Do we need to buy it?

542
00:20:04,215 --> 00:20:08,015
I'll also send you a location of the nearby yogurt place.

543
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:09,755
I'll send it to you.

544
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:14,325
I think it's my work. I'm nervous.

545
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:17,064
(Caretaker Fairy isn't used to this situation.)

546
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:19,364
Kwang Kyu, there's something else you need to do.

547
00:20:19,365 --> 00:20:20,534
- Really?
- Yes.

548
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:22,294
I need to film something at the salon.

549
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,034
Film me with the camera.

550
00:20:24,035 --> 00:20:25,834
I see. Will you film a challenge?

551
00:20:25,835 --> 00:20:27,634
She isn't a singer. Why would she do that?

552
00:20:27,635 --> 00:20:29,475
I need to practice for a challenge.

553
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:31,104
Will you dance today as well?

554
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:35,114
No, the Blue Dragon Film Awards is coming up.

555
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:36,115
Okay.

556
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:40,115
One of the people who will give a congratulatory performance...

557
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:43,584
There are many things to do.

558
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:44,625
Yes.

559
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:47,054
(They arrive at the salon as they bicker like siblings.)

560
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:49,055
- Is this the place?
- Yes, it's this place.

561
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,525
Be careful when you get out later.

562
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:54,964
- What?
- Is there a valet?

563
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,264
I'll park once Ji Min goes in.

564
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:58,965
(I'll park once My Star goes in.)

565
00:20:59,065 --> 00:21:00,605
I'll park once Ji Min goes in.

566
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:03,135
(What's wrong with him?)

567
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,945
(Feeling)

568
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:11,014
Ji Min, how do I open the door?

569
00:21:11,015 --> 00:21:12,245
Oh, that.

570
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:14,085
Oh, that.

571
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:18,625
- It's this button.
- Is it that button?

572
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:22,594
- Kwang Kyu, press this button.
- Hey, this car...

573
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,124
- Really?
- Press this button...

574
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,265
to close the car door.

575
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:27,095
- Do this.
- I see.

576
00:21:27,565 --> 00:21:28,964
I've never seen it.

577
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:30,264
At what time do we leave?

578
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:31,564
At what time do we leave the salon?

579
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,604
We can leave as soon as you get ready.

580
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:35,274
You need to go and buy my yogurt.

581
00:21:35,275 --> 00:21:36,844
- Okay. Go on in.
- Don't make Kwang Kyu do it.

582
00:21:36,845 --> 00:21:38,144
- Okay. Go on in.
- Kwang Kyu come inside with me.

583
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:39,475
- Okay.
- A challenge...

584
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:40,874
Go on in. Hurry up and come here.

585
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,984
His old habit is coming out!

586
00:21:43,985 --> 00:21:45,985
- Come on.
- He did this to me!

587
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:47,714
Go on in. Hurry up and come here.

588
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:51,955
(The siblings had the same chemistry 18 years ago.)

589
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,355
It was exactly like this!

590
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,694
- Is this the place?
- Kwang Kyu!

591
00:21:58,695 --> 00:21:59,965
- I...
- Go on in.

592
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:01,534
He dragged me again.

593
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:03,294
His body remembers...

594
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,565
the way he handled me in the past.

595
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,505
You caught it on camera, right?

596
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,705
- It was exactly like this!
- That was how he treated me.

597
00:22:11,045 --> 00:22:12,574
Hurry up and go.

598
00:22:12,575 --> 00:22:13,615
(Hurry up and pick up yogurt for me.)

599
00:22:13,745 --> 00:22:15,214
(After taking Ji Min to the beauty salon, )

600
00:22:15,215 --> 00:22:19,185
(he goes to buy yogurt right away.)

601
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:26,055
(Thanks to Ji Min, he works more busily than ever.)

602
00:22:27,225 --> 00:22:28,625
- Hello.
- Hello.

603
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,195
Hello.

604
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:32,964
- What should I do?
- You can just sit and relax.

605
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:34,394
- Really? Oh, my.
- Yes.

606
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,564
Have a seat and relax.

607
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:36,595
(Smiling happily)

608
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,535
(As soon as she arrives, My Star starts getting dolled up.)

609
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:45,945
(She looks so beautiful even early in the morning.)

610
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:49,945
(Staring)

611
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:51,715
Oh, I see that...

612
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:53,815
Ji Min has a lot of hair.

613
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,185
She has a lot of hair.

614
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:57,885
(Jealous)

615
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,185
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

616
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:00,555
- You don't have to...
- That was random.

617
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,025
I just realised that you had a lot of hair.

618
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,424
- Seo Jin is calling.
- I called him. That's why.

619
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:04,825
Let me speak to him, please.

620
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:07,495
- You answer the phone.
- I was going to call him.

621
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:11,065
Hi, Assistant Manager Lee.

622
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:12,464
Hey, Ji Min.

623
00:23:12,465 --> 00:23:14,334
I need you to get me something else.

624
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:18,505
- What? Sorry?
- I need you to get me some coffee.

625
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,474
They serve coffee as well at the yogurt place.

626
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:21,645
What kind of coffee do you want?

627
00:23:22,315 --> 00:23:24,114
Five cups of iced Americano.

628
00:23:24,115 --> 00:23:25,144
- Five?
- Okay.

629
00:23:25,145 --> 00:23:27,384
And for me, please get a cup of hot Americano.

630
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:29,385
And I want it to be decaf.

631
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,124
(Entering her orders without complaining)

632
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,554
- They have different flavours...
- That's all. Yes?

633
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:34,725
of Greek yogurt here.

634
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,524
Thick or creamy?

635
00:23:36,525 --> 00:23:38,064
(You have to choose the texture of yogurt.)

636
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:39,325
- Thick.
- Thick?

637
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:40,934
Yes, and an apple.

638
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:42,234
(Ji Min's snack order: Greek yogurt, coffee, and apple)

639
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:43,265
Got it.

640
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,804
- Got it.
- You should wash the apple...

641
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:45,835
even if it's a washed apple.

642
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:48,105
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

643
00:23:48,205 --> 00:23:49,235
Okay. Bye.

644
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:51,675
- That was...
- Yes?

645
00:23:51,676 --> 00:23:53,574
He's not the obedient type.

646
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,544
That's because he feels guilty about what he did.

647
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:57,015
(That's because he feels guilty about what he did.)

648
00:23:57,915 --> 00:24:00,085
You practically have him wrapped around your little finger.

649
00:24:00,515 --> 00:24:02,714
(The only My Star who specialises in taming Seo Jin)

650
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:04,255
I was just...

651
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:06,355
laughing inside.

652
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,725
"It's your turn to go through what I always go through, you punk."

653
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,025
I was smiling while thinking that.

654
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,165
(Meanwhile, Seo Jin is running the errand obediently.)

655
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:19,565
(Selecting iced Americano)

656
00:24:22,435 --> 00:24:25,145
(He doesn't know where to tap.)

657
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:28,275
- How do I adjust the amount?
- The amount of what, sir?

658
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,015
- Coffee.
- Tap "Add to cart" first.

659
00:24:30,075 --> 00:24:31,345
Oh, I should tap "Add to cart" first?

660
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:32,744
- And then...
- Okay.

661
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:34,554
(Greek yogurt, 5 iced Americano: checked)

662
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:35,685
What's next?

663
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:40,125
Where can I find decaf coffee?

664
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:42,725
- We have no decaf coffee.
- You don't have it? Okay.

665
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,164
Then I'll pay for these for now.

666
00:24:44,165 --> 00:24:46,294
(He ordered yogurt and iced Americano.)

667
00:24:46,295 --> 00:24:47,535
How long will it take?

668
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:49,795
- Between 10 and 15 minutes.
- All right. Thank you.

669
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:53,004
(After ordering coffee, he heads to a convenience store.)

670
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,034
- Hello.
- Hello.

671
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,604
- Do you have apples here?
- Apples?

672
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,275
- Oh, my. Hello.
- Hello.

673
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:00,645
(Greek yogurt, 5 iced Americano, apple: checked)

674
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:03,015
(A whole apple)

675
00:25:03,445 --> 00:25:05,745
Don't forget to cut an apple into small pieces.

676
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:08,015
It's pretty.

677
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:10,154
He's calling again.

678
00:25:10,155 --> 00:25:11,225
(It's starting to get bothersome.)

679
00:25:12,025 --> 00:25:13,524
(Kwang Kyu goes up to My Star as Seo Jin is calling.)

680
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:15,255
- Yes, Seo Jin.
- Kwang Kyu.

681
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:16,865
Do we have a knife?

682
00:25:17,295 --> 00:25:19,325
- There's no knife here.
- We don't have a knife?

683
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:20,834
We don't have a knife.

684
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:22,565
(We don't have a knife.)

685
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:24,835
- Do you have a knife too?
- Yes.

686
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:27,834
Kwang Kyu, do you want an apple too? Shall I get you some bananas?

687
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:28,934
- I...
- Bananas?

688
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:30,645
I'd like a banana.

689
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:32,375
- Okay.
- Okay.

690
00:25:34,975 --> 00:25:36,115
- A box cutter?
- If you need to peel an apple...

691
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:37,615
I don't think that'd work.

692
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:41,554
(He buys an apple and a banana for now.)

693
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:43,054
I'll just get these.

694
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,525
(He buys an apple and a banana for now.)

695
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,355
Is it ready?

696
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:49,895
- I'm sorry, - Yes?

697
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:52,225
but could you please cut this apple?

698
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:53,834
I don't have a knife.

699
00:25:53,835 --> 00:25:55,664
(Speaking nicely while smiling with dimples)

700
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:57,535
- Could you just cut it...
- In half?

701
00:25:58,365 --> 00:25:59,735
- Into a few small pieces.
- Oh, okay.

702
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,945
(He has a good head on his shoulders.)

703
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,305
Thank you.

704
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:12,585
(Carrying the apple, yogurt, and coffee)

705
00:26:13,985 --> 00:26:15,884
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

706
00:26:15,885 --> 00:26:17,424
(Hot decaf Americano: checked)

707
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,125
- Have a good day.
- You too.

708
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:22,455
(Restless)

709
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:25,965
It feels weird not to do anything and just relax on the sofa.

710
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:32,405
(I wish every day were like today.)

711
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:36,835
Then shall I give you a task you can do while sitting there?

712
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,244
What is it?

713
00:26:38,245 --> 00:26:40,644
As I told you earlier, I need to dance...

714
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:42,475
- Right.
- At the Blue Dragon Film Awards.

715
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,285
I shouldn't have said that.

716
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:46,484
- You can just rest instead.
- No.

717
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:47,485
I heard...

718
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:48,954
you liked to make challenge videos.

719
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,054
Absolutely.

720
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:52,454
I helped many celebrities make a challenge video on this show.

721
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:53,924
- Really?
- Yes.

722
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,424
I filmed U-Know for his challenge video.

723
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:57,225
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Right.

724
00:26:57,695 --> 00:26:59,395
I specialise in making a challenge video.

725
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,835
- You do?
- Yes.

726
00:27:01,535 --> 00:27:02,735
Then... What was it?

727
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:04,104
Actually,

728
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:06,164
I taught myself the choreography, but it was hard for me.

729
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:07,635
Do you like dancing?

730
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,374
- Dancing?
- Yes.

731
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:11,174
- Yes, I like dancing.
- Good.

732
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:13,744
Watch a video and teach me the dance moves.

733
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:15,945
(Watch a video and teach me the dance moves.)

734
00:27:18,945 --> 00:27:20,184
Oh, that's not what I meant.

735
00:27:20,185 --> 00:27:21,685
I was talking about a random dance.

736
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:25,225
When is the Blue Dragon Film Awards?

737
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:26,684
It's in ten days.

738
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:28,395
(My Star has requested a dance challenge lesson.)

739
00:27:28,695 --> 00:27:30,595
I sent you a dance challenge video.

740
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:32,425
(Let me see.)

741
00:27:34,335 --> 00:27:35,794
(BOYNEXTDOOR's "If I Say, I Love You" challenge)

742
00:27:35,795 --> 00:27:36,934
That part.

743
00:27:36,935 --> 00:27:38,705
(BOYNEXTDOOR's "If I Say, I Love You" challenge)

744
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:43,405
(You can easily tell it's a difficult dance move.)

745
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,515
Goodness. It looks difficult.

746
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:50,445
This...

747
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:52,745
(Sighing)

748
00:27:53,045 --> 00:27:54,254
I'll try...

749
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,284
- to make it simple.
- You'll make it a simple move?

750
00:27:56,285 --> 00:27:57,755
I'll try to turn it into a simple move.

751
00:28:01,455 --> 00:28:04,524
(He places his phone on the mirror to see it while practising.)

752
00:28:04,525 --> 00:28:06,024
Only today

753
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:07,235
- Now you act like you're whining.
- Today

754
00:28:07,865 --> 00:28:09,834
- One, two, and then...
- That's good.

755
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:10,904
point at the camera.

756
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:12,004
Bend your elbows...

757
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:14,575
(Struggling)

758
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:17,175
I don't think I can do this.

759
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:21,115
(It's not easy.)

760
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:24,215
(But I can't give up!)

761
00:28:28,155 --> 00:28:30,215
(Flustered)

762
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:33,225
(Whatever)

763
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:36,955
(He has poor arm-leg coordination, which is pitiful.)

764
00:28:37,265 --> 00:28:39,895
(He's in a trance.)

765
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:41,634
He's cute, right?

766
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:43,235
I want to go and watch him dance.

767
00:28:46,065 --> 00:28:47,435
He's really good at it.

768
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,875
(Enthusiastic)

769
00:28:51,805 --> 00:28:53,405
It's so difficult.

770
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,444
- How should I do that move?
- Kwang Kyu, I was told...

771
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:56,744
I only had to dance with my upper body.

772
00:28:56,745 --> 00:28:58,314
- Sorry? Only the upper body?
- I'll dance with my upper body.

773
00:28:58,315 --> 00:28:59,984
- I'll stand behind the MCs' podium.
- No leg moves?

774
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:01,814
That's right. You don't have to learn the leg moves.

775
00:29:01,815 --> 00:29:03,084
Only the upper body? Okay.

776
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:05,425
- My legs won't be seen.
- Oh, I see. Okay.

777
00:29:08,655 --> 00:29:09,855
Make a heart.

778
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:13,395
(Kwang Kyu dances more awkwardly as My Star is watching him.)

779
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:17,165
(She finds him cute.)

780
00:29:18,605 --> 00:29:22,005
(He continues practising the choreography for My Star.)

781
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:25,475
Dancing?

782
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:26,675
Yes, I like dancing.

783
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:33,045
(The dancing machine dances passionately.)

784
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:37,654
(He amazes himself while practising the challenge dance moves.)

785
00:29:37,655 --> 00:29:39,824
(And he's mastered the choreography.)

786
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:40,855
(Sighing)

787
00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:42,655
- Kwang Kyu.
- Yes?

788
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:45,265
Getting me coffee would've been easier, right?

789
00:29:45,665 --> 00:29:47,024
Rest on the sofa now.

790
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:48,164
My goodness.

791
00:29:48,165 --> 00:29:49,934
- Is it very difficult?
- It's harder than I thought.

792
00:29:49,935 --> 00:29:51,234
I heard the dance moves were very simple...

793
00:29:51,235 --> 00:29:52,865
like making a heart with hands. But that's not the case, right?

794
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:55,574
- You'll be wearing a dress, so...
- It'll be even harder.

795
00:29:55,575 --> 00:29:57,344
That's why they said I could just dance with my upper body.

796
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,505
- Then just do this move.
- Only that move?

797
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:02,814
- I love you - Make a heart. Throw it. Again.

798
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:03,815
And make a circle.

799
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:04,985
I'll do only this part.

800
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:08,414
- Is it too short?
- This move...

801
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:10,625
(The choreography customized for My Star)

802
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:19,024
Make a heart. Throw it. Again.

803
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,065
And make a circle.

804
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:24,605
(She danced the dance move perfectly thanks to Caretaker Fairy.)

805
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,234
I'll go and change my clothes.

806
00:30:26,235 --> 00:30:27,834
(The hair and makeup are done. She'll get changed for the shoot.)

807
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,434
- You'll get changed here?
- No, I'll do it in the next room.

808
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:30,574
Oh, I see. Okay.

809
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:32,605
- Just relax and rest.
- Okay.

810
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,345
Let's go

811
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:45,355
(Caretaker Fairy has lingering passion about the dance challenge.)

812
00:30:52,665 --> 00:30:53,765
Love you

813
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:55,065
Love you

814
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:01,934
(The unexpected heart gesture)

815
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:03,175
This is for her dance challenge.

816
00:31:03,435 --> 00:31:04,844
- It's for her dance challenge.
- Where is Ji Min?

817
00:31:04,845 --> 00:31:06,104
Ji Min is changing her clothes.

818
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:07,475
- Put them here.
- Sorry?

819
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:08,774
- Put them here.
- Here or there?

820
00:31:08,775 --> 00:31:09,875
- Over there.
- Okay.

821
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:11,914
(Removing a lint)

822
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:13,715
(They may squabble frequently, but they care a lot about each other.)

823
00:31:14,385 --> 00:31:19,555
(Nominees for the Best Couple Award at the SBS Entertainment Awards)

824
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:22,994
(Best Couple UP Award Nominees)

825
00:31:22,995 --> 00:31:24,124
(Lee Seo Jin and Kim Kwang Kyu, Vote)

826
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:27,025
(Please vote for us.)

827
00:31:29,335 --> 00:31:30,464
- Ji Min, let's eat.
- Hey.

828
00:31:30,465 --> 00:31:31,504
- Did you get everything right?
- Yes. Come and eat.

829
00:31:31,505 --> 00:31:32,904
- I need to finish styling my hair.
- Sorry?

830
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:33,905
Give me the apple.

831
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:35,404
- Nice work.
- Sorry?

832
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:36,535
You did a good job.

833
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,074
Assistant Manager Lee, my stylist...

834
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,444
- has something to tell you.
- What is it?

835
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:41,674
She said there was a task for you.

836
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:43,175
What is it? Why would she tell me that?

837
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,084
Because you're my manager.

838
00:31:45,085 --> 00:31:46,485
(Today is officially the revenge day.)

839
00:31:46,845 --> 00:31:48,585
(Looking at him nervously)

840
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:50,514
You should pack her sneakers...

841
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:52,855
and bring her the slippers.

842
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:55,655
- Slippers? Where are her slippers?
- Yes.

843
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,395
- Under her seat in the car.
- Sorry?

844
00:31:57,595 --> 00:31:58,725
- They're in the car?
- Yes.

845
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:02,094
Gosh, this is so bothersome.

846
00:32:02,095 --> 00:32:03,965
(Gosh, this is so bothersome.)

847
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,035
Done. I'm all set.

848
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:10,305
Let's get going.

849
00:32:12,745 --> 00:32:14,775
- Ji Min, are these your shoes?
- Yes.

850
00:32:15,215 --> 00:32:16,514
Put them under my seat...

851
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:18,015
- and bring my slipper, please.
- Are these for babies?

852
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:20,084
- What did you say?
- Are these for babies?

853
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,985
- They're size six.
- What?

854
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:25,785
- Are your slippers in the trunk?
- Under my seat.

855
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:26,925
Under the back seat?

856
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:29,455
This is so good.

857
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:39,505
(Grumpy Secretary may be prickly, but he handles all requests.)

858
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,135
Those people...

859
00:32:42,505 --> 00:32:43,775
(Dropping)

860
00:32:44,275 --> 00:32:45,605
Can you hold my phone for me?

861
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:47,175
(He turns around and leaves.)

862
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:49,514
- Help me walk down the stairs.
- Why?

863
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:51,815
Didn't you learn your duties? I fall down easily.

864
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,485
Kwang Kyu almost fell down too.

865
00:32:56,615 --> 00:32:58,654
- What's wrong with him?
- Hold me.

866
00:32:58,655 --> 00:32:59,954
Gosh, seriously.

867
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:00,955
(There are so many people whom Seo Jin needs to take care of.)

868
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:03,295
Where should I go? That way?

869
00:33:03,855 --> 00:33:06,064
- Hold my shoulder.
- I might fall down.

870
00:33:06,065 --> 00:33:07,465
- I said, hold my shoulder.
- Okay. I'll do that.

871
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:10,494
- Do you still fall down so easily?
- Pardon?

872
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:11,965
- Do you still fall down so easily?
- Yes.

873
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,904
(Seo Jin speaks bluntly but looks after her in a sweet way.)

874
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:17,004
- You fell down before...
- I even trip on a raised spot.

875
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:18,705
So I dragged you while I was trying to help you.

876
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:22,145
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

877
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:27,084
Was the yogurt place far from here?

878
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,155
He's pressing the button.

879
00:33:28,915 --> 00:33:30,984
(Struggling)

880
00:33:30,985 --> 00:33:33,154
I'll help you. The button...

881
00:33:33,155 --> 00:33:34,855
- I can't press it.
- It's used for closing the door.

882
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:37,125
- Only when you close the door.
- Oh, I see.

883
00:33:37,525 --> 00:33:39,664
Can you put the bag under your seat?

884
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:40,665
- Yes.
- Is there enough space?

885
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:42,865
- Yes, there's enough space here.
- Okay.

886
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:45,004
- I'll close the door for you.
- Oh, thank you.

887
00:33:45,005 --> 00:33:47,134
(My Star closes the door for Kwang Kyu.)

888
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:49,275
He's the one to take care of you, not vice versa.

889
00:33:49,475 --> 00:33:52,405
I had to help him. He couldn't open the door.

890
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:54,475
- Thank you.
- I've never ridden in this model.

891
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:58,284
(Crunchy)

892
00:33:58,285 --> 00:33:59,415
The apple is good.

893
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:01,614
I found a place where they had delicious apples.

894
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:03,315
(Smiling with dimples)

895
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:05,524
(My Star's Schedule:)

896
00:34:05,525 --> 00:34:09,025
(12:10pm, dress boutique in Gangnam, Drama Shoot 1)

897
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:13,625
Hello? This is Actress Han Ji Min's manager. Please go ahead.

898
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,135
Oh, hello.

899
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,934
I'm Park So Hyeon, a staff member of "Efficient Dating for Singles."

900
00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:18,665
Yes. Hello.

901
00:34:19,005 --> 00:34:21,704
I'm calling you to tell you that you can call me on this number...

902
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:23,334
when you arrive.

903
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:25,174
Understood. I'll call you right when we get there.

904
00:34:25,175 --> 00:34:26,945
- Great. Thank you.
- Bye.

905
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:29,545
She's the main staff member.

906
00:34:29,546 --> 00:34:30,714
Is the title "Singles?"

907
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:32,744
It's "Efficient Dating for Singles."

908
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:33,914
("Efficient Dating for Singles")

909
00:34:33,915 --> 00:34:36,055
- Kwang Kyu would like the title.
- What?

910
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:38,654
- Why?
- "Efficient Dating for Singles."

911
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:39,655
"Efficient Dating for Singles."

912
00:34:40,025 --> 00:34:41,524
I want to date someone efficiently.

913
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:44,425
(Since this year is almost over, meet someone efficiently next year.)

914
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:50,805
Seo Jin, I don't see any spoons.

915
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:54,634
(There's no spoon with Greek yogurt?)

916
00:34:54,635 --> 00:34:55,934
(It's there!)

917
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,104
There is a spoon here?

918
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:58,105
Where?

919
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:01,715
Under the tissues.

920
00:35:02,515 --> 00:35:05,245
(The flustered dimples)

921
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:12,825
- It's there, right?
- It's not a spoon. It's honey.

922
00:35:12,885 --> 00:35:13,955
It's honey?

923
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,294
Did you not bring a spoon?

924
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:18,864
(Nodding)

925
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:19,925
Goodness.

926
00:35:20,995 --> 00:35:23,734
(She's dumbfounded and only chuckles.)

927
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,105
I can't eat yogurt with my hand.

928
00:35:26,805 --> 00:35:29,505
- Kwang Kyu, don't you have a spoon?
- I can't eat it with my hand.

929
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:31,145
- Pardon me?
- He must have a spoon.

930
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:34,515
I have some straws but no spoon.

931
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:35,815
- No spoon?
- Can you suck it with a straw?

932
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:37,944
Suck it with a straw?

933
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:40,815
I asked you to buy thick yogurt earlier.

934
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,214
(He talks nonsense because he's flustered.)

935
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:45,425
- Just wait for a while.
- I don't have any spoons.

936
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:47,725
We can buy one at a store when we get there.

937
00:35:48,055 --> 00:35:49,625
She wants to eat it in the car on our way there.

938
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:51,195
We're running late.

939
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:53,495
I'll buy you a spoon at a store on the way.

940
00:35:54,065 --> 00:35:55,095
Okay.

941
00:35:56,135 --> 00:35:58,734
Kwang Kyu, we'll stop by a store. Can you go get a spoon for her?

942
00:35:58,735 --> 00:36:00,505
Here? That convenience store?

943
00:36:01,705 --> 00:36:03,775
- Thank you, Kwang Kyu.
- Don't mention it.

944
00:36:05,275 --> 00:36:06,805
- Don't forget about the receipt.
- Okay.

945
00:36:09,075 --> 00:36:13,315
(He runs toward the store to buy a spoon for My Star.)

946
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,514
I think he can walk all the way.

947
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:18,285
(I think he can walk all the way to the filming location.)

948
00:36:18,655 --> 00:36:20,455
He'll be shocked if the car is gone when he comes out. That's mean.

949
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:23,525
- Shall we just go without him?
- No.

950
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,865
He's looking for a spoon.

951
00:36:27,695 --> 00:36:28,995
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

952
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:31,134
You don't sell them separately, do you?

953
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:32,135
No, we don't.

954
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:33,935
It's a waste of money.

955
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:37,104
It's a waste of money.

956
00:36:37,105 --> 00:36:39,675
(Kwang Kyu, the thrift man who spends money wisely)

957
00:36:40,745 --> 00:36:44,315
(He finds free disposable spoons which can be an alternative.)

958
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:46,145
Do they have any small cups of yogurt?

959
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:49,914
Peach? Or strawberry?

960
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:53,324
(He'll buy yogurt to receive a free spoon.)

961
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,355
And...

962
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:56,924
- Let's go.
- You'll leave now, right?

963
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:58,295
(He's being playful.)

964
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,965
That's so mean. Come on.

965
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:04,034
(They will leave without Kwang Kyu.)

966
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:05,164
(They make a great team at a situation like this.)

967
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:06,305
Oh, boy.

968
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:08,475
I feel so bad for him.

969
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:12,305
(They set off leaving Kwang Kyu here.)

970
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:14,044
Come on, seriously.

971
00:37:14,045 --> 00:37:15,514
(Half worried, half excited)

972
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,074
He won't walk all the way there, will he?

973
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:19,014
It's close by. It's really near here.

974
00:37:19,015 --> 00:37:20,645
(It takes 5 minutes on foot.)

975
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:23,254
You should be on set early.

976
00:37:23,255 --> 00:37:25,055
(As they left without Kwang Kyu, they arrived on set early.)

977
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:27,654
- Hello.
- Do you need only one spoon?

978
00:37:27,655 --> 00:37:28,694
Well, actually,

979
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:30,154
- I need just one spoon, - I see.

980
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:31,595
so I'm buying the yogurt.

981
00:37:34,595 --> 00:37:36,064
I was going to give you this if you needed just one.

982
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:37,394
Really? Could you give me that too?

983
00:37:37,395 --> 00:37:38,434
- Sure.
- Thank you.

984
00:37:38,435 --> 00:37:39,535
Give me a second.

985
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:41,504
Can I just take this spoon without buying the yogurt?

986
00:37:41,505 --> 00:37:43,935
(Payment has been completed.)

987
00:37:44,305 --> 00:37:47,075
- Well... I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

988
00:37:47,305 --> 00:37:48,444
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

989
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:52,685
(He leaves quickly feeling embarrassed.)

990
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:57,085
He left without me again.

991
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:58,785
Gosh, seriously.

992
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,425
- Hello?
- How could you leave without me?

993
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:04,494
We were told to hurry to the set.

994
00:38:04,495 --> 00:38:06,064
- Oh, did they call you?
- Yes.

995
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:08,464
Send me the address... Wait.

996
00:38:08,465 --> 00:38:09,634
- Or...
- You just have...

997
00:38:09,635 --> 00:38:11,165
to turn left and go straight. And you'll find it.

998
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:12,705
- Okay.
- Okay.

999
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:14,674
I'll find the way.

1000
00:38:14,675 --> 00:38:16,975
(She feels bad for no reason.)

1001
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:23,715
(Here comes the spoon for My Star.)

1002
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:26,985
- Hello.
- Hello.

1003
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:28,654
On which floor does the shoot take place?

1004
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,155
- On the 3rd floor.
- On the 3rd floor?

1005
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:34,155
(Kwang Kyu ran without a break and arrived.)

1006
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:36,324
- You came so fast.
- Right.

1007
00:38:36,325 --> 00:38:37,765
- Thank you.
- Here's a spoon.

1008
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:39,294
Oh, my. It's so big.

1009
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:41,095
Can I eat it now? Do I have enough time?

1010
00:38:41,365 --> 00:38:42,535
Go ahead and eat it.

1011
00:38:42,895 --> 00:38:43,895
(Exhausted)

1012
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:45,404
- Close the door.
- Thank you for the spoon.

1013
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:47,035
- No problem.
- Did you buy snacks for you?

1014
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:48,235
It's not like that.

1015
00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:50,705
- You can't just buy only a spoon.
- There was a set of spoons,

1016
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:53,105
which was three dollars. I thought it was a waste of money.

1017
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:55,974
I often leave my phone...

1018
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:57,345
- with my manager.
- I see.

1019
00:38:58,615 --> 00:38:59,615
Assistant Manager Lee.

1020
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:01,354
You'll leave it with me?

1021
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:03,314
- And...
- Leave it with him. He has a bag.

1022
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:04,684
No. You should take photos of me.

1023
00:39:04,685 --> 00:39:06,085
He specialises in taking photos.

1024
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,054
You take photos of her in front of the monitor.

1025
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:10,194
- I'll take care of her beside her.
- Okay.

1026
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:11,994
- Okay?
- Yes, sure.

1027
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:13,224
(Thanks to My Star, we see a lot of rare sights.)

1028
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,664
Your phone is ringing.

1029
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:16,694
- Hello?
- We should spread them all...

1030
00:39:16,695 --> 00:39:18,334
Hello, Mr. Lee. She has to come upstairs now.

1031
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:19,835
- Understood.
- All right.

1032
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:21,304
I ate a lot.

1033
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:24,844
(She has the last bite before she leaves.)

1034
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,874
I couldn't practice my lines. I can do it at the rehearsal.

1035
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:30,015
(They head to the first filming set.)

1036
00:39:32,615 --> 00:39:34,315
(Thinking hard)

1037
00:39:35,585 --> 00:39:37,314
Are you wearing this outfit for the drama scene?

1038
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:38,554
- Yes.
- What about your shoes?

1039
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:39,885
I can change my shoes when I get there.

1040
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,324
(She spots a staff member.)

1041
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:43,525
Hi, So Hyeon.

1042
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:45,394
- Have you ever worked with him?
- Yes.

1043
00:39:45,395 --> 00:39:47,225
- Hello, Mr. Kim.
- I think I've met you.

1044
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:49,434
Yes. Hello, Mr. Kim.

1045
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:50,664
(Park So Hyeon, the floor director of "Efficient Dating for Singles")

1046
00:39:50,665 --> 00:39:52,334
I worked on the teams of "The Undateables..."

1047
00:39:52,335 --> 00:39:53,364
and "The Judge from Hell."

1048
00:39:53,365 --> 00:39:55,575
That's right. I remember now.

1049
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,704
- He starred in all dramas.
- Exactly.

1050
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:59,104
- He starred in all dramas.
- He starred...

1051
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,604
- He played in all dramas.
- That's right.

1052
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:01,714
Give her what you prepared.

1053
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:02,845
Oh, right.

1054
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:04,784
Here you go, So Hyeon. You haven't eaten yet, right?

1055
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:06,885
- Thank you, Mr. Kim.
- How many floor directors are here?

1056
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:08,354
Do you have any spoons?

1057
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:11,684
Of course, I brought spoons as well.

1058
00:40:11,685 --> 00:40:12,685
(He almost forgot about the spoons, the most important things.)

1059
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:14,154
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1060
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:15,955
- I brought some more just in case.
- Thank you.

1061
00:40:17,525 --> 00:40:20,594
Seo Jin, there's a bottle of perfume in the right corner under my seat.

1062
00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,034
- Please bring it to me.
- Why would you wear perfume?

1063
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:23,764
I always wear perfume when acting. Hurry up and go.

1064
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:26,264
- Forget about it. Just go.
- Hurry up and bring my perfume.

1065
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:27,404
Which one?

1066
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:28,704
- There's only one bottle.
- Sorry?

1067
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:29,775
There's only one bottle.

1068
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:31,604
- Why?
- Where is it again?

1069
00:40:31,605 --> 00:40:33,375
- What are you talking about?
- That's okay. I'll spray it later.

1070
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:36,474
(She's excited, pranking Seo Jin.)

1071
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,615
It's okay.

1072
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:40,245
(Grunting)

1073
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:43,584
Ji Min, you're determined to give me a hard time, right?

1074
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:44,624
No, that's not the case.

1075
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,584
I always wear different perfumes for different characters.

1076
00:40:47,585 --> 00:40:49,455
Do you wear good perfume these days?

1077
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,094
I don't wear the cucumber-scented perfume anymore.

1078
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:52,964
It smelled like a cucumber. Do you remember that?

1079
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:54,835
Of course. I hate the scent of cucumber the most.

1080
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:56,464
Which floor are we going to?

1081
00:40:56,465 --> 00:40:57,665
I bet he hates the smell of cucumber too.

1082
00:40:57,765 --> 00:40:59,204
Those who served in the military hate the smell of cucumber.

1083
00:40:59,205 --> 00:41:00,205
Why?

1084
00:41:00,206 --> 00:41:01,834
You get cucumber-scented soap in the military.

1085
00:41:01,835 --> 00:41:04,004
- I like it.
- It wasn't the case in your days.

1086
00:41:04,005 --> 00:41:05,974
- I used Dial.
- It was Dial back then.

1087
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:07,875
- I used Dial.
- It wasn't cucumber soap.

1088
00:41:08,275 --> 00:41:10,244
As for cigarettes, there were Eunhasoo and Geobookseon.

1089
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:12,145
(Grumpy Secretary reminisces the old days.)

1090
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:13,944
(Staring)

1091
00:41:13,945 --> 00:41:15,754
- Is it a long scene?
- No, it's not long.

1092
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:17,284
- What is it? Which scene is it?
- What scene...

1093
00:41:17,285 --> 00:41:18,384
- Just this much.
- I see.

1094
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,024
The scene number 16? Right. This is the one she'll shoot.

1095
00:41:20,025 --> 00:41:22,325
- This much from here.
- About one page.

1096
00:41:23,095 --> 00:41:25,194
Let's begin the rehearsal.

1097
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:26,324
(My Star's drama "Efficient Dating for Singles")

1098
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:29,134
Those on this side are in the frame. Please move to the back.

1099
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:31,864
(The staff members are busy preparing for the shoot.)

1100
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,434
- Eui Young is here.
- She's here.

1101
00:41:34,435 --> 00:41:36,474
- Hello.
- Hello.

1102
00:41:36,475 --> 00:41:38,705
- Hello.
- Hello.

1103
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:40,675
- Hello.
- Hello.

1104
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:42,445
- The director is here.
- Get ready.

1105
00:41:42,575 --> 00:41:44,315
- Director, hello. These two...
- Hello.

1106
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:47,245
- They're my managers.
- Hello.

1107
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,885
- Hello.
- Hello.

1108
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:52,884
- Hello.
- Hello.

1109
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,524
- Hello.
- Hi, guys.

1110
00:41:54,525 --> 00:41:57,155
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

1111
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:59,325
- Hey, hi. Hi, guys.
- Hello.

1112
00:41:59,765 --> 00:42:01,995
- Hi, guys. Hello.
- Hello.

1113
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:04,805
We'll rehearse the scene first.

1114
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:06,965
(The name of Ji Min's character is Eui Young.)

1115
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:09,135
Let's begin the rehearsal. Action.

1116
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:15,615
(Rehearsing for the scene she will shoot today)

1117
00:42:15,945 --> 00:42:17,375
Yu Mi.

1118
00:42:17,915 --> 00:42:19,014
You look so pretty.

1119
00:42:19,015 --> 00:42:22,914
(My Star with 26 years of experience at her professional moment)

1120
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,985
My friend.

1121
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:25,655
Goodness.

1122
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,285
Okay.

1123
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:32,565
(He's on close personal care mode.)

1124
00:42:33,395 --> 00:42:35,935
(Glancing)

1125
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:37,865
I can't believe this.

1126
00:42:38,365 --> 00:42:40,104
This is something I never imagined would happen.

1127
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:41,105
Why?

1128
00:42:42,105 --> 00:42:44,745
It's so funny you're standing there like a manager.

1129
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,845
(He's grumpy, but he does his job.)

1130
00:42:49,075 --> 00:42:50,244
Let's go.

1131
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:52,685
(The drama filming starts.)

1132
00:42:53,385 --> 00:42:56,515
Just. I don't know why I'm so nervous.

1133
00:42:56,915 --> 00:42:59,125
Did anything happen?

1134
00:43:00,155 --> 00:43:02,255
(He's always on stand-by near My Star.)

1135
00:43:03,725 --> 00:43:05,665
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

1136
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:11,065
- Yes. Like that.
- Like that.

1137
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:13,104
(The scene didn't receive an okay sign yet.)

1138
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:14,565
- You're not moving.
- Why?

1139
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:16,375
- Read it again.
- Suddenly?

1140
00:43:16,475 --> 00:43:17,575
Did I get it wrong?

1141
00:43:17,705 --> 00:43:19,245
Read the lines of other people too.

1142
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:23,314
(She reads the script again.)

1143
00:43:23,315 --> 00:43:26,144
- Shall we begin?
- Okay.

1144
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,215
(He finds a better place to monitor her.)

1145
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:30,015
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Stand by.

1146
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:32,085
- One, two, three, cue.
- Cue.

1147
00:43:34,825 --> 00:43:36,595
Did anything happen?

1148
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:38,995
Nothing happened.

1149
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:42,894
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

1150
00:43:42,895 --> 00:43:44,035
(Glancing)

1151
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:46,035
I keep thinking if this is okay.

1152
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:49,974
I guess you're having many thoughts...

1153
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:52,645
because the wedding day is approaching.

1154
00:43:53,045 --> 00:43:54,644
- Okay.
- It's because of you.

1155
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:56,615
- I told you to read the script.
- Turn around.

1156
00:43:57,415 --> 00:43:58,585
Don't make eye contact with me.

1157
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:03,755
(His mouth is itching to talk.)

1158
00:44:03,785 --> 00:44:07,285
(Moving)

1159
00:44:07,385 --> 00:44:08,495
Read it again.

1160
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:09,954
Why are you giving it to me again?

1161
00:44:09,955 --> 00:44:11,925
- I know my lines.
- Put the script underneath.

1162
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:13,564
I suppose you're having...

1163
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:17,335
(How an actor-turned manager provides hands-on acting support)

1164
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:19,604
One, two, three, cue.

1165
00:44:19,605 --> 00:44:22,335
(The part where they just had a blooper)

1166
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:25,274
I suppose you're having many thoughts...

1167
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:27,405
because the wedding day is approaching.

1168
00:44:27,905 --> 00:44:29,674
Okay. Cue.

1169
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:30,844
(Observing with a hawk's eye)

1170
00:44:30,845 --> 00:44:33,245
I should do this. I will.

1171
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:36,114
- Okay.
- Okay.

1172
00:44:36,115 --> 00:44:37,115
(They received an okay sign.)

1173
00:44:37,116 --> 00:44:38,254
Don't be near the camera.

1174
00:44:38,255 --> 00:44:39,725
- Why?
- I can't help but laugh.

1175
00:44:39,925 --> 00:44:42,424
- Why?
- Why are you within my sight?

1176
00:44:42,425 --> 00:44:43,724
A manager should be somewhere within your sight.

1177
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:44,894
- Where else should I be?
- Doesn't he bother you?

1178
00:44:44,895 --> 00:44:46,024
- I'm not.
- Move away.

1179
00:44:46,025 --> 00:44:48,095
- I'm outside the angle.
- Just kick him.

1180
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:49,865
Let's move.

1181
00:44:50,235 --> 00:44:52,504
Please take him, So Hyeon.

1182
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:53,505
Okay.

1183
00:44:53,765 --> 00:44:55,604
He keeps staying in my view.

1184
00:44:55,605 --> 00:44:57,405
- You're...
- I want to be of assistance.

1185
00:44:59,675 --> 00:45:02,115
- You're not on social media, right?
- You're not acting seriously.

1186
00:45:02,275 --> 00:45:03,345
That's not true.

1187
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:05,244
You're not acting seriously these days, right?

1188
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:06,984
(She's speechless.)

1189
00:45:06,985 --> 00:45:08,084
Why are you saying that?

1190
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:09,815
- You're taking it easy.
- No, I'm not.

1191
00:45:09,985 --> 00:45:12,885
You should do something here and enter.

1192
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:14,685
Why do you just enter like that?

1193
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:18,025
(The baffled back of My Star)

1194
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:22,034
- If someone else were teaching me, - She's not putting effort.

1195
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:23,435
- I would have thanked the person.
- What?

1196
00:45:24,165 --> 00:45:25,934
Are you even giving acting directions?

1197
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:28,204
(Clicking his tongue)

1198
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:29,434
Let's watch it.

1199
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,274
- Am I being filmed well?
- Let's watch it.

1200
00:45:31,275 --> 00:45:32,704
- You're being filmed well.
- Did you record it?

1201
00:45:32,705 --> 00:45:34,875
You're being filmed well.

1202
00:45:35,715 --> 00:45:37,714
Seo Jin asked me if I'm not acting seriously.

1203
00:45:37,715 --> 00:45:38,914
(She tells on him.)

1204
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:40,614
Is he giving you acting directions?

1205
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:41,854
He's giving me acting directions.

1206
00:45:41,855 --> 00:45:43,355
Goodness.

1207
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:45,654
Did you ask him for help?

1208
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:47,754
I didn't, but he came and asked why I'm not being serious.

1209
00:45:47,755 --> 00:45:49,855
He said, "You should do this and that."

1210
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:52,365
I think he's becoming a boomer.

1211
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,834
He talks too much.

1212
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:56,864
(My Star's private gossip session with Kwang Kyu)

1213
00:45:56,865 --> 00:45:59,105
He should do his job properly. Why is he giving directions?

1214
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:02,974
He won't give me my script.

1215
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:04,004
(He's studying to give directions.)

1216
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:05,045
Manager.

1217
00:46:05,945 --> 00:46:07,645
Ji Min told on him to me.

1218
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:09,615
- Right.
- What did you say?

1219
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:13,845
That he's becoming a boomer because he aged.

1220
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:17,385
That she should understand.

1221
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:19,955
He did the same thing to Ahn Eun Jin.

1222
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:25,895
(Seo Jin's School Season 1)

1223
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,964
(Glancing)

1224
00:46:28,965 --> 00:46:31,605
I'm really sorry, but could you clear the area?

1225
00:46:31,635 --> 00:46:33,764
- Everyone, clear the area.
- We should remove that.

1226
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:35,105
(While preparations for filming are underway)

1227
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:37,504
- So Hyeon.
- Yes?

1228
00:46:37,505 --> 00:46:38,675
Is that leftover gimbap?

1229
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:40,204
- Gimbap?
- Over there.

1230
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:42,115
Could you be quiet?

1231
00:46:42,475 --> 00:46:43,715
Never mind.

1232
00:46:43,975 --> 00:46:45,485
Please be quiet.

1233
00:46:45,585 --> 00:46:46,585
I feel embarrassed.

1234
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:47,914
(Seo Genie is embarrassed by the older bestie.)

1235
00:46:47,915 --> 00:46:49,784
Why can't you read the room?

1236
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:51,384
They said these were leftovers earlier.

1237
00:46:51,385 --> 00:46:53,185
Then speak quietly.

1238
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:56,124
Are these leftovers?

1239
00:46:56,125 --> 00:46:57,555
(He asks again quietly.)

1240
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:01,795
I'll eat one.

1241
00:47:02,165 --> 00:47:04,965
I've been on drama sets long enough to know.

1242
00:47:05,305 --> 00:47:08,505
When you order 100 gimbaps,

1243
00:47:08,935 --> 00:47:10,705
you always end up with 20 to 30 left.

1244
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:12,645
Those get thrown away.

1245
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:15,875
Rather than having them thrown away, it would be better...

1246
00:47:16,675 --> 00:47:18,015
to throw them inside my stomach.

1247
00:47:20,185 --> 00:47:22,315
(Eating)

1248
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:24,985
(He carefully throws them inside his stomach.)

1249
00:47:25,725 --> 00:47:27,925
(He habitually looks around.)

1250
00:47:31,525 --> 00:47:35,635
(Eating)

1251
00:47:37,865 --> 00:47:39,105
There he is.

1252
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:43,205
I really can't leave you. You're already...

1253
00:47:43,575 --> 00:47:46,475
- You're amazing.
- I mean...

1254
00:47:47,805 --> 00:47:48,845
You're amazing.

1255
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:50,115
You should eat.

1256
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:54,315
Do you like the ends?

1257
00:47:55,855 --> 00:47:58,925
(Keeping him quiet with the end piece of the gimbap)

1258
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:01,425
It's tasty.

1259
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,094
Take one more.

1260
00:48:03,095 --> 00:48:04,555
(Suddenly changing in attitude)

1261
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:07,795
(Okay. I'll take one more!)

1262
00:48:07,965 --> 00:48:10,835
They're leftovers anyway. They'll be thrown away.

1263
00:48:13,165 --> 00:48:17,435
(Since she doesn't drink much water, it has to be supplied constantly.)

1264
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:19,275
(Glancing)

1265
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:22,845
I don't want to drink now.

1266
00:48:24,045 --> 00:48:25,845
I said I don't want to drink now.

1267
00:48:27,445 --> 00:48:28,485
Take a sip.

1268
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:31,085
Take a sip.

1269
00:48:31,685 --> 00:48:32,724
Drink.

1270
00:48:32,725 --> 00:48:34,585
(Forcing My Star to drink water)

1271
00:48:35,525 --> 00:48:38,155
(Feeling proud)

1272
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:42,195
- I don't want to drink now.
- Drink.

1273
00:48:42,235 --> 00:48:45,704
- Drink some water.
- It's not like I'm a newborn.

1274
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:48,334
(He's tormenting My Star under the excuse of hydration.)

1275
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:50,405
- Don't do this.
- Take a sip.

1276
00:48:51,335 --> 00:48:53,945
- Here.
- Report this man.

1277
00:48:54,405 --> 00:48:55,775
- Drink.
- All right. I'll drink.

1278
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:57,215
Don't push it at me.

1279
00:48:58,745 --> 00:49:01,614
You should keep drinking if you want to say the lines.

1280
00:49:01,615 --> 00:49:03,115
Why should I drink so much?

1281
00:49:04,855 --> 00:49:05,985
She's drinking a lot.

1282
00:49:07,255 --> 00:49:08,954
Ji Min is drinking a lot of water.

1283
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:09,995
That's right.

1284
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:13,394
There's a reason why people are pretty.

1285
00:49:13,395 --> 00:49:14,495
That's right.

1286
00:49:17,235 --> 00:49:18,935
I should also drink a lot of water.

1287
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:20,835
You're already pretty.

1288
00:49:21,975 --> 00:49:23,675
- I am?
- Yes.

1289
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:25,675
That's kind of ambiguous.

1290
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:30,115
(He's on constant water duty.)

1291
00:49:31,475 --> 00:49:34,045
Could you get me the yogurt I had in the car?

1292
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:35,584
- Drink.
- I'll drink.

1293
00:49:35,585 --> 00:49:36,885
Drink the water first.

1294
00:49:37,185 --> 00:49:38,684
- Yogurt.
- Which yogurt?

1295
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:39,954
I couldn't eat it earlier.

1296
00:49:39,955 --> 00:49:41,795
The one you had earlier? Aren't you going to have lunch?

1297
00:49:42,355 --> 00:49:43,455
Do you want gimbap?

1298
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:45,025
- I can't have gimbap.
- Why?

1299
00:49:45,765 --> 00:49:47,225
I have to wear a dress.

1300
00:49:47,795 --> 00:49:50,265
You know gimbap spikes blood sugar faster than anything else, right?

1301
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:52,364
Just 2 or 3. Would you like to eat just a few?

1302
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:54,364
- No.
- I'm not telling you to eat it all.

1303
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:56,075
I'm asking you to get me the yogurt.

1304
00:49:56,505 --> 00:49:58,035
- You can eat that while moving.
- My perfume as well.

1305
00:50:00,545 --> 00:50:02,944
- You can eat that while moving.
- I'm hungry now.

1306
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:05,114
You have to film now. You can't keep eating.

1307
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:07,114
- Yogurt is fine.
- Just drink water.

1308
00:50:07,115 --> 00:50:09,015
I just drank.

1309
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,854
Cancel the instruction...

1310
00:50:10,855 --> 00:50:12,085
of hydrating me frequently.

1311
00:50:12,825 --> 00:50:14,924
Stop giving me. I'll have to use the restroom.

1312
00:50:14,925 --> 00:50:17,495
You can't keep eating things while you're filming.

1313
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,865
I'm hungry now.

1314
00:50:19,965 --> 00:50:21,424
- Won't you talk with your friend?
- Let's have the runway.

1315
00:50:21,425 --> 00:50:22,894
How are you going to eat now?

1316
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,504
The yogurt will be here when I'm back from the next scene.

1317
00:50:25,505 --> 00:50:27,234
The actor has a very bad attitude.

1318
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:29,635
I learned my attitude from you.

1319
00:50:29,905 --> 00:50:32,075
She keeps trying to eat.

1320
00:50:32,175 --> 00:50:35,005
- You always ate.
- It might get stuck in your teeth.

1321
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:40,385
(He keeps annoying My Star.)

1322
00:50:42,185 --> 00:50:45,455
(He goes to the parking lot to get the yogurt.)

1323
00:50:46,455 --> 00:50:48,795
(Yogurt and perfume)

1324
00:50:49,495 --> 00:50:52,765
(He's like a brother who grumbles but does everything.)

1325
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:56,734
You shouldn't eat between the scenes.

1326
00:50:56,735 --> 00:50:58,435
Food shouldn't get in your teeth.

1327
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:02,305
She's gotten less focused.

1328
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,275
She wasn't like that before.

1329
00:51:05,005 --> 00:51:07,505
I've been an actor for a long time.

1330
00:51:07,845 --> 00:51:10,044
That yogurt had blueberries.

1331
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:12,115
When blueberries get stuck in your teeth, they don't come out.

1332
00:51:12,845 --> 00:51:14,745
I eat blueberries every morning these days.

1333
00:51:15,215 --> 00:51:17,684
It stays there for a long time.

1334
00:51:17,685 --> 00:51:18,685
(How Seo Genie takes care of My Star)

1335
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:21,925
That's why I told Ji Min not to eat it.

1336
00:51:23,195 --> 00:51:25,325
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

1337
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,924
- Take it.
- Why are you in my view?

1338
00:51:27,925 --> 00:51:29,564
You brought it. What got into you?

1339
00:51:29,565 --> 00:51:31,634
- You didn't bring it, did you?
- I brought it.

1340
00:51:31,635 --> 00:51:33,365
- He brought it.
- Thank you.

1341
00:51:33,605 --> 00:51:37,805
(She finally recharges her scent.)

1342
00:51:39,075 --> 00:51:40,145
Thank you.

1343
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:43,745
It doesn't smell like cucumbers, right?

1344
00:51:44,315 --> 00:51:45,785
Your taste has gotten much better.

1345
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,085
Really?

1346
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:49,555
That was the only time I put on that perfume.

1347
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:50,715
(Eating some yogurt)

1348
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:52,324
- It smells nice.
- Right?

1349
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:53,554
- Yes.
- You can put it on as well.

1350
00:51:53,555 --> 00:51:55,655
Did you film "Lee San, Wind of the Palace" for more than a year?

1351
00:51:55,795 --> 00:51:57,694
- Almost a year.
- For a year?

1352
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:59,665
(It was a grand historical drama with 77 episodes.)

1353
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,724
I don't think I'll be able to film something for that long now.

1354
00:52:01,725 --> 00:52:03,065
- It's crazy.
- Right?

1355
00:52:03,595 --> 00:52:04,994
- Back then, - You worked all night, right?

1356
00:52:04,995 --> 00:52:07,134
we would film a day scene at 2am.

1357
00:52:07,135 --> 00:52:08,875
That's right. When the script came out,

1358
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:11,305
I practised the script at 4 or 5am.

1359
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,375
The filming began at 8am.

1360
00:52:13,845 --> 00:52:15,945
- That's when he came to me.
- Not many people...

1361
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:18,745
knew the script inside and out.

1362
00:52:19,915 --> 00:52:21,115
But Lee Soon Jae.

1363
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:22,584
He never made a single blooper.

1364
00:52:22,585 --> 00:52:24,054
(But Lee Soon Jae!)

1365
00:52:24,055 --> 00:52:25,225
- He's amazing.
- Really.

1366
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:27,325
Among the seniors...

1367
00:52:27,725 --> 00:52:29,995
But he also never messed up any lines.

1368
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:32,095
He didn't practice.

1369
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:34,225
He didn't read the scripts, but he made no mistakes.

1370
00:52:35,295 --> 00:52:36,764
He's smart, but that's about it.

1371
00:52:36,765 --> 00:52:38,165
- He's clever.
- Just that.

1372
00:52:38,395 --> 00:52:40,565
- When did you memorize them?
- What?

1373
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:42,034
During the practice.

1374
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:43,035
That's all.

1375
00:52:43,036 --> 00:52:45,135
You memorized those long lines with just that?

1376
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:47,445
I just read them then.

1377
00:52:47,775 --> 00:52:48,915
That's amazing.

1378
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:50,915
- They weren't everyday lines.
- We'll check the location.

1379
00:52:50,945 --> 00:52:52,115
Okay.

1380
00:52:52,215 --> 00:52:53,345
I finished it.

1381
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:54,944
Okay.

1382
00:52:54,945 --> 00:52:56,215
Thank you.

1383
00:52:56,985 --> 00:52:58,084
Take a sip.

1384
00:52:58,085 --> 00:52:59,825
(He gets her to drink after the meal.)

1385
00:53:00,355 --> 00:53:01,584
It can show.

1386
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:04,095
(My Star gets back to work.)

1387
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,694
Just turn quietly.

1388
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:09,965
- You have to take pictures.
- Take what?

1389
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:11,464
Let's get ready.

1390
00:53:11,465 --> 00:53:12,634
Do I have to take pictures of this?

1391
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:13,705
Yes.

1392
00:53:14,535 --> 00:53:16,634
- Take pictures with the small one.
- The camera...

1393
00:53:16,635 --> 00:53:18,605
Whenever you look at the phone, I see an old lady.

1394
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:20,845
You should do it well.

1395
00:53:21,775 --> 00:53:23,045
This doesn't look nice.

1396
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:24,644
Take a natural photo.

1397
00:53:24,645 --> 00:53:25,815
I shouldn't know you're taking pictures.

1398
00:53:26,885 --> 00:53:28,214
Let's begin.

1399
00:53:28,215 --> 00:53:30,855
(Natural pictures...)

1400
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:35,254
(It's the last scene at the dress shop.)

1401
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:38,155
Okay. Let's move to the exhibition hall.

1402
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,194
We're going to start with looking at the mirror, right?

1403
00:53:40,195 --> 00:53:42,265
He just took pictures without thinking.

1404
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:44,164
Seriously.

1405
00:53:44,165 --> 00:53:45,934
I became four heads tall. Do you see this?

1406
00:53:45,935 --> 00:53:47,165
(I became four heads tall.)

1407
00:53:49,035 --> 00:53:51,334
(Goodness...)

1408
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:53,004
This is so annoying.

1409
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:54,075
(This is so annoying!)

1410
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:56,244
- I'm going to the restroom.
- Throw this away now.

1411
00:53:56,245 --> 00:53:58,175
Why did you take pictures of me looking like I'm three heads tall?

1412
00:53:58,415 --> 00:53:59,984
You should make me look tall.

1413
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:01,345
You're only three heads tall.

1414
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,384
You look three heads tall?

1415
00:54:03,385 --> 00:54:04,654
(You look 3 heads tall?)

1416
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:06,384
Who takes pictures from above like that?

1417
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:07,524
Take nice pictures of me.

1418
00:54:07,525 --> 00:54:08,624
- Hey.
- Make me look tall.

1419
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:09,625
This is how you look.

1420
00:54:09,626 --> 00:54:10,855
- What?
- This isn't how I look.

1421
00:54:10,895 --> 00:54:11,965
Seriously.

1422
00:54:12,225 --> 00:54:13,565
You should take pictures...

1423
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:15,165
- I'll use the restroom again.
- Okay.

1424
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,994
- Hurry back.
- I'll get changed.

1425
00:54:16,995 --> 00:54:18,535
(They move to the second filming location.)

1426
00:54:18,935 --> 00:54:21,505
Why did you leave this behind?

1427
00:54:22,405 --> 00:54:23,535
Did you leave this behind?

1428
00:54:24,605 --> 00:54:26,205
This is all you carry.

1429
00:54:26,405 --> 00:54:28,644
You carried this around.

1430
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:30,374
I gave it to you earlier to put it in your bag.

1431
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:31,715
- When?
- Earlier.

1432
00:54:32,045 --> 00:54:35,414
You gave me the phone.

1433
00:54:35,415 --> 00:54:37,314
Water is the only thing you give me.

1434
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,384
How could you leave it behind?

1435
00:54:38,385 --> 00:54:39,524
You said...

1436
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:40,784
you didn't want to drink water.

1437
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:42,454
- I didn't...
- I threw it away on purpose.

1438
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:43,925
I didn't want it so frequently.

1439
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:46,564
Where are we going? Jongno?

1440
00:54:46,565 --> 00:54:47,595
Yes.

1441
00:54:47,695 --> 00:54:50,665
Shall we go to Jongno?

1442
00:54:51,095 --> 00:54:54,265
Shall we go to Yeongdeungpo?

1443
00:54:54,705 --> 00:54:56,174
- Or - Did you drink alcohol?

1444
00:54:56,175 --> 00:54:57,475
- What?
- Did you drink alcohol?

1445
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:01,245
I'm just saying we should cheer up.

1446
00:55:01,605 --> 00:55:03,074
- Thank you.
- Right.

1447
00:55:03,075 --> 00:55:05,384
(Kwang Kyu's cheering song lifts My Star's mood.)

1448
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,184
(My Star's Schedule: 12:10pm, Filming 1 at Gangnam dress boutique)

1449
00:55:07,185 --> 00:55:08,344
How nice.

1450
00:55:08,345 --> 00:55:13,025
(3pm, Filming 2 at Jongno Art Center)

1451
00:55:15,525 --> 00:55:17,724
Could you help me with the lines?

1452
00:55:17,725 --> 00:55:19,425
You help her. Try a romantic scene.

1453
00:55:20,295 --> 00:55:21,425
Me?

1454
00:55:21,895 --> 00:55:23,034
You can do it.

1455
00:55:23,035 --> 00:55:24,434
It's going to be awkward.

1456
00:55:24,435 --> 00:55:25,865
(It's going to be awkward.)

1457
00:55:26,505 --> 00:55:28,464
Help her with the romantic scene.

1458
00:55:28,465 --> 00:55:29,504
- Should I?
- You also wanted to try it.

1459
00:55:29,505 --> 00:55:30,704
I wanted it.

1460
00:55:30,705 --> 00:55:32,044
You wanted a romantic scene with the female lead.

1461
00:55:32,045 --> 00:55:33,705
(It's his 1st romantic scene in his 30 years of acting.)

1462
00:55:33,775 --> 00:55:35,414
Have you ever heard the words, "I love you?"

1463
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,044
Why are you talking like that?

1464
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:39,315
- Of course, he has.
- It's been...

1465
00:55:40,215 --> 00:55:41,984
- so long since I last heard that.
- See?

1466
00:55:41,985 --> 00:55:43,014
It's been so long.

1467
00:55:43,015 --> 00:55:44,284
- About ten years...
- You don't even remember well.

1468
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:45,354
I don't remember...

1469
00:55:45,355 --> 00:55:46,484
(Kwang Kyu lacks the love genes.)

1470
00:55:46,485 --> 00:55:47,724
Why are you already nervous?

1471
00:55:47,725 --> 00:55:49,295
(Why are you already nervous?)

1472
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:51,854
I'll be doing the embarrassing parts.

1473
00:55:51,855 --> 00:55:53,295
- You would be fine.
- All right.

1474
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:54,895
("Efficient Dating for Singles")

1475
00:55:55,195 --> 00:55:56,764
(Scene 16, Dress boutique, early evening)

1476
00:55:56,765 --> 00:56:00,365
(Eui Young looks at the chair Tae Seop made.)

1477
00:56:00,635 --> 00:56:05,975
(It's written, "Title: The Lover's Chair.")

1478
00:56:06,775 --> 00:56:08,105
Cut.

1479
00:56:09,675 --> 00:56:12,244
So this is why you needed...

1480
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:13,544
my height and all.

1481
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:14,944
(So this is why you needed my height and all.)

1482
00:56:14,945 --> 00:56:16,185
Nodding.

1483
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:18,184
Don't say "nodding." Just say the lines.

1484
00:56:18,185 --> 00:56:19,885
Why are you so nervous?

1485
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:21,854
(Blushing)

1486
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:23,824
Why did you suddenly say "nodding?"

1487
00:56:23,825 --> 00:56:24,894
The directions...

1488
00:56:24,895 --> 00:56:26,664
- I...
- Don't read the directions.

1489
00:56:26,665 --> 00:56:28,325
- The directions.
- Just say the lines.

1490
00:56:29,335 --> 00:56:30,634
I think he's thirsty.

1491
00:56:30,635 --> 00:56:32,534
You won't be cast...

1492
00:56:32,535 --> 00:56:34,305
if you do it like this.

1493
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:36,374
You won't be able to act in the future.

1494
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,475
Act...

1495
00:56:38,035 --> 00:56:40,044
Just drive.

1496
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:41,175
Driver Lee.

1497
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:44,175
I'll do it again.

1498
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:51,685
So this is why you needed my height and all.

1499
00:56:52,925 --> 00:56:55,695
There are things I normally pay attention to when making chairs.

1500
00:56:56,325 --> 00:56:58,425
(Laughing)

1501
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,365
There are things I normally pay attention to when making chairs.

1502
00:57:01,825 --> 00:57:03,034
(Laughing)

1503
00:57:03,035 --> 00:57:04,464
- You're better than before.
- Why are you laughing?

1504
00:57:04,465 --> 00:57:06,004
Why do you keep laughing?

1505
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,805
There are things I normally pay attention to when making chairs.

1506
00:57:08,975 --> 00:57:11,034
Couldn't you...

1507
00:57:11,035 --> 00:57:12,775
say it naturally like that?

1508
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:15,575
(Speechless)

1509
00:57:15,715 --> 00:57:18,574
There are things I normally pay attention to when making chairs.

1510
00:57:18,575 --> 00:57:20,814
There are things I normally pay attention to when making chairs.

1511
00:57:20,815 --> 00:57:23,084
Whether it's structurally stable...

1512
00:57:23,085 --> 00:57:24,514
Whether it's structurally stable...

1513
00:57:24,515 --> 00:57:25,924
- What's next?
- and aesthetically pleasing.

1514
00:57:25,925 --> 00:57:27,485
And aesthetically pleasing.

1515
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:29,025
But this time,

1516
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:30,594
(He takes a breath.)

1517
00:57:30,595 --> 00:57:31,694
it was you.

1518
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:32,795
(But this time, it was you.)

1519
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:37,694
(Seo Genie is the best in romantic acting.)

1520
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:38,804
Right.

1521
00:57:38,805 --> 00:57:41,164
You should breathe a little in between.

1522
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:42,475
(You should breathe a little in between!)

1523
00:57:42,675 --> 00:57:43,775
Acting...

1524
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:45,875
I don't want to do this.

1525
00:57:46,205 --> 00:57:47,205
Why?

1526
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:48,874
Romance is really...

1527
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,045
You should give it a try.

1528
00:57:51,075 --> 00:57:53,184
Why are you suddenly trying to direct this?

1529
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:54,984
I'm telling you to help her practice her lines.

1530
00:57:54,985 --> 00:57:56,884
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

1531
00:57:56,885 --> 00:57:58,315
- Move on to the next line.
- Okay.

1532
00:57:58,655 --> 00:58:00,384
- Eui Young.
- Eui Young?

1533
00:58:00,385 --> 00:58:01,425
Yes?

1534
00:58:01,785 --> 00:58:04,125
I thought about you a lot.

1535
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:06,064
(He takes a break.)

1536
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,495
You and me.

1537
00:58:08,265 --> 00:58:10,935
That's why I made a pair of chairs.

1538
00:58:11,695 --> 00:58:12,704
(Thinking)

1539
00:58:12,705 --> 00:58:14,235
Then they're chairs of truth.

1540
00:58:14,865 --> 00:58:16,704
I'll sit there...

1541
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:19,375
and tell you everything honestly.

1542
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:23,675
Can I tell you my thoughts about the chairs?

1543
00:58:24,475 --> 00:58:25,515
What?

1544
00:58:25,685 --> 00:58:27,584
That makes me a bit nervous.

1545
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:29,415
(Breathing in)

1546
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:31,484
I love you.

1547
00:58:31,485 --> 00:58:32,485
(I love you.)

1548
00:58:33,185 --> 00:58:35,625
(I love you.)

1549
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:36,994
Pardon?

1550
00:58:36,995 --> 00:58:38,255
Pardon?

1551
00:58:38,525 --> 00:58:40,464
It feels like I got hit from behind.

1552
00:58:40,465 --> 00:58:43,735
It feels like she hit me by saying, "I love you."

1553
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:46,605
This is my first time doing this.

1554
00:58:49,105 --> 00:58:50,174
(Clearing his throat)

1555
00:58:50,175 --> 00:58:53,375
This is the best comment I've heard.

1556
00:58:54,205 --> 00:58:55,814
It's nice.

1557
00:58:55,815 --> 00:58:57,115
(It's nice.)

1558
00:58:58,475 --> 00:59:00,744
It was something I had never heard...

1559
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:02,515
from the female lead.

1560
00:59:03,115 --> 00:59:04,255
From then on,

1561
00:59:04,715 --> 00:59:05,824
my heart...

1562
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:07,425
started beating.

1563
00:59:09,825 --> 00:59:10,995
Would you like to film a romance movie?

1564
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:13,325
Would you like to film a romance movie?

1565
00:59:13,765 --> 00:59:14,894
A romance movie in which you're the male lead.

1566
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:16,235
(A romance movie? Me?)

1567
00:59:16,335 --> 00:59:18,834
I'd be thankful if you invest.

1568
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:20,234
(I'd be thankful if you invest.)

1569
00:59:20,235 --> 00:59:21,564
Do you want to film a romance movie?

1570
00:59:21,565 --> 00:59:23,075
Yes. I want to do that.

1571
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:25,675
Do you want to film a kissing scene?

1572
00:59:27,345 --> 00:59:28,705
More than a kissing scene.

1573
00:59:30,215 --> 00:59:32,145
Would you like to film a bed scene?

1574
00:59:33,545 --> 00:59:34,785
Yes!

1575
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:36,984
Can you go fully nude?

1576
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:39,024
Fully nude...

1577
00:59:39,025 --> 00:59:40,984
- Is that possible?
- Fully nude...

1578
00:59:40,985 --> 00:59:42,724
I don't know about that,

1579
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:45,894
but I can give it a try.

1580
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:47,825
(Ready to do anything)

1581
00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:50,694
We have to call them.

1582
00:59:50,695 --> 00:59:51,865
(They arrive at the second filming location in Jongno.)

1583
00:59:52,265 --> 00:59:54,634
(He gets My Star's chair.)

1584
00:59:54,635 --> 00:59:55,735
Please get the mirror out.

1585
00:59:55,835 --> 00:59:58,735
(He gets the mirror as well.)

1586
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:00,645
- Don't we need the lamp?
- This one?

1587
01:00:00,675 --> 01:00:01,774
Yes.

1588
01:00:01,775 --> 01:00:03,115
Put it on top.

1589
01:00:03,645 --> 01:00:06,284
(They get My Star's necessities...)

1590
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:08,114
(and head to the waiting room.)

1591
01:00:08,115 --> 01:00:09,455
There are many people.

1592
01:00:10,285 --> 01:00:11,815
(Bustling)

1593
01:00:12,555 --> 01:00:15,124
(It's a hectic and busy atmosphere on set.)

1594
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:16,324
The ending scene...

1595
01:00:16,325 --> 01:00:18,254
of the episode is really important today.

1596
01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:20,225
We'll be filming the ending scene of the episode.

1597
01:00:20,265 --> 01:00:21,624
- Drama...
- Yes.

1598
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:24,095
The staff of actor Park Sung Hoon.

1599
01:00:24,365 --> 01:00:26,534
(It's an important scene where the lead characters...)

1600
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:27,935
(confirm their love.)

1601
01:00:28,165 --> 01:00:31,435
(Since it's an important scene, the atmosphere is serious.)

1602
01:00:33,045 --> 01:00:34,175
Thank you.

1603
01:00:35,145 --> 01:00:37,544
- Do I make it stand like this?
- You can put it here.

1604
01:00:37,545 --> 01:00:38,675
Right.

1605
01:00:39,045 --> 01:00:40,114
Naturally.

1606
01:00:40,115 --> 01:00:41,915
(Grumpy Secretary is busy preparing for the filming.)

1607
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:43,714
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1608
01:00:43,715 --> 01:00:44,914
(So My Star can focus solely on her acting)

1609
01:00:44,915 --> 01:00:46,325
- Excuse me.
- Goodness.

1610
01:00:46,985 --> 01:00:48,224
- Goodness.
- Sung Hoon.

1611
01:00:48,225 --> 01:00:49,225
Right.

1612
01:00:49,226 --> 01:00:51,494
- I heard you're the managers.
- Goodness.

1613
01:00:51,495 --> 01:00:53,495
- Manager.
- Nice to meet you.

1614
01:00:53,795 --> 01:00:55,495
- Did you never meet before?
- I haven't met him before.

1615
01:00:55,565 --> 01:00:57,635
It's my first time seeing them both.

1616
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,695
Right.

1617
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:00,134
- Goodness.
- Come and sit.

1618
01:01:00,135 --> 01:01:01,265
Right.

1619
01:01:02,135 --> 01:01:04,104
Will they be with you until the end?

1620
01:01:04,105 --> 01:01:05,175
That's right.

1621
01:01:05,435 --> 01:01:06,444
He gave me so many...

1622
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:07,904
- acting directions today.
- Really?

1623
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:09,475
I'm so tired.

1624
01:01:09,615 --> 01:01:12,015
(Talking bad about her lover in her past life to her current lover.)

1625
01:01:12,515 --> 01:01:14,314
- It was hard for me as well.
- Right?

1626
01:01:14,315 --> 01:01:15,344
He was helping me with the lines,

1627
01:01:15,345 --> 01:01:16,854
- and he kept commenting.
- Right.

1628
01:01:16,855 --> 01:01:18,284
- He helped you with the lines?
- Yes.

1629
01:01:18,285 --> 01:01:19,324
He helped me with...

1630
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:21,284
"I love you."

1631
01:01:21,285 --> 01:01:23,194
(It's going to sound different.)

1632
01:01:23,195 --> 01:01:24,355
He was scolded.

1633
01:01:24,395 --> 01:01:25,625
Did you eat?

1634
01:01:25,865 --> 01:01:27,594
- I didn't.
- Would you like some gimbap?

1635
01:01:27,595 --> 01:01:29,035
I'm fine.

1636
01:01:29,135 --> 01:01:30,294
Are you also on a diet?

1637
01:01:30,295 --> 01:01:31,295
I am.

1638
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:33,164
You are? You're not skipping meals, are you?

1639
01:01:33,165 --> 01:01:34,504
I get bloated so easily.

1640
01:01:34,505 --> 01:01:36,234
I also controlled my eating yesterday.

1641
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:37,274
Really?

1642
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:39,345
I should have started way earlier.

1643
01:01:39,505 --> 01:01:40,875
The filming is almost done.

1644
01:01:41,505 --> 01:01:44,215
(The gimbap eater feels somewhat guilty.)

1645
01:01:44,475 --> 01:01:46,485
- We only have three episodes left.
- Please be on stand-by.

1646
01:01:46,715 --> 01:01:48,544
- I have to film one scene.
- Okay.

1647
01:01:48,545 --> 01:01:49,614
Go ahead.

1648
01:01:49,615 --> 01:01:50,884
Be careful.

1649
01:01:50,885 --> 01:01:52,925
(See you later, Grumpy Secretary.)

1650
01:01:52,985 --> 01:01:54,725
- You have to get your hair done.
- Shall we start?

1651
01:01:54,855 --> 01:01:56,025
Over there.

1652
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:57,454
Okay.

1653
01:01:57,455 --> 01:01:59,794
(My Star needs to get changed now.)

1654
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:02,295
(A moment later)

1655
01:02:02,565 --> 01:02:04,994
(My Star returns in a pure white dress.)

1656
01:02:04,995 --> 01:02:07,135
- Did we not decide on it yet?
- We didn't.

1657
01:02:08,335 --> 01:02:11,004
(Transforming into a romance queen...)

1658
01:02:11,005 --> 01:02:13,675
(who makes you want to ask her out)

1659
01:02:15,605 --> 01:02:18,745
(His heart skips a beat.)

1660
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:24,455
(His dormant romantic side comes back to life.)

1661
01:02:24,655 --> 01:02:27,255
(The queen is here.)

1662
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,554
(Next to Kwang Kyu who is wearing a proud smile...)

1663
01:02:29,555 --> 01:02:32,295
(is a man who looks bored.)

1664
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,865
(He's not so impressed.)

1665
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:37,635
I'm hungry now.

1666
01:02:38,895 --> 01:02:40,134
(Peeking)

1667
01:02:40,135 --> 01:02:42,164
- Please find a nice restaurant.
- Come again?

1668
01:02:42,165 --> 01:02:43,235
A nice restaurant.

1669
01:02:43,605 --> 01:02:47,444
(My Star asked to find a restaurant for the wrap-up party.)

1670
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:49,474
Something I can eat.

1671
01:02:49,475 --> 01:02:51,444
(But she can't eat carbohydrates that make her gain weight.)

1672
01:02:51,445 --> 01:02:52,585
Give me some candidates.

1673
01:02:53,015 --> 01:02:54,314
Then...

1674
01:02:54,315 --> 01:02:57,315
(He starts searching.)

1675
01:02:57,615 --> 01:02:59,924
- No sushi, right? It has rice.
- Sushi?

1676
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:02,055
- No sushi, right?
- How about soba?

1677
01:03:02,185 --> 01:03:04,154
- Soba?
- Buckwheat noodles.

1678
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,224
Buckwheat noodles?

1679
01:03:05,225 --> 01:03:06,665
It's nice,

1680
01:03:07,365 --> 01:03:08,894
but it'll digest...

1681
01:03:08,895 --> 01:03:11,664
- in 30 minutes. You'll get hungry.
- It's easy to digest?

1682
01:03:11,665 --> 01:03:13,734
- Sorry?
- You'll get hungry in 30 minutes.

1683
01:03:13,735 --> 01:03:14,765
(They disagree from the start.)

1684
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:17,405
I'll think about it when it happens. I like buckwheat.

1685
01:03:18,705 --> 01:03:19,705
How about kalguksu?

1686
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:21,544
- Rice noodles?
- Kalguksu.

1687
01:03:21,545 --> 01:03:22,875
- No.
- No?

1688
01:03:23,715 --> 01:03:25,174
How about whole chicken soup?

1689
01:03:25,175 --> 01:03:27,645
You're so annoying. Whole chicken soup?

1690
01:03:28,415 --> 01:03:30,184
You need to put noodles in it.

1691
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:31,454
- Can you eat it...
- You can just eat the meat.

1692
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:32,984
without noodles?

1693
01:03:32,985 --> 01:03:36,955
- You can eat just the meat.
- She wants to avoid flour and rice.

1694
01:03:37,895 --> 01:03:39,194
- Suyuk is fine.
- Sorry?

1695
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:41,625
- Suyuk.
- You'll want to eat kimchi with it.

1696
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:43,235
And you can't eat kimchi.

1697
01:03:43,535 --> 01:03:44,765
It's not that I can't eat it.

1698
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:47,205
Kimchi is really salty, though.

1699
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:49,634
No. It's a vegetable.

1700
01:03:49,635 --> 01:03:50,735
My gosh.

1701
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:53,705
If you're going to think that way, just eat anything.

1702
01:03:54,875 --> 01:03:57,075
I'm pretty picky. No soup.

1703
01:03:57,145 --> 01:03:59,684
Soup is better than salty food.

1704
01:03:59,685 --> 01:04:00,814
(Pouty)

1705
01:04:00,815 --> 01:04:01,944
I eat kimchi, though.

1706
01:04:01,945 --> 01:04:04,654
Kimchi is the worst when you're on a diet.

1707
01:04:04,655 --> 01:04:05,655
It's vegetable.

1708
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:07,725
You should eat raw vegetables then.

1709
01:04:07,755 --> 01:04:09,225
Do you want me to get you a cabbage?

1710
01:04:09,825 --> 01:04:13,024
(The siblings' heartwarming conversation...)

1711
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:17,165
(is interrupted by a familiar ringtone.)

1712
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:19,095
Yes, ma'am.

1713
01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:21,235
- The previous scene is over.
- Okay.

1714
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:24,134
Please come down at 20 when you're ready.

1715
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:26,404
- Got it.
- Okay.

1716
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:27,875
(My Star should stand by.)

1717
01:04:28,475 --> 01:04:29,515
Is it over?

1718
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:33,185
- You don't need it anymore?
- No.

1719
01:04:34,585 --> 01:04:38,615
(He organises it on his own.)

1720
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:41,825
Shall we go down first?

1721
01:04:41,855 --> 01:04:43,255
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1722
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:46,894
(They're going to the set, leaving Seo Jin behind.)

1723
01:04:46,895 --> 01:04:48,924
Can I hold your arm...

1724
01:04:48,925 --> 01:04:50,235
- Of course.
- just for a moment? Thank you.

1725
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:57,235
(Kwang Kyu is escorting her by himself.)

1726
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:04,345
(Seo Jin has escorted everyone so far.)

1727
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:07,084
(Holding hands)

1728
01:05:07,085 --> 01:05:08,814
- I'll collect feedback.
- Okay.

1729
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:09,985
One more to go, right?

1730
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:11,555
Yes, you're right.

1731
01:05:11,556 --> 01:05:14,524
(My Star is holding my arm.)

1732
01:05:14,525 --> 01:05:16,595
There are many stairs.

1733
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,754
- Be careful.
- I...

1734
01:05:18,755 --> 01:05:20,294
I think both of us fall easily.

1735
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:21,625
I know.

1736
01:05:21,895 --> 01:05:22,895
My goodness.

1737
01:05:22,896 --> 01:05:24,495
(They're getting along very well.)

1738
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:30,034
(Meanwhile, there's a man walking down the stairs with a chair.)

1739
01:05:30,035 --> 01:05:31,035
Where is Kwang Kyu?

1740
01:05:32,435 --> 01:05:33,544
Where did he go?

1741
01:05:33,545 --> 01:05:36,774
(He's still not used to the switched roles.)

1742
01:05:36,775 --> 01:05:40,084
(He does everything he needs to do even though he complains.)

1743
01:05:40,085 --> 01:05:41,085
(Sighing)

1744
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:47,324
(Since morning, he's been driving around...)

1745
01:05:47,325 --> 01:05:50,894
(and running all kinds of errands for My Star.)

1746
01:05:50,895 --> 01:05:54,824
(He complained from time to time.)

1747
01:05:54,825 --> 01:06:00,304
(But he becomes obedient around his natural enemy, Ji Min.)

1748
01:06:00,305 --> 01:06:02,674
- Eui Young has come.
- Okay.

1749
01:06:02,675 --> 01:06:03,675
(Meanwhile, My Star gets to the set.)

1750
01:06:03,676 --> 01:06:04,705
This way, please.

1751
01:06:05,435 --> 01:06:09,815
(They're about to shoot the ending scene of a major episode.)

1752
01:06:10,045 --> 01:06:12,944
(I love you.)

1753
01:06:12,945 --> 01:06:14,244
(What?)

1754
01:06:14,245 --> 01:06:15,745
What?

1755
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:20,455
(The practice that made Kwang Kyu's heart flutter)

1756
01:06:23,625 --> 01:06:27,565
(She'll make a sweet confession of love.)

1757
01:06:28,165 --> 01:06:29,494
Yes. So...

1758
01:06:29,495 --> 01:06:31,765
Kwang Kyu practised with me a lot.

1759
01:06:33,435 --> 01:06:34,505
I'm sorry.

1760
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:38,105
I heard her say "I love you" first. I'm sorry.

1761
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:41,375
(He stole my love.)

1762
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:43,745
- I'll pop into the restroom.
- Okay.

1763
01:06:43,775 --> 01:06:45,445
I'll stand here instead.

1764
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:49,045
(Acting coy)

1765
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,455
What's with this two shot?

1766
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:52,615
I want to film it.

1767
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:57,594
(The two shot that inspires him)

1768
01:06:57,595 --> 01:07:01,465
Shall we start a rehearsal?

1769
01:07:03,665 --> 01:07:06,264
- I'm sorry.
- Yes. Let's do a rehearsal.

1770
01:07:06,265 --> 01:07:07,565
(Handing the script)

1771
01:07:08,405 --> 01:07:11,834
(The genre has suddenly changed.)

1772
01:07:11,835 --> 01:07:12,845
I'm sorry.

1773
01:07:13,005 --> 01:07:14,275
Shall we do it?

1774
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:15,974
Cue for rehearsal.

1775
01:07:15,975 --> 01:07:17,245
(The rehearsal begins for real.)

1776
01:07:18,715 --> 01:07:20,615
This is the chair of truth.

1777
01:07:20,845 --> 01:07:23,954
I'll sit there and say everything honestly.

1778
01:07:23,955 --> 01:07:24,955
(It suddenly became noir.)

1779
01:07:25,115 --> 01:07:28,855
So, can I share my thoughts on the chair?

1780
01:07:30,025 --> 01:07:31,324
I'm nervous.

1781
01:07:31,325 --> 01:07:33,065
(Terrified)

1782
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:35,664
(Did he summon the wrong soul?)

1783
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:36,764
I love you.

1784
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:40,164
(I love you.)

1785
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:42,665
(Crying)

1786
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,034
I said I love you.

1787
01:07:44,035 --> 01:07:45,735
(A wild confession of love)

1788
01:07:46,245 --> 01:07:48,174
("Chair of Truth," the end)

1789
01:07:48,175 --> 01:07:49,245
I love you.

1790
01:07:49,945 --> 01:07:50,945
It's crazy.

1791
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,115
(Very satisfied)

1792
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:53,885
- Okay. So this is how it goes.
- Yes.

1793
01:07:54,285 --> 01:07:55,615
I'm sweating.

1794
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:57,155
I'm sweating.

1795
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,414
(A lasting impression)

1796
01:07:58,415 --> 01:07:59,624
There's no kiss scene, right?

1797
01:07:59,625 --> 01:08:01,325
There's no kiss scene.

1798
01:08:01,485 --> 01:08:02,555
Okay.

1799
01:08:03,695 --> 01:08:05,494
(Acting in a brief romantic scene reignited his passion for acting.)

1800
01:08:05,495 --> 01:08:07,294
Yes. Okay.

1801
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,864
- So...
- Right.

1802
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:10,435
- We're done with the rehearsal.
- Yes.

1803
01:08:11,035 --> 01:08:13,165
- Thank you.
- I said, "I love you."

1804
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:14,765
Were you okay? Was he good?

1805
01:08:17,305 --> 01:08:18,334
Okay. Here we go.

1806
01:08:18,335 --> 01:08:20,504
(They begin filming the confession scene for the ending.)

1807
01:08:20,505 --> 01:08:21,904
If you're not ready...

1808
01:08:21,905 --> 01:08:23,474
- One, two.
- Cue.

1809
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:24,575
(Ready, action.)

1810
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:28,715
That's why you needed to know...

1811
01:08:29,615 --> 01:08:31,185
my height and stuff.

1812
01:08:34,455 --> 01:08:36,824
There's something I pay attention to when I...

1813
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:41,694
(Grumpy Secretary is quietly watching behind My Star.)

1814
01:08:41,695 --> 01:08:43,895
(Having done this before, he feels relaxed.)

1815
01:08:44,365 --> 01:08:45,535
Speaking of which,

1816
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:48,704
can I say what I think about the chair?

1817
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:49,705
(It's finally time to say...)

1818
01:08:49,706 --> 01:08:53,304
(the most important line.)

1819
01:08:53,305 --> 01:08:54,305
I love you.

1820
01:08:54,306 --> 01:08:57,975
(I love you.)

1821
01:08:59,215 --> 01:09:03,314
(He's watching her acting up close for the 1st time in 20 years.)

1822
01:09:03,315 --> 01:09:04,415
Ji Min...

1823
01:09:05,485 --> 01:09:09,055
She's been acting for over 20 years.

1824
01:09:09,225 --> 01:09:12,395
She's still impressive among people her age.

1825
01:09:12,655 --> 01:09:15,995
It's impressive how long she's stayed active.

1826
01:09:16,965 --> 01:09:18,064
I should acknowledge her for that.

1827
01:09:18,065 --> 01:09:21,135
(Seo Jin always feels proud of her even though he doesn't express it.)

1828
01:09:21,435 --> 01:09:23,874
- Cut. It was nice. Okay.
- Okay.

1829
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:26,604
(My Star's acting was perfect.)

1830
01:09:26,605 --> 01:09:27,675
- It was nice.
- Yes.

1831
01:09:30,475 --> 01:09:31,514
It was good.

1832
01:09:31,515 --> 01:09:33,014
(A short break after a great performance)

1833
01:09:33,015 --> 01:09:36,115
- My gosh.
- Stand up.

1834
01:09:36,355 --> 01:09:40,585
(The respect is over. A familiar scene begins again.)

1835
01:09:40,855 --> 01:09:41,925
I'm so hungry.

1836
01:09:44,325 --> 01:09:46,194
- I'm hungry.
- Come again?

1837
01:09:46,195 --> 01:09:47,995
- I'm hungry.
- You must be hungry.

1838
01:09:48,665 --> 01:09:49,795
You aren't hungry, are you?

1839
01:09:49,965 --> 01:09:51,264
- Sorry?
- Are you hungry?

1840
01:09:51,265 --> 01:09:52,494
I don't like bananas.

1841
01:09:52,495 --> 01:09:53,804
(The remaining emergency food is just bananas.)

1842
01:09:53,805 --> 01:09:55,305
It's for Ji Min.

1843
01:09:55,665 --> 01:09:58,135
I'm hungry, but I had a banana earlier.

1844
01:10:00,145 --> 01:10:02,005
- Do you want something else?
- Like what?

1845
01:10:02,305 --> 01:10:03,415
- Like a convenience store.
- Sounds good.

1846
01:10:03,945 --> 01:10:05,715
- What will you get?
- Do you want some chocolate?

1847
01:10:06,315 --> 01:10:07,985
Get dark chocolate then.

1848
01:10:08,745 --> 01:10:10,655
Do you eat dark chocolate? Because it doesn't have sugar?

1849
01:10:10,885 --> 01:10:12,584
- Like 100 percent cacao?
- You know what it is, right?

1850
01:10:12,585 --> 01:10:13,885
- Dark chocolate?
- Yes.

1851
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:17,355
(He quickly arrives at the nearby convenience store.)

1852
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:21,294
(He picks up chocolate as soon as he walks in.)

1853
01:10:21,295 --> 01:10:23,994
(He grabs a similar one.)

1854
01:10:23,995 --> 01:10:27,364
(He chose a snack for Ji Min without a second thought.)

1855
01:10:27,365 --> 01:10:28,635
I'm hungry.

1856
01:10:30,305 --> 01:10:32,875
(Feeling hungry, he's walking around in front of the fridge.)

1857
01:10:33,305 --> 01:10:36,175
(Scanning carefully)

1858
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:39,314
(After thinking for a long time, he picks a sandwich...)

1859
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:42,584
(and milk.)

1860
01:10:42,585 --> 01:10:45,114
(He ended up buying more snacks for himself than for her.)

1861
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,215
Can I have the receipt?

1862
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:48,884
- Let's do it.
- Okay. Ready.

1863
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:50,524
(Meanwhile, they're almost done with the ending scene.)

1864
01:10:50,525 --> 01:10:51,724
One, two, three.

1865
01:10:51,725 --> 01:10:53,464
(He goes back to the set quietly.)

1866
01:10:53,465 --> 01:10:54,495
Kwang Kyu.

1867
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:56,835
Kwang Kyu.

1868
01:10:58,665 --> 01:11:03,075
(Seo Jin secretly calls Kwang Kyu.)

1869
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:04,435
Do you want to try this?

1870
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:05,974
What is it?

1871
01:11:05,975 --> 01:11:08,744
(Behind the scenes of a romance drama, )

1872
01:11:08,745 --> 01:11:09,745
(a secret bromance unfolds.)

1873
01:11:09,746 --> 01:11:11,175
Let me sit. My legs hurt.

1874
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:15,614
- Try it.
- My gosh.

1875
01:11:15,615 --> 01:11:17,585
I shouldn't eat a lot.

1876
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,315
I'll gain weight.

1877
01:11:19,885 --> 01:11:22,385
(Saying one thing and doing another)

1878
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:24,294
- Is this...
- What?

1879
01:11:24,295 --> 01:11:25,554
Is this for you?

1880
01:11:25,555 --> 01:11:26,765
(Eating)

1881
01:11:27,095 --> 01:11:30,135
(Showing his dimples in satisfaction)

1882
01:11:30,435 --> 01:11:31,594
I love you.

1883
01:11:31,595 --> 01:11:33,604
(I love you.)

1884
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:34,704
(I love the sandwich.)

1885
01:11:34,705 --> 01:11:36,305
One, two, three. Cue.

1886
01:11:37,305 --> 01:11:40,545
(It seems eating bread made his throat feel dry.)

1887
01:11:40,775 --> 01:11:42,404
Why is it so good?

1888
01:11:42,405 --> 01:11:44,674
(Gulping)

1889
01:11:44,675 --> 01:11:45,675
(Gurgling)

1890
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,385
Please be quiet.

1891
01:11:48,015 --> 01:11:50,814
(His gulping was too loud.)

1892
01:11:50,815 --> 01:11:53,325
Please stay as quiet as possible from now on!

1893
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:56,494
- Please be quiet.
- Okay.

1894
01:11:56,495 --> 01:11:58,725
(- Please be quiet!
- Okay.)

1895
01:11:58,825 --> 01:12:00,295
One, two, three. Cue.

1896
01:12:01,395 --> 01:12:06,135
(He's eating the sandwich quietly.)

1897
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:09,505
(He thinks what he's doing is funny too.)

1898
01:12:09,905 --> 01:12:13,045
(Eating the sandwich without a word)

1899
01:12:13,405 --> 01:12:17,414
(At an average age of 55.5, a mere sandwich brings them great joy.)

1900
01:12:17,415 --> 01:12:18,945
Why is this so good?

1901
01:12:19,245 --> 01:12:21,685
(He's gulping carefully.)

1902
01:12:21,715 --> 01:12:24,015
Manager Lee!

1903
01:12:25,655 --> 01:12:30,595
(Oh, no)

1904
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:34,695
(Destructing evidence)

1905
01:12:35,065 --> 01:12:36,264
Assistant Manager Lee!

1906
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:37,894
(He quickly wipes his mouth...)

1907
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:42,065
(and acts like nothing happened.)

1908
01:12:42,765 --> 01:12:44,604
- What did you guys eat?
- Sorry?

1909
01:12:44,605 --> 01:12:45,734
What did you eat?

1910
01:12:45,735 --> 01:12:47,244
- What did you guys eat?
- Sorry?

1911
01:12:47,245 --> 01:12:48,304
What did you eat?

1912
01:12:48,305 --> 01:12:49,344
I just rinsed my mouth.

1913
01:12:49,345 --> 01:12:51,175
- Don't lie.
- I brushed my teeth.

1914
01:12:51,975 --> 01:12:52,975
- What did you eat?
- I said I hadn't eaten.

1915
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:54,185
- What?
- What did you eat?

1916
01:12:54,485 --> 01:12:56,684
(It's suspicious.)

1917
01:12:56,685 --> 01:12:58,915
He had two containers of gimbap.

1918
01:12:59,055 --> 01:13:01,025
He had two containers of gimbap.

1919
01:13:01,225 --> 01:13:02,924
It's suspicious. There must be something.

1920
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:04,154
Is this all?

1921
01:13:04,155 --> 01:13:05,355
(An unexpected search)

1922
01:13:05,655 --> 01:13:09,125
(She found a trash bag they hadn't managed to dispose of.)

1923
01:13:09,995 --> 01:13:13,134
You ate a sandwich.

1924
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:15,264
(You ate a sandwich!)

1925
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,575
(Showing the evidence)

1926
01:13:17,735 --> 01:13:18,774
Kwang Kyu, when did you eat it?

1927
01:13:18,775 --> 01:13:21,275
- You said you only eat once a day.
- Hey.

1928
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:22,544
This is unbelievable.

1929
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:24,414
- I didn't eat it.
- I didn't even ask,

1930
01:13:24,415 --> 01:13:26,175
- but he went to grab a snack.
- Yes.

1931
01:13:26,415 --> 01:13:27,645
I went to the restroom.

1932
01:13:28,215 --> 01:13:29,715
You ate the sandwich with him, didn't you?

1933
01:13:30,255 --> 01:13:32,154
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1934
01:13:32,155 --> 01:13:33,854
- I'm hungry.
- Let's go and eat something nice.

1935
01:13:33,855 --> 01:13:34,855
(Only My Star is hungry when the shoot is over.)

1936
01:13:35,085 --> 01:13:36,894
It smells good.

1937
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:38,995
- My Star is here.
- Here we go.

1938
01:13:39,555 --> 01:13:40,894
(Escorting My Star perfectly as always)

1939
01:13:40,895 --> 01:13:42,265
Good job.

1940
01:13:43,135 --> 01:13:44,334
Are we going there?

1941
01:13:44,335 --> 01:13:45,635
We're going to the restaurant, right?

1942
01:13:47,905 --> 01:13:49,265
My legs hurt.

1943
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:50,605
Your legs hurt, right?

1944
01:13:50,805 --> 01:13:53,775
You've been standing for too long. You must be tired.

1945
01:13:54,645 --> 01:13:55,875
I'm fine.

1946
01:13:59,245 --> 01:14:01,085
(Vibrating)

1947
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:02,515
Can I pick up my phone?

1948
01:14:03,515 --> 01:14:05,354
- Of course, you can.
- It's an unknown number.

1949
01:14:05,355 --> 01:14:06,755
(My Star got a mysterious call.)

1950
01:14:07,055 --> 01:14:08,925
- Ji Min.
- Hi.

1951
01:14:09,725 --> 01:14:11,955
Ro Ma, I'm filming in the car.

1952
01:14:12,195 --> 01:14:13,464
- Who is it?
- He's over 180cm.

1953
01:14:13,465 --> 01:14:14,594
- It's her nephew.
- Her nephew?

1954
01:14:14,595 --> 01:14:16,994
- Yes.
- Yes. He lives in Australia.

1955
01:14:16,995 --> 01:14:18,235
(My Star's nephew lives in Australia.)

1956
01:14:18,735 --> 01:14:20,064
You're filming in a car?

1957
01:14:20,065 --> 01:14:22,005
Yes. There are so many cameras.

1958
01:14:22,135 --> 01:14:24,535
Do you know Lee Seo Jin?

1959
01:14:25,035 --> 01:14:29,045
He starred in the same drama as me.

1960
01:14:29,645 --> 01:14:31,915
Kwang Kyu, can you show your face once?

1961
01:14:31,975 --> 01:14:35,444
- Do you know this uncle?
- Hi.

1962
01:14:35,445 --> 01:14:36,785
It seems he knows.

1963
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:37,914
- Do you know him?
- Hello.

1964
01:14:37,915 --> 01:14:39,614
Hi. What does your father do?

1965
01:14:39,615 --> 01:14:41,185
"What does your father do?"

1966
01:14:41,485 --> 01:14:42,654
I think he knows.

1967
01:14:42,655 --> 01:14:44,395
- He covered his mouth.
- Do you know him, Ro Ma?

1968
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:46,054
I know him.

1969
01:14:46,055 --> 01:14:48,295
How about this man?

1970
01:14:49,995 --> 01:14:51,295
I can't see his face.

1971
01:14:51,735 --> 01:14:53,765
- How about him?
- He grew up this much?

1972
01:14:54,035 --> 01:14:55,134
- Do you know him?
- He grew this much?

1973
01:14:55,135 --> 01:14:56,265
He grew a lot. He's a ninth grader.

1974
01:14:56,435 --> 01:14:58,005
- Oh, my.
- He's over 180cm now.

1975
01:14:59,105 --> 01:15:00,805
They came to the drama set...

1976
01:15:00,975 --> 01:15:03,915
to help me as my manager.

1977
01:15:04,645 --> 01:15:07,215
- I love you.
- Uncle loves you too.

1978
01:15:07,615 --> 01:15:08,684
You should say it back.

1979
01:15:08,685 --> 01:15:10,614
- Thank you.
- He said, "Thank you."

1980
01:15:10,615 --> 01:15:11,615
(He's cute.)

1981
01:15:11,655 --> 01:15:13,255
Thank you so much.

1982
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:15,684
Kwang Kyu, do you want to talk with him in English?

1983
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:16,725
No.

1984
01:15:17,255 --> 01:15:19,095
- You've been speaking English.
- No.

1985
01:15:19,155 --> 01:15:20,424
- He's going to kill it.
- Are you okay with that?

1986
01:15:20,425 --> 01:15:21,425
Gosh.

1987
01:15:21,426 --> 01:15:22,694
Ro Ma, can you ask him a question...

1988
01:15:22,695 --> 01:15:23,965
- in English?
- In English?

1989
01:15:24,765 --> 01:15:26,134
(Nervous)

1990
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:27,304
Can you speak English?

1991
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:29,805
Yes. Okay. Let's start.

1992
01:15:30,505 --> 01:15:32,804
Yes. Okay. Let's start.

1993
01:15:32,805 --> 01:15:33,874
(Kwang Kyu's fluent English surprised Ro Ma.)

1994
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:36,275
Hi, how are you? Thank you, and you?

1995
01:15:36,445 --> 01:15:38,675
Hey. Your father's job.

1996
01:15:39,545 --> 01:15:41,014
(He spits out English words so he won't have to answer.)

1997
01:15:41,015 --> 01:15:42,845
You're just talking without even listening.

1998
01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:45,215
Ro Ma, ask him something else.

1999
01:15:46,185 --> 01:15:47,825
What's your hobby?

2000
01:15:48,185 --> 01:15:49,525
"Hobby?" What is it in Korean?

2001
01:15:49,725 --> 01:15:51,795
- Hobby.
- Oh, hobby.

2002
01:15:51,855 --> 01:15:56,195
I... My hobbies are salsa and tango.

2003
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,434
- Salsa?
- Yes.

2004
01:15:58,435 --> 01:16:00,065
Ro Ma, do you know what salsa is?

2005
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:01,905
He's laughing a lot.

2006
01:16:01,965 --> 01:16:03,064
(Feeling proud)

2007
01:16:03,065 --> 01:16:04,535
Hee Jae, do you have any questions?

2008
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:08,905
Ask him a question in English. He can speak English.

2009
01:16:09,915 --> 01:16:11,445
Are you good at soccer?

2010
01:16:12,275 --> 01:16:13,385
Say it again.

2011
01:16:15,315 --> 01:16:17,155
Are you good at soccer?

2012
01:16:18,485 --> 01:16:19,655
Iron...

2013
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:21,525
"Are you good at soccer?" That's what she said.

2014
01:16:23,085 --> 01:16:25,094
No, thank you. I'm sorry.

2015
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,325
(Laughing awkwardly)

2016
01:16:26,895 --> 01:16:28,865
Short needle.

2017
01:16:29,295 --> 01:16:30,695
It's so embarrassing, Ji Min.

2018
01:16:30,995 --> 01:16:32,835
- I...
- I'm embarrassed.

2019
01:16:33,805 --> 01:16:36,165
The conversation went quite smoothly, right?

2020
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,234
Yes.

2021
01:16:38,235 --> 01:16:39,305
- "Conversation."
- Yes.

2022
01:16:39,945 --> 01:16:41,244
Okay, Hee Jae.

2023
01:16:41,245 --> 01:16:43,145
I'll call you again later.

2024
01:16:43,205 --> 01:16:45,075
Bye.

2025
01:16:45,475 --> 01:16:47,014
(My Star's schedule, Time: 7:30pm, Location: Restaurant)

2026
01:16:47,015 --> 01:16:48,215
Let's eat.

2027
01:16:49,145 --> 01:16:50,215
It must be delicious.

2028
01:16:50,415 --> 01:16:51,884
It looks like a famous place.

2029
01:16:51,885 --> 01:16:53,984
(Grumpy Secretaries carefully chose the place for My Star.)

2030
01:16:53,985 --> 01:16:55,025
It must be nice.

2031
01:16:57,625 --> 01:16:59,694
(Glancing)

2032
01:16:59,695 --> 01:17:01,294
(My Star is reading the menu, hungry.)

2033
01:17:01,295 --> 01:17:02,665
"Lunch special."

2034
01:17:04,095 --> 01:17:06,295
Did you say you would order eobok jaengban earlier?

2035
01:17:06,595 --> 01:17:09,005
Yes. It sounds delicious.

2036
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:12,134
Do you mostly eat once a day?

2037
01:17:12,135 --> 01:17:14,905
No. It's just that...

2038
01:17:15,075 --> 01:17:17,245
I have to do dress fittings again this week.

2039
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:20,045
It's the last one. That's why I eat once a day.

2040
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:23,185
- Women are so... Come again?
- If it only didn't show my belly...

2041
01:17:23,355 --> 01:17:25,984
If it only didn't show my belly, I'd be able to cover it.

2042
01:17:25,985 --> 01:17:28,185
But it shows my sides.

2043
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:32,425
If I go on the red carpet in a dress without side slits,

2044
01:17:32,655 --> 01:17:34,765
take it as me giving up.

2045
01:17:35,195 --> 01:17:36,995
So how did you...

2046
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:40,135
(A few days later on the Blue Dragon Film Awards red carpet)

2047
01:17:40,965 --> 01:17:44,275
(My Star appeared in a striking, revealing dress.)

2048
01:17:44,905 --> 01:17:47,845
(She successfully managed her weight.)

2049
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,515
We should go live.

2050
01:17:51,175 --> 01:17:52,514
We should go live.

2051
01:17:52,515 --> 01:17:54,445
(Why do we have to go live out of nowhere?)

2052
01:17:54,585 --> 01:17:56,145
You don't have an Instagram account, do you?

2053
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:57,915
I don't even have a messenger.

2054
01:17:58,915 --> 01:18:00,325
Why would I have an Instagram account?

2055
01:18:00,625 --> 01:18:02,124
- You don't have one either, right?
- Sorry?

2056
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:03,184
Do you have an Instagram account?

2057
01:18:03,185 --> 01:18:05,324
I have one.

2058
01:18:05,325 --> 01:18:06,624
Do you know you can go live on Instagram?

2059
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:08,024
- Of course, I do.
- I'm sorry.

2060
01:18:08,025 --> 01:18:09,264
I have an account.

2061
01:18:09,265 --> 01:18:10,564
We're going live now.

2062
01:18:10,565 --> 01:18:11,965
Should we stay quiet?

2063
01:18:12,065 --> 01:18:15,534
No, you should say hi too.

2064
01:18:15,535 --> 01:18:16,564
(My Star asked him to go live together.)

2065
01:18:16,565 --> 01:18:17,905
- It's...
- What?

2066
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:20,545
Hello.

2067
01:18:20,745 --> 01:18:23,474
I'm going to a radio show.

2068
01:18:23,475 --> 01:18:26,645
(My Star goes live quite often.)

2069
01:18:27,515 --> 01:18:30,985
It was my birthday not long ago, and fans sent me many gifts.

2070
01:18:31,115 --> 01:18:32,914
So I want to go live to thank them.

2071
01:18:32,915 --> 01:18:34,025
Let me do it.

2072
01:18:34,325 --> 01:18:35,484
Hello.

2073
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:36,584
(The live broadcast is starting.)

2074
01:18:36,585 --> 01:18:37,795
Can you hear me?

2075
01:18:39,795 --> 01:18:42,125
It's Sunday night. What are you doing?

2076
01:18:42,895 --> 01:18:45,235
(- Oh, my gosh.
- I missed you!)

2077
01:18:45,795 --> 01:18:47,565
- A while ago, - I think it's broken.

2078
01:18:47,705 --> 01:18:49,534
- I think it's out of order.
- I wanted to thank you...

2079
01:18:49,535 --> 01:18:52,005
for all the birthday wishes...

2080
01:18:52,435 --> 01:18:55,975
and say hi. That's why I went live for the first time in a while.

2081
01:18:57,175 --> 01:18:58,675
How many people are watching?

2082
01:18:58,775 --> 01:19:00,284
For now, around 2,550.

2083
01:19:00,285 --> 01:19:01,745
Around 2,550?

2084
01:19:01,985 --> 01:19:03,915
You've still got it.

2085
01:19:05,015 --> 01:19:07,285
I came to have dinner in the middle of filming.

2086
01:19:08,825 --> 01:19:11,295
I'd like to introduce someone today.

2087
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:13,794
I'd like to introduce someone today.

2088
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:15,494
I'll show you.

2089
01:19:15,495 --> 01:19:16,894
(The 2 live broadcast beginners are ready to appear.)

2090
01:19:16,895 --> 01:19:18,135
(Zooming in)

2091
01:19:18,435 --> 01:19:19,835
You're appearing.

2092
01:19:20,905 --> 01:19:22,635
- Me?
- Say hi.

2093
01:19:23,365 --> 01:19:26,004
- To whom?
- Wave your hand like this.

2094
01:19:26,005 --> 01:19:27,505
To the fans.

2095
01:19:28,545 --> 01:19:29,575
Yes.

2096
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:32,544
Hello.

2097
01:19:32,545 --> 01:19:35,285
(Hello)

2098
01:19:35,385 --> 01:19:37,614
- You should greet happily like him.
- Yes.

2099
01:19:37,615 --> 01:19:39,815
(His face got stiff as it's live.)

2100
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:41,724
(- It's Grumpy Secretary.
- Oh, my. )

2101
01:19:41,725 --> 01:19:43,425
(- Nice to see you guys.
- Managers!)

2102
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:48,325
They're my new managers.

2103
01:19:49,265 --> 01:19:51,695
(He's staring at the screen without a word.)

2104
01:19:52,435 --> 01:19:55,205
This is a live broadcast. You can speak.

2105
01:19:56,435 --> 01:19:58,775
I don't talk much during live streams.

2106
01:19:58,835 --> 01:20:00,644
- You don't talk much?
- It's often inappropriate.

2107
01:20:00,645 --> 01:20:01,745
Oh, right.

2108
01:20:01,775 --> 01:20:03,305
They're asking me to make you suffer.

2109
01:20:03,715 --> 01:20:05,115
Can you see it? "Make them suffer."

2110
01:20:05,715 --> 01:20:08,145
(Make them suffer.)

2111
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:12,785
- I hope they leave.
- Did you read it?

2112
01:20:12,915 --> 01:20:14,424
- Come again?
- I hope they leave.

2113
01:20:14,425 --> 01:20:15,625
He wants you to leave...

2114
01:20:15,825 --> 01:20:16,825
- the chat room.
- You're good.

2115
01:20:16,826 --> 01:20:17,924
(He sweetly asks them to leave.)

2116
01:20:17,925 --> 01:20:19,124
You're good.

2117
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:20,524
You're good at live broadcasts.

2118
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:22,565
(He's communicating better than expected.)

2119
01:20:22,625 --> 01:20:25,694
What should I...

2120
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,705
ask the managers...

2121
01:20:28,265 --> 01:20:31,535
to do?

2122
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:34,674
Yes. They're my managers.

2123
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:35,905
(They're immersed in the communication.)

2124
01:20:37,475 --> 01:20:38,475
(Make an acrostic poem using "Han Ji Min.")

2125
01:20:38,476 --> 01:20:40,214
They want you to make an acrostic poem using "Han Ji Min."

2126
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:41,715
An acrostic poem using "Han Ji Min."

2127
01:20:41,845 --> 01:20:42,885
H.

2128
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:45,284
(Live)

2129
01:20:45,285 --> 01:20:47,685
(Is he going to do it when 2,600 people are watching?)

2130
01:20:47,785 --> 01:20:48,925
Okay. H.

2131
01:20:50,125 --> 01:20:51,395
Han Ji Min's.

2132
01:20:51,795 --> 01:20:53,055
Han Ji Min's.

2133
01:20:53,225 --> 01:20:55,125
- Han Ji Min's.
- Han Ji Min's.

2134
01:20:55,265 --> 01:20:56,895
J.

2135
01:20:57,235 --> 01:20:58,395
Joyful friend.

2136
01:20:58,895 --> 01:21:01,135
- M.
- Mr. Bald, Kim Kwang Kyu.

2137
01:21:02,265 --> 01:21:03,704
Mr. Bald, Kim Kwang Kyu.

2138
01:21:03,705 --> 01:21:05,635
(What?)

2139
01:21:06,005 --> 01:21:08,305
(My Star and her 2,600 fans are impressed.)

2140
01:21:08,605 --> 01:21:11,375
Hey, that's the only thing you can think of?

2141
01:21:12,575 --> 01:21:13,714
- I knew it.
- Hey.

2142
01:21:13,715 --> 01:21:15,245
(He teased his bald friend out of nowhere.)

2143
01:21:15,645 --> 01:21:17,985
(Anyway, he successfully made an acrostic poem.)

2144
01:21:18,315 --> 01:21:22,085
We're going to eat soon, so we'll say goodbye now.

2145
01:21:22,955 --> 01:21:24,455
Please watch My Grumpy Secretary.

2146
01:21:25,325 --> 01:21:26,525
Say goodbye.

2147
01:21:27,295 --> 01:21:29,295
(Bye)

2148
01:21:30,335 --> 01:21:32,034
Thank you so much.

2149
01:21:32,035 --> 01:21:33,735
(Grumpy Secretaries are communicating quite naturally now.)

2150
01:21:34,365 --> 01:21:35,564
Thank you.

2151
01:21:35,565 --> 01:21:38,434
Have a great evening. Bye.

2152
01:21:38,435 --> 01:21:39,475
(The live stream was a success.)

2153
01:21:39,575 --> 01:21:41,205
Oh, the food is here.

2154
01:21:43,005 --> 01:21:45,215
- Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal.

2155
01:21:46,215 --> 01:21:47,514
(Filled with delicious beef shank, green onions, and cilantro)

2156
01:21:47,515 --> 01:21:49,044
- Should I add more?
- Yes.

2157
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:51,115
- Can you eat cilantro?
- I love it.

2158
01:21:51,315 --> 01:21:52,985
Hold this.

2159
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:54,985
I'll enjoy the food.

2160
01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:56,484
It looks delicious.

2161
01:21:56,485 --> 01:21:59,255
(Eobok jaengban with warm broth, beef, and vegetables)

2162
01:21:59,825 --> 01:22:01,295
Can I eat this?

2163
01:22:01,495 --> 01:22:03,594
You can, but mix it well first.

2164
01:22:03,595 --> 01:22:05,564
- Should I mix everything?
- Of course.

2165
01:22:05,565 --> 01:22:06,595
- Mix it all.
- Okay.

2166
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:09,764
You do it. Why are you making me do it?

2167
01:22:09,765 --> 01:22:11,074
She's right. You do it.

2168
01:22:11,075 --> 01:22:13,035
I heard you bullied her during "Lee San, Wind of the Palace."

2169
01:22:13,075 --> 01:22:14,645
- Me?
- Yes.

2170
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:16,645
I didn't bully Ji Min.

2171
01:22:16,905 --> 01:22:18,474
No wonder she gnashes her teeth...

2172
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:19,875
at the mere mention of you.

2173
01:22:21,715 --> 01:22:22,814
Come on.

2174
01:22:22,815 --> 01:22:23,885
You're right.

2175
01:22:24,515 --> 01:22:26,154
Bon appetit.

2176
01:22:26,155 --> 01:22:28,355
- Great work today.
- Great work.

2177
01:22:31,955 --> 01:22:33,054
(Impressed)

2178
01:22:33,055 --> 01:22:37,594
(A tasty meal during her self-care week)

2179
01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:38,865
- It's so good.
- Let's boil it.

2180
01:22:42,735 --> 01:22:44,005
Have more. There are some left.

2181
01:22:44,075 --> 01:22:45,235
Where?

2182
01:22:46,535 --> 01:22:48,204
I love these, tendons.

2183
01:22:48,205 --> 01:22:50,474
- Which one?
- Tendons.

2184
01:22:50,475 --> 01:22:51,974
Yes, tendons.

2185
01:22:51,975 --> 01:22:53,114
(Eating mode on)

2186
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:54,485
- Bon appetit.
- Is there no soup?

2187
01:22:54,685 --> 01:22:55,914
- No, there is.
- There is soup.

2188
01:22:55,915 --> 01:22:57,954
- Don't give her soup.
- Why not?

2189
01:22:57,955 --> 01:22:59,484
- You don't drink soup, do you?
- But it's clear soup.

2190
01:22:59,485 --> 01:23:00,655
You can't have soup, no?

2191
01:23:00,825 --> 01:23:02,785
Soup as in stew and such.

2192
01:23:05,425 --> 01:23:07,795
Isn't it delicious? This restaurant, I mean.

2193
01:23:07,825 --> 01:23:09,325
- What?
- It has a clean, rich taste.

2194
01:23:09,925 --> 01:23:11,064
This place is good.

2195
01:23:11,065 --> 01:23:13,065
(Enjoying a proper meal for the first time in ages)

2196
01:23:13,935 --> 01:23:16,805
(The three are digging in without a word.)

2197
01:23:17,505 --> 01:23:20,975
(Becoming self-conscious)

2198
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:26,974
How about we drop all formalities right now?

2199
01:23:26,975 --> 01:23:28,185
(Drop all formalities?)

2200
01:23:28,241 --> 01:23:29,510
- What?
- Drop all formalities.

2201
01:23:29,511 --> 01:23:31,680
What's the need? You're rude all the time.

2202
01:23:31,681 --> 01:23:32,535
When was I ever rude to you?

2203
01:23:32,577 --> 01:23:33,676
- You always...
- Did I ever call him...

2204
01:23:33,677 --> 01:23:35,416
- call me, "Hey! You!"
- by his name?

2205
01:23:35,417 --> 01:23:36,516
When did I call you "Hey! You?"

2206
01:23:36,517 --> 01:23:38,177
- The worst I did was "mister."
- Gosh.

2207
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:40,181
Shall we?

2208
01:23:40,741 --> 01:23:41,950
- Go ahead.
- I don't care...

2209
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:43,480
since she always drops...

2210
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:44,751
all formalities with me.

2211
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:46,920
There are two people who are always rude to me.

2212
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,391
- Who?
- Ji Min and Yu Mi.

2213
01:23:48,521 --> 01:23:49,890
But you never treat her...

2214
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:50,991
like you treat me.

2215
01:23:52,321 --> 01:23:53,621
- Yu Mi?
- Yes.

2216
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:55,431
Do you treat Yu Mi like you treat me?

2217
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:58,331
Yu Mi... Honestly, I treat you well.

2218
01:23:59,661 --> 01:24:00,830
- You treat her worse?
- You?

2219
01:24:00,831 --> 01:24:02,971
- I'm treating you well.
- No way.

2220
01:24:03,331 --> 01:24:04,770
She may talk casually to me,

2221
01:24:04,771 --> 01:24:07,541
but Yu Mi never mistreats me as you do.

2222
01:24:09,311 --> 01:24:11,440
When did I ever say rude things to you?

2223
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:14,141
The way you mistreat me is different.

2224
01:24:14,641 --> 01:24:16,050
Why not drop all formalities for once?

2225
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,281
(In that case)

2226
01:24:17,351 --> 01:24:18,721
Why not drop all formalities for once?

2227
01:24:19,151 --> 01:24:21,481
(How about it?)

2228
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:24,651
- Just for three minutes.
- If we're going to do it...

2229
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:26,590
- Kwang Kyu...
- She's only going to drop...

2230
01:24:26,591 --> 01:24:27,890
formalities with me.

2231
01:24:27,891 --> 01:24:28,930
What?

2232
01:24:28,931 --> 01:24:31,390
I don't see the need to with Kwang Kyu.

2233
01:24:31,391 --> 01:24:33,060
- Then why do you want to do it?
- But...

2234
01:24:33,061 --> 01:24:34,500
- I don't mind.
- Because you annoy me.

2235
01:24:34,501 --> 01:24:35,971
But you're always rude to me.

2236
01:24:36,301 --> 01:24:37,730
Aren't you always rude to me?

2237
01:24:37,731 --> 01:24:38,770
Hey, Lee Seo Jin!

2238
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:40,101
What? See that?

2239
01:24:40,201 --> 01:24:42,370
(No formalities begin.)

2240
01:24:42,371 --> 01:24:43,540
Look, that's how she's always like.

2241
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:45,240
All right. Let's begin.

2242
01:24:45,241 --> 01:24:46,510
Only for three minutes, okay?

2243
01:24:46,511 --> 01:24:48,010
Here we go.

2244
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:50,310
In 1, 2, 3. Start.

2245
01:24:50,311 --> 01:24:51,351
Hey, Lee Seo Jin.

2246
01:24:51,381 --> 01:24:52,851
You should lead a proper life.

2247
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:55,020
You should lead a proper life.

2248
01:24:55,021 --> 01:24:59,061
(Starting to criticize Seo Jin as if she was waiting)

2249
01:24:59,691 --> 01:25:02,091
Shows are just a hobby since life is easygoing for you, right?

2250
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:06,001
Easygoing, yes.

2251
01:25:09,031 --> 01:25:10,830
- Look me in the eye.
- Continue.

2252
01:25:10,831 --> 01:25:12,240
- An adult is talking.
- Got it.

2253
01:25:12,241 --> 01:25:13,340
Listen well.

2254
01:25:13,341 --> 01:25:14,440
You're no adult. We're friends.

2255
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:16,571
We're not friends. Keep your manners with me.

2256
01:25:17,471 --> 01:25:18,940
Aren't we dropping all formalities?

2257
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:20,011
Only me.

2258
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:21,541
Should I be calling you "miss?"

2259
01:25:22,611 --> 01:25:23,680
Ma'am.

2260
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:25,080
(Ma'am.)

2261
01:25:25,081 --> 01:25:26,681
Try calling me "ma'am."

2262
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,321
All right, ma'am.

2263
01:25:31,721 --> 01:25:33,091
(Smiling)

2264
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:34,890
She gets all shy now.

2265
01:25:34,891 --> 01:25:36,061
(Laughing)

2266
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,330
I can totally continue.

2267
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:38,461
(I can totally continue.)

2268
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:39,661
Stop lying.

2269
01:25:40,661 --> 01:25:43,671
(My Star is soft-hearted by nature.)

2270
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:46,201
(He knows Ji Min very well.)

2271
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:48,811
Seriously.

2272
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:51,311
See that? She can't continue now.

2273
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:53,410
- Look.
- I'm cutting you some slack.

2274
01:25:53,411 --> 01:25:54,640
Ji Min has become self-conscious.

2275
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:55,750
- All done?
- She's done now.

2276
01:25:55,751 --> 01:25:56,851
- It's over.
- Apologise to me.

2277
01:25:56,881 --> 01:25:58,381
- Admit to the sins...
- Yes?

2278
01:25:58,921 --> 01:26:00,881
you've committed against me until now.

2279
01:26:01,681 --> 01:26:04,191
I'll forgive you if you apologise sincerely.

2280
01:26:04,951 --> 01:26:06,061
I can't admit to them.

2281
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:09,590
Do you not admit to how you flung me on the MBC floor?

2282
01:26:09,591 --> 01:26:11,491
You tripped by yourself.

2283
01:26:11,561 --> 01:26:13,930
I tripped by myself as I was walking?

2284
01:26:13,931 --> 01:26:15,531
You stepped on your skirt and tripped.

2285
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,400
How will you explain...

2286
01:26:17,401 --> 01:26:20,000
the ending footage caught on "Section TV?"

2287
01:26:20,001 --> 01:26:21,101
I don't remember.

2288
01:26:21,571 --> 01:26:22,910
- What if the footage is played?
- What?

2289
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:24,011
What if the footage is played?

2290
01:26:24,211 --> 01:26:25,211
- Apologise...
- I don't remember.

2291
01:26:25,212 --> 01:26:27,181
- Did you only ever treat me well?
- What?

2292
01:26:27,581 --> 01:26:30,051
How could I have been mean when she was my wife in the drama?

2293
01:26:30,481 --> 01:26:33,350
Do you know how much I cried with her in my arms when she died?

2294
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:35,490
But he kept complaining about how hot it was.

2295
01:26:35,491 --> 01:26:37,351
(But he kept complaining about how hot it was.)

2296
01:26:37,891 --> 01:26:42,091
Let her punch you and call it even.

2297
01:26:43,391 --> 01:26:44,560
(Glancing)

2298
01:26:44,561 --> 01:26:45,630
How about getting punched in my stead?

2299
01:26:45,631 --> 01:26:46,701
Me?

2300
01:26:47,331 --> 01:26:48,970
I don't mind doing that for you.

2301
01:26:48,971 --> 01:26:51,331
Why work with him? Just don't work with him.

2302
01:26:53,501 --> 01:26:54,841
Have you settled scores with Seo Jin?

2303
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:56,370
- No, my grudge has gotten worse.
- Here.

2304
01:26:56,371 --> 01:26:57,571
(No, my grudge has gotten worse!)

2305
01:26:57,611 --> 01:26:59,510
Where can I possibly work it off?

2306
01:26:59,511 --> 01:27:00,641
(Running away in the end)

2307
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:02,350
It's gotten worse.

2308
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:03,811
(The close chemistry has been ongoing for 20 years.)

2309
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:05,729
I was jealous.

2310
01:27:05,730 --> 01:27:08,090
They were like bickering siblings.

2311
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:10,830
Because they trust each other,

2312
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:12,530
the two exchange harsh jokes.

2313
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,770
"How nice. If only..."

2314
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,870
"I had a junior like her," was my thought.

2315
01:27:19,570 --> 01:27:22,280
I was stuck with her...

2316
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,940
for almost ten months.

2317
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,120
Because of what we went through, despite not meeting up much,

2318
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,480
we have things to talk about...

2319
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,050
and continue our friendship when we meet.

2320
01:27:34,150 --> 01:27:36,560
I have no idea if she likes me.

2321
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:37,959
She might even hate me.

2322
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,960
But I never thought badly of Ji Min.

2323
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:41,829
She's good-natured.

2324
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:42,830
(She's good-natured.)

2325
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:45,670
It was half a success,

2326
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:48,170
and the rest, my grudge only got worse.

2327
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,440
If he had admitted our past,

2328
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:54,670
I would've just thought he remembered.

2329
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:57,409
I really don't understand...

2330
01:27:57,410 --> 01:27:59,179
how he doesn't remember...

2331
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:00,309
our memories correctly.

2332
01:28:00,310 --> 01:28:01,880
You're too loud. It was Kwang Kyu.

2333
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:04,579
- Sorry.
- No, keep going.

2334
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:05,889
- No, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

2335
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:07,450
I thought it was Seo Jin.

2336
01:28:08,290 --> 01:28:09,389
- So it's okay...
- Be quiet.

2337
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:10,559
if it's him and not me?

2338
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,760
Of course.

2339
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,590
(Feeling happy)

2340
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:17,360
The moment he took the wheel.

2341
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,670
When...

2342
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:21,799
I asked him to get my lunch for our travel time,

2343
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,500
I thought he wouldn't do it.

2344
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,739
But he did.

2345
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,709
- Seo Jin even got the apples.
- Right.

2346
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:27,810
Those two?

2347
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,910
- I'll give you one last chance.
- What chance?

2348
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:33,080
The chance to apologise to me.

2349
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,320
What is there for me to apologise to you?

2350
01:28:37,150 --> 01:28:38,890
- People don't change.
- Tell me.

2351
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:41,090
- Seriously.
- For goodness' sake.

2352
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,660
Becoming mature...

2353
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,259
Being an adult...

2354
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:46,460
has nothing to do with age.

2355
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:48,529
People rarely change.

2356
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:50,260
(Their sibling-like chemistry won't change.)

2357
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:52,700
She's a strange one.

2358
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,699
It's good we consider...

2359
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:55,799
- each other weird.
- Why are you so twisted?

2360
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:57,700
- Sorry?
- Why are you so twisted?

2361
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,140
That's how I'd look to a twisted person.

2362
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,940
(My Star half-succeeded in her revenge.)

2363
01:29:05,010 --> 01:29:06,610
I didn't know it'd be this hard.

2364
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,250
I'm being sucked dry.

2365
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,780
Their loudness is exhausting me.

2366
01:29:12,650 --> 01:29:16,620
(The liberated mothers have appeared.)

2367
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:21,860
(My Stars: Lee Hyun Yi, Lee Ji Hye, Lee Eun Hyeong)

2368
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:26,370
(The day of My Star's 1 million subscriber celebration shoot)

2369
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,499
Only the two.

2370
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,670
(Share childcare duties)

2371
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,799
(The baby-loving Seo Genie...)

2372
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,610
(makes the mothers satisfied.)

2373
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:36,879
(Every child he looks at, )

2374
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,610
(he looks at them with loving eyes.)

2375
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:41,150
(Highly satisfied with shared childcare)

2376
01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:43,250
(Meanwhile)

2377
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:45,219
Gosh, look at your belly, Hyeon Jo.

2378
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:46,549
(Kang Hyeon Jo, 16 months old, Lee Eun Hyeong's son)

2379
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:47,920
(Kwang Kyu doesn't know how to care for kids.)

2380
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:50,120
(16-month-olds are scarier than tigers.)

2381
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,259
(Just approaching him...)

2382
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,859
(is enough to make him cry.)

2383
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:55,629
(How will this messy shared childcare end?)

2384
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,799
(Thanks to them, we're free!)

2385
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,969
(Their pent-up...)

2386
01:30:01,970 --> 01:30:05,310
(energy explodes.)

2387
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:07,909
(Going all out)

2388
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:09,980
(A culture shock)

2389
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:12,479
(We've gone this far.)

2390
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,879
(Sing us a song.)

2391
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:16,519
(Seo Jin sings, something we've never seen before.)

2392
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,550
(My Grumpy Secretary)
