00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>I've long dreamed of being a trader.</i>

3
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:57,640
<i>A trader who, even if not remarkable,</i>
<i>always fulfills her share of the work.</i>

4
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,643
<i>That has been my goal.</i>

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,188
We've got so many here.

6
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,731
We should start sorting them out.

7
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:11,237
<i>I've thought that was my dearest wish.</i>

8
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,609
Oh, dear.

9
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,472
What is that smell?

10
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,412
What?

11
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,965
Oh, my! What do I do? Hold on.

12
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,010
No, this can't happen!

13
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,845
What do I do? But how?

14
00:02:58,928 --> 00:02:59,971
How did a fire break out?

15
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,620
No, please.

16
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,331
Please stop.

17
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,749
No.

18
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,630
Oh, no.

It's hot!

21
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,774
What do I do?

22
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,112
Please help!

23
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,450
This can't be happening.

24
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,333
What do I do?

25
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,983
Ms. Oh!

26
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,609
Ms. Oh!

27
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,820
Darn it.

28
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,904
Oh Mi-seon!

29
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,240
Hold on. Hang in there.

30
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,883
Please…

31
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,218
Ms. Oh!

32
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,772
<i>Now, before the dreams I once longed for,</i>

33
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,525
<i>regrets come to mind first.</i>

34
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,450
<i>I should've said goodbye</i>
<i>to my grandmother.</i>

35
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:30,246
<i>I should've told Mi-ho to quit her job</i>
<i>at the department store.</i>

36
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,792
<i>I should've bought</i>
<i>Beom's underwear sooner.</i>

37
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,340
<i>But what I regret the most now…</i>

38
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,301
Oh Mi-seon!

39
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,930
Mi-seon!

40
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>…is that I never told him</i>

41
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,064
<i>how I actually feel about him.</i>

42
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,026
<i>I wish I had told him that I like him,</i>

43
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,487
<i>his gaze,</i>

44
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,156
<i>and everything about him.</i>

45
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,659
<i>I should've let him know.</i>

46
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,998
Mi-seon.

47
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,510
Hang in there.

48
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,266
Oh Mi-seon!

49
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,540
{\an8}It must've been so scary.

50
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,168
{\an8}Let's get out of here.

ANJEONG HOSPITAL

53
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,772
That must be painful.

54
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,858
Just a minute, ma'am.

55
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,818
Could you check a patient here?

56
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:24,986
Ma'am, please.

57
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:27,029
Why isn't she getting any treatment?

58
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,614
She's had the tests already.

59
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,576
She's been waiting for ages.
Why aren't you treating her?

60
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,538
I told you the urgent test came back fine,
and the rest comes out tomorrow.

61
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,291
She'll be moved once she wakes.

62
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,419
But she inhaled
a mountain of jet-black smoke!

63
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,254
I bet she has.

64
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,798
Like I said,
please go get tested yourself.

65
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,265
What's going on? Ms. Oh.

66
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,476
Are you coming around?

67
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,935
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

68
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,438
{\an8}Ms. Oh.

69
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,648
{\an8}Mi-seon!

70
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,610
Can you hear me, Mi-seon?
Open up your eyes!

71
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,363
-Hey, punk! Keep it down, will you?
-Mind the other patients, okay?

72
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,781
How inconsiderate.

73
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,454
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

74
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,999
Mr. Kang.

75
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,751
What's up? Where does it hurt?

76
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,628
Go on, tell me.

77
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,259
I like you.

78
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,222
Come again?

79
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,141
I like you.

80
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,852
I'm asking you to go out with me.

81
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,067
You're asking me that here?

82
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,658
Please, ma'am!

83
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,494
Please come take a look at him.
The bleeding won't stop!

84
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,496
Oh, no. Please take a look.

85
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,291
-Let me take a look.
-She's losing it.

86
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,422
I mean…

87
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,927
Come on, not in a place like this.

88
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,679
What about it?

89
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,557
It's safe and hygienic.

90
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,977
No way. I'll pretend I never heard that.

91
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,105
Let's do this again later.

92
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,315
What, again? Spare me the embarrassment.

93
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,526
No, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear it.

94
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,904
This just isn't right.

95
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,991
-Mr. Kang.
-Yeah?

96
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,869
What about our stock?
What happened to the gloves?

97
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,746
How is that the issue now?

98
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,373
Mr. Kang Tae-poong?

99
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,335
Hello, we're from the police department.

100
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,672
We'd like to ask you a few questions
regarding the fire.

101
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,726
{\an8}Ms. Bun-i! Ma'am, wait for…

102
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,060
{\an8}Wait up!

103
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,522
{\an8}Slow down. Let me come with you!

104
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,774
{\an8}Ma'am!

105
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,318
{\an8}Where's my precious girl?

106
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,028
{\an8}Over there.

107
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,655
{\an8}-Are you okay, dear?
-Yes, Grandma.

108
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,324
{\an8}I'm all good. Don't you worry.

109
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,201
{\an8}-You're okay?
-Honestly, I'm okay.

110
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,286
{\an8}Mom.

111
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,121
{\an8}-Gosh, Tae-poong.
-Ms. Bun-i.

112
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,959
{\an8}You rascal.
Look at the state of my baby girl.

113
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,337
{\an8}How come you're unscathed?

114
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,880
{\an8}Ma'am.

115
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,467
{\an8}Ma'am, that wasn't exactly his fault…

116
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,596
Dear me. What if my beautiful bud
of a granddaughter had perished

117
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,723
without ever fully coming to bloom?

118
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,517
Could you have lived with that regret?

119
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,146
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-I'm okay.

120
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,397
You foolish girl.

121
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,359
How did you get into such big trouble?

122
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,988
My old heart
has long hardened like a rock.

123
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,241
A piercing tragedy
might not do that big a damage.

124
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,370
But what about Mi-ho and Beom?

125
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,582
Did you consider how their tender hearts
will get shattered into pieces?

126
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
Grandma…

127
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,753
Your siblings aside,

128
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,383
have you thought about your life?
What about the life ahead of you?

129
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,387
Value and cherish yourself, okay?

130
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,723
I may have not given you
a comfortable life,

131
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,935
but that doesn't mean
you should knock yourself about.

132
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,105
My dear child.

133
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,525
-It must've been so hot in there.
-I'm all good.

134
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,612
-It must've been so suffocating and scary.
-I wasn't scared at all.

135
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,239
-Just how…
-I'm okay, Grandma.

136
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,492
-Don't worry, Grandma.
-You poor little thing.

137
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,078
Grandma, it's okay.

138
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,082
Don't cry.
You'll wear yourself out. It's all good.

139
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,501
I'm okay.

140
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:55,047
HOSPITAL

141
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,215
Here, ma'am.

142
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,770
I apologize for the harsh words earlier.

143
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,398
I shouldn't have blamed you at all.

144
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,649
No, ma'am.

145
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,026
It was my fault.

146
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,323
Can you make me a promise?

147
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:25,161
-I feel like I can ask you for a favor.
-Of course you can.

148
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,413
I noticed that my dear girl

149
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,499
has begun to smile again
after meeting you.

150
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,835
I mean, she's smiling again.

151
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,590
I'll fill her life with smiles.

152
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,426
All smiles and no tears.

153
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:43,679
Goodness, no. Make her cry.

154
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,434
Help her cry her eyes out
without holding back.

155
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,770
She's endured a lot at a young age.

156
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,065
Help her let go
of all the sorrows in her heart.

157
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,651
Can you do that for me?

158
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,660
Of course, I promise.

159
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,539
You can cry now too, ma'am.

160
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,417
We're a family now.

161
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,942
Get off. Didn't you hear me?

162
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,026
Unbelievable.

163
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,873
You've lost it, haven't you?

164
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,416
What have you done this time?

165
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,127
Did you ask about the delivery date
and the warehouse

166
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,505
to set the place on fire?

167
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,006
Did you torch the warehouse?

168
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,967
I haven't got time for this nonsense.

169
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,844
Listen, you crazy brat.
There was a person inside.

170
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,807
Mi-seon was there.
Did you do it on purpose?

171
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,852
So what?

172
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,610
Did Freckles die or something?

173
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,280
If she had died,
I'd be with the police, not you.

174
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,992
Oh, the police? Go ahead.
You've still got time to go see them.

175
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,118
But tell me.

176
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,203
Do you have any evidence?

177
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,788
I didn't do anything.

178
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,832
Listen up, lady.

179
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,877
You seem
to be having trouble grasping things,

180
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,130
but your job is to bring me
that promissory note or whatever.

181
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,591
Not my father, but me. Got it?

182
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,803
What's more, I suggest
you use your common sense.

183
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,765
Who do you think is next?

184
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,064
What a handsome kid.

185
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,276
STUDENT ID
PARK MIN-SEONG

186
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,821
Familiar, no?

187
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,760
Think about it.

188
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,180
The door was locked from the outside.

189
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,767
And yet, the warehouse burst into flames.

190
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,603
Are we sure it wasn't arson?

191
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:41,899
So, did you guys visit
Ms. Oh in the hospital?

192
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,317
Mr. Go here

193
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,362
had a total meltdown
at the sight of Ms. Oh in her sleep.

194
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,906
We got kicked out for being so loud.

195
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,534
So, is Ms. Oh going to be fine?

196
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,370
Fine, my foot.

197
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,705
She almost died.

198
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,500
She got first-degree burns
on her hands and arms.

199
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,460
She had some inhalation burn too,

200
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,296
but luckily she'll recover
after some rest.

201
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,763
-Hey.
-What's that?

202
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,183
-What's inside?
-It's just our goods from the warehouse.

203
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,309
Why bring them here?

204
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,813
-I have to go. I'm late.
-You're leaving?

205
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,316
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

206
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,740
I have a few more boxes in the car.

207
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,492
-That's enough, Mr. Kang.
-What?

208
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,412
They're all junk.

209
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,872
But why? They didn't get burned.

210
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,625
Take a look for yourself.
They still reek of smoke.

211
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,168
-What?
-These won't do.

212
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,309
They're for surgeries.

213
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,062
You can't use them.

214
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,858
Great effort, though.

215
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,280
I mean…

216
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,741
We know you did your best.

217
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,999
What are you even saying?
I can't believe my ears!

218
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,127
The deadline's a week away,
and now there's a problem?

219
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,170
Are you kidding me?

220
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,005
That's why we've come to ask

221
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,175
if you could extend
the deadline just by a few days.

222
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,718
There's no way!

223
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,181
You know all goods are to be collected
and shipped to Africa in one freighter!

224
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,767
My gosh, what an absolute nightmare!

225
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,435
You know what?

226
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,813
You're welcome to book a new ship
and take care of the delivery fees!

227
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,732
Look here.

228
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,401
It wasn't entirely due to
mismanagement on our part.

229
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,694
We had a fire.

230
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,404
"Look here"?

231
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,198
Ma'am, we had a fire.

232
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,370
Help your countrymen in need
before helping other nations.

233
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,165
There's no room for help here.
This is the protocol.

234
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,125
What about the damages for the delay?

235
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:09,004
Let's not argue over nothing.
Just go secure a new batch of products.

236
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,049
We're only here
because that's not so easy.

237
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,636
My goodness… Did you hear that, Mr. Jung?

238
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,972
This is why I don't want
small businesses getting involved.

239
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,225
How irresponsible!

240
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,436
When things go south, they just pretend
like it's none of their business.

241
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:30,067
In that case,
you could consider giving up your deal.

242
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,403
Then ten percent of the bid bond
will cover the damages--

243
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,615
Don't bring up giving up just yet.

244
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,618
You're taking the private sector's money,
corrupt bureaucrats.

245
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,746
Excuse me, don't make it sound
like we will get that money.

246
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,582
You'd be paying KOICA.
It's a different entity.

247
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,253
Then the right to the deal
will go to the runner-up bidder.

248
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,047
Does that mean it will go
to Pyo Merchant Marine?

249
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,257
-Yes.
-Goodness.

250
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,135
They're just as annoying.
You're like two seeds in a pod.

251
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,970
It's two peas in a pod!

252
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:02,307
Fine! "Two peas in a pod."
But that's not the key issue for me!

253
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,352
Just make sure
to deliver your goods on time!

254
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,938
Meet the deadline
and the quantity we agreed upon!

255
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,024
Our guests are leaving.
Validate their parking.

256
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,819
They only gave us 30 minutes.

257
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,739
She's not budging at all.

258
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,908
She wouldn't flinch for anything.

259
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,744
Let's talk to Blaze Eagles first.

260
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,050
Yes, we need that handled quickly.

261
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,306
Excuse me.

262
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,893
My goodness.

263
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,269
Ms. Jung.

264
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,858
Give me a few minutes.

265
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,344
Is it too rough for you?

266
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,430
Oh, no. I'm good.

267
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,641
This neighborhood
gives you quite the hike,

268
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,601
but the air here is so fresh.

269
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,521
It's not like any top-floor unit
of a high-rise complex.

270
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,400
I see.

271
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,112
Hello!

272
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,407
My gosh, it's so hot.

273
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,596
I may not have raised her like a princess.

274
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,473
Gosh, you scared me!

275
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:11,770
Still, it's admirable
how she seems to cherish others.

276
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,063
You mean the young lady?

277
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,566
It's rather pitiful.

278
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,237
Maybe it's because
she's used to walking on eggshells…

279
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,863
Well, I…

280
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,699
Ma'am.

281
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,119
Even so,

282
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:32,708
I'm sure she'll find someone
who'll recognize her warm heart's worth.

283
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,586
Please don't treat her poorly.

284
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,676
She may look feisty on the outside,
but she's a kind-hearted girl.

285
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:46,596
Ma'am, please don't misunderstand…

286
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,600
Her shoulders are squared,
and her tail is curled up beautifully.

287
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,685
Tail…

288
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,105
-She's got a tail?
-Sure.

289
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,650
Gosh, a dog! You scared me!

290
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,946
-My heart…
-Ms. Kim, you can wait in our bedroom…

291
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,365
My gosh. When did you come out, Ms. Bun-i?

292
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,705
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's nothing.

293
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,624
-Ms. Jung!
-Hey, Beom.

294
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,293
I got 70!

295
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,212
My gosh.

296
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,422
You got 70 on the test?

297
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,134
See? I knew you had it in you!

298
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,719
You sweet thing.

299
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,804
You must be a genius.
What would you like to eat?

300
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,723
-Glazed sweet potato.
-Sweet potato?

301
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,683
I'll make it for you.

302
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,643
Let's get 90 on the next test.

303
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,147
Ninety points.

304
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,818
This is so exciting!
You got a whopping 70 points!

305
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,367
What did they say?

306
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,789
They can't produce more gloves
at the moment.

307
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,332
They can't produce gloves?

308
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,708
Because of recent bulk orders,

309
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,126
they're out of material.

310
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,587
Orders are flooding in,
but they don't have enough material.

311
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,548
It will take three months
until they can resume production.

312
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,676
We're facing bankruptcy here.

313
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,888
Don't even…
Please don't mention it, Myung-gwan.

314
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,602
Surely, the surgical gloves
can't be so hard to find.

315
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,771
Let's keep trying. We'll find a supplier.

316
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,940
Keep looking. We've got this.

317
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,819
-Come on, everyone.
-Okay.

318
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:29,658
Check for inventory
of the suppliers in the provinces.

319
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,742
Yes, okay.

320
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:51,221
HAEMONG FLOWER SHOP

321
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,631
Hi, you're here.

322
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,178
It must've been a long day.

323
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,470
It was rough, wasn't it?

324
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,937
Sorry I wasn't there for your discharge.

325
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,318
I don't mind it.

326
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,740
Thank you.

327
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,813
Should we have some dinner?

328
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,733
Let's eat.

329
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,699
-Thanks.
-You're an amazing cook, Ms. Bun-i.

330
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,203
It's just you're not much of a cook, dear.

331
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:39,120
Goodness.

332
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,956
Even water might taste better.

333
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,044
Remember, your father-in-law
likes his food well-seasoned.

334
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,714
But Tae-poong prefers
bland dishes over salty ones.

335
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,634
Drink enough water
if the dishes are too salty for you.

336
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,511
It tastes amazing.

337
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,101
Pretty lady, eat up.

338
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,687
-Always stay in good health.
-I will, Grandma.

339
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,106
I'm amazed you prepared
all my favorite dishes, Grandma.

340
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,107
Oh, sure.

341
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,109
What about me, Grandma?

342
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,652
Goodness, my baby.

343
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,696
You can have your fill too.

344
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,657
Wait.

345
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,576
We're short of one person.

346
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,372
Mi-ho is meeting her friends, Grandma.

347
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,624
YEOUIDO TOP PUB

348
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,627
STUDIO I LOVE YOU REUNION
AT YEOUIDO TOP PUB

349
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,545
Bang!

350
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,052
-Down a shot!
-Down a shot!

351
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,805
-Let's begin again.
-Zero.

352
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,808
-Zero.
-Seven.

353
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,184
-Bang!
-Bang!

354
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,811
Hey, you got it wrong!

355
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:45,729
Wait, no!

356
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,522
This time, it's soju.

357
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,608
-Down a shot!
-Cheers.

358
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,282
Hey, we've got another pitcher of beer.

359
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,576
Gosh, we're getting beer non-stop.

360
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:02,620
We can't leave your glass empty, Mr. Jung.

361
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,081
-Drink up.
-Oh, dear.

362
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,584
Look, I've got some soju.

363
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,462
Gosh.

364
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,214
Let me refill your glasses, ladies.

365
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,842
Why aren't you guys drinking?

366
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,554
Is Tae-poong skipping again?
I thought he promised to come this time.

367
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,224
Why do we always get
either Kim Chu-seok or him?

368
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,477
-Hey, Man No. 4.
-Yes?

369
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,729
Where's Tae-poong?
You said you called him.

370
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,649
Tae-poong didn't recognize me.

371
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,734
What about him?

372
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,110
Ha Cheong-il impersonator.

373
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,696
-Oh, Wang Nam-i?
-Nam-i or whatever.

374
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,616
He sang Park Nam-jung's song,
not Ha Cheong-il's.

375
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,620
His name is Wang Nam-mo, not Wang Nam-i.

376
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,873
-Sure, Nam-mo.
-Nam-mo.

377
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,833
-We know that.
-Of course.

378
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,960
-Don't get it wrong.
-Okay.

379
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,546
-Cheers, everyone!
-Cheers!

380
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,425
-Let's drink up, okay?
-Cheers!

381
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,260
-Jeez, she's wasted.
-Mi-ho sure is.

382
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,681
Can we get more soju, ma'am?

383
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,392
-We're good, ma'am.
-We have some here.

384
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,769
Mi-ho's running late tonight.

385
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,814
-What is that?
-This?

386
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,483
Do you want to try it?

387
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,366
Ms. Bun-i, they produced this serum

388
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:26,079
using the technology they developed
while carrying out research on diabetes.

389
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,040
It keeps your skin healthy.

390
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,836
Even the bottle
is designed quite elegantly.

391
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:33,920
I love it.

392
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,673
If I get prettier than this,

393
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,593
the young men in the area will badger me
for giving them butterflies!

394
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,220
You needn't worry about that.

395
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,391
Ms. Oh. Come here and try this.

396
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:50,145
-Little Ms. Oh got me this, and I love it.
-Really?

397
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,775
It's pretty unique.

398
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,694
-Right?
-For sure.

399
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,612
Let's keep your skin nice and moist.

400
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,949
-Can I step outside for a bit?
-Okay.

401
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,951
Where are you going? Seeing someone?

402
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,369
Goodness, no.

403
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,913
I'm going out for a stroll.
I'll be back soon.

404
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,498
-See you.
-Okay.

405
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,961
-Are you sure you should be out here?
-Yeah.

406
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,298
I had a big meal,
so a walk will help me digest.

407
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,176
It felt rather stuffy inside too.

408
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,854
How does it feel
to see the person you like?

409
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,482
I thought you'd pretend
you never heard it.

410
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,694
I love it.

411
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,908
That I get to see you like this.

412
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,004
It was really rough today, wasn't it?

413
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,381
I felt

414
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,220
somewhat lost.

415
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,766
But I'm good now.

416
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,727
I'm really fine.

417
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,156
I'm sorry.
If only I had noticed the fire sooner.

418
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,327
Don't say that.

419
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,665
{\an8}It was my fault.

420
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:41,756
{\an8}From now on, I will never leave you alone.

421
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,469
You know…

422
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,351
{\an8}Mi-seon, you are…

423
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,526
The one you really like?

424
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,746
No.

425
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,543
The one I love.

426
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,831
Hello?

427
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,709
<i>Man No. 2. Please come over quickly.</i>

428
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,793
What?

429
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,005
Come on. They gave me a twister shot!

430
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,466
A shot of that can take even bulls down.

431
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,635
-Jeez.
-I honestly want to quit drinking…

432
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,136
-Mi-ho!
-Just a bit further.

433
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,013
Who the hell are you?

434
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,474
It's not…

435
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,476
Well… You know…

436
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,769
Are you okay, Mi-ho?

437
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,063
-Why did you get so wasted?
-Hey, that's mine.

438
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:21,981
It's not what you think.

439
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,110
Hello, Man No. 2. I'm Man No. 4.

440
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,113
Abracadabra.

441
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,240
-Oh, right. Hello.
-Hi.

442
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,826
Why didn't you come
to the <i>Studio I Love You</i> reunion?

443
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,247
Chu-seok said he left both you
and Tae-poong countless pager messages.

444
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,584
He kept inviting us to a group date
with women from other cohorts.

445
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,252
What? When did he ever do that?

446
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,504
What, a group date?

447
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,006
Have you finally lost your mind?

448
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,467
You don't get to say that
in your state, Mi-ho.

449
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,427
What have I done so wrong?

450
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,388
Go on and tell me. What's my problem?

451
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,139
Your sister was just discharged today.

452
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,641
Why were you at the party?

453
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,477
-Are you an alcoholic or what?
-I drank because I was upset!

454
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,354
What's wrong with it?

455
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,147
Do you not approve of a girl drinking?

456
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,819
It becomes an issue if you can't hold
your liquor, regardless of your gender.

457
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,779
Don't you know
how unsafe the world has gotten?

458
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,698
Don't give me a lecture!

459
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,032
Who do you think you are?

460
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,661
-Who are you to say that?
-What?

461
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,247
Hey, do you really have to ask?

462
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,458
Why are you even dating me, Mi-ho?

463
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,295
Are you dating me out of pity
because I kept following you around?

464
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,505
No.

465
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,007
Because you were annoying.

466
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,260
It was because you were annoying
and I was bored.

467
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,728
I'll go grab a taxi. Wait here.

468
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,774
Take this with you, Nam-mo!

469
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,798
I didn't get the fruit basket for you.
It's for your sister.

470
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,884
Take it home with you.

471
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,313
I started seeing you
because you were annoying.

472
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,608
That's how it was at the start!

473
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,362
But I've fallen for you.

474
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:39,077
I'll still like you
even when your situation worsens.

475
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,916
What can I do when I still care for you
even after all the humiliation?

476
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,925
Jeez, I can't stand this stupid melodrama!

477
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,344
Mom…

478
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,764
Get over here, Nam-mo.

479
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,307
Mom, are you drunk?

480
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,391
Come on!

481
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:08,189
Life will get really tiring
if you start squabbling so soon.

482
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,400
If you're not taking this home,
I'll take it--

483
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,195
No, ma'am. I'm going to eat everything.

484
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,279
Really?

485
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,073
Good. Come here, Nam-mo.

486
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,744
Carry it for her.

487
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,624
Why don't we

488
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,752
cure our hangover?

489
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,254
Let's go. Come inside.

490
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,558
That hits the spot.

491
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,518
<i>Gumiho.</i>

492
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,188
Wait, I meant… Mi-ho.

493
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,276
For what it's worth,
Nam-mo makes amazing <i>ramyeon,</i> doesn't he?

494
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,113
Here's your kimchi.

495
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,576
-I hope you haven't nagged at Mi-ho again.
-Of course, I didn't!

496
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,456
Have some kimchi with your <i>ramyeon.</i>

497
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:15,339
To think I gave birth to this brat
and kept him under my roof for decades…

498
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,549
How unfortunate of me.

499
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,803
You don't even like kimchi, Mom.

500
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,597
What do you mean? I love it.

501
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,779
Eat up.

502
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,617
My mom never gives the egg yolk
to anyone, not even me.

503
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,368
I gave it to you plenty of times.

504
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,288
You're so annoying. Hurry and eat up.

505
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,048
Could we get the gloves custom-made?

506
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,799
It's a bulk order.

507
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,301
Oh, I see.

508
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,262
So the latex needs to be imported?

509
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,015
Okay, I understand.

510
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,769
Wasting breath on the obvious.

511
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,773
Why do you keep bringing up rubber gloves?

512
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,108
Should surgeons wear
the dish-washing gloves?

513
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,903
Do you think surgical operations
are the same as making kimchi?

514
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,155
I'm hanging up! You're wasting my time.

515
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,002
They won't even answer. Darn it.

516
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,465
The manufacturer client list was here.

517
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,552
What on earth?

518
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,597
It's a mess.

519
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,892
Did you go through the documents here?

520
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,145
No, the cabinets here are in the shade.
That's bad feng shui.

521
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,986
{\an8}I swear I had these arranged neatly.

522
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,655
{\an8}IMPORT DECLARATION CERTIFICATES
CLIENT TRANSACTION INVOICE

523
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,286
-Hey.
-Min-seong.

524
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,122
So you're Min-seong.

525
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,749
-Get a snack with your buddy.
-Min-seong!

526
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,713
What are you doing here?

527
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,214
Go to the study room now.

528
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,967
-This guy came up to me--
-Don't mind him.

529
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,971
This gentleman here is my colleague.

530
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:31,475
I forgot to bring your meal today.

531
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,269
Get something with your friends.

532
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,856
No, ask the study room owner
to order you <i>jjajangmyeon.</i>

533
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,482
Get going. Come on.

534
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,734
Off you go.

535
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,277
STUDY ROOM

536
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,413
Why are you back again?
What's the matter with you lot?

537
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,334
Your son doesn't take after you.
He won't take my money.

538
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,339
I bet you scared him
by forcing him to go upstairs.

539
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,383
Next time,

540
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,720
I'll be taking him.

541
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,125
How many boxes do we have?

542
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,712
It'll take more than a year
to sell them all in the domestic market!

543
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,048
I'll look into wholesale dealers quickly.

544
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,301
Your son had a plan this time--

545
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:52,306
How could you place an order
on a bid you hadn't even won?

546
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,724
Have you lost your senses?

547
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,936
This time, we had the deal
almost in the bag--

548
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,020
"Almost"?

549
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,106
"Almost"!

550
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:05,277
Have Hyun-jun come quickly
and check the inventory.

551
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,906
-Snap to it!
-Yes, sir.

552
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,847
Aren't you a professional?

553
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,516
Why are you holding back?
Is it because you are broke?

554
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,061
Knock me down,
and I'll pay you, you broke bum!

555
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,024
Take that.

556
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,698
Jeez!

557
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,993
Gosh.

558
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,583
What was that for?

559
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,251
You crazy bastard…

560
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,502
Darn it!

561
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,299
Today's your unlucky day.

562
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,681
I had a really bad day, you know.
Look at me.

563
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,225
You worthless scum!

564
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,269
Hyun-jun! Hey, knock it off!

565
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,479
Hey, stop it!

566
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,771
-Let me go!
-Enough!

567
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,440
You broke bastard!

568
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,777
GYEONGIL MEDICAL SUPPLIES

569
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,031
<i>Hello, I'm with Typhoon Trading.</i>

570
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,658
-Hi.
-Do you perhaps have surgical gloves

571
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,119
powdered with corn starch
instead of talcum powder?

572
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,871
We only stock ones with talcum powder.

573
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,039
-Really?
-Yes.

574
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,707
We don't have three million pairs.

575
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,627
Right? Thank you for your time.

576
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,922
I heard there was
a major incident of late.

577
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,757
-Pardon?
-About the surgical gloves.

578
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,842
Everyone's in a frenzy.

579
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,066
I've got it.

580
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,860
-What on… Hey, are you okay?
-Ms. Oh.

581
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,987
-Wait.
-Take a seat.

582
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,699
-Slow down.
-I figured it out.

583
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:16,909
What do you mean?

584
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,870
I know why Blaze Eagles
is short on supplies.

585
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,249
Have you looked
into what I asked, Mr. Bae?

586
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,794
Yes, I talked to the factory manager
in Malaysia just as you asked.

587
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:30,172
One company placed an order
with Blaze Eagles two weeks ago

588
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:31,549
for three million pairs.

589
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,802
For three million? Doesn't that
match the quantity of our order?

590
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,471
-It's a Korean company too.
-A Korean company?

591
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,307
-Can it be--
-Yes, it's Pyo Merchant Marine.

592
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,936
I've talked to all the wholesalers
dealing in medical supplies.

593
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,689
There's a rumor that Pyo Merchant Marine
is seeking a wholesaler

594
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,899
to take their bulk supply
of surgical gloves.

595
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:52,570
Everyone is worried the large inventory
will cause prices to drop.

596
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,196
They've lost their minds.

597
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,408
They proceeded with the order
even when they had lost the bid?

598
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,833
Turns out they have what we want.

599
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,130
-What now? Don't tell me you're going.
-Mr. Kang.

600
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:13,549
-No, wait.
-You shouldn't go see them.

601
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:15,301
They'd never give us their stock.

602
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:19,096
It will be like
banging your head against a wall.

603
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,764
You know how ruthless they are.

604
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,183
Mr. Kang, you know
it will be a waste of time.

605
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,310
No.

606
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,688
At least I'll be able to see it myself.

607
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,653
Mr. Kang.

608
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:10,230
What are you up to?

609
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,611
Why sneak in like some common thief

610
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,947
and take a peek at our goods
without permission?

611
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,658
I thought you're here to see me.

612
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,743
Did you order these?

613
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,247
-Who will you sell these to?
-Jeez, you stress me out.

614
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,876
That's all you've got to ask
after coming all the way here?

615
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,545
By any chance,

616
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,675
did you set our warehouse on fire?

617
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,181
-To get the deal instead?
-What, me?

618
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,227
Do you think I can't sell this junk?

619
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,146
I got it wrong, right?

620
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,400
You may not be in your right mind,

621
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:57,194
but you were never such a lowlife, right?

622
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,823
Thanks for your kind words, punk.

623
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,080
Can you get out of my sight now?

624
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,958
I'm having a really bad day today.

625
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,254
If that's not the case…

626
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,216
I'm saying,

627
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:21,802
if you didn't

628
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:24,721
set the fire…

629
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,601
let me borrow these gloves.

630
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,773
-Come again?
-Or sell them to me.

631
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,693
I may not be able to pay you right away.

632
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:41,113
-But I'll add a handsome interest--
-Wake up, you clown.

633
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,866
Are you that desperate?

634
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,950
Yeah.

635
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,411
I'm really desperate.

636
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,710
If that's the case, Tae-poong,

637
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,880
show me how much you want them.

638
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,090
I might consider it then.

639
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:06,847
Look, you're not going to have any luck
when you're standing tall.

640
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,141
Come on.

641
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:14,438
Lower your head humbly. There you go.

642
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,148
That's more like it!

643
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,775
That's what I'm talking about.

644
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,738
Tell me everything you want.

645
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,949
All I want in return are these gloves.

646
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,662
What do I want?

647
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,837
Nothing, you idiot.

648
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,299
I'd rather burn them
than give them to you.

649
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,305
I know they catch fire easily too.

650
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,561
Hyun-jun!

651
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,070
I…

652
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:08,951
I was wrong.

653
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,746
I will…

654
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,166
I apologize for everything.

655
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:20,837
So,

656
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,674
please…

657
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,928
help me out here.

658
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,185
Otherwise, my company won't survive.

659
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,653
Please do me a favor.

660
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,165
That was my goal in the first place.
To make you go bankrupt.

661
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,004
Even the back of your head
rubs me the wrong way.

662
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,733
TOJONG SUNDAE SOUP

663
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,123
I thought soju would taste sweet
on a day like this.

664
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,668
It's just as bitter.

665
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,298
I wonder why you loved
this bitter thing so much.

666
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,890
MAKGEOLLI, SUNDAE SOUP

667
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,416
I should've joined you
for a drink back then.

668
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,465
I should've poured you a glass at least.

669
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,610
I never got to do this for you
when it was this easy.

670
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,741
I thought you'd wait for me.

671
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,374
That breaks my heart the most.

672
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,462
What about you, Dad?

673
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:11,800
What upset you so much that night?

674
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,049
Welcome.

675
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,851
-Can we get one more glass, ma'am?
-Sure.

676
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,981
Don't pour your own drink.
You'll bring your father bad luck.

677
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,235
I'm here too, Mr. Kang.

678
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,615
You're clueless
about the drinking etiquette.

679
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,622
How did you know
I was saving a spot for my dad?

680
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,626
I just do, punk.

681
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,044
Drink up.

682
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:39,930
Hey, Tae-poong.

683
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,681
A bizarre thing happened to me.

684
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,351
What kind of bizarre thing?

685
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:48,313
<i>Back when I was sleeping at your office</i>
<i>after arguing with my mom,</i>

686
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,525
<i>that lady paid a visit</i>
<i>in the dead of night.</i>

687
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,861
<i>You know, the lady</i>
<i>who used to work for your company.</i>

688
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,326
{\an8}I swear I had these arranged neatly.

689
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:07,332
{\an8}Ms. Cha, did you reorganize
the files in this office?

690
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,167
I took a look yesterday

691
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:13,213
and noticed how they were arranged
by date from right to left.

692
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,924
I know that's how you arrange files.

693
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,302
So, he would never rip out a page
even if he made errors.

694

00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,810

keep insisting it's here?

00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,526
What can it be
that they're throwing this hissy fit?

702
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,914
What are you doing, Ms. Cha?

703
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,749
What exactly are you doing?

704
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,130
Why is everyone out to get me?

705
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,552
Why won't any of you just leave me alone?

706
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,803
Ms. Cha!

707
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,771
I bet it was you.

708
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,900
You hid it, didn't you?

709
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,654
You knew everything
and hid it on purpose, didn't you?

710
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,448
What do you mean?

711
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,367
What is it that I supposedly hid?

712
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,243
You know what.

713
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:10,038
Without it, my son will be in big trouble.

714
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,166
What are you talking about?
I won't know unless you tell me.

715
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:15,168
You know, the promissory note.

716
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,378
Promissory note?

717
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,005
The proof that Pyo Bak-ho borrowed money.

718
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,007
Are you working under his orders?

719
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:24,260
You really have no idea.

720
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,306
Oh, no. It's truly missing.

721
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,558
What do I do?

722
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,560
-What's this promissory note?
-What am I to do?

723
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,728
Talk to me.

724
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,148
Why the hell do you need it?

725
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:41,319
You already saw that the ledger
was missing a page!

726
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,864
-The loan must've been on there.
-So why are you looking for the note?

727
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,493
Did he perhaps

728
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,620
bribe you?

729
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,253
Did he?

730
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:00,964
You're right.

731
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:05,343
He offered me money, and I took it.

732
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,971
When your father's funeral was being held…

733
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:12,726
While his body was in the funeral home,
I accepted a bribe.

734
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,104
A huge one, at that.

735
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:21,234
My hand instinctively reached out
and wouldn't let go of that money.

736
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,696
I had no other choice, okay?

737
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:25,864
My wage was withheld,

738
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:29,075
my husband is a total money pit,
and I couldn't pay my son's tutors!

739
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,327
I needed money to keep my family afloat!

740
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,954
So what?

741
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,914
What about the others?

742
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,127
Didn't you ever think of them?

743
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,506
You're really clueless, aren't you?

744
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,009
Even if I hadn't complied,

745
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,512
Pyo Merchant Marine might've found it,
perhaps through a harsher way.

746
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,431
Don't you agree? Let's be real.

747
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,267
If they meant to pay,
they would've done it ages ago.

748
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,479
-They were never going to pay it back.
-So what?

749
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,691
"So what"?

750
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:09,991
If I were you, Mr. Kang,
I'd give it to them and get it over with.

751
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,078
Think about how much we suffered
over that note.

752
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,205
We're about to go bankrupt,
and Ms. Oh got hurt.

753
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,665
Who knows what will happen next?

754
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,335
So let's find that note
and give it to them.

755
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,753
-Come on.
-Listen, Ms. Cha!

756
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,218
Don't you feel bad for my father?

757
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,555
Seriously, how could you do this to us?

758
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,766
Snap out of it, Kang Tae-poong!

759
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:38,978
Why dwell on the dead man?
The living must go on!

760
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,915
What in the world…

761
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,000

Mr. Kang…

00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:13,716
Ms. Oh.

772
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,553
I'm sorry to bother you,

773
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,391
but could you place
an order for this again?

774
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,397
TYPHOON TRADING
CEO KANG TAE-POONG

775
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,067
I think it reflects poorly…

776
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,154
on the company, not on myself.

777
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,119
Please take care of it.

778
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,831
Where are you going?

779
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,424
To do my job.

780
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,522
What kind of a jerk
parks their car this way?

781
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,108
They didn't even leave their number.

782
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,669
At least you're consistently ill-mannered,
I'll give you that.

783
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,463
You know Ms. Cha Seon-taek, don't you?

784
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,049
"Cha Seon-taek"?

785
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:40,053
What, as in tea selection?

786
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,971
You won't be seeing her again

787
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,558
because I found out everything.

788
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,146
I don't follow.

789
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,231
{\an8}By any chance…

790
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,153
{\an8}did my father come to you…

791
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,740
{\an8}to ask for help?

792
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,209
What a strange thing to say.

793
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,339
How could I have met Mr. Kang
when he's long gone?

794
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,561
Look closely.

795
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,399
Mr. Kang is right here.

796
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,068
You've lost your mind.

797
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:44,992
What's wrong?

798
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,286
Do you feel anxious?

799
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,540
Sure, your father was just as anxious.

800
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,376
Watching your company go bankrupt

801
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,254
must make your stomach churn.

802
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,301
Even if it kills me,

803
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,514
Typhoon Trading will never go down.

804
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,536
Why else would a trading company's owner
visit you if not to strike a deal?

805
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,751
-A deal?
-You have surgical gloves.

806
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,044
Sell them to me.

807
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,130
What?

808
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,301
I hope you'll give me a discount.

809
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,305
I suffered a huge loss, you see.

810
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,895
I thought you had
a good head on your shoulders.

811
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:58,149
-Turns out it was all a bluff.
-Why won't you sell them to me?

812
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,444
I bet you're losing sleep
over what to do with them.

813
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,237
That's none of your concern.

814
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,823
Here's the most important issue.
Do you have money?

815
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,327
I'm asking if you can pay for the gloves.

816
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,500
-You're asking me about money?
-That's right.

817
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:20,129
Given our history,
you can't be considering buying on credit.

818
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,006
I do have it.

819
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,217
The money, that is.

820
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,393
You took money from my father.

821
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,270
Shouldn't that be enough to cover it?

822
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,609
-What?
-Haven't you heard?

823
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,616
I'm talking about your promissory note.

824
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,496
It seems you haven't heard
that I recovered it.

825
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,126
"Promissory note"?

826
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:02,713
I can't recall if such a thing existed.

827
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,050
The money from nine years ago
should now be…

828
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,970
What with the interest… No.

829
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,597
Throw in all the overdue interest,

830
01:04:13,057 --> 01:04:14,350
and this office

831
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,979
and the building should be mine.

832
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,697
Watch your darn mouth, you little brat.

833
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,952
Don't you worry.
I couldn't care less about your building.

834
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:34,912
Then what?

835
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,665
I want the three million pairs
of gloves in your storage.

836
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,126
What?

837
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,462
I'm losing out big time, aren't I?

838
01:04:45,089 --> 01:04:46,090
What's the matter?

839
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,136
Do you think I don't have it?

840
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:57,435
That may be the case.

841
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:17,663
SEOUL OFFICE OF PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SERVICE

842
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,671
Why is this young man here?

843
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,381
Did I call him over?

844
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:28,466
-No.
-What perfect timing.

845
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:32,219
-We've been talking about our deal.
-Deal? What deal?

846
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:35,306
Do you think your company
can deliver the goods on time?

847
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:39,393
Try it if you can.
We can deliver our goods even today.

848
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,937
Deals aren't some children's game.

849
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,272
We have time until the deadline.
Respect the protocol.

850
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,858
To put it bluntly,
Typhoon Trading hasn't messed up yet.

851
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:46,943
Exactly. Oh, my gosh.

852
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,195
Hey, you're being nice to us
all of a sudden.

853
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,530
As if! What brings you here anyway?

854
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,951
-It's just--
-We want to ask for a deadline extension.

855
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,703
-You shouldn't have led with that.
-Why not?

856
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,747
Mistakes happen. We're only humans.

857
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:01,999
Haven't you been listening?

858
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,419
-I'm giving up now.
-My goodness.

859
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,421
Take my gut and do what you want.

860
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,881
Tell him he can take my gut.

861
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,383
He says to open up his stomach.

862
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,718
Who is sick? I'm a doctor.

863
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,347
Thank you.

864
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,390
Hello?

865
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:19,600
Hey, Ms. Oh. What's up?

866
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:23,729
Hello?

867
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,485
What?

868
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,905
Pick up the pace,
and we can all wrap up quickly.

869
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,157
Speed it up even more,
and we'll be out in no time.

870
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,535
Hey, watch your step.

871
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,706
Don't you dare touch them!

872
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,082
You bastards.

873
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:45,543
So, did you come
looking for a fight, Tae-poong?

874
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:48,254
Bring it on. Come at me, you punk.

875
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,095
Jerk.

876
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,013
Ms. Oh.

877
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,599
Are you out of your mind?

878
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,644
You did it, didn't you?

879
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:18,409
LOVE BEYOND FEAR

880
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:53,444
TYPHOON FAMILY

881
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,488
{\an8}<i>You better have it</i>

882
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,949
{\an8}<i>if you want to save that petty position</i>
<i>your father left behind.</i>

883
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,409
{\an8}Will an apology change anything?

884
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:01,702
{\an8}My father will hear it too.

885
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,205
{\an8}<i>And you'll hear it too.</i>

886
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:05,706
{\an8}<i>I have to find it quickly.</i>

887
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:08,084
{\an8}<i>I was feeling rushed</i>
<i>and I'm running out of time.</i>

888
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,127
{\an8}You can go with Honey Poong

889
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,671
{\an8}<i>or Baby Poong, something like that.</i>

890
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,757
{\an8}<i>Why don't we take a day trip</i>
<i>to the sea with Beom?</i>

891
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,051
{\an8}<i>Tae-poong, that kid,</i>

892
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:19,345
{\an8}<i>knows about the promissory note,</i>
<i>but he doesn't have it.</i>

893
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,389
{\an8}<i>Don't you want to know</i>
<i>why I need those gloves?</i>

894
01:08:22,473 --> 01:08:23,682
<i>But I never beg.</i>

895
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,101
<i>I make others beg.</i>
