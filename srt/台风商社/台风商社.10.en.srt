TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:49,632
What on earth?

3
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,632
{\an8}Mr. Arthit.

4
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,846
He's the customs officer
who took the $50 bribe.

5
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,770
"At 6:00 p.m. on April 27th,

6
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,856
a Korean man gave me $10,000
after work on my way home."

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,733
{\an8}That's that line.

8
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,366
Yes, he did it.

9
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,959
Your Honor.

10
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,672
This film includes the entire instance
of grabbing money and handing it to him.

11
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,635
I wish to turn this film in as evidence.

12
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,691
And if necessary, I'd like to have
the photo studio owner as our witness.

13
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,962
-It's game over.
-Yes, it's game over.

14
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,564
RECEIPT OF THE CRIMINAL COURT

15
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,065
FINE PAID IN FULL
DEFENDANT RELEASED

16
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,698
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,199
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,121
-Are you sure it's done?
-Yes, it's done.

19
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,708
-We did it!
-We did it!

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:29,709
We did it!

21
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,713
-Great work.
-Yes, great work.

22
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,465
We did it.

23
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,551
Oh, right. Here.

24
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,054
The old man at the photo studio
gave this back.

25
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,472
Your watch.

26
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,015
I'll take that.

27
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,980
We have to hurry.

28
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,529
{\an8}COURT FOR CONCILIATION

29
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,866
{\an8}-Mr. Kang. Ms. Oh.
-Hey.

30
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,493
{\an8}-Mr. Go!
-Mr. Go!

31
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:08,790
{\an8}-You've gone through so much trouble!
-You almost ended up in prison!

32
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,209
{\an8}Who's the police chief? Get him here!

33
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,545
{\an8}I'll show him the terror
of the Korean Marine Corps!

34
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,006
{\an8}-Hold yourself back.
-I'll hold myself back.

35
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,424
{\an8}Gosh, I'm free.

36
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,677
{\an8}-You are.
-I'm free!

37
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,472
{\an8}-I've been freed!
-You've been freed!

38
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,391
{\an8}I got freed!

39
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,184
{\an8}-I'm free now!
-Wait.

40
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,811
{\an8}Wait, what time is it?

41
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,312
-Why?
-It's already past 3:00 p.m.!

42
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,314
-The time! We have to go!
-We have to hurry.

43
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,524
What do you mean?

44
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,777
Our helmets will be disposed of
if this case isn't closed by 4:00.

45
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,571
Why are you here?
Why were you celebrating?

46
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:44,200
We ran around everywhere
trying our best to save you!

47
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,538
-Over there. That's the car.
-Hey!

48
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,914
-Over here!
-Here!

49
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,419
-Get in.
-To the port!

50
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,962
-No, you can't go!
-Why not?

51
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,964
-Why not?
-We're in huge trouble!

52
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,048
What now?

53
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,759
They're doing some construction work
on the highway,

54
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,429
so the entire road is closed off!

55
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,017
This car can't go on the highway.
We can't go.

56
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,561
If we can't take this car,
we'll take another way, then.

57
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,855
Goodness gracious.

58
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,400
It'll take at least an hour
to get to the port.

59
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,445
And there's no guarantee
that other roads will be open.

60
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,822
-What do we do?
-What now?

61
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,616
-Let's find bicycles.
-How are you going to go on bicycles?

62
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,285
What else can we do, then?

63
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,495
I get scared. I'm not going!

64
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,123
Where are you going, Mr. Go?

65
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,542
-Where is he going?
-Where are you going?

66
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,302
What's going on?

67
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,471
What are you doing, Mr. Go?

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,808
When in doubt, always take a motorcycle.

69
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:51,976
-Let's go, Ms. Oh.
-Okay.

70
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,103
I'll get behind you,
and Ms. Oh can hop on last.

71
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,521
You can come separately.

72
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,856
Why?

73
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,275
This motorcycle can't fit three.
We aren't kids, you know.

74
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,069
The sales team will go on our own.

75
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,573
-Bye.
-Hold tight!

76
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,408
Be careful!

77
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,251
MIN BURI CRIMINAL COURT
MIN BURI CIVIL COURT

78
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,003
What about me?

79
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,810
Thank you, Ms. Oh!

80
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,270
What? I can't hear you!

81
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,357
Hold tight!

82
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,400
I can't hear you, Mr. Go!

83
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,362
-And you smell awful!
-What?

84
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,489
You smell awful!

85
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,199
Don't worry!

86
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,119
We need to hurry, but be careful!

87
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,297
Let me come through!

88
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,349
Excuse me!

89
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,445
Coming through!

90
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,654
I'm sorry!

91
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,751
-Drive faster, Mr. Go!
-This motorcycle is too slow!

92
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,422
-Do you know the direction?
-Trust me!

93
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,300
-Just trust in me!
-Eyes on the road!

94
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,471
Be careful, Mr. Go.

95
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,599
Don't worry!

96
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,107
You're going too fast!

97
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,277
Don't worry about it!

98
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:58,120
-What's going on? What is it?
-Wait a second.

99
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,622
-What's with this?
-What?

100
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,750
-This can't happen. What's going on?
-Is it broken? Why?

101
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,085
Why? What's the matter?

102
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,295
-It won't move.
-Did it break down?

103
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,172
-What's with this?
-What are we going to do?

104
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,675
-Why would it break down now?
-We should do something.

105
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,552
We'll do something. But…

106
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,804
-This is driving me insane.
-Wait, what do we do?

107
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,305
What now? Wait.

108
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,349
-Let's see.
-Darn it.

109
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:21,936
-Has the engine given up?
-Can you even tell by looking?

110
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,897
What would I know even if I looked?
I don't know anything.

111
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,316
But we have to do something…

112
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:32,280
Hey, what's… What's with this?

113
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,241
-Mr. Go, I'll get there faster if I run.
-What?

114
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,742
Where are you going?

115
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,161
Ms. Oh!

116
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,775
Hey.

117
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,819
Hop in.

118
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,488
It's you, Mr. Kang.

119
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,750
Mi-seon has gone far.
I don't see her anymore.

120
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,002
-Did she run?
-Yes.

121
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,254
Why would she do that?

122
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,289
PRIVATE CAR LANE

123
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,003
Okay, just trust me.

124
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,343
Ms. Oh!

125
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,672
Oh, no…

126
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,309
Wait! Wait a moment!

127
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,604
Hold on! Wait, no. Wait.

128
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,398
-Get out.
-I'm begging you. Please.

129
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,150
-Wait! Stop!
-Get out.

130
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,110
-They're almost here.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

131
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,403
-Hurry up!
-It's dangerous.

132
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,280
-Let's get going.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

133
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,656
-One moment.
-Hurry up, quick!

134
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,907
Wait just a little.

135
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,577
-They're almost here.
-It's dangerous.

136
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,912
-Please…
-What's she saying? One minute!

137
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,582
-No, wait.
-Hey!

138
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:30,791
Jeez.

139
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,001
-Get down.
-Get out.

140
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,544
-Get down.
-Get out. It's dangerous.

141
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,337
-No, stop!
-Get out.

142
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,339
-Ten minutes! Stop, please.
-Get out.

143
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,467
-Ten minutes. Ten minutes.
-Get her out of here.

144
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,260
-You can't. Wait…
-Get out.

145
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,722
-No, wait! They're almost here!
-Get out.

146
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
Wait!

147
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,400
You can't! No!

148
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,319
I won't let you.

149
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,030
No, wait!

150
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,540
Please…

151
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,181
Ms. Oh!

152
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,479
No…

153
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,689
-Hold tight, Mr. Go!
-What?

154
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,531
-Move!
-Move aside!

155
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,282
-Move aside!
-Move aside!

156
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,618
Move aside, all of you!

157
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,496
{\an8}-Ms. Oh! Move aside!
-Move aside!

158
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,039
-Ms. Oh!
-Move it!

159
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,085
No…

160
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,349
Move aside!

161
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,274
-Mi-seon!
-Move aside!

162
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,584
Are you okay, Mr. Go?

163
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,502
I'm fine.

164
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,504
No, I'm not fine!

165
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,050
Stop it!

166
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,060
Get out.

167
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,646
Mr. Kang, are you all right?

168
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,814
I'm fine.

169
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,274
-Here.
-Yes.

170
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,650
Take it.

171
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,029
What? Get out of the way!

172
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,488
I have it. Hold on.

173
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,616
Here.

174
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,414
FINE PAID IN FULL PER VERDICT
DEFENDANT DISCHARGED

175
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,416
Oh, I see.

00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:30,179
What's going on? The <i>tuktuk!</i> Hold it.

177
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,016
-That was so shocking.
-It worked.

178
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,726
-Hey, your forehead.
-What about it?

179
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,769
You're bleeding.

180
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,978
-I'm bleeding?
-Oh, no.

181
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,063
I'm fine.

182
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,068
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-No, it's okay.

183
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,778
Are you really okay?

184
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,615
-Are you okay, Mr. Go?
-I'm not, but I guess I'm fine.

185
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,479
Thank you.

186
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,696
They look like they've seen better days,
but they should be fine, right?

187
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,322
After all, these are helmets.

188
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,453
They look fine.

189
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,541
The insides are destroyed.

190
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,026
They'll run it through customs again.

191
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,030
What's wrong? What is it?

192
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,873
What happened to these?

193
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,876
Are they all in this condition?

194
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,380
Wait. Hold on.

195
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,757
I'm sure some are…

196
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,677
Do we have to throw out all of these?

197
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,472
What about this one?

198
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,682
Are they all like this?

199
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,477
Wait a second. What do we do now?

200
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,146
What do we do?
Do we have to throw them out or what?

201
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,606
What do we do?

202
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,445
No, we…

203
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,364
Wait.

204
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,659
-Ms. Oh.
-No, wait.

205
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,039
-It's okay. We can start again.
-No, give me a second.

206
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,803
Wait, Mr. Kang.

207
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,265
In the end, we failed.

208
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,687
We couldn't find a client,
make sales, or save the inventory.

209
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,149
Don't worry. It's okay.

210
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,652
Ms. Oh.

211
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,405
Ms. Oh, it's okay.

212
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,033
We did our best.

213
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,663
I never realized it before,
but you're very good at your job.

214
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,791
You've done so well, Ms. Oh.

215
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,919
Senior Staff Oh Mi-seon,

216
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,797
you were the best trader.

217
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,093
You've done well. It's all right.

218
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,430
-You did a good job.
-What do we do?

219
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,351
You did well. We can do it over.

220
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm so frustrated. What do we do?

221
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,026
I'm so frustrated.

222
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,744
I smell, don't I?

223
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,289
You don't.

224
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,249
What do we do?

225
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,226
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

226
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,067
But still, I'm so relieved.

227
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,571
In the end, we didn't lose everything.

228
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,449
We still managed to save 140 helmets.

229
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,077
It came through customs,
so we won't face more problems, right?

230
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,747
We'll do our best
to sell everything we have.

231
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,500
{\an8}YEOPJIP RAMYEON

232
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,379
Should we export <i>ramyeon?</i>

233
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,382
Isn't it too spicy for foreigners?

234
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,385
The spiciness makes it unique.
I think it'll be a hit.

235
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,014
We were going to throw away
that T-shirt, remember?

236
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,809
Why would you throw away
this perfectly good T-shirt?

237
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:34,066
This is proof
of my youthful days when I was 27.

238
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,319
It takes me back
to the sentiment from those days,

239
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,613
when I listened
to Deulgukhwa and Infinite Track.

240
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,365
Were you in high school?

241
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,743
I was in eighth grade,
and I loved Lee Sang-eun's "Dam-Da-Di."

242
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:48,538
Our age gap is way too big
for us to sit together.

243
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,625
Back in the day,

244
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:55,545
when I was in tenth grade,
Nam-mo and I skipped military drill,

245
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,923
went to watch
Kim Soo-nyung's archery game,

246
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,426
got caught by the drill instructor,
and got beaten up ten times.

247
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,345
That's why I have a huge butt.

248
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,765
The student military drill?

249
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,559
You must've practiced
with wooden guns, right?

250
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,645
We did it with real guns.

251
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,982
When did you start elementary school?
You're old.

252
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,316
I mean, real guns?

253
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,486
It was a turbulent time.

254
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,656
Everything and everyone was suspicious.

255
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,284
However…

256
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,619
You know,

257
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,751
just because I'm older,
it doesn't mean I'm wiser.

258
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,798
Who would've known I'd make
such huge trouble in this foreign land?

259
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:45,053
And I acted like I was full of myself
when I talked to Ms. Oh.

260
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,391
Those $50 were just 70,000 won.

261
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:54,354
I thought it was petty money,
but it led me to lose a huge amount.

262
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,484
The fine seemed pretty heavy.
I'll do something to pay that back.

263
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,820
Don't mention it.

264
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,239
Everything happened
while you were working,

265
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,450
so we'll write it off.

266
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:11,079
But we have to pay for this business trip
and pay off Kangseong Helmet's balance.

267
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,832
I already came up with a plan in my head.

268
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,464
I feel too ashamed.

269
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,924
I'm sorry.

270
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,426
Goodness.

271
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,805
Mr. Go.

272
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,685
I was the one who turned off the lights
whenever you were in the restroom.

273
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,603
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,856
-So, it was you.
-Yes.

275
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:42,527
I think this is really great.
I finally feel like we're a team.

276
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:49,159
All right, from now on,
let us stand hand in hand.

277
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:54,372
-We'll get past walls and stay as a team.
-Okay.

278
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,957
-All right.
-Let's go!

279
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,794
You're starting to sound like a real CEO.

280
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:00,962
Of course, I am.

281
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,635
Wait, you two
couldn't eat cilantro before.

282
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,096
Hand in hand we stand.

283
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,495
Come on. I'm really fine.

284
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,873
That wound can leave a scar.

285
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,841
-It stings.
-Hang on a second.

286
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,883
Oh, no.

287
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,563
Okay. All done.

288
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,524
Does it still sting?

289
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,737
It kind of stings,
but it kind of doesn't. I'm not sure.

290
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,991
Someone told me not
to get up close and personal.

291
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,918
Please excuse me, then. Get a good rest.

292
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,712
Ms. Oh.

293
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,801
I have something to tell you.

294
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,930
-Thank you.
-What?

295
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,933
I thought about it
and realized I never said this.

296
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,103
When I was in trouble

297
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:45,233
or when I felt I was all alone,

298
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,694
you were always there with me.

299
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,661
Thank you, Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

300
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,736
I was just doing my job,

301
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,863
whenever I had to do it.

302
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,494
Because you have to write
the business trip log?

303
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,288
Because records last longer than memories.

304
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,042
We'll need to take
disciplinary action too.

305
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,277
No.

306
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,739
I prefer memories over records.

307
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:57,032
{\an8}EPISODE 10
YOU AND I

308
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,876
I'll miss this so much once we go back.

309
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,836
-Eat up.
-Okay.

310
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,755
Does anyone sell this in Korea?

311
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,883
-I doubt it.
-No way. That's just ridiculous.

312
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,056
What's this red thing?

313
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,558
Put it in the front and back.

314
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,604
-Go Ma-jin!
-Hey.

315
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,647
-He's here.
-Yes.

316
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,821
-Hey, Ma-jin.
-Hey.

317
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,947
Hello.

318
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,325
-Get the boat closer.
-Pull it.

319
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:41,701
-Closer.
-Right here.

320
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,537
-Hey, Ma-jin.
-Hey.

321
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,789
Goodness.

322
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,999
-Hey, Ma-jin!
-Hey!

323
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,168
-Hello.
-It must've been a rough journey.

324
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,711
Goodness, it must've been hard.

325
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,547
Mr. Kang and Ms. Oh,
it's a shame to see you go.

326
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:55,840
Let us meet again, okay?

327
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,175
-Yes.
-My goodness.

328
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,259
Hey, Ha-neul.

329
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,595
What are you waiting for?
Come and say goodbye.

330
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,850
Don't go.

331
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,769
-Here.
-Okay.

332
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,605
Thank you so much.

333
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,190
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

334
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,858
-Bye.
-Bye.

335
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,569
It's such a shame to see you go.
Now, come along.

336
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,405
Are you sure you can do this alone?

337
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,367
Mr. Kang, going around on foot
is the best way to do sales.

338
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,286
I'll see the numbers working
once I put my feet to work.

339
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,164
Of course, it'd be great
if I could sell all 140 at once.

340
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,792
But I don't care if I can't do that.

341
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,379
If I sell ten helmets
to 14 different places,

342
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:40,135
there will be at least one or two places
where I sell big and hit the jackpot.

343
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,761
It will happen.

344
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,263
And I'm not here alone.

345
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,644
Now, we're ahead of the game
with my experience and connections.

346
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,148
-See you in Seoul.
-Okay.

347
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,107
-Wait.
-What?

348
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,234
Let's do a cheer for our business.

349
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,445
-Why are we doing this?
-On the count of three.

350
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,239
-Typhoon Trading, let's go!
-Let's go.

351
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,782
We weren't in sync.

352
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,784
-Let's do this.
-Yes, let's do it!

353
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:05,702
Let's do this!

354
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,871
-All right. Go now.
-You can do it!

355
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,289
-Come and visit, okay?
-Okay.

356
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,582
My goodness.

357
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,709
Mr. Kang.

358
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,962
Keep an eye on my dear Ms. Oh, will you?

359
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,298
Since when was she your dear Ms. Oh?

360
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,841
Be careful.

361
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:23,845
It's such a shame to see you go…

362
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:29,559
Ms. Oh, I'll make money
and bring some dried mangoes home.

363
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,936
-And big peanuts!
-Okay!

364
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,313
Mangoes are for me.

365
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,565
Make sure you visit!

366
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,942
-Bye!
-Bye! Be careful!

367
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,195
Drive safely!

368
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,119
Bye!

369
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,294
Why isn't she here yet?

370
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,884
It's about time she came back.

371
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,722
Mi-seon!

372
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,392
Hey, Beom.

373
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,269
You're back!

374
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,147
-We're back.
-It must've been exhausting.

375
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,067
-Was it a tough journey?
-No.

376
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,029
-We had a good journey.
-You look so thin.

377
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,406
-Have you been well?
-Hey.

378
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,159
-I'm home, Grandma.
-You're back, Mi-seon!

379
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,577
-Mi-seon!
-Hey.

380
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,497
-I got you a present.
-You did? Show me.

381
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,252
Did you miss me or not?

382
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,419
Did you or did you not?

383
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,381
Let's see them.

384
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,633
That's a lot.

385
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,218
You got so many things.

386
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,011
Why did you get so much stuff?
That's mine.

387
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,929
-No, mine.
-No.

388
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:53,768
Does the US Army Base have
a lot of great things like these?

389
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,354
This could look tacky
if the wrong person holds this.

390
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,606
It looks good only on someone like me.

391
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,025
Tae-poong has such good taste.

392
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,653
-It's pretty.
-Hey, you.

393
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,905
Was this the best you could do?

394
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,784
What is this? It's blue!

395
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,246
It makes me look like a ghost!
Didn't you see anything in pink or red?

396
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,541
Darn it. You're the worst.
Why did you get me this?

397
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,418
-Thank you.
-It's tasty.

398
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,128
Is there anything else?

399
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,713
She's a ghost.

400
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,965
-Stop it, ma'am.
-She's a ghost.

401
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,593
-Mi-seon, what is this?
-What?

402
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,762
You can wear it to work.
It looked comfortable.

403
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,848
Darn it. Keep it for yourself.

404
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,558
-This sucks.
-It's cute.

405
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,977
It's pretty. I'm jealous of you, Mi-ho.

406
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,020
-Here.
-You can keep it.

407
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:37,937
Grandma?

408
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,398
-Goodness, no.
-Eat this.

409
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,276
-Don't give it to me.
-The banana's delicious.

410
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,660
Why isn't he home yet?

411
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,179
It's so cramped.

412
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,556
Beom, you said you'd sleep with Grandma.

413
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,433
It's been so long
since we've seen Mi-seon.

414
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,317
-I'm thirsty, Mi-ho.
-Be quiet and swallow your spit.

415
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,028
Go to sleep.

416
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:56,140
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 126,550 WON

417
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,397

00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,371
CEO'S OFFICE

421
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,450
I'll be back.

422
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:22,995
I promise.

423
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,487
Watch out.

424
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,741
{\an8}-Stop pushing.
-Please don't push.

425
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,793
{\an8}EUROPE ALSO SUFFERS
FROM UNEMPLOYMENT CRISIS

426
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,837
Stop looking at me and read the paper.

427
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,634
Are you okay?

428
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,597
Sure, I'm fine.

429
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,226
-Watch it.
-Come on.

430
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:33,441
I'm sorry.

431
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,736
-I'm sorry.
-Stop getting in.

432
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,280
-I'm so sorry.
-Jeez.

433
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,913
Except that we're standing too close.

434
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:11,979
Thank you.

435
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,066
-It's hot. Be careful.
-It's surely hot.

436
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,360
-Thank you.
-Sure.

437
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,531
Eat up.

438
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,700
-It's so hot.
-Is it?

439
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:30,748
What is it?

440
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,879
-Your lips.
-Right.

441
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,297
-Your lips.
-Is something on it?

442
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,299
Thank you.

443
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:46,847
It's so hot.

444
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,521
-Oh, my.
-My gosh.

445
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,023
Why did you…

446
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,112
Why did you pull out the straw?

447
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,906
You can wipe it now.

448
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,909
-Is it in my nose?
-No, you're fine.

449
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,997
-Be careful.
-Okay.

450
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:18,921
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

451
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,548
-Thank you.
-Bye.

452
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,260
Wait, Ms. Oh.

453
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,345
We aren't going there.

454
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,474
-We aren't going to work?
-Well, we are.

455
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,061
-But we aren't going in that direction.
-What?

456
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,189
-Our office is this way.
-No, we're over here.

457
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,025
What?

458
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,029
What have you done now?

459
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,250
Stand right there.

460
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,882
Oh, my gosh, Mr. Kang.

461
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,843
What is this?

462
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,928
-The thing is--
-What?

463
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,722
Hey, over here.

464
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,516
You just sent me a random address.
What is this?

465
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,436
-Hello, Mr. Bae.
-Hey.

466
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,440
Allow me to present Typhoon Trading.

467
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,657
I'm not really into fried chicken.

468
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,826
Why did you call him?

469
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,412
I was raised with good food,
so palm oil doesn't work with me.

470
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,832
Wipe that margarine off your face first.

471
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,212
Anyway, let's go inside.

472
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,254
-Okay.
-All right.

473
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,382
{\an8}TYPHOON TRADING

474
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,865
This is Typhoon Trading version 2.0.

475
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,827
Mr. Kang, when did you make this decision?

476
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,289
It started in Thailand.

477
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,962
Things were too hectic back then,
so I didn't get a chance to tell you.

478
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,550
And our team wasn't in good spirits.

479
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,511
Also,

480
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:36,600
I needed some money
to handle my responsibilities as the CEO.

481
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:44,483
But because I made you move here
without discussing this beforehand,

482
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,444
I am very sorry…

483
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:50,865
about that matter.

484
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,117
-No.
-It's okay.

485
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,495
Is there something on the floor?

486
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,705
-The floor?
-What's that?

487
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:02,460
If you think about it, we couldn't afford
an office like that in our situation.

488
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,420
Please stop, Mr. Kang.

489
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,923
It's not like we'll stick around here
for a long time, right?

490
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,719
Of course not.
We'll go back to our office.

491
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,054
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

492
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:16,891
Was this previously a pub?

493
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,604
It was a pub my friend ran,
but he's taking some time off.

494
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:24,732
So, we're using this for the time being.

495
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,859
It has running water, right?

496
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,653
Of course, it does.
It has electricity too.

497
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,823
The Internet modem works as well.

498
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,409
Are you all right?

499
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,789
It's working fine.

500
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,501
Did they move out in a hurry?

501
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,588
Look at this place.
We could start frying chicken now.

502
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:54,512
MOMO'S PUB

503
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,598
-Let's do this!
-Go!

504
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,933
All right!

505
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,735
-Careful with your back.
-Let's go!

506
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,238
-Be careful.
-Careful.

507
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,656
-All right!
-Be careful.

508
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,282
Is it that heavy?

509
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,076
Now, let's move this.

510
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,285
MONTHLY SCHEDULE AND PLANNER

511
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,709
Is this okay?

512
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,921
-Put it this way.
-Turn it around.

513
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,756
No, go the other way.

514
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,508
-The other way?
-Wait, no. I'm sorry.

515
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,725
We're almost done.

516
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,435
All done.

517
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,397
THE CONTACT

518
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,439
CHRISTMAS IN AUGUST

519
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,251
Has anybody been watering this?

520
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:13,841
That was Mr. Koo's duty,
but no one else did it once he left.

521
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,303
-Does that beer machine work?
-It does.

522
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:20,889
Does it work?

523
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,103
-What?
-This is awesome.

524
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,396
What are you doing?

525
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,984
-What do you think you're doing?
-I wanted to test it and see if it worked.

526
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,571
Why would you test that?
Of course, it'll work once it's plugged.

527
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,449
-Jeez.
-Okay. I'll be careful from now on.

528
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:41,076
Please do. We have to save on everything.

529
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,873
I mean, we can grab a glass of beer
from time to time while we work now.

530
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,877
MOMO'S PUB

531
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,795
These two…

532
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,093
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hey, you're here.

533
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,596
-These two are for you, right?
-That's right.

534
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,598
-Thank you.
-Sure.

535
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,989
-How much is this, ma'am?
-Yes?

536
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,243
Why? Do you want one for yourself?

537
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,286
What?

538
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,955
You have such a cute smile.

539
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,125
Take it.

540
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,585
-You're giving it for free?
-Sure.

541
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,836
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

542
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,088
Thank you.

543
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,964
-Thank you.
-Here. Take this.

544
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,720
-Goodbye, then.
-Bye.

545
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:49,061
I thought it would look shabby,
but it turned out to be a decent office.

546
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,480
It looks rather cozy.

547
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,775
What about the kitchen?
Should we use it as a meeting room?

548
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,694
My friend wanted to use it,
so he asked us to leave it alone.

549
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:06,161
We have a freeloader now?

550
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,041
Did you call me a freeloader?
The lease is in my name.

551
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,960
What is this, Tae-poong?

552
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,962
You said you'd only use half.

553
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,756
We're paying 50-50, but you want me
to be locked up in the kitchen?

554
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,466
-We're paying 50-50?
-I guess so.

555
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,552
Hey, push this over.

556
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:25,389
Then you can come out.
We have extra seats, no doubt!

557
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,516
Stop talking nonsense
and draw the halfway line.

558
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,892
-Push it!
-Hold on.

559
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,561
Let's do this, then.

560
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,438
Give him a hug!

561
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,648
-What are you doing?
-Okay. Welcome!

562
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,859
Welcome to Typhoon Family.

563
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:37,943
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

564
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,445
-Welcome!
-I'm glad you're here.

565
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,114
-How endearing.
-Welcome.

566
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:43,991
I'll turn on the light!

567
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,494
TYPHOON TRADING
MOMO'S PUB

568
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,914
It's hard to make out both.

569
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,167
"Momo's Typhoon Trading."

570
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,086
-Turn it off.
-Turn it off?

571
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,674
This way, you can see both.

572
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,265
This way.

573
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,815
See? I told you.

574
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,025
They're done for good.

575
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,517
{\an8}"Notice of Office Relocation."

576
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,852
I'm telling you they're done.

577
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,064
We aren't done.
This is just the beginning.

578
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,151
The beginning of your suffering.

579
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,076
Aren't you hot? Have something cold.

580
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,455
My back hurts.

581
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,050
-Hey, cheers.
-Cheers.

582
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,890
-Oh, man.
-How's your mother?

583
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,309
What happened?

584
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,938
It was human marketing.

585
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,398
In other words, a pyramid scheme.

586
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:45,571
My dear Ms. Kim Eul-nyeo reached
the Sapphire tier with our mortgage money.

587
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:52,744
Everyone who reached the jewel tier
was crying together in that office.

588
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,832
They were Ruby, Sapphire,
and Diamond tiers.

589
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,751
Doesn't it sound like a fairy tale?

590
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,922
It must've been upsetting, Nam-mo.

591
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,174
It's not something
for me to be upset about.

592
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,969
It's my mom who's struggling.

593
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,139
My mom

594
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,516
held my hand and cried.

595
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,687
She said she was sorry.

596
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,776
But, Tae-poong,
I'm not going down like this.

597
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,071
I'm the head of my household.

598
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,991
-I'll live a diligent life.
-Of course.

599
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,619
Although I'm not sure
what your mom's thinking.

600
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,372
Also, I'm seeing someone.

601
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,125
Of course. Although I'm not sure
how that woman feels…

602
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,211
What? Who is she?

603
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,922
There's this woman,
the prettiest woman you know.

604
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:52,220
She reminds me of an adorable deer
that drinks from a spring in a mountain

605
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:56,433
or a girl who lives in the Alps,
just 4,000 m above sea level.

606
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,976
Anyway, she's that pretty.

607
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,563
Why, you! Is it Ms. Oh?

608
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,774
She's more like a tigress from Jirisan!

609
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,693
Then who is this girl
who resembles the deer in the Alps?

610
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,905
Hey, go back to your job!
What do you know about love?

611
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,032
I can never tell what women are thinking.

612
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:15,077
You're just a fool
who only knows how to export.

613
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,539
I mean…

614
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,377
Don't you start dating after a kiss?

615
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,462
Are you out of your mind?
You need to marry her!

616
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,130
-Right?
-Who did you kiss?

617
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,217
-What?
-Why didn't you tell me? Who was it?

618
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,718
Is she pretty?

619
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,391
-Yes.
-Who is it? Tell me.

620
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:43,730
It can't be. Not the tigress from Jirisan.

621
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,441
Is it her?

622
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,026
Yes.

623
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,029
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

624
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,864
Man, this is crazy!

625
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,033
This is impossible.

626
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,792
Ms. Oh.

627
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,173
Right. Thank you.

628
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,099
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

629
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,811
Here, have some tea.

630
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,105
Thank you.

631
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:30,402
What's going on?
Why do you two look so close?

632
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,863
Actually, we are--

633
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,865
I came down with a cold.

634
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:38,577
Don't cough at me.
I don't want to catch it.

635
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,746
I'm sorry.

636
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,332
You're coughing? Then…

637
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,385
I didn't know she caught a cold.

638
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,263
Wait a second, Ms. Oh.

639
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,807
Let me get this from now on.

640
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:01,850
Huh? Why?

641
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,019
Ms. Oh? That doesn't sound right.

642
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:07,773
-What should I call you?
-What do you mean?

643
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,066
I mean,

644
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,111
we're now dating, so…

645
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,198
Mr. Kang.

646
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,576
When did we say we'd start dating?

647
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,872
Last night, we kissed…

648
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,750
The kiss?

649
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,918
It's not that…

650
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:33,715
People don't start dating
just because it happened once.

651
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,343
We don't do that in this day and age.

652
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,178
Then why did you kiss me?

653
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,349
-Were you toying with me?
-No, it's not that.

654
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,642
Are you coming?

655
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,353
-Should I do all the work?
-I'm coming.

656
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,731
-We'll talk later.
-Wait a second.

657
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:55,779
What about staying by my side?

658
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:05,247
What do you mean?
We're together at work and at home.

659
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,584
We should talk again later.

660
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,253
We're running late.

661
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,924
He didn't even ask me out,

662
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:19,636
so why does he suddenly think
that we're dating?

663
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,477
<i>Yes, I get it. I know the answer.</i>

664
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,271
She doesn't like you.

665
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,315
-Then why did she kiss me?
-Why do you chew gum?

666
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:36,027
-Because I get bored.
-That's exactly it. You know the answer.

667
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,738
Hey, you're way too slow.

668
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,199
No, it wasn't like that.

669
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:42,576
Jeez. You and your pride.

670
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,579
Goodness gracious. Hold on.

671
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,705
What time is it?

672
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:48,748
Wait, did you buy a cell phone?

673
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,376
Don't you have one?

674
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,754
You should get one.
How can you run a business without it?

675
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,506
Right. I have to go to your place today.

676
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,425
-My place? Why?
-Right? Why am I going?

677
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,677
Oh, it's to hang out with you.

678
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,429
-With me?
-Yes, I'll go there first.

679
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,097
Bye.

680
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,311
With me?

No.

686
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,722
I prefer memories over records.

687
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,957
Let's hang out, Tae-poong!

688
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,294
Hello.

689
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,463
Who's that?

690
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,591
Tae-poong said he'd be late.

691
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,009
Really?

692
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,178
That's weird.

693
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,099
I even brought some clothes for him.

694
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:57,687
I said I didn't want to buy them.
Why do you keep bothering me?

695
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,565
I got some for you too.

696
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:05,987
-Have you had dinner?
-No, I actually haven't eaten dinner.

697
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,324
-What is that?
-I'll show you later.

698
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,617
Goodness.

699
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,788
Wang Nam-mo.

700
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,503
Goodness, Mr. Wang.

701
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:28,426
You're even good at doing chores.
You're rather decent for a man.

702
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,263
I'll cook you a delicious meal, ma'am.

703
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:41,064
-You look great, Grandma.
-Yes, it looks great on you.

704
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:45,068
You look so cute. How adorable.

705
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,986
-This is nice.
-How cute.

706
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,489
I don't think these are right for me.

707
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,783
Hey, Beom. Don't you
know anything about hip-hop?

708
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,993
I don't. How is this called hip-hop?

709
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,412
You should thank him
for the thought. Sit down.

710
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,249
Okay. Fine. Thank you.

711
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:03,503
I don't see anything
that Tae-poong can wear.

712
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,298
Goodness.

713
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,677
-Are these mine?
-Yes, they're yours.

714
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,179
Thank you so much.
I can't wait to wear them.

715
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:15,014
I thought you were with Mr. Kang.

716
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:16,933
What? We left together.

717
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:20,520
Mi-seon. I got you some too.

718
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,648
This floral pattern
is the most popular in Dongdaemun now.

719
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,483
Give me those.

720
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,652
-Those are mine.
-Yes, give them to her.

721
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:28,820
Yes, these are yours.

722
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,197
-These look warm.
-These are tights.

723
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,657
-Yes, they're tights.
-Yes.

724
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,452
-You got socks and pants.
-These are for Mi-seon.

725
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,037
Here you go. Thank you for the food.

726
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,664
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

727
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,124
-Eat up.
-Thank you.

728
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,460
Grandma, go ahead.

729
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:49,424
-Have some rice.
-Watch it.

730
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,177
Beom, is that how you were raised?

731
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,762
-Come on.
-Eat some more.

732
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,725
-Make sure to chew carefully.
-Goodness.

733
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,560
-Have this, Beom.
-Goodness.

734
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,937
It's nice to eat with many people.

<i>Did she accept it?</i>

740
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,632
She said she'll think about it.

741
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:37,013
Now that she has accepted it,
her heart is bound to follow.

It's not so bad here, is it?

746
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,401
It's our first day,
so let's stay together.

747
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,912
There's way too much work to do.

748
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:57,635
Man, he was such a meticulous person.

749
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:01,556
Every inch is covered.

August 17th, 18th, 19th.

755
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,922
Did he rip out the next page
because there were errors?

756
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,865
Where's my IOU?

757
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,826
My promissory note.

758
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,789
I can't find it.

759
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:21,552
End-of-the-day mark.

760
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:24,639
This is crossed out.

761
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,934
"Data entry error. Next page."

762
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,314
So, he would never rip out a page
even if he made errors.

01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,530

764
