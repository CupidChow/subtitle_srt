00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,592
Aren't you glad we found a place
that's still open at this hour?

3
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:51,634
I agree.

4
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:57,307
Goodness, all of these are
in great condition.

5
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,894
Someone must love
ripe persimmons very much.

6
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,854
It's our CEO.

7
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,440
I want him to have some tomorrow.

8
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,277
That's why I have to pick out
the prettiest one.

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,576
-This one's pretty, isn't it?
-Yes, it's pretty.

10
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,078
That one's pretty. Careful.

11
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:24,667
<i>What did our CEO do so wrong</i>

12
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,004
How could you not show up at all?

13
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,466
Sure, you were busy.

14
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,177
So, you sent artificial flowers
because you were busy?

15
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,180
Artificial flowers, good grief!

16
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,683
Hello? Hey, what on earth?

17
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,602
This punk just hung up.

18
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,565
Darn it.

19
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,483
Yes.

20
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,735
This is what happened.

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,738
Mr. Kang came to the office

22
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,866
and told us he was sorry.

23
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,829
He had no reason to be sorry.

24
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,582
{\an8}I… Sure.

25
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,878
I don't think I can talk now.

26
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,485
Why…

27
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,071
Why was he sorry?

28
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,582
Jin-young,

29
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,543
how was life for you?

30
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,922
I wanted to ask after we got a bit older.

31
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,305
Fare… Farewell.

32
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,140

Do you see how these flowers are falling?

51
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:24,949

-Yes, sign here. The envelopes are…
-We're actually here

-Hey, wait!

-Hey, let go of this!

I'm the CEO of a company

81
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,976
He still has an unpaid balance.

82
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,519
Unpaid balance?

83
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,062
What's wrong?

84
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,814
Don't you know what it is?

85
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,607
He owes me money!

86
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,570
Everyone in the industry heard
Mr. Kang went under

87
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,155

88
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,158
What can I do?
I've got no choice but to take that.

89
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,661
Or you can pay me right now.

90
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,831
Sir, you can't do this here.

91
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,710
Hey, let's talk it out, okay?
And just leave that alone.

-Take it.
-Yes, sir.

102
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,775
{\an8}Should I really let this go?

103
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,903
He must've been that desperate.

104
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,489
He must be so desperate

105
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,742
that he has no time to say his goodbyes
to a business partner

106
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,287

107

-Yes, sir.

113
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,639
-No, you can't!
-He told us to take it!

114

This isn't our company's fund.
It belongs to Mr. Kang's family.

00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,025
Do you realize taking this is theft?

133
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,613

You're just a girl who runs bank errands.

He said he'll think about it.

{\an8}and had pork <i>galbi </i>together.

177
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,426
{\an8}He called himself a big success

178
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,929
{\an8}after getting this car.

179
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,517
{\an8}He rarely smiled, but he did on that day.

180
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,025
{\an8}Mom.

181
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,111
{\an8}Don't you worry about a thing.

182
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,738
You know I'm an all-rounder, right?

183
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:27,908
Except for parking.

184
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,411
Of course, I do.

185
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,915
I raised you into a man
who's good at everything.

186
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,721
<i>No.</i>

187
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,056
Tae-poong, wait. Hold on.

188
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,058
No, you have to turn it the other way.

189
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,059
-Right now?
-Yes.

190
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,227
-Just…
-Okay.

191
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,062
-No, wait.
-Okay. I got it.

192
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,564
-Do it slowly.
-Okay.

193
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,107
Do it slowly.

194
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,817
-Be careful.
-Oh, my, hold on.

195
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,322
-Okay. We're here now.
-It's okay.

196
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,657
-You can do this.
-I got it now.

197
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,410
-Do I go left now?
-Yes.

198
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,830
-Turn it to the left side.
-The left?

199
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,748
-The left.
-Wait.

200
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,957
No, not all the way.

201
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,626
No, stop steering. Stop!

202
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,960
Stop!

203
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,927
<i>This is why</i>

204
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,180
your dad should've bought you a car
a long time ago.

205
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,182
Why was that so hard for him?

206
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,642
He would never listen.

207
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,442
Don't be alarmed. You're fine.

208
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,612
Why are you looking back? Careful.

209
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,615
Wait. You're about to crash!

210
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,532
-Stop!
-No!

211
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,660
Stop the car! Stop.

212
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,708
Did you crash into it?

213
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,626
I don't know.

214
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,336
Are you okay?

215
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:03,963
Yes, I'm fine.

216
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,933
-What are you doing?
-My gosh.

217
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,559
Where are you going at this hour?

218
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,312
Oh.

219
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,107
-A job interview.
-What job interview?

220
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,276
I thought you passed
all three interviews with Korea Airways?

221
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,782
It's not that.

222
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,871
It's just so absurd.

223
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,625
My recruitment got canceled.

224
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,086
Something about the IMF crisis.

225
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,048
What? Canceled?

226
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,676
I shouldn't sit around,
so I'll just get a part-time job.

227
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,058
I can't believe it.

228
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,810
It's the first cancellation they've done,

229
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,812
and it happened to be me.

230
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,397
How ridiculous.

231
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,404
-You need to see this, Deputy Manager.
-Take a look.

232
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,947
How can they do this to us?

233
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:12,948
PERSONNEL TRANSFER NOTICE

234
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,575
-What do we do now?
-My gosh.

235
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,287
Don't you think this is too much?

236
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,833
Pull yourself together, everyone.

237
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,752
Let us not panic.

238
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,920
But remember.

239
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,590
Don't sign the resignation blindly.

240
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,676
Are they allowed to do this?

241
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,970
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

242
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,305
-That's my desk!
-Wait!

243
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,473
-Drop it!
-Stop them.

244
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,683
-Let it go!
-You can't do this!

245
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,851
Drop the desk!

246
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,353
Let it go! Why are you taking this?

247
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,315
-Our lives are at stake!
-Stop it!

248
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,637
Hey.

249
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,180
Mr. Typhoon.

250
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,726
Why don't you ever cry?

251
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,938
If you don't cry when you need to,

252
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,357
you'll fall ill sooner or later.

253
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,817
No reason.

254
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,486
The tears won't come.

255
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,990
I'm not sure if I'm sad or angry.

256
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,121
I guess I haven't decided yet.

257
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,041
Hey, look at me.

258
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,793
Will you look at me?

259
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,926
I can't tell what this punk is thinking.

260
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,719
You used to be transparent.

261
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,270
I have to put on a suit
to go to an office, right?

262
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,564
No idea. I've never been to one.

263
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,691
What are you supposed to wear?

264
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,527
I should look as formal as possible.

265
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,159
FOR SALE
FOR LEASE

266
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,161
ON SALE
EVERYTHING HALF OFF

267
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,933
TYPHOON TRADING

268
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,059
They all resigned.

269
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,437
Don't you think this is too much?

270
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,938
Did they even find a job?

271
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,857
Everyone is getting fired these days.

272
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,818
Kids these days have zero commitment.

273
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,361
Kids born after 1970

274
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,532
all need to shave their heads
and get a mental reform.

275
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,409
I was born in 1968,
the Year of the Monkey.

276
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,245
There's no use in holding back
those who left.

277
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,414
Let's wrap up our deal
with Daebang Textile,

278
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,917
and find enough money to pay out
our overdue salary.

279
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,168
Wait a second.

280
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,504
We got an order for 50,000 m,
so how much is that worth?

281
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,382
Hey, how much was it per meter?

282
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,051
Give me a moment.

283
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,012
I'm in charge of logistics,

284
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,306
-so I don't know the unit price.
-Wait.

285
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,099
It was 112,400,000 won,

286
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,684
excluding the value-added tax.

287
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,856
Right.

288
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,985
It's a relief we paid Italy up front.

289
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,320
Think of the exchange rate.

290
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,072
Just the thought makes me shudder.

291
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,282
It was 907 won
when we signed the contract,

292
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,035
but I saw that
it was 1,080 won this morning!

293
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,871
Mr. Kang made a few advance payments
out of his pocket.

294
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,458
He worked so freaking hard on it,

295
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,460
but now he's gone.

296
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,713
Do apartment units in his area

297
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,968
cost about 200 million won per 34 <i>pyeong?</i>

298
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,178
That's what we call a bubble.

299
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,472
It has already dropped by 20 million won.

300
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,100
Even the rich
can't live through the IMF crisis.

301
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,644
Why don't we do this?

302
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,480
Let's all go down together, okay?

303
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,816
It'll feel awful if only the poor go down.

304
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,904
Isn't that Mr. Kang's

305
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,572
son?

306
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,661
Mr. Kang's son?

307
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,539
What's he wearing?

308
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,958
Look at how he's dressed.

309
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,334
What's he wearing inside?

310
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,050
He's dressed like Solid.

311
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,386
My gosh. Just like Solid.

312
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,889
Pass him a cue stick or something.

313
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,641
He's dressed like a pop star.

314
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,227
Is he here to treat us
after wrapping up the funeral?

315
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,312
Jeez, dummy.

316
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,230
It wasn't an occasion to celebrate.

317
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,277
Good morning.

318
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,407
What brings you here?

319
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,371
I came to get my father's stuff.

320
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,710
We should tell him, right?

321
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,796
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

322
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,047
Since he's already here,

323
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,841
let's tell him we'll be getting money
from Daebang Textile.

324
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,967
Of course.

325
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,720
Mr. Kang was also behind on his paychecks,

326
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,597
and he even made a few payments himself.

327
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,973
Wait a second.

328
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,351
Let's think this out first,

329
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,395
then give him
whatever Mr. Kang's portion is.

330
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,857
I mean, what if Mr. Kang's son
uses his status as heir

331
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,694
to take away all company assets
and close down the business?

332
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,947
-Who'll take responsibility?
-He wouldn't.

333
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,449
He's not that smart.

334
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,660
Remember the huge fuss
when he went to college?

335
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,370
Oh, right.

336
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,998
TYPHOON TRADING

337
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,877
Knock everything down!

338
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,883
Typhoon Trading must be doing great.

339
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,303
You're sitting here
with the heater on in this IMF crisis.

340
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,684
Not only couldn't I pay my employees here,

341
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,019
but they now have nothing to eat at home.

342
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,147
Hey, actually,

343
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,275
I served in the Marines,
so let's talk man-to-man.

344
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,319
You can't suddenly barge in here
without an appointment--

345
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,487
Suddenly?

346
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,156
-I barged in suddenly?
-My gosh!

347
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,407
-Suddenly?
-Hey, man!

348
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,242
-Why are you doing this?
-Oh, my gosh.

349
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:13,326
Hey.

350
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,828
Where's that smart girlie?

351
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:17,330
-Hey, you, bookkeeper.
-Me?

352
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,540
-Get over here.
-Wait!

353
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,000
{\an8}CONTRACT

354
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,084
{\an8}Look.

355
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,587
{\an8}You must have nothing to say now.
Give me my money!

356
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,048
Hey, it's not like we have cash
piled up in our office!

357
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,634
Sure, of course not.

358
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,721
I'm not that ignorant.

359
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,931
Now, look.

360
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,686
This joint surety says
you'll pay me until a certain date.

361
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,271
{\an8}JOINT SURETY

362
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,106
{\an8}I need you to sign this.

363
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,357
Who's the CEO here?

364
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,860
Who's Mr. Kang's replacement?

365
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,570
Who is it?

366
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,531
-What's wrong with you?
-I won't let this go!

367
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,122
I'll sign that joint surety.

368
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,666
You're his son.

369
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,959
What right do you have?

370
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,670
What do you do here?

371
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,715
I'm an employee.

372
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,091
An employee? Since when?

373
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,969
-Today.
-Fine.

374
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,888
Sign it.

375
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,392
-I must find a collateral.
-You can't…

376
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,895
This was the CEO's office, right?

377
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,033
This is the lease contract
for this office.

378
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,744
An office this size in Ulchiro
can serve as collateral.

379
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:42,666
Move aside.

380
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,586
Give that back. That was my father's.

381
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,673
I said I'd take responsibility.

382
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,925
Hey, Tae-poong.

383
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,677
Deals always come with conditions.

384
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,137
It'll be more bizarre if I left,

385
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,474
just trusting the words
of a mere employee.

386
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:02,602
{\an8}When someone is nice to you for no reason,

387
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,105
{\an8}stay suspicious and see
what they're hiding up their sleeve.

388
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:06,481
Got it?

389
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,777
Also, it's now

390
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,030
your responsibility
to retrieve this from me.

391
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,908
-You still can't…
-Let's go.

392
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,744
Darn it.

393
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,707
-That hurts!
-Darn it!

394
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,586
-So…
-Man.

395
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,174
Anyway, what's he going to do?

396
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,093
Doesn't he know
how scary a joint surety is?

397
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,886
What if he doesn't know what it is?

398
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,471
This is big trouble.

399
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,767
Can we handle the payout once we get
the money from Daebang Textile?

400
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,187
He looks like the type
who interferes without thinking.

401
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,942
-What are you doing?
-Mi-seon.

402
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,360
Why are you going in?

403
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,611
He has to sign this.

404
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,865
If he's planning to work here,
I need his paperwork.

405
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,458
CEO'S OFFICE

406
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,045
You know, she scares me the most.

407
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,380
That isn't nosiness or ambition.
What is that?

408
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,050
Devotion for the company.

409
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,386
Devotion for her company?

410
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,181
EMPLOYMENT RECORD CARD

411
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,774
-I'm the bookkeeper--
-Yes, and I'm Tae-poong.

412
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:35,820
I'm Oh Mi-seon.

413
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,697
Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

414
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,324
Bookkeeper Oh Mi-seon.

415
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,786
-So, your name is Oh Mi-seon.
-Yes.

416
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,913
This is…

417
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,707
Please fill out
the employment record card.

418
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,467
NAME: KANG TAE-POONG

419
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,596
BIRTHDATE

420
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,730
So…

421
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,233
What else do I--

422
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,568
Your qualifications.

423
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,197
SON

424
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,577
It means certifications and licenses.

425
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,997
It was just for laughs.

426
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,336
TAE KWON DO DAN 3

427
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,841
-Is that enough?
-Yes, that should be enough.

428
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,800
Okay.

429
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,555
I look forward to working together,
Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

430
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,460
Why is there so much?

431
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,129
Jeez.

432
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Why won't this light up?

433
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:32,687
Mom.

434
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,398
Mom?

435
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,692
Mom.

436
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,988
My gosh! Come on!

437
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,823
-Goodness!
-Gosh!

438
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,325
Oh, my gosh.

439
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,787
Why did you suddenly barge in?

440
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,622
What's all this, Mom?

441
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,085
It's December,
and it'll be Christmas soon.

442
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,921
What do you think?

443
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,674
It's the mink coat your dad got me.

444
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,551
It looks great.

445
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,140
Our electricity got cut off.

446
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,936
So naturally,
the boiler stopped working, too.

447
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,729
You must be cold.

448
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,481
-Should I get you a jacket?
-What?

449
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,941
No, I'm fine.

450
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,236
Anyway,

451
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,323
-are we that broke?
-We are.

452
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,999
I seem like
such a fool without your dad, don't I?

453
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,550
You really are a fool, Mom.

454
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,427
-The phone is unplugged.
-No, don't touch that!

455
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:48,888
What?

456
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,765
It works without electricity?

457
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,933
-Hello?
-No!

458
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,852
<i>You fucking assholes!</i>

459
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,937
<i>Are you enjoying your life</i>
<i>after stealing my money?</i>

460
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,189
<i>-Give me my--</i>
-Goodness. What now?

461
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,318
Are you in shock?

462
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,320
Are you all right? Oh, no.

463
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,615
Yes, I'm fine. My friends and I

464
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,451
also swear at each other
and call each other punks.

465
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,621
-I'm fine. Yes.
-You are?

466
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,587
It's cold right now.
Should we eat something?

467
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,463
No, I have to go back to the office

468
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,799
-to grab some stuff.
-Right. I see.

469
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,010
Why did Dad keep so much stuff?

470
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,054
That's what we call the stain of time.

471
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,473
He was an organized guy,

472
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,560
but he practically lived there
for the last 26 years.

473
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,562
A lot of things must've piled up.

474
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,773
The stain of time?

475
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,610
Those books and logs he loved so much.

476
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,071
All of those are who he is.

477
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,163
Anyway, Mom, don't pick up those calls.

478
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,581
I'll pick them up now.

479
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,833
It's okay. I unplugged it.

480
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,251
Good job.

481
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,086
Let's put this on together.

482
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,671
It's too cold.

483
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,381
Oh, gosh.

484
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,592
You must be cold.

485
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,178
Do we have more candles?

486
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,096
No, these are all.

487
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,121
COLLEGE SCHOLASTIC ABILITY TEST

488
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,499
Why is this so clean?

489
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,170
PAST EXAM QUESTIONS, LANGUAGE ARTS

490
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,807
What are you doing?

491
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:58,935
What is this?

492
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,145
Didn't you take the test?

493
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,857
Why not?

494
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,776
I can't afford to study.

495
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,320
Hey, worry about yourself.

496
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,489
If they canceled
the recruitment this year,

497
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,157
they'll hire again next year.

498
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,245
I said I'd do anything
to pay for your tuition.

499
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,164
I'll support you just as you supported me.

500
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,583
You aren't my mom or dad!

501
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,460
Why do you keep carrying all the burden?

502
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,463
I'll do whatever I can to pay you back!

503
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,508
Stop doing this.

504
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,552
-Get up, Mi-seon.
-Let go of me.

505
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:33,678
-No!
-Darn it!

506
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:49,110
Of course, you have to pay me back,
you silly human.

507
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,741
What about your studies?

508
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,996
Everything I studied is still mine.

509
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,667
Everything is in my head.

510
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,626
I'm fine.

511
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,549
Mi-seon.

512
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,009
It's okay. Don't cry.

513
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,343
Don't cry. I'm fine.

514
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,828
What is this mess?

515
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:46,000
Everything is a wreck at home and at work.

516
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,347
Look at that.

517
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,402
-Mister.
-Yes?

518
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,571
Mr. Typhoon!

519
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,906
Hey, I knew it was you.

520
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,450
-I got you first.
-Whatever.

521
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,293
-A secret safe?
-Yes.

522
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,628
Hey.

523
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,256
What if there are gold bars inside?

524
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,300
That'd be so great.

525
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,223
Hey, I heard my dad's business
had an unpaid balance.

526
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,557
Do you know what that is?

527
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,310
Yes, something that's not paid.
Otherwise, it would be paid.

528
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,187
-It'd be nice if we could pay it back.
-What?

529
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,607
-I should tell people at work, right?
-Why?

530
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,569
The safe is there
because there's a secret.

531
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,990
If it's a secret,
I shouldn't see it either, right?

532
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,619
No matter what you find,
take it to your grave.

533
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,915
-Anyway, will you keep working there?
-No.

534
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,877
I'll return to the plant nursery
once everything wraps up.

535
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,796
But it was your dad's business.

536
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,547
Exactly. It wasn't mine.

537
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:47,056
Anyway, why are you drinking liquor
in that big glass?

538
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,269
My dear mother, Ms. Kim,
was placed on standby at work.

539
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,311
On standby?

540
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,106
She's sitting out in the hallway all day
in this cold.

541
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,987
I told her to quit,
but she kept insisting on staying.

542
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,036
But I still have one more big hit waiting.

543
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,413
What now?

544
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,623
What is it?

545
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,250
What? Did you pass the preliminaries?

546
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,335
-Yes, I did!
-Really?

547
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,962
Once I pass the final audition,

548
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:22,008
then I'll debut and perform
here, there, and everywhere, kid.

549
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,301
Hey, man. Guys!

550
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,386
He's going to be a singer! Come here.

551
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,138
Nam-mo is going to be a singer!

552
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:28,723
-Look at you!
-Hey, stop it!

553
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,892
-You're ruining my hair!
-Those broke punks are too loud.

554
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,772
My man, Tae-poong,

555
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,109
still won't shut up
even after his family went under.

556
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,529
Let's just ignore him.

557
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,325
Hey, sidekick.

558
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,368
You, sidekick.

559
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:52,371
Hey.

560
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,081
Aren't you sick and tired of him?

561
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,462
That's not Yu-rim…

562
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,297
I get it. You got dumped again.

563
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,257
That girl?

564
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,551
I have a lot to say about her.

565
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,556
Her dad signed a joint surety by mistake
and got locked up or something.

566
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,141
How pathetic is that?

567
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,895
You two can check in on her
since you're all broke now.

568
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,481
Hey, Tae-poong.

569
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,193
Let's go.

570
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,863
Your mom will be worried.

571
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:28,991
Okay.

572
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,534
Good one.

573
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,912
Kids are like that these days.

574
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,416
They don't have a shred of compassion.

575
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,549
MY COMPUTER

576
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,885
HUNMIN JEONGEUM PROCESSOR

577
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,064
You've reached Typhoon Trading.
Go Ma-jin speaking.

578
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,150
Goodness!

579
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,194
I can't believe
you called me yourself, sir.

580
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,782
I passed that to the manager.

581
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,950
It's 11:30 a.m.

582
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,618
Let's have our meeting before lunch.

583
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,999
About the fabric from Italy.

584
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,209
Yesterday,

585
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,004
I sent the belated statements
to Incheon Port.

586
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,715
Will it be delivered in two days
if it comes into port today?

587
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:11,177
Yes, we can make it
if it leaves Incheon right away.

588
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,555
We'll be in big trouble
if this goes wrong.

589
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,348
You know, right?

590
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,225
We're going to go bankrupt.

591
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,603
Why do you say that?
Are you trying to jinx us?

592
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,063
Going bankrupt? Words have power!

593
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,565
Ms. Cha.

594
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,276
-Knock on wood!
-Fine. Knocking.

595
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,777
Be careful with your words.

596
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,946
I'm just saying this is that important.

597
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,949
Once we get paid by Daebang Textile,

598
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,786
calculate Mr. Kang's portion
and hand it over.

599
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,788
Yes, we should do that.

600
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:41,665
Gosh.

601
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,084
I went to Tae-poong's…

602
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,669
Yes?

603
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,880
Oh, my. He's a grown-up now.

604
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:53,928
I mean, Mr. Kang,
I attended your first birthday party.

605
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,346
Do you remember, Mr. Koo?

606
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,806
You grabbed money back then.

607
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,225
-Isn't that right?
-He did.

608
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,520
Yes, I see. Thank you.

609
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,356
My goodness.

610
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,614
By the way,

611
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:20,579
what would you say are the most important
four digits for Typhoon Trading?

612
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,304
-Let's get back to work.
-Right.

613
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:38,931
I'm starving.

614
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,315
Jeez.

615
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,193
They dodged the question.

616
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,786
A GREAT PLAN FOR 100 YEARS

617
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,705
What about lunch, Tae-poong?

618
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,456
We're getting <i>chueotang.</i>

619
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,543
I'll get a hamburger.
I don't really like <i>chueotang.</i>

620
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,877
You're having bread?

621
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,462
-Eat some rice.
-Enjoy your lunch.

622
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,841
He doesn't know
the basics of corporate life.

623
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,802
Excuse me.

624
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,347
Why did you want to know
the important numbers?

625
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,976
For training purposes.

626
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,023
Two, zero, seven, two.

627
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,191
-What?
-Did you notice

628
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,110
the calligraphy in the meeting room?

629
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,654
"A great plan for 100 years."

630
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:39,283
Mr. Kang had a dream to make a business
that'll last 100 years.

631
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:42,119
So, the 100th year would be the year 2072.

632
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,912
So it's 2, 0, 7, and 2.

633
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,249
That's just my take.

634
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,461
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Thanks. Enjoy your lunch.

635
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,796
Do you like <i>chueotang?</i>

636
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:56,800
-No.
-Why would you go if you don't like it?

637
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,302
Have lunch with me.

638
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,764
We must move as a team at work
even if you don't like it.

639
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,015
It's a part of your job.

640
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,520
Going to lunch is a part of work?

641
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,685
Wedding anniversary?

642
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,314
Mom's birthday.

643
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,364
A stethoscope?
What is this? Why did Nam-mo give me this?

644
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,035
Okay.

645
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,498
Please cut open.

646
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,669
Darn it! It won't even budge.

647
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,594
<i>Two, zero, seven, two.</i>

648
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,348
Two, zero, seven, two.

649
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,186
Did it just work?

650
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,001
SAVINGS ACCOUNT

651
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:03,886
Cha Seon-taek.

652
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,556
Oh Mi-seon.

653
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,436
Go Ma-jin.

654
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,397
Bae Song-jung.

655
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,903
KANG TAE-POONG
FOR HIS WISH

656
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,590
KANG TAE-POONG

657
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:58,982
September.

658
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,734
October. November.

659
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:01,652
SALES TAX INVOICE

660
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,450
I don't see Tae-poong today.

661
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,035
He's a temp anyway.

662
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,954
I guess he'd rather eat at home.

663
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,122
I'm jealous he gets to eat at home.

664
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:20,045
He finally wore himself down
after making that huge scene.

665
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,714
Well, kids these days are all like him.

666
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,550
Let's eat lunch. What should we eat?

667
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:28,011
-How about <i>chueotang?</i>
-I'm so sick of it.

668
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,513
-<i>Seolleongtang.</i>
-Goodness.

669
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,599
-How about pork cutlet?
-We have to eat rice.

670
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,767
Ms. Oh Mi-seon!

671
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,270
Let's have lunch together today.

672
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:38,689
Me?

673
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,077
-Enjoy your lunch.
-It's still hot.

674
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,088
You can talk to me.

675
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,260
You must have something to say to me.

676
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:22,357
It's kind of funny
to say something like this here,

677
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:24,818
but please help me.

678
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,031
You're the only one I can ask for help.

679
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,117
Well…

680
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,537
I want to learn how to do my job.

681
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,626
I want to know what my duties are

682
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,086
and what I need to do right now.

683
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,379
Something like that.

684
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,216
Why all of a sudden?

685
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,593
I thought about it

686
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,303
and realized that

687
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:56,683
I probably wanted my father's approval.

688
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,562
However,

689
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,941
I'm finally getting the feel
of what my father…

690
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,322
deemed as important.

691
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:13,950
And what is that?

692
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,828
Typhoon Trading.

693
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,246
Well…

694
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,252
That's why

695
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,589
I want to be a part of this company.

696
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,258
A true employee

697
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,135
of Typhoon Trading.

698
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,520
I have to stop by somewhere,
so you can go first.

699
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,772
-Sure. Thank you for lunch.
-Sure.

700
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:46,900
And…

701
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:52,364
Mr. Kang left a few last words.

702
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,829
Mi-seon.

703
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,205
Yes? What is it?

704
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,043
Tae-poong will…

705
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,299
do a good job.

706
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,178
So, please…

707
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,725
Please look after him.

708
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,697
"He'll do a good job."

709
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,950
That's what he said.

710
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,618
He said you'd do a good job.

711
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,414
Jeez.

712
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,584
My dad…

713
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,836
Why couldn't he have waited?

714
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,301
Thank you for hearing
his last words for me.

715
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:56,052
-Sure. See you later.
-Bye.

00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:11,318
Hello, are the business cards done?

717
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,945

-That should do.
-I'll send it over, then.

759
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,966
-Here's the sales statement.
-Sure.

-Check the departure time.
-Sure.

762
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,183
-I talked to Mr. Baek.
-Here.

763
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,852
All right.
Tell them that we'll leave soon.

764
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,353
I'm sorry I'm late.

765
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:02,025
My goodness. What happened to him?

766
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,444
What's going on?

767
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,906
Who's that?

768
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,617
He's unrecognizable.

769
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,244
-That wasn't his style.
-Oh, my.

770
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,288
My goodness.

771
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,920
Should we ask where he's going?

772
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,131
What a great beauty.

773
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,591
You're a good-looking man.

774
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,178
Don't people say that to women?

775
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:32,013
He often uses expressions
he isn't sure of.

776
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,058
Are you leaving for a delivery
to Daebang Textile?

777
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,267
Yes, right.

778
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:37,852
Yes, I am.

779
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,605
May I come along?

780
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:19,727
Why do you two have to come here with me?

781
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,521
I should come as the rookie.

782
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,232
The fax is broken, so I couldn't send
the detailed statement,

783
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:25,859
and we have to get paid quickly.

784
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:29,237
A day of delay won't put us in trouble.

785
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,198
-You're so inflexible.
-It's better not to be late.

786
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,423
-Hello.
-Hello.

787
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,803
Please be careful.

788
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,973
-It's luxury fabric, so don't scratch it.
-Okay.

789
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,435
Yes, okay.

790
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,769
You can load them.

791
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,195
A bit higher. Okay.

792
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,242
{\an8}Have you been well?

793
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,830
What is this? You don't have to do this.

794
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,081
What is that?

795
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,791
Cigarettes? I'm not sure.

796
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,419
We should be glad
if we have any job at all.

797
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,338
The country has gone down.

798
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,714
Tell me about it.

799
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:31,508
How long will it take today?

800
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,260
The roads
aren't crowded these days, right?

801
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,182
-Who are they?
-Them?

802
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,309
-Hello.
-He's Mr. Kang's son.

803
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,144
You don't have to mind him.

804
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,688
There's no way he'll last long.

805
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,441
Mr. Go Ma-jin.

806
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,360
Who are you to judge that?

807
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:56,991
-Hey.
-Mr. Kim!

808
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,826
Come here.

809
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,287
-Me?
-Come here.

810
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,247
Yes, sir.

811
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,165
Come here.

812
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,501
Hey,

813
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,419
I like the look in your eyes.

814
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,341
But you know, this is a rough job.

815
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,218
It'll be tough.

816
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,597
But consider yourself dead
and hang in there.

817
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,726
Then you'll live to see tomorrow
after a tough day today.

818
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,811
Yes, sir.

819
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,271
-I understand, sir.
-Good.

820
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,774
All right. Let's get going.

821
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,360
Don't let the gas run dry. Let's go!

822
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,780
Off you go!

823
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,073
Drive safely!

824
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,786
This way, please.

825
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,788
Please drive safely!

826
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,790
Goodbye!

827
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:50,211
Oh, my.

828
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,088
Did he leave without us?

829
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,258
We should get going, too.

830
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,261
To 1-15 Nam-ri, Nongong-eup, Dalseong-gun.

831
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,305
Do you always memorize addresses?

832
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,788
Any music you like?

833
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,875
Hey, turn right 200 m ahead.

834
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,543
-Exit at three o'clock.
-Where?

835
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,629
This way. Yes.

836
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,713
-At your three o'clock.
-Now?

837
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,298
Yes, right now. This way.

838
01:00:35,381 --> 01:00:36,758
-Wait.
-Turn right.

839
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:37,800
This is it.

840
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:40,845
Okay.

841
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,773
Wait.

842
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,149
Hey. Watch it.

843
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,442
Take it slow.

844
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,819
-Slowly!
-Oh, no, it's fine.

845
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,237
Should I look?

846
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,156
-No, wait. Goodness.
-We're here. Stop.

847
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,991
We're here. That was perfect.

848
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,036
-Did you park it straight?
-Yes.

849
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,579
It's so perfect.

850
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:07,789
Please step out.

851
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,333
My heart is racing.

852
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,635
I guess we got here first.

853
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:22,887
You were so good with the map.

854
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,140
-Goodness. Hello.
-Hello.

855
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:27,642
You must be from Typhoon Trading.

856
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,185
Yes.

857
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,146
Where's the fabric?

858
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,231
We got here first.

859
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,609
Is that so?

860
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,528
Well, it's a chilly day.

861
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,154
-Come in for a cup of tea.
-Sure.

862
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,197
-Okay.
-Let's go.

863
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,785
Wasn't the drive quite long?

864
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,286
-It really was.
-I see.

865
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,871
But there was no traffic,

866
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,082
-so we came quickly.
-She's like a map.

867
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,502
I brought the detailed statement.

868
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:56,754
-I see.
-May I fax it over with the receipt?

869
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,424
Of course. Our office is right over there,

870
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,675
-so go ahead.
-Okay.

871
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,760
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

872
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,558
Where's the fax machine?

873
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,767
-Over here.
-Right.

874
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,768
This way, please.

875
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,901
I hear Daebang Textile has a long history.

876
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,364
I started here when I was 23,
so it's been over 30 years.

877
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,408
I see.

878
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:30,580
-And has it always been here?
-Yes, that's right.

879
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,083
The factory over there
was built 15 years ago.

880
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,212
Oh, right. Let me run over
to grab the seal and the receipt.

881
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:39,756
-Okay.
-Yes, sure.

882
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,399
<i>You really are a fool, Mom.</i>

883
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,818

-No! Don't touch that!

888
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,961
He was an organized guy,

889
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,089
but he practically lived there
for the last 26 years.

890
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,841
A lot of things must've piled up.

891
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,478
Ms. Oh, something seems odd.

892
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:37,230
What is?

893
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,982
Things are too quiet and clean.

894
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,318
It's nice.

895
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,903
That's not what I mean.

896
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,032
It's the stain of time.

897
01:03:48,115 --> 01:03:48,950
I don't see that.

898
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,496
It can't be this neat
if they were around for 30 years.

899
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,748
There are no sent faxes,

900
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,209
and there's nothing
in the trash cans, either.

901
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,211
And the fax machine that broke down

902
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,047
isn't ours, but theirs.

903
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,757
Look at the plug over there.

904
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,050
It's pulled out.

905
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:07,802
You're right.

906
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,346
It means they cannot accept calls.

907
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:14,600
Or there must be something
that they want to hide,

908
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:15,768
like ledgers.

909
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:21,774
Isn't it a bit cold in here?

910
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,317
I know it's winter,

911
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:27,071
but it must be uncomfortable to work
in such thick winter jackets.

912
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,874
-Don't send the fax.
-What?

913
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,709
What do you mean?

914
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:42,044
Do not stamp the seal, okay?

915
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,047
Please trust me this once. Please? Okay?

916
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,549
Where are you going? Hey.

917
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:05,795
What's going on?

918
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,637
You can't go. Turn around!

919
01:06:17,682 --> 01:06:19,767
Hey! Move aside!

920
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:21,227
We cannot

921
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,563
deliver those to Daebang Textile!

922
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:33,698
Move!

923
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:37,785
What's with that man?

924
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:39,537
What's with him?

925
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:43,958
What the heck, Mr. Kang?

926
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:47,795
One moment, sir.

927
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,758
-Daebang…
-What?

928
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,802
-No.
-What?

929
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:55,886
What's that?

930
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,514
We shouldn't deliver those to Daebang.

931
01:06:58,597 --> 01:06:59,974
Why do you say so?

932
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:01,976
-Do they not want it?
-No, not that.

933
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:04,854
It's not that.

934
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,313
Something is off.

935
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,566
-Is that so?
-Yes.

936
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,651
What the heck is this nonsense?

937
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,571
Do you think you can joke around at work?

938
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,156
Hey!

939
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:16,866
What's going on?

940
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:17,867
Are we going or not?

941
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:18,951
One second, sir.

942
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,619
I'm so sorry.

943
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,996
We'll go.

944
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,123
Do you know how much this is worth?

945
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,293
Jeez, you must be drunk.

946
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,962
Have you gone crazy? Move it!

947
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,505
-Just move it.
-Wait.

948
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,132
No, we can't go.

949
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,217
If we deliver those, we'll end up…

950
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,636
Yes, unpaid balance. We won't get paid.

951
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,057
-Stop jinxing this and just get lost!
-No.

952
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,808
-Just get lost!
-Please!

953
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:44,435
We won't get paid!

954
01:07:44,518 --> 01:07:46,228
I told you to get lost!

955
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,563
Good grief!

956
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:50,024
No.

957
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:51,776
We cannot go.

958
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,235
We just can't.

959
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,200
I get it now.

960
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,495
You are a total nutjob.

961
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:04,747
Just drive over him, sir.

962
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,333
He'll get scared and move.

963
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,959
-Really?
-Yes.

964
01:08:10,544 --> 01:08:12,254
Should I just drive over him?

965
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:14,715
Young man.

966
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,469
Try to stay if you can.

967
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,574
I'm not scared.

968
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:44,245
I'm not scared at all.

969
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:59,695
How pretty.

970
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:01,864
Dad…

971
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:29,475
ASPHALT MAN

972
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,344
TYPHOON FAMILY

973
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,846
{\an8}<i>I don't know which company</i>
<i>you'll end up in,</i>

974
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,014
{\an8}<i>but they'll be tortured.</i>

975
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,307
{\an8}-Excuse me.
-My gosh!

976
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:12,268
{\an8}<i>I suppose you don't use this often?</i>

977
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,310
{\an8}It's rather run-down.

978
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:15,479
{\an8}<i>Why don't we return it?</i>

979
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:18,440
{\an8}Even after 30% fees,
we still end up with a profit.

980
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,234
{\an8}<i>Are you interested?</i>

981
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:21,986
{\an8}-You feel fine, don't you?
-Yes.

982
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,237
{\an8}Oh, man.

983
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,363
{\an8}Mr. Kang!

984
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,823
{\an8}<i>I knew this would happen.</i>

985
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:28,117
{\an8}This contract is ridiculous.

986
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,994
{\an8}<i>I think we're really going under.</i>

987
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,496
{\an8}<i>It's not over yet.</i>

988
01:11:32,579 --> 01:11:34,373
{\an8}<i>No one can take this.</i>
