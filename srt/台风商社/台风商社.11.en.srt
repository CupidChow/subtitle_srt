00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,219
Where's my IOU?

3
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,681
My promissory note.

4
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,560
{\an8}I can't find it.

5
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,737
AUGUST 1989

6
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,784
It's just as I told Mr. Ha, sir.

7
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,998
Just look, Mr. Pyo.

8
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,376
There was a page
with records of loans right here,

9
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,463
so I tore it and destroyed it.

10
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,633
I went through everything daily

11
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,636
{\an8}since we were at the Ulchiro office,
but I couldn't find it.

12
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,640
That small scrap of paper can't have gone
anywhere on its own, can it?

13
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,810
I've searched everywhere,
but I still couldn't find it!

14
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,401
Are you sure Tae-poong doesn't have it?

15
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,822
Please think about it, Mr. Pyo.

16
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,365
We… I mean, no.

17
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,827
Typhoon Trading had to resort
to relocating to this old place.

18
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,246
Let's say Tae-poong has that note.

19
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,748
Do you think that hotheaded kid
would stay quiet?

20
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,792
He'd have caused a scene
at your office already.

21
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:13,258
As for the money you gave me,
I'll make sure to return it to you.

22
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,428
I wasn't in my right mind
when I accepted it.

23
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,227
-Here.
-Goodness.

25
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,564
I can't accept this.

26
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,941
Please don't put me on the spot like this.

27
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,404
I heard your husband's business
is struggling.

28
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:42,370
I'm saying that I don't know anything
about that promissory note you're after.

29
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,372
We won't make the same offer again.

30
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,712
-All right, then--
-Wait!

31
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,633
Could I have some time to think about it?

32
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,096
My financial situation is…
Well, it's in terrible shape.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,268
I swear I'll return every penny.

34
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,895
I've done enough, haven't I?

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,064
It's about time you gave up, all right?!

36
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,319
What's the matter?

37
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,573
I hear your husband's business went under.

38
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,826
Does it feel like it's all over now?
You thought wrong.

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,162
You have your kid.

40
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,206
That kid should get
to finish school, right?

41
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,876
-What are you--
-Stop squealing and find my note.

42
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,170
-Then we're all good.
-What do you…

43
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,507
What are you saying?

44
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,718
Why are you even mentioning my child?

45
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,470
Why are you dragging my kid into this?

46
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,808
Why would you mention my baby?!

47
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:48,811
Find it.

48
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,897
That's all I need.

49
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,899
{\an8}You're so sweet, Mi-ja.

50
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:42,740
{\an8}My goodness.

51
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:58,715
{\an8}Mi-ja, could you teach Beom
how to clean up his things?

Oh, dear.

55
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,505
-What are you doing?
-Hi.

56
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,633
I'm reviewing the ledgers
from the old office.

57
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,678
Look at this, Mom.

58
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,267
My gosh.

59
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,229
This must have been taken on the day
he signed the Ulchiro office's lease.

60
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,608
-They're Ms. Cha and Mr. Koo, right?
-Yes.

61
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,360
Tae-poong.

62
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,072
How are you holding up?

63
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,158
I'm amazed you decided
to move out of the office.

64
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,326
I'm fine.

65
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,370
I just feel bad for my dad
and the employees.

66
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,499
But I badly needed that deposit
to try something new.

67
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:20,963
You know what?

68
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,175
It's nice to have people around.

69
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,596
It felt like it was over for the company
in the empty Ulchiro office,

70
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,766
but now that I can hear
people breathing and conversing,

71
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,393
I finally feel at ease.

72
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,190
That's why people flock together
and form a village.

73
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,155
People watch the television,
read the newspapers,

74
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,075
and go to cinemas
just to see how other people are doing.

75
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,870
-Mom.
-Yes?

76
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,207
What do you think
troubled my dad that badly?

77
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,503
Well…

78
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,965
Everyone running a business
suffered greatly.

79
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,299
That's my point.

80
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,388
My dad wasn't the type

81
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,476
to crack under the pressure of work
or losing a client, was he?

-It's 24,500 won.

-What the… What is wrong with you?

96
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,081
Why would you pour the sauce
all over the <i>tangsuyuk?</i>

97
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,542
-To enjoy it juicy and moist.
-It'll be soggy!

98
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,377
How could you be so reckless?

99
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,046
This is unacceptable, man.

100
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,259
-Surely, it can't be such a big deal--
-Just look at what you've done!

00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,512

Take any more <i>tangsuyuk,</i>
and I'll hurt you.

Ms. Oh.

113
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,365
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

114
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,619
-What do you mean?
-You keep watching me.

115
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,537
You even gave me a <i>tangsuyuk</i> piece.

116
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,165
Because it was the piece you dropped.

117
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,916
Please stop liking me so much.

118
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,129
Oh, come on. It's not like that.

119
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,174
Tell him he's got it wrong.

120
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,759
Don't date, Ms. Oh.

121
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,094
Focus on your career
until I find one for you.

122
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,472
Then, you'll marry a nice man.

123
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,807
No, don't get married.
Enjoy your single life.

124
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,309
I'll do as you say.

125
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,603
That took a weight off my chest.

126
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,729
Why won't you tell them?

127
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,568
We're good colleagues, nothing more.

128
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,987
Please don't declare your love for me.

129
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:59,992
Don't order <i>tangsuyuk</i>
until we finish collecting the coupons.

130
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,994
We've almost reached our goal.

131
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,181

Look at him. Even Mr. Bae
comes in daily to work with us.

137
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,128
I'll have you know
that logistics requires a specialist.

138
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,380
It requires all sorts of expert knowledge.

139
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,882
Those with that expertise
are the top assets.

140
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,428
Come on, now. The company
can save a ton with one less employee.

141
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:08,018
What's this?

142
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,440
I've been reviewing the old ledgers.

143
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,317
But why? That's random.

144
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,364
Isn't this…

145
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,199

If you realize you put down

148
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,957
how do you generally proceed?

149
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:35,296
Supposing it was either a simple error
or that the order got canceled.

150
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,966
The golden rule was to strike it out
and get the late Mr. Kang's seal.

151
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,553
Or we reported the discrepancies
by the end of the month

152
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,306
and added an extra page
listing the corrections later.

153
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,185
Why? Did you find anything useful?

154
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,646
Hello?

155
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,815
Mr. Kang?

156
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,070
I couldn't find it.

157
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:20,007
I mean a deal that is stable,
dependable, and also lucrative.

158
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,510
I've had no luck yet.

159
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,720
So that's what you're after?

160
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:28,557
Such deals don't exist. Even if they did,
they'd never come our way.

161
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,017
If you think about it…

162
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,604
Government projects are still
the most reliable despite all this,

163
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,231
but it's not easy to sign them on.

164
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,484
-The government agencies?
-The public sector deals? Forget it.

165
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:41,612
We could never handle that now.
Only the large corporations do it.

166
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,696
Gosh, look at the time.

167
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,865
Oh, dear. I've got to go.

168
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,200
-Hey.
-"Public sector deals"?

169
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,119

to visit our partner company?

170
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,412
Oh, right.

It's called public procurement.

175
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,301
"Public procurement"?

176
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,567
Public procurement?

177
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,487
So, this is
the Public Procurement Service?

178
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,780
SAVE RESOURCES CAMPAIGN

179
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,907
I see tons of notices.

180
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,826
BID FOR DOMESTIC COMMODITIES

181
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,954
BID FOR FOREIGN COMMODITIES
BRIEFING ON "PLAINS OF HOPE"

182
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,664
This is tricky.

183
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:39,795
To my knowledge,
the PPS doesn't handle export.

184
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,755
There has to be something for us too.

185
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,592
I don't get why you brought me here.

186
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,344
You've always taken
Ms. Oh with you so far.

187
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,889
I asked you to come

188
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,018
because I haven't had time
to get to know you and stuff.

189
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,357
You know,

190
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,694
about Ms. Oh…

191
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,156
I know you two have
a special thing going on.

192
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,703
How can I miss it
when you're always together?

193
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,373
Oh, no. I wouldn't say

194
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,375
we've reached that level.

195
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,919
You're best friends, right?

196
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,713
So, about Ms. Oh.

197
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,300
Was she heartbroken by my demeanor?

198
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,010
-What the--
-Excuse me?

199
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:33,474
Oh, no. She wasn't heartbroken at all.

200
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,352
I believe men and women can be friends.

201
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,813
Please do all you can to console Ms. Oh.

202
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,106
Friends…

203
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,609
That's not how things are between us.

204
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,738
I hope you're not delusional
or think that everyone loves you.

205
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,740
-Sorry?
-You can hear me, can't you?

206
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,367
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

207
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,120
Could you direct me to the team
handling export-related projects?

208
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,414
I'm not sure if we have such projects.

209
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:01,961
Perhaps the Foreign Commodities Division?
Their office is over there.

210
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,754
-Okay, thank you.
-No problem.

211
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,798
Hello, I'm with KOICA.

212
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,303
{\an8}<i>"Bienvenue en Corée."</i>

213
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,889
Welcome to Korea.

214
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,516
KOICA?

215
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,187
I studied French for my elective
foreign language course in high school.

216
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,943
My friends told me I have the look
of a European, especially a French man.

217
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:29,321
I was initially reluctant
to take up French,

218
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,909
but as time passed, I got the sense
that the language suited me rather well.

219
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
So…

220
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,790
Mr. Kang?

221
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,048
Man, look at all these people.

222
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,182
-Welcome.
-Sorry?

223
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,642
Please go in. We'll begin soon.

224
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,894
-I can wait here--
-You know how she is.

225
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,858
All right, everyone.
We'll begin the presentation shortly.

226
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,651
Please take a seat.

227
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,695
Please be seated.

228
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,535
Hello.

229
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,746
Jeez.

230
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,917
PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SERVICE

231
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,215
I apologize for the delay.
It's been a hectic day.

232
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,217
What was I thinking?

233
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,845
Mr. Jung. Could you go get my shoes?

234
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,847
I'm afraid we have to start, ma'am.

235
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,855
BRIEFING ON "PLAINS OF HOPE"

236
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,441
THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
FOR HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS IN AFRICA

237
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,318
HOSTED BY: FOREIGN PROCUREMENT DIVISION 2

238
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,490
My heartfelt gratitude to everyone
for attending this event in person.

239
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:59,453
To make the most of your valued time,
I'll get straight to the point.

240
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,124
Hello and welcome. Thanks for coming.

241
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,628
Since time is precious,
we will keep this brief.

242
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,882
First, please welcome
the representatives from KOICA.

243
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,761
To my left, the organization
for international cooperation.

244
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,604
We also have the African delegation
who came all the way to Korea.

245
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,899
And to my right,
the delegation from Africa.

246
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:29,942
Welcome.

247
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,534
As you know, KOICA has decided
to fund the construction of schools

248
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:43,956
and hospitals with surgical facilities
to post-conflict regions in Africa.

249
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,000
Our agency will be procuring
the resources required for the project.

250
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,837
As you know, we have decided
to provide financial aid

251
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,713
for the construction
of schools and hospitals

252
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,465
in regions affected by the war.

253
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,718
We will purchase anything necessary
to support this effort.

254
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,972
Please check the document on your desk.

255
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,933
You can find
the list of items to be procured,

256
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:07,271
the project timeline,
contact information, and key guidelines.

257
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:12,442
"Gauze pad, X-ray film, ambu bag,
thermometer, surgical glove, oxygen tank…"

258
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,610
EQUIPMENT AND PURPOSE

259
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,363
As for the items procured
for this project,

260
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:20,534
our agency will collect them all
and ship them together to Africa.

261
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,121
Since that's the case,
please make sure to meet the deadline.

262
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,373
The agency is handling shipping?

263
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:30,127
Do you have any questions?

264
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,336
Do you have any questions?

265
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:33,964
Excuse me.

266
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,720
Can I sign up for everything on the list?

267
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,472
Which company is he with, Mr. Jung?

268
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,892
He seems familiar,
but I can't say for sure.

269
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,146
To my knowledge,

270
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:53,483
we already have a vendor
for all the items on the list.

271
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,112
Mr. Jung. Are they any items
that haven't been decided?

272
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,530
Yes, there are.

273
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,284
Please make sure that you don't bid
on items assigned to another company.

274
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,161
Let's not get greedy, okay?

275
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,954
We're all here for a great cause.

276
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,873
-Let's keep it civil.
-Of course.

277
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,292
To be frank,
you all work at respectable firms.

278
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,252
Once this project concludes smoothly,

279
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,505
our African counterpart
will extend their invitations.

280
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,133
Can you remind me
what the top tourist spots are?

281
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,552
What is famous in your region?

282
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,347
Sahara Desert, safari…

283
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,557
Serengeti, lions.

284
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,894
They have the Sahara Desert, the safari,
the Serengeti, and the lions.

285
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,480
Lions?

286
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,914
<i>"Global Exploration: The World of Nature."</i>

287
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,044
No, you should keep it on a little longer.

288
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,382
You need to wear it for 15 minutes or more
to enhance your concentration.

289
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,593
It wasn't an easy decision
for me to buy it.

290
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:07,599
Beom, getting only 30 points
in the dictation test is a serious issue.

291
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,977
Keep it on, okay?

292
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,148
There's my good boy.

293
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:24,366
<i>The nimblest and quickest predator</i>
<i>here in the African savanna</i>

294
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,288
<i>has its eye on only one thing.</i>

295
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,790
There's no way I would let this go.

296
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,834
Did you see zebras and giraffes too?

297
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,754
Were you the lion chasing after them?
What exactly is your goal here?

298
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,215
A government project,
the most secure project.

299
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,301
Here you go. Please check this out.

300
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,095
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT
OF HOSPITALS AND SCHOOLS IN AFRICA

301
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,975
So, KOICA is launching
an aid project in Africa,

302
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,643
building schools and hospitals.

303
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,769
That's right.

304
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,063
They'll ship all
necessary items to Africa.

305
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,065
Just think about it.

306
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,318
This ship won't disappear,

307
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,946
the goods will never get seized,
and our client will never go under.

308
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:07,367
This is the perfect opportunity for us.

309
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,411
Of course, it's perfect.

310
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:14,041
But larger corporations generally have
monopoly on such fantastic deals.

311
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,250
"Monopoly"?

312
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,545
-Haven't you heard of it?
-Monopoly.

313
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,758
Anyhow, didn't you say

314
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,469
that they already have a vendor
for all of the items?

315
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,512
And yet…

316
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:30,849
one item is left hanging.

317
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,894
Surgical gloves.

318
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,564
-How come?
-There's no domestic supplier.

319
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,903
See? All the meaty, juicy parts
have been divvied up among them.

320
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,906
We would never get to have a bite.
Do you want to know why?

321
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,117
Because we lack the funds.
Have you got some?

322
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,621
What about personnel and experience?

323
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,914
FUNDS, PERSONNEL, EXPERIENCE

324
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,373
This requires quite a big sum.

325
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,960
Even if we got items on credit,
we still need a bid bond and a deposit.

326
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,756
Also, there's a mountain
of paperwork to submit. It's too much.

327
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:06,551
To my knowledge, we've never done
a deal in the public sector.

328
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,430
You might as well think the big companies
called dibs on such big projects.

329
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,182
They meet all three criteria.

330
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,352
Don't say that.
We have experience, at the very least.

331
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,272
If you're going to voice your opinion,
just come work here.

332
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:22,109
You're not a guest star.
Do you think we're 015B?

333
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,402
Ms. Cha, the green juice is expired.

334
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,696
Think of it as being aged and drink up.

335
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,782
Hear me out.

336
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:33,245
The late Mr. Kang and Mr. Koo
used to work for Samjeon Trading.

337
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,082
So, we did work on public sector projects
in the early days.

338
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,959
-My father did that?
-Sure.

339
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,840
Things would be better
if Mr. Koo were here, right?

340
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:51,930
But I must say, you guys have no respect.

341
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:57,018
How can you talk back
to your boss this much?

342
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,271
As the saying goes,

343
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,065
you can only come up with excuses
when you're trying to weasel out.

344
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,734
But where there's a will, there's a way.

345
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,612
I'm off.

346
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,823
See you.

347
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,241
-See you.
-See you.

348
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,786
Come work with us already.
You can find a way for us.

349
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,956
KOO MYUNG-GWAN

350
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,166
I might be able

351
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,252
to find a way.

352
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,269
-Hello.
-Hello, we're with Typhoon Trading.

353
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,645
Please take this.

354
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,233
We just wanted to ask--

355
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,746
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

356
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,807
Freight Elevator 3 will be going down
with the VIPs heading to the B3 lounge.

357
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,436
Does that make us very important cargo?

358
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,440
It must be tiring to repeat that all day.
You might as well rest back here.

359
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:26,358
Gosh.

360
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,110
I hold the doors open for the jerks
who are strangers.

361
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,280
It's nothing to hold the doors open
for the brats I work with.

362
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,991
We'd love you more
if only you were polite.

363
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,285
I already get enough attention
for my beauty.

364
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,537
I'd be in big trouble
if I get any prettier.

365
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,041
Pretty girl, you've got a run
in your tights again.

366
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,588
-Get a new pair, will you?
-I have a run on this side too.

367
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,299
A pair, huh?

368
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,635
It's a sure way to lose your luck.

369
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,972
Only those born with good luck
can afford to care about it.

370
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,059
Cover up your belly button
when you're out of the uniform.

371
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,727
That's none of your business.

372
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,104
You're unbelievable.

373
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:09,776
We've arrived at your lounge, dear VIPs.
Please exit here.

374
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,070
Thanks for the VIP treatment, pretty girl.

375
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:15,865
-She sure doesn't lack confidence.
-Doesn't it feel good, though?

376
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,583
Ma'am.

377
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,669
Excuse me.

378
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,838
-May I rearrange your hair?
-Excuse me?

379
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,300
I saw a bobby pin
stick out of your headscarf.

380
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,634
Just a second.

381
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,927
Let me take this…

382
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,596
Here we go.

383
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,434
The team's manager throws a fit
over minor details like this.

384
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,270
Nobody likes being nagged
when they're doing their best.

385
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,106
I'll be off, then.

386
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,357
Wait, miss.

387
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,693
Thank you.

388
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,486
No problem.

389
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,050
"Buhyeong Station, Exit 1."
And this is the Exit 1.

390
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,387
Do you think she meant
that we could meet him here?

391
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,182
She gave us the note for a reason.
Let's wait it out.

392
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,224
Right?

393
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,810
It's the new millennium.
Believe in the Prophet.

394
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,354
-New millennium, new sky.
-Exactly.

395
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,355
THE DIVINE SKY

396
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,398
Hello.

397
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,277
<i>Millennium, the Prophet of the new age</i>

398
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,112

00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,238
-Oh, my.
-Mr. Koo.

400
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,241
Tae-poong.

401
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,284
Mi-seon.

402
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,747
-What brings you here?
-Of course, we've come to see you.

403
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,500
We need your advice
on the Public Procurement Service.

404
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,252
Could you spare us a minute?
It won't take long.

405
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,047
I'm afraid I'm rather busy at the moment.

406
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,966
-I'll see you later.
-Wait, Mr. Koo.

407
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,305

408
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,267
Rumor has it
that you're the CEO now, Tae-poong.

409
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,811
That's true.

410
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,981
-Congratulations, Mr. Kang.
-Goodness.

00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,192
A NEW MILLENIUM
FOR THE DIVINE SKY

412
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,445
Hello.

413
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,197
-Hello.
-Hello.

414
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,659
Are you friends of Deacon Koo here?

415
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,244
That's right, sir.

416
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,746
We met by chance.

417
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,165
-Off you go, then.
-Mr. Kang, correct?

418
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:30,959
Yes?

419
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,752
{\an8}I can see fortune in your face.

420
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,379
Pardon?

421
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,256
-Does he mean there's money?
-No.

422
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,841
He thinks you look lucky.

423
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,385
Oh, you meant good fortune.

424
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:45,432
My eyes can see everything,
and I mean everything.

425
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,308
He is the Prophet.

426
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,353
-Thank you, Mr. Prophet.
-That's not his name.

427
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,814
I've fallen victim
to crooks twice recently.

428
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,901
-So I--
-Are you sure you're not a lucky man?

429
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,988
I'm sure. I've been conned twice.
I lost my home and office--

-Look.
-That startled me.

472
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:49,681
Once upon a time,
a prophet appeared and declared,

473
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,308
"In the year 1999,

474
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,520
the lord of darkness
will descend onto your world."

475
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,070
"The lord of darkness
shall devour everything in the world."

476
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,449
"But do not fear."

477
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:13,705
"I have dispatched a being
with my authority and discerning eyes."

478
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,541
Thank you!

479
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,294
Everyone.

480
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,754
Who or what is the lord of darkness?

481
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:26,759
Who or what is this lord of darkness
that you fear so much?

482
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,970
War!

483
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,389
-Satan.
-The Gulf War.

00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,267
-The IMF!
-Poverty!

485
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,104
No, you're all wrong!

486
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:43,026
The lord of darkness
is none other than Y2K.

487
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,152
It's Y2K.

00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,653
A NEW MILLENIUM
FOR THE DIVINE SKY

489
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:52,994
Computers run on a binary system,
which consists of ones and zeros.

490
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,916
0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.

491
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,586
In other words, computers can't grasp
the concept of the new millennium.

492
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,380
When the clock hits 12:00 a.m.
on January 1st, 2000,

493
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,091
all computers will start malfunctioning!

494
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,720
All the missiles and nuclear weapons
rely on their computer system!

495
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,931
So the world…

496
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,558
It will go boom!

497
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,478
Please save us!

498
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:20,980
And yet,

499
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,525
the true path to the heavens
will soon appear before us.

500
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,985
OPENING THE PATH TO THE SKY

501
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:30,698
Just ten million won can make the systems
understand number two!

502
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,788
Oh, dear Prophet!

503
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,167
This is a sweet deal.

504
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:46,172
Surely, you don't want to keep it and
survive alone while your family perishes!

505
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,715
-Of course not!
-You're right!

506
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,342
Let us pray.

507
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,396
-About that deal with the PPS--
-They're praying.

508
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,855
I'm sorry, everyone.

509
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,736
They're securing goods
to construct schools and hospitals,

510
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,989
and most items on the list
have been claimed

511
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,242
except for surgical gloves.

512
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,788
All we need is to strike a deal
at a good price and hand the goods over.

513
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,709
But we're having difficulty
navigating the waters on our own.

514
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,753
{\an8}You're the only one
who's ever worked with the PPS.

515
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,879
{\an8}Exactly.

516
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:34,595
I really want to secure this… No.
We must secure that deal.

517
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,182
Please stop, Tae-poong.

518
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,685
How's this, Mr. Koo?

519
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:44,147
We'll show you the documents.
You can make your decision after that.

520
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,066
Then you'll see
it's a golden opportunity you can't miss.

521
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,651
-Join us already!
-Why, you…

522
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,570
Stop it, okay?!

523
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,074
Typhoon Trading doesn't even have
enough money to strike that deal!

524
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:58,536
We have spawns of Satan
harassing one of our own!

525
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,747
Drag them out!

526
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,838
Hang on.

527
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,715
This is just… Mr. Koo!

528
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,924
Let me go!

529
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:16,304
Folks, how lame is "Y2K"?

530
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,973
Just turn the computers off
and unplug them, okay?

531
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,308
Mr. Koo!

532
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,559
Wait, Mr. Koo!

533
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,024
Do you think he'll come back?

534
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,860
We've got to have faith.

535
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,782
With or without him,
I'm going to secure that deal.

536
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,120
Why do you want the PPS deal so badly?

537
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,963
I just have a hunch
that this may be the final shot for me.

538
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,843
Since I don't have more funds,
or anywhere to make a retreat,

539
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,805
I need a dependable client.

540
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,810
Let's go inside.

541
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,363
I told you we could get
something more delicious.

542
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,823
I happen to love dumplings.

543
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,574
-You do?
-Sure.

544
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,956
Thanks.

545
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,298
Is it good?

546
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,015
What's wrong? Are you okay?
Sip some water.

547
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,144
-Should I go get some medicine?
-No, I'm good.

548
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,436
Some water will do.

549
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,524
-Are you sure?
-I'm quite sure.

550
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,280
-Was there something in the dumpling?
-Oh, no.

551
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,992
I'm fine.

552
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,372
Let me try it.

553
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,082
Mr. Kang.

554
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:18,551
I'm usually the one looking out for others
and not the other way around.

555
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,348
I'm the opposite.
People tend to look out for me.

556
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,318
So…

557
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,700
it feels new to me
to have someone look out for me.

558
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,704
I honestly feel grateful too.

559
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,626
But I must say…

560
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,592
I don't want to be dependent
on such emotional comfort.

561
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,804
What I'm saying is…

562
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:08,684
How about we…

563
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,440
just look out for each other at work only?

564
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,568
Let's separate feelings from work.

565
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,077
-Separate feelings from work?
-That's it.

566
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,085
I want to pursue my career
more than anything, Mr. Kang.

567
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,964
I feel this is necessary.

568
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,025
-Dig in. The dumplings might get cold.
-Okay.

569
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,698
Take them slowly.

570
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,666
-So, did you come here to get some tights?
-No, I've come to see you.

571
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,919
I could've come to you after I was done.

572
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,671
I came because I could manage it.

573
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,132
-Hello.
-Hey, you're here.

574
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,092
I have an order
from Color Story in Gwangju.

575
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,261
-The order is for 233,000 won.
-I have them here.

576
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,264
You can check.

577
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,350
Here's 240,000 won, sir.

578
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,394
-The change is 7,000 won.
-Okay.

579
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,566
-Here's your 7,000 won.
-Thank you.

580
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,194
-Did you check everything?
-Sure.

581
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,905
Thank you.

582
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,407
-Thank you.
-Have a good one.

583
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,578
I gave it some thought afterwards.

584
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:54,957
Wouldn't it be unfair
to lose good luck over torn tights?

585
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,751
My sister works so hard every day.

586
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,963
Then again, older ladies
turn out to be right most of the time.

587
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,717
Mi-ho, I'll buy you 100 pairs of tights.

588
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,428
Really?

589
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,764
-Let's make it 1,000 pairs.
-Lucky me.

590
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,689
Open wide, Mi-ho.

591
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,818
Gosh, this is so nice and cold.

592
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:28,491
By the way, this place is bustling
with people, clothes, and money.

593
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,575
Right?

594
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:33,079
{\an8}All the money in the country
seems to flow into this area.

595
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,497
{\an8}TEXTILE ACCESSORIES MARKET

596
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,748
{\an8}It's nice here.

597
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,834
I love clothes and money.

598
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,048
What would you do
if you had a lot of money?

599
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,716
Me?

600
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,720
I know what I'd do.

601
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,723
I want to fund Mi-seon's college tuition.

602
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:59,647
I've always been an airhead,
and she was the model student.

603
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,150
But Mi-seon had the bad luck
of being born first,

604
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,902
so I went to college, not her.

605
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,698
I hate it.

606
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,367
It feels like I owe her.

607
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:17,373
I'll make a lot of money,
so she can go to college.

608
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,881
What about you? What's your dream?

609
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,341
Me?

610
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,887
My dream is making it as a singer.

611
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,723
Are you serious?

612
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,184
Sing a song for me.

613
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,063
Come on. I can barely remember
what happened on <i>Studio I Love You.</i>

614
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,317
<i>Here's my song</i>
<i>Now it's over</i>

615
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,948
But that's in the past.

616
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,867
It's not what I want now.

617
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,536
Instead,

618
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,372
I have a new dream.

619
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,708
What's that?

620
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:02,877
You.

621
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,508
You are

622
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,053
my dream, Mi-ho.

623
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,868
SEOUL REGIONAL OFFICE

624
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:42,750
Sample containers, plaster cast kits…

00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,376
Hochang, screens.

LIST OF VENDORS

00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,922
What's this? Who are they?

628
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,882
"Typhoon Trading"?

629
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:52,551
Why do we have a small fish here?

630
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,969
Who gave them a call?

631
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,763
-Hey, Mr. Jung.
-Yes, ma'am?

632
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,978
-Did you bring in Typhoon Trading?
-No.

633
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,272
Fax them that they're not eligible.

634
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,732
Understood, ma'am.

TYPHOON TRADING, POWDERED SURGICAL GLOVES

636
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,410
{\an8}SEOUL OFFICE
OF THE PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SERVICE

637
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,880
It's an official notice from the PPS.

638
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,470
"Bidding ineligibility notice."

639
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:39,306
"We inform that your company
is ineligible to bid on this project."

640
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,391
"End of note"?

641
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,228
They can't just kick us out.

642
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,608
Didn't I warn you?
I knew it would come to this.

643
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,277
Be rational.

644
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,198
It would be odd if they let any company
bid on a project on a national scale.

645
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,244
Our company only has four staff members.

646
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,954
How much do we have left?

647
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,748
We have 43,500,000 won, rounded down.

648
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,418
It's so specific. Now, I feel suffocated.

649
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,420
We must get this deal.

650
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,051
-Yes?
-What now?

651
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,598
-Hey!
-What's going on?

652
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,017
-My gosh!
-Jeez, I can't believe this!

653
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,435
-Come in already.
-Mr. Koo!

654
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,686
-Don't dawdle.
-Mr. Koo!

655
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,522
How have you been?
I bet you lounged around.

656
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,817
Couldn't you have come in
and helped us move stuff?

657
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,486
I did hear about the relocation.

658
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,239
But the office itself doesn't matter.

659
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,577
As long as we're all together,
that's Typhoon Trading.

660
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,704
He seems pretty fine.

661
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,039
No, the office matters.

662
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,665
-It affects my mood.
-Mr. Bae.

663
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,086
I see you've brought us
some presents again.

664
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,379
Darn it.

665
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,341
-Accept salvation.
-What's this?

666
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,636
What does Y2K mean? Who made this?

667
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,640
-What is it?
-Have you joined a church?

668
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,308
Here's your salvation, Mi-seon.

669
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:06,769
This isn't the time
to turn to religion, Myung-gwan.

670
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,730
Look at what we're dealing with.

671
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,860
BIDDING INELIGIBILITY NOTICE

672
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,656
File an appeal.

673
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:22,117
Pardon?

674
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,119
Tae-poong.

675
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:28,457
Civil servants operate
according to their own code.

676
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:33,379
What civil servants love and hate the most
is none other than due process.

677
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,467
It's about anti-competitive practices,
unfair trade, coercion of confidentiality…

678
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,929
and discrimination.

679
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,436
<i>What?</i>

680
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,106
They filed an appeal? On what grounds?

681
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:57,444
Apparently, they're claiming
the conditions of eligibility are unclear.

682
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,238
They'll also lodge a complaint

683
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,324
on "anti-competitive practices,
unfair trade, discrimination,

684
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,411
coercion of confidentiality,"
and any other grounds they can think of.

685
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,955
They've got to be joking.

686
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,207
What discrimination?
We just don't want any mishap.

687
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,877
-You can't be more right.
-Jeez, what a pain…

688
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,130
-Mr. Jung.
-Yes?

689
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,465
What was it again? The surgical gloves?

690
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,884
Has any other company
submitted a bid for them?

691
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,136
No, ma'am.

692
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,180
Tell them to come in.

693
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,062
It turned out all our orchids
had been overwatered.

694
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,858
Overwatered?

695
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,235
Yes.

696
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,739
The orchids kept growing,
but there was no room in the pots

697
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,658
while the soil was soaking up water.

698
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,702
Huge chunks of their roots rotted away.

699
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,246
That's why they couldn't bloom.

700
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,541
I see.

701
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,752
They seemed fine on the outside,

702
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,798
while the hidden parts were rotting away.

703
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:00,883
But still,

704
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,636
they survived
thanks to their strong roots.

705
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,180
Look.

706
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,058
I cut away all the rotten roots
and moved them to a bigger pot.

707
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,643
They then flowered right away.

708
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:17,524
Mr. Koo.

709
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,070
It's time you came back to our office.

710
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,449
We have a place for you here.

711
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:30,621
Hello?

712
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,624
Oh, I see. Understood.

713
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,626
Sure, thank you. Goodbye.

714
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,548
-They want us to come in to submit a bid.
-That's amazing.

715
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:45,260
-That's splendid.
-Mr. Koo's valuable advice paid off.

716
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,439
Does this CD contain instrumental songs?

717
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,695
Turn it off!

718
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,157

<i>Our dear Prophet!</i>

720
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,538
The lord of darkness will strike
on January 1st, 2000.

721
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,997
An apocalypse is coming!

722
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,210
Life as we know it will no longer exist
after December 31st, 1999!

723
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,880
You have to install this
to save yourselves and your families!

724
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,383
Listen, Ma-jin, Seon-taek, and Tae-poong.

725
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,968
-You must install this!
-Mr. Koo.

00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:35,936

-Play the CD.

Please help Typhoon Trading.

00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:08,820
Father.

735
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:17,496
Please shield them so they won't get hurt
by a worthless being like me.

736
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:23,502
Allow them to forget
a miserable failure like me forever…

737
00:49:25,962 --> 00:49:26,963
and lead…

738
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,218
a happy life.

00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,806

740
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,519
Please let them be happy.

741
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,486
Ms. Cha.

742
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,864
Hi there.

743
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,366
Gosh.

744
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,159
How come you're here all alone?

745
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,829
I'm waiting to hear from someone.

746
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,248
I volunteered to stay behind
and sent the others home.

747
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,043
-Can I get you a cup of tea?
-Sure, that sounds lovely.

748
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,347
You take after your father.

749
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,016
-You're sweet just like him.
-Sorry?

750
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,102
My father was sweet?

751
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,731
You bet he was.
He was so thoughtful and generous.

752
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,820
Mr. Koo used to be
the ruthless one around here.

753
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:32,738
Here you go.

754
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,240
Thanks.

755
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,539
You know…

756
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:44,416
By any chance…

757
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:55,677
did the late Mr. Kang
tell you something in secret

758
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,180
or entrust you with a special item?

759
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,641
-A special item?
-Did the late Mr. Kang…

760
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,352
Did he really not have
any emergency funds?

761
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,399
Could he have left you with something
you don't recognize the value of?

762
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,777
I was just curious.

763
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,034
The truth is…

764
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,370
There's nothing.

765
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:25,081
The bankbook I gave you was everything.

766
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,584
Of course, I should've known better.

767
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,379
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
given up our old office.

768
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,318
Ms. Cha.

769
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:58,323
If your current job is too rough on you,
you can join us anytime.

770
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,869
You spent 20 years
working for this company.

771
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,541
Goodness, dear.

772
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,127
Thanks for saying that.

773
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:17,008
Right, more than 20 years
have passed already.

774
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,596
You know what?

775
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:26,643
Turns out long years of service don't mean
you deserve a second chance.

776
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,900
I really liked your father.

777
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,489
-Not romantically, but as a colleague.
-Oh, of course.

778
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,617
I loved our company too.

779
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,209
{\an8}That much is true.

780
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:55,589
Please remember that, okay?

781
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,013
What time is it?

782
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,558
-I should get going. It's late.
-Ms. Cha.

783
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,813
-You forgot your bag.
-Oh, right.

784
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:21,281
Ms. Cha, did you reorganize
the files in this office?

785
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,915
What do you mean? Why would I do that?

786
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,584
I took a look yesterday

787
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:36,713
and noticed how they were arranged
by date from right to left.

788
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,134
I know that's how you arrange files.

789
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,975
I guess someone tried your way, then.

790
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,770
Looks like it.

791
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:55,482
-Good night, then.
-Okay.

Great. Now, here.

No errors, right?

797
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,229
Would you look at that?

798
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,564
Trying to expand to Africa, punk?

799
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,066
Ignore him.

801
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,695
Just ignore him.

802
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,823

Is the total amount correct?

00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:48,868

Cancel yours, then.

00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,807
Sucks for you, but all I can think of

824
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,060
That way, you'd get to win

00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,279
Excuse me.

827
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,616
What's this?

828
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,703
Pyo Merchant Marine was supposed
to procure orange juice, wasn't it?

829
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,582
That's right. But we just updated
the item to rubber gloves…

830
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,459
I mean, surgical gloves.

831
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,045
You can't make
last-minute changes like that.

832
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,547
-Then we'll export orange juice--
-Mr. Ha!

833
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,926
I'm going for the gloves.

834
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,303
Gloves it is, then.

835
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,679
But the gloves are taken.

836
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,349
The nit-picking Taeheung Trading
took the gloves.

837
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:36,017
-Typhoon Trading.
-Typhoon Trading.

838
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,062
-Right, Typhoon Trade.
-It's Typhoon Trading.

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,898

Listen, lady.

843
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,825
Why can't I make changes?

844
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:55,036
Excuse me? Listen very closely, mister.

845
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,746
I don't appreciate your tone.

846
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,374
I'm a Grade 6 civil servant
with Salary Grade 23.

847
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,542
He's simply curious, ma'am.

848
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,710
When we have multiple bidders
on the same item,

849
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,754
we must have competitive bidding.

850
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,339
-Competitive bidding?
-That's right.

851
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,423
What's that?

852
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:11,094
Each company will submit their price,
and we'll choose the lowest.

853
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,388
-The winner gets the deal.
-That's right.

854
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,683
But with this process,
both of you will sustain heavy losses.

855
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,309
That's exactly my point!

856
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,687
All right, then.

857
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,357
Here's an idea.
Why don't you make a compromise?

858
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,986
If one of you changes an item,
I'll offer favorable treatment for you.

859
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,737
-Especially on our next project.
-Great.

860
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,614
-I can assure you that.
-We'll do that.

861
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,617
We submitted our form first.
Don't we have the priority?

862
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,746
That's a load of crap.
There's no rule like that.

863
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,125
-Why, you little--
-All right, fine!

864
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,460
Let's have competitive bidding.

865
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,337
I might as well do it the right way
if there's no way around it.

866
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,509
You seem to know each other,
so mark my words.

867
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:55,930
I have two terms.
First, submission closes on the dot.

868
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,974
You're out if you miss
any required documents.

869
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:02,145
Second, the bid will be open 100%
with the lowest bidder winning.

870
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:05,982
You realize what this means, do you?

871
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,275
-Sure.
-Of course.

872
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,277
-You don't.
-Not in here.

873
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,455
Your father would be enraged.

874
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:22,790
Never mind him.
Just get me all the documents.

875
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:28,171
And check all the companies
producing surgical gloves

876
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,631
and secure all their stock for me.

877
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,341
Yes, sir.

878
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,310
PURCHASE SPECIFICATIONS

879
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,562
Let's see.

880
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,897
These are ready.

881
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:48,733
-Do we have enough funds for the bid bond?
-Of course.

882
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:52,237
Once we secure the deal,
we'll have to wire the deposit too.

883
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,324
We should take that into account.
Have you requested a quotation?

884
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:59,077
Yes, only three companies produce
the powdered surgical gloves

885
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,787
that meet KOICA's requirements.

886
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,289
-I've made the request to all three.
-Well done.

887
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,834
Everything hinges on price this time,
so quotations matter the most.

888
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,672
Those Pyo Merchant Marine punks
are a pain in our neck.

889
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,257
Why are they getting in our way?

890
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:16,094
-What's that?
-The translated manual for the gloves.

891
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,764
I don't understand why they would ask
the manual to be translated into French.

892
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:23,851
All the French phrases I know
are Sophie Marceau and <i>La Boum.</i>

893
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:24,936
Those two are it.

SPECIFICATION OF SURGICAL GLOVES

895
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:27,981
Mr. Go.

896
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,441
Look at this. How could they…

897
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:34,779
They wrote the translations by hand.
Who works this way? Are they crazy?

898
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,489
What's the matter with these people?

899
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:39,284
They should've typed everything
and sent us the printed copy.

900
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,244
Hold on. What can we do now?

901
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,830
Shouldn't we type every word ourselves?

902
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,417
Of course. But to do that,
we need the right keyboard.

903
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,128
-One that supports French.
-Yes, one that supports French.

904
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,422
-Where can we… Would Mr. Bae know?
-Hold on.

905
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,840
In that case…

906
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,383
Who should I call? Oh, right here.

TYPEWRITERS, COPIERS, FACSIMILE

908
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,420
I see. I got it loud and clear. Okay.

909
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,463
-Okay.
-Are we good?

910
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:38,885
-They managed to find it!
-Gosh, I can't believe they bought one.

911
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,346
-I can't believe they pulled it off.
-They're incredible.

912
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,979
-How are things moving along?
-Great.

913
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,482
Mr. Pyo.

914
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,360
About the update to the goods.

915
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,446
-Shouldn't we inform your father--
-Forget it.

916
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,406
My dad will only nag some more.

917
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,954
It's all going to be fine.

918
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,998
Look at me, Mr. Ha.

919
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,458
Come on.

920
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:16,673
You may find my dad hard to deal with,
but no parent wins against their child.

921
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,842
-Don't you worry.
-I won't, sir.

922
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:25,682
This is the golden opportunity
to make one of my dad's dreams come true.

923
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,561
-Where's that business card?
-Oh, right.

924
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,696
So, this is the surgical gloves company?

Okay, then…

929
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,758
-Are we all set?
-Here. Yes.

930
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,760
-We just need the manual.
-How much longer?

931
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:05,847
-We're almost done.
-We're nearly there.

932
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,896
-Are you done?
-Yes.

933
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,314
-Great.
-Are we ready?

934
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,691
-Ms. Oh, here…
-Print it.

935
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,026
-I'll hit the print button.
-Okay, I'll be right here.

01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,111
PRINTING

937
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:21,404
-All right!
-Okay.

938
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,700
-You can be quite handy, man.
-I told you I'm a top-level asset.

939
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:26,617
Mr. Bae.

940
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,828
-Thanks for your trouble.
-You're welcome.

941
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,496
I'm glad we bought that keyboard.

942
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,418
-Yes, that really saved us.
-We owe this success to our joint efforts.

943
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:40,298
-I can't believe we managed to find this.
-It must've not been easy finding that.

944
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,758
Mr. Kang, look!

945
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,677
-Letters are broken up.
-What's the matter?

946
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,928
Look at these letters.

947
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,308
-What happened?
-Maybe the printer glitched.

948
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,560
-I'll try again.
-Was it the wrong button?

949
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,854
The machine may glitch on the first try.

950
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:00,860
-There. Check it out.
-Did you do it?

951
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,620
-What's going on here?
-Hold on.

952
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:12,914
-How…
-What's going on with these letters?

953
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,248
Is it a computer virus?

954
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,209
Wait, it's the font.

955
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,920
-Font?
-The software must not support this font.

956
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,838
What do we do then, Mr. Kang?

957
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,048
It's 2:00 a.m., isn't it?

958
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,509
We've got to find a way quickly.

959
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,761
-What options do we have?
-Reinstall the software?

960
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,012
Hold on. What do we do?

961
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,312
Have you been well?

962
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,408
Quick, give me my work sleeves!

963
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,785
Let's find his work sleeves.

964
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,371
Where are they?

965
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:14,976

than I can type it.

967
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,202
You're great at drawing too. It's amazing.

968
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,121
I feel like I could wear that glove.

970
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,417
I can't believe
he's managing it in one go.

971
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:42,169
No one will doubt that's a glove.

POWDER: CORN

974
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:55,975
-It means corn.
-I see.

975
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,018
So, corn.

976
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,942
-That must mean "powdered corn."
-I guess powdered corn goes into gloves.

977
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,236
I don't mind corn.

978
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,922
I'm done.

979
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,592
Thank you for your hard work.

980
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,136
-You were amazing.
-Way to go, Mr. Koo.

981
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:33,721
I can't believe my eyes.

982
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:34,764
Incredible.

983
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,766
Thank you so much. Seriously…

984
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,018
-You did it, Myung-gwan.
-How cool is this?

985
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,771
Thank you. You were brilliant.

986
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,982
-Goodness, you sure are.

01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,160
It's not easy, is it?

991

-Tell me about it.
-You're so clumsy.

992
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,957
-Let me take that.
-I can barely see.

993
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,293
-Hello.
-Welcome.

994
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,880
-Over here, Ms. Cha!
-Hey, welcome.

995
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,883
-Please take a seat.
-Right here, Ms. Cha.

996
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,929
-Goodness.
-You didn't have to invite me as well.

997
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,390
-Mr. Koo.
-Come on.

998
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,684
How could we not
when Mr. Koo saved the day?

999
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,730
-Let me pour you a glass.
-Okay.

1000
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,482
Let me pour you one.

1001
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:30,653
Now that you're here, make a toast for us.
It's been a while.

1002
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:33,572
You'd like that? Okay.
What should I go with?

1003
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,491
How about this?

1004
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,994
-Let's go with "ILA."
-Okay.

1005
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,037
All together, then. One, two…

1006
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,080
-I!
-I!

1007
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,082
It can be terribly exhausting.

1008
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,291
-L!
-L!

1009
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,793
Let's still hang in there…

1010
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,670
-A!
-A!

1011
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:49,547
And thrive!

1012
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,384
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1013
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:58,222
-Great.
-All right.

1014
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:00,349
Wait until the meat turns brown, punk.

1015
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,185
Uncooked meat can make you ill.
I'm genuinely concerned.

1016
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:04,562
Did you submit the documents?

1017
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:06,355
Listen. When I got there…

1018
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,775
What was that shifty little punk's name?
Was it Ha?

1019
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,486
That guy was walking over,
so I glared at him

1020
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,156
to let him know
I was ready to take him down.

1021
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,825
-I scared the hell out of him.
-He sure was charismatic.

1022
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,163
Are you trying
to memorize the menu, Mr. Koo?

1023
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:27,168
I can't decide
if I want noodles, the stew,

1024
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,586
or the scorched rice soup.

1025
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:31,547
-Shall we order more meat?
-Go ahead.

1026
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,966
Ma'am, three portions of meat, please.

1027
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,968
-Just two portions, please.
-Oh, come on.

1028
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,179
Order some more. I want to take some home.

1029
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,390
The decent thing to do
is take the leftovers.

1030
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:43,225
Don't claim stuff from the get-go.

1031
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,603
Come on,
my kid is a senior in high school.

1032
01:07:45,686 --> 01:07:46,854
Wrap these up for now.

1033
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,564
-Take them home.
-Thanks.

1034
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:49,523
It looks so good.

1035
01:07:49,607 --> 01:07:50,941
Mr. Koo.

1036
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,694
No, that's okay.

1037
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:55,446
I'd say these are all cooked.

1038
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,241
It's not good for your health
to overcook the meat.

1039
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,910
It can increase the risk of cancer.

1040
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,120
You're a know-it-all.

1041
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:10,836
Mr. Koo, have some coffee.

1042
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,090
Thank you.

1043
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,053
I wanted to get some air. That's all.

1044
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:23,766
Goodness.

1045
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:26,352
Thank you for what you've done today.

1046
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:30,731
The idea of copying the notes by hand
didn't even occur to me.

1047
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,110
It was nothing.

1048
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:39,782
Back in the day,
we used to complete all forms by hand,

1049
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,659
whatever document it was.

1050
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:47,331
Mr. Koo.

1051
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:52,336
What Typhoon Trading needs at the moment
is a tree rather than a flower.

1052
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,173
Trees can give you shelter
from the sun in summer

1053
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,384
and a warm layer of leaves in fall.

1054
01:08:59,885 --> 01:09:03,764
In winter,
they can even give us some firewood.

1055
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:12,106
I'd appreciate a sturdy tree
with layers of growth rings.

1056
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,067
I can't recall what they called it.

1057
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,237
I'm not the sharpest, you see.

1058
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:24,994
Take your time and join us back in.

1059
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,788
You have to come back in.

1060
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,798
Growth rings, huh?

1061
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:42,428
He must be talking about experience.

1062
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:50,060
I prefer Job's tears tea.

1063
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,443
Get up now.

1064
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,612
-See you tomorrow.
-See you, Mr. Koo.

1065
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,906
-Get home safely.
-Stop wandering and come to work!

1066
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:03,282
-Good night.
-Hey, driver!

1067
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:04,992
-Our ride is here.
-Jeez, you dummy.

1068
01:10:05,075 --> 01:10:06,785
-Let me in!
-He's a handful. Hey, you.

1069
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,370
-We're sharing the car!
-Hey, punk.

1070
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:10,372
I can't get out now.

1071
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,874
I'll give you the taxi fare.

1072
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,417
I'll get you a taxi too, Seon-taek.

1073
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,085
-No, please.
-I'll pay double!

1074
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,671
We're paying double, darn it!

1075
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,006
-This is our ride.
-Sorry.

1076
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,466
-You can take the taxi.
-Goodness.

1077
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,384
-I'm not sure--
-Get in there, Seon-taek.

1078
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,969
You don't have to double the rate.

1079
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:25,679
I can't believe you.

1080
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,264
-Here we go.
-Hey, wait.

1081
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,891
-Take this.
-What's this? Oh, no.

1082
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,100
I insist. Take it.

1083
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,769
I'm not taking it back!

1084
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:34,188
-Listen, Seon-taek.
-Yes?

1085
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:39,318
I know you've got your husband and kid,
but prioritize yourself, okay?

1086
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,320
You're unbelievable.

1087
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:45,241
Your folks might not be around,
but you have us.

1088
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,037
You can go now.

1089
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,413
{\an8}Off you go!

1090
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,915
{\an8}Thank you.

1091
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:54,833
-Thanks again!
-Get home safely.

1092
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,252
-Thank you!
-No problem.

1093
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,004
Goodbye.

1094
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,214
-Taxi!
-Mi-seon.

1095
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,340
-Mi-seon!
-Double the rate!

1096
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,050
-I'll quadruple the rate!
-Here, Mi-seon.

1097
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:04,885
-What?
-No, I'll pay eightfold!

1098
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:06,553
Are you getting on? Go ahead, sirs.

1099
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:07,888
I'm taking the subway.

1100
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,765
-I see. Get home safely.
-Oh, goodbye.

1101
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,226
-Don't squabble, okay?
-Okay, we won't.

1102
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:14,061
Good night.

1103
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,984
It sure felt like the old days
to have everyone together.

1104
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,908
Do you want to walk together for a bit?

1105
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:31,245
Sure.

1106
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:48,929
Thanks.

1107
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,183
I've given it a thought.

1108
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:01,692
I can't do that.

1109
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:07,573
I can't pretend like
what happened between us never happened.

1110
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,784
Do you dislike me, Mi-seon?

1111
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:15,039
No, I don't dislike you at all.

1112
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:19,835
I just don't feel comfortable
when the air goes mellow around us.

1113
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,797
You should just take it easy--

1114
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,632
You don't get to decide how I feel.

1115
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,385
My feelings for you won't change.

1116
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,141
Feel this. My heart is racing.

1117
01:12:34,224 --> 01:12:37,227
{\an8}-It's because I like being with you.
-I get it, okay?

1118
01:12:42,566 --> 01:12:45,778
I'm going to like you,
and my feelings will only grow stronger.

1119
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,910
Don't you worry. I won't let
my feelings interfere with work.

1120
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:56,747
Yes, I'm the CEO,
and you're my senior staff.

1121
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:58,457
Yes.

1122
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:03,587
Jeez.

1123
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,841
But know this.

1124
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:11,720
You should know…

1125
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:16,809
that I…

1126
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,067
I love you.

1127
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:33,325
Although it's one-sided.

1128
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,042
It's my first unrequited love.

1129
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:10,404
TOMORROW COMES LOVE

1130
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:45,439
TYPHOON FAMILY

1131
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,941
{\an8}<i>Starting today, I'll act on my feelings.</i>

1132
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,194
{\an8}<i>Where do I start?</i>
<i>You think I can pull it off?</i>

1133
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,612
{\an8}<i>Those surgical gloves</i>

1134
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:53,489
{\an8}<i>are made in one place in the US.</i>

1135
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:54,531
{\an8}That's a monopoly.

1136
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:56,450
{\an8}<i>If the starting lines aren't the same,</i>

1137
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:58,827
{\an8}<i>maybe we take a step ahead.</i>

1138
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,371
{\an8}<i>What's most precious to you, Ms. Oh?</i>

1139
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:02,539
{\an8}<i>And you, Mr. Kang?</i>

1140
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,749
{\an8}<i>What matters most to you?</i>

1141
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:05,042
{\an8}<i>While you were quiet,</i>

1142
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,585
{\an8}you made this mess?

1143
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:08,212
{\an8}It's not over yet.

1144
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:09,838
<i>Even if I take a few jabs,</i>

1145
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,590
<i>one uppercut from me and he's done.</i>

1146
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,050
<i>Please! Ms. Oh!</i>

1147
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:14,510
<i>Oh Mi-seon!</i>
