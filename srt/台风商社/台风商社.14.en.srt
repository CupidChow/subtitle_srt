TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,963
{\an8}Yes, sir.

3
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,881
{\an8}NINE YEARS AGO

4
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,925
{\an8}I'm sorry to bother you again,
but I'd like to ask for another favor.

5
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:54,429
As you know,
come tomorrow, I'll go bankrupt.

6
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,557
{\an8}I'll give you some shares.

7
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,518
{\an8}No, it's not worthless!
How is that worthless?

8
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,479
{\an8}Don't you trust me? I'm Pyo--

9
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,481
{\an8}Hello?

10
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:24,793
KOREA TELECOM

11
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,836
TYPHOON TRADING

12
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:44,354
"Promissory note."

13
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,484
In… return for borrowing

14
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,027
PROMISSORY NOTE

15
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,488
forty million won…

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,995
CREDITOR: KANG JIN-YOUNG
DEBTOR: PYO BAK-HO

17
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,337
Mr. Kang…

18
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,308
"Promissory note"?

19
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,895
I can't recall if such a thing existed.

20
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,149
The money from nine years ago
should now be…

21
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,068
What with the interest… No.

22
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,445
Throw in all the overdue interest,

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,115
and this office

24
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,743
and the building should be mine.

25
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,919
Watch your darn mouth, you little brat.

26
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,174
Don't you worry.
I couldn't care less about your building.

27
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,176
Then what?

28
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,846
I want the three million pairs
of gloves in your storage.

29
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:01,973
What?

30
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,018
I'm losing out big time, aren't I?

31
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,645
What's the matter?

32
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,941
Do you think I don't have it?

33
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,865
That may be the case.

34
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,540
Let me share the order of events.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,504
Once Typhoon Trading delivers the gloves
and the payment has been received,

36
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,590
our transaction will be complete.

37
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,552
That promissory note or whatever
will be given to you.

38
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,766
Why should I make this deal with you?

39
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,142
It's obvious.

40
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,439
You have much more to lose.

41
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,087
But I can't

42
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:18,341
just give you the stuff
solely based on your words.

43
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,804
Let's do this.

44
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:27,600
LETTER OF GUARANTEE

45
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,060
The terms are the same.

46
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,647
But on the day the payment is made,

47
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,150
you will hand over
the promissory note to me.

48
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,320
What if you fail to do so?

49
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,741
What can you offer?

50
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,955
You have no money, so not that.

51
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,291
What can you offer?

52
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,128
Typhoon Trading.

53
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,838
I don't know.

54
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,215
My company?

55
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,636
That's not something
I can offer as I please.

56
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,766
Let's think realistically.

57
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,561
I offer myself.

58
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,647
To be exact, my position.

59
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,986
You'll give up everything
and leave the business alone?

60
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,615
The position of CEO
at Typhoon Trading, you say?

61
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,369
Is it a balanced deal now?

62
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,249
You better have it

63
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:38,171
if you want to save that petty position
your father left behind.

64
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,131
3. IF THE PROMISSORY NOTE IS NOT RETURNED,

65
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:44,635
KANG TAE-POONG SHALL RESIGN
FROM TYPHOON TRADING

66
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,563
{\an8}1. PYO MERCHANT MARINE TO TRANSFER
3 MILLION GLOVES

67
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,648
{\an8}2. TYPHOON TRADING TO RETURN
THE PROMISSORY NOTE

68
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,358
{\an8}You can't come crying to me later.

69
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,276
{\an8}JUNE 5TH, 1998

70
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,331
HOWEVER, OTHER EMPLOYEES
OF TYPHOON TRADING

71
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:18,169
SHALL NOT BE IMPACTED IN ANY WAY
THROUGH THE CONTENTS OF THIS CONTRACT

72
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,722
KANG TAE-POONG

73
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,768
PYO BAK-HO

74
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,821
Oh, it almost slipped my mind.

75
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,743
Don't you want to know
why I need those gloves?

76
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,206
Because someone set

77
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,416
our warehouse on fire.

78
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,088
But I never beg.

79
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,550
I make others beg.

80
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,734
I'm getting a call.

81
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,737
Hello?

82
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,906
Hey, Ms. Oh. What's up?

83
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,786
Hello?

84
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,959
What?

85
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,756
We got the gloves, so we can deliver them
straight to the designated warehouse.

86
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,759
Mr. Bae just went out
to look for a truck himself.

87
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,306
Yes, you can do that.

88
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,516
Okay, bye.

89
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,202
MOMO'S PUB

90
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,540
I don't know about everyone else,

91
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,544
but I thought I should apologize to you.

92
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,969
Pick up the pace,
and we can all wrap up quickly.

93
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,555
Speed it up even more,
and we'll be out in no time.

94
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,516
Hey, watch your step.

95
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,269
Don't you dare touch them!

96
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,146
You bastards.

97
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,565
So, did you come
looking for a fight, Tae-poong?

98
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,026
Bring it on. Come at me, you punk.

99
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,659
Jerk.

100
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,576
Ms. Oh.

101
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,163
Are you out of your mind?

102
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,915
You did it, didn't you?

103
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,085
-What?
-I know everything.

104
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,920
You set the place on fire.

105
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,048
I don't know what you mean.

106
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,096
So shut your mouth and wait.

107
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,015
Let's go.

108
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,317
Give me that!

109
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,322
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

110
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,907
"Seller, Pyo Bak-ho"?

111
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,130
Darn it!

112
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:54,677
Ms. Oh.

113
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,941
Can we…

114
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,695
Can we stay like this for a moment?

115
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,948
I really want

116
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,579
to say something to comfort you,
but I don't know what to say.

117
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,297
Ms. Cha came by.

118
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,093
Did she tell you everything?

119
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,014
I was going to take my time
and tell you later.

120
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,642
What about your hand?

121
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,977
He has thick skin,
so it must've hurt a lot.

122
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,023
So here's what happened.

123
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,526
-First, I said I had the promissory note.
-Take your time.

124
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,570
You can take your time to tell me.

125
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,700
My hand isn't the problem right now.

126
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,285
It's how you're feeling.

127
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,330
Are you all right?

128
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm…

129
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:09,960
Well…

130
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,589
I'm okay, I guess.

131
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,592
I just feel bad for my father.

132
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,720
It would've broken his heart

133
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,515
if he had seen all this.

134
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,560
He would've said you've done well.

135
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,004
EPISODE 14

136
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,176
{\an8}TYPHOON TRADING

137
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,219
{\an8}Yes.

138
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,305
{\an8}Yes, thank you.

139
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,016
{\an8}-So?
-Yeah.

140
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,978
{\an8}The insurance company handled everything.

141
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,606
{\an8}So is the case closed as arson?

142
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,902
{\an8}Well, it was an arson case.

143
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,822
{\an8}But there's insufficient evidence,
so it'll remain unresolved.

144
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,574
{\an8}I'm just glad the insurance can cover it.

145
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,243
{\an8}We just got over another hurdle.

146
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,579
{\an8}Will it take about a month
for the payment?

147
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:30,416
{\an8}Yes, I've issued the invoice,
so the payment will be made in a month.

148
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,335
{\an8}Good. We finally caught a breather
thanks to Mr. Kang.

149
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,213
All right. Good work, everyone.

150
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,175
After all, it's summer vacation season.

151
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,178
Why don't we use this chance
to get some fresh air?

152
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:45,681
-I'm sure you're all feeling down.
-Well, we'll get over this.

153
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,018
Who would feel great after this?

154
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,604
What's wrong with Seon-taek, really?

155
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,899
She isn't someone who'd do that,
so she must've lost her senses.

156
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,152
I was greatly disappointed too.

157
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,286
Ms. Cha?

158
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,169
Have you lost your mind?
How dare you show up here?

159
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,546
I'll leave these and go.

160
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,757
I was designated to this area.

161
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,634
Then you should change it.

162
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,385
Swap your area with someone else.

163
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,930
I'm all done here and leaving. Okay?

164
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,433
Cha Seon-taek!

165
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,527
You are less than human
and worse than the beasts.

166
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,238
How dare you brazenly show up here?

167
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,532
Then what can I do?

168
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,284
You can stop ordering
after this month's subscription.

169
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,328
I guess you haven't heard.

1989
ACCOUNT BOOK

171
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,462
I already lodged a complaint
with your juice company

172
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,131
for the damage you caused
to our official documents.

173
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,218
Your company had a solid reputation,
so why would they keep you?

174
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,428
-Myung-gwan.
-And Mr. Kang.

175
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,600
I also sued her for trespassing and theft,
so that's all you need to know.

176
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,726
Mr. Koo.

177
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,062
How can you be so cruel?

178
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,731
What did I do so wrong?

179
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,235
Think of all the years
we've known each other!

180
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,278
The years?

181
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,696
What did that mean to you?

182
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:29,451
When you sold away 26 years
for a petty amount of money,

183
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,954
did this mean anything to you?!

184
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,622
Think of how desperate I was.

185
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:38,210
I can't believe not a single person here
asked me why I did it.

186
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,213
If you were going through something
that made you do this,

187
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,215
you should've told us about it!

188
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,258
If I were

189
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,762
to tell you all about my business,
it'd be like speaking ill of my family!

190
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,514
But are we strangers?

191
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,807
Are we?

192
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,935
We said we'd be your family!

193
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,731
We already know
you have no one else to rely on.

194
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,942
All of us here are all living
in such misery anyway!

195
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,361
So why did you feel ashamed
and want to hide this,

196
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,697
only to end up in this state?

197
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,076
Why should the miserable stick together?
We have to take something from the rich!

198
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,582
You're hopeless. Get out of here!

199
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,585
Don't ever show your face here again!

200
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,670
I'm going to starve to death anyway.

201
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,213
We don't have to meet again!

202
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,257
Can you please stop?

203
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,136
-This is too frightening and upsetting.
-Ms. Cha, that's enough for today.

204
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,305
You should leave for now.

205
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:34,892
Why…

206
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,771
won't you apologize?

207
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,817
Say you're sorry.

208
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,696
Say you were wrong.

209
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,033
And I don't mean to me,
but to your colleagues and my father.

210
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,827
You need to apologize to them.

211
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:55,871
My dear.

212
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,874
Will an apology change anything?

213
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,920
-Please just beg for forgiveness.
-So what if I beg?

214
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,382
Are you going to forgive me?

215
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,009
If I apologize,

216
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:13,222
can the late Mr. Kang hear anything I say?

217
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,390
Yes.

218
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:16,850
He'll hear you.

219
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,562
He may be dead, but he's not gone.

220
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,273
No, right?

221
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,859
All of us here remember him.

222
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,738
I'll hear it. We'll hear it.

223
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,615
My father will hear it too.

224
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,704
And you'll hear it too.

225
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,627
I can't understand
or forgive you for this.

226
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,173
But still,

227
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,636
you should understand…

228
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,099
and forgive yourself for this.

229
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,645
Living with guilt toward my father?

230
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,358
I'm already carrying enough
of that myself.

231
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,676
If that is the case,

232
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,221
if he's listening,
that's all the more reason I can't say it.

233
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:47,858
I can't do it.

234
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,542
<i>A whale breathes through the blowhole</i>
<i>on top of its head.</i>

235
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,932
-Mi-seon, isn't that nice?
-It is.

236
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,603
But you never did anything like that.
Why are you using cosmetic products?

237
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,189
It's as if you're dating someone.

238
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,194
I am dating someone.

239
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,531
Wait, what? Who is it?

240
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,074
Is it Tae-poong?

241
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,827
Oh, my goodness.

242
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,621
What do you see in him?
Wait, does he like you?

243
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,500
My gosh. This is insane.
He's an unusual one too.

244
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,044
You didn't lend him money
or something like that, did you?

245
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,965
Don't be cheeky.

246
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,351
-By any chance, have you two kissed?
-Stop saying that in front of a kid.

247
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,105
It's time to sleep, Beom. It's late.

248
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,357
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

249
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,734
Is the sea that big?

250
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,113
Yes, the sea
is much bigger than Han River.

251
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,700
-It's blue and vast.
-I don't think so.

252
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,952
It's not so big.

253
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,498
So how do blue whales live there,
and how does it have treasures?

254
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:27,958
You fool.

255
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,919
It's because you're watching it
on a tiny TV.

256
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,796
It's really huge in real life.

257
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,924
I'm not a fool, you old hag.

258
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,092
What did you say?

259
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,220
I'm the only one
who hasn't seen the sea. Gosh.

260
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,514
Get over here.

261
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,976
Get over here! Did you call me a hag?

262
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,438
I'm going to tickle you!

263
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,607
Tickles, doesn't it?

264
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,151
Doesn't it? That's what you get
for calling me a hag!

265
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,194
Get back here!

266
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,240
Did you want to see the sea
that badly, my dear Beom?

00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:13,772

Where would the promissory note be?

270
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,381
Oh, my.

271
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,137
Gosh, why is it so dusty?

272
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,266
Hold on.

273
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,193
Mi-seon?

274
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,740

I can't see anything right now.

00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,699

Excuse me, I received a call to come here.

278
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,671
-Are you his guardian?
-Yes.

279
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,674
He was reported
for trespassing and vandalism.

280
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,675
Okay.

281
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,179
Mr. Kang?

282
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,017
Gosh.

283
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,815
You need to dust yourself off a little.

284
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,443
You're going to break Ms. Jung's heart.

285
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,320
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

286
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,489
-I'm hungry.
-Are you?

287
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,448
Yes.

288
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:53,038
Jeez.

289
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,127
What?

290
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,213
Well, you know.

291
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,591
-We were on the same page.
-We were.

292
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,010
-You can have this later.
-Okay. Thanks.

293
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,472
Here. You love this. Have some.

294
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,280
Mr. Kang.

295
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,742
"Mr. Kang"?

296
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,285
Man, "Mr. Kang"?

297
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,287
You're on a break.

298
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,498
I really don't want to be called that.

299
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,417
-I'm your boyfriend.
-Okay.

300
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,045
Mr. Kang Tae-poong.

301
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,884
Exactly. We're on a break.
What are we doing here?

302
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,803
I have to find it quickly.

303
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,557
I was feeling rushed
and I'm running out of time.

304
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,643
-If I don't, the business will--
-One second.

305
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,271
Clear your mind for one second.

306
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,358
Have you been sleeping
or eating since that day?

307
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,613
What you need
is a moment to relax your mind.

308
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,118
You're right.

309
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,917
-It's good.
-Is it?

310
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,214
I prepared something for you.

311
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,220
Here.

312
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,684

315
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,360
Is this for me?

316
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:48,820
This is mine!

317
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,034
What was that?
Were you just showing it off?

318
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,243
Look.

319
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,453
Number one on my speed dial.

320
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,582
"Oh Mi-seon" with a heart.

321
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,674
-What?
-Why won't it connect?

322
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,760
Why isn't this working?

323
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,261
What do you mean?

324
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,430
Jeez, I barely have any reception!

325
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,432
Why won't it work?

326
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,143
-Come on.
-What is it?

327
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,147
-I've found a signal.
-What's that sound?

328
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,948
Look.

329
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,743
This is yours.

330
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,123
We should've bought this ages ago.

331
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:46,086
We're the only two salespeople
who don't have cell phones.

332
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,546
Is this really for me?

333
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,428
You didn't have to get one for me.

334
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,098
Thank you.

335
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,810
-Do you like it?
-This is so light.

336
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,480
I think it's as heavy as a block of tofu.

337
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,316
-What kind of an analogy is that?
-No?

338
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,239
So, what now?

339
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,243
Will I be number one on your speed dial?

340
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:21,997
-Yes.
-What will you save my name as?

341
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,875
Your name, Kang Tae-poong.

342
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,461
You'd be on top. It's the first letter
of the Korean alphabet.

343
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,587
You can be so dry.

344
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,008
Just Kang Tae-poong? How about…

345
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,345
You can go with Honey-poong

346
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,099
or Baby-poong, something like that.

347
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,855
-Honey-poong?
-Yes.

348
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,567
Honey-poong? Okay.

349
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,986
But that'll put you last on the list.
Is that okay?

350
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,321
No, I want to be number one.

351
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,032
I mean that you'd be at the bottom
in the actual contacts.

352
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,908
Then just use the first alphabet.

353
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,410
-The first?
-Or Baby-poong.

354
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,050
I knew it. We have such good chemistry.

355
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,164
<i>Is the sea a sky for whales?</i>

356
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,759
<i>I'm sorry for making you worried today.</i>

357
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,387
"Anyway."

358
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:05,016
"What is on your

359
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,227
mind?"

360
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,105
"Are you thinking about me…"

361
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:17,362
Where's the question mark?
The question mark.

362
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,489
The question mark.

363
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,491
My gosh!

364
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,000
One more time.

365
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:35,964
"What are you up to?"

366
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,842
You're finally home after days,

367
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,428
so why are you texting
instead of sleeping?

368
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,013
Mom.

369
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,642
Do you want me to check your biorhythm?
I can check it here.

370
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:53,481
-Is it accurate?
-Of course.

371
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:59,320
Your date of birth.

372
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,037
<i>Why don't we take a day trip</i>
<i>to the sea with Beom?</i>

373
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:10,999
<i>And then, let's go look</i>
<i>for the promissory note.</i>

374
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,678
Sounds great!

375
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,056
My condition is great? How so?

376
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,395
Everything about you is great.
Everything, including your skin.

377
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,106
I've always had good skin.

378
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,026
That's untrustworthy.

379
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,737
"I would…

380
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,532
love to."

381
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:59,047
ALL VEHICLES MUST CHECK IN
AT THE SECURITY OFFICE

382
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,410
Did you get this from that woman?

383
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,831
Yes, I received it
from Ms. Cha Seon-taek herself today.

384
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,796
I thought she got fired
from the juice company.

385
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,590
-She must've had someone to borrow from.
-She sold her house.

386
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,343
Of course.

387
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,721
She shouldn't have slept in peace
before she paid my money back.

388
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,640
What's your plan now?

389
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,101
Tae-poong, that kid,

390
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,478
knows about the promissory note,
but he doesn't have it.

391
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,315
He had no idea money wasn't the problem,
but our shares were at stake.

392
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:04,529
"Pyo Bak-ho will
transfer 20% of his shares…"

393
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,614
No.

394
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:10,368
"Transfer 30% of his shares…"

395
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,248
What about the flight?

396
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,501
I'll send him away as soon as possible.

397
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,880
Have him stay abroad
and study for about three years.

398
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,966
By then, Kang Tae-poong
would've been gone without a trace.

399
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:33,933
CEO OFFICE

400
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,775
Dad!

401
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,998
-Send my driver home. You may leave too.
-Yes, sir.

402
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,421
What were you two talking about?

403
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,134
PURCHASE AGREEMENT

404
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:11,137
Dad. No.

405
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,181
Mr. Pyo.

406
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,850
I went through such a ridiculous incident.

407
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,229
And my family was behind it.

408
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,907
-Why did you set the place on fire?
-That's not the problem!

409
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,036
Why did you sell my gloves to that idiot?

410
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,041
Yes, I set the place on fire.
I knew it was dangerous,

411
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,961
but I put up with the risk
and did that. Do you know why?

412
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,132
Because I wanted you…

413
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,553
to be proud of me just once.

414
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,597
And you chose to set the place on fire?

415
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,557
You idiot!

416
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:01,854
Have you considered
the kind of consequences you'd face?

417
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,024
That's the very proof of your idiocy!

418
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,988
I'm dumb, and you're so smart

419
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,157
that you had to borrow money
from Typhoon Trading?

420
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,494
What's wrong?
Did you think I didn't know a thing?

421
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,540
Tae-poong always gets the best of you…

422
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,670
because you let him
get a hold of your weakness!

423
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,844
You wicked punk. Do you know
how I kept this business going?

424
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:37,140
I should've had a son like Tae-poong,
not an idiot like you!

425
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,560
Dad…

426
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,983
-You can't say that to me.
-Why not?

427
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:51,112
My business wouldn't be in this state
if a smart kid like him were my son!

428
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,073
You can't do a thing without me!

429
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,952
But Tae-poong is out there
spreading his wings without his dad!

430
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:02,290
All you ever do is pull tricks
and look for excuses!

431
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,044
You're a loser.

432
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,255
Get out.

433
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,758
Go and get ready to go to America.

434
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:15,011
I don't want to see you here. Get out!

435
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,487
Why do you call me a loser?

436
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,198
PYO BAK-HO

437
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,033
Dad.

438
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,203
I'm not a loser.

439
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,333
I'm not a loser!

440
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,804
Tae-poong is the thief.

441
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,140
He keeps stealing everything that's mine.

442
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,186
The girls,

443
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,689
the fabric, the shoes, the gloves,

444
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,901
and…

445
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,990
even you, Dad.

446
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,952
He even took you from me.

447
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,240
Gosh.

448
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,829
Dad.

449
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,917
I once heard somewhere
that people don't die that easily.

450
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,959
So,

451
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,630
wait here just a little, okay?

452
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,889
I'll get my victory
against that punk, Tae-poong,

453
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,100
and come back to get you.

454
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,858
{\an8}So…

455
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,154
{\an8}hang in there for a while.

456
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:41,008
<i>Light you up at the end of the night</i>

457
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,597
<i>As you flowed in your loneliness</i>

458
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:51,769
<i>You did not enjoy any of your days</i>

459
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:57,525
<i>And crossed winter with a blank face</i>

460
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,708
Wang Nam-mo.

461
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,917
Make me something to eat.

462
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,258
Why haven't you eaten yet?

463
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,595
Mind your own business.

464
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:32,226
Then, why are you strumming alone
instead of meeting <i>gumiho?</i>

465
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,855
Mom.

466
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,566
Have you ever heard me sing?

467
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,984
Of course, I have.

468
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,236
When you were in third grade,

469
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,448
you were chosen to sing
the national anthem on the field day.

470
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,283
But not since then.

471
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,452
What do you say?
Should I sing something now?

472
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,579
No, don't bother me while I eat.

473
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,624
Just listen to it. It's not so bad.

474
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,418
-Forget it.
-Okay.

475
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,973
<i>Her smile</i>

476
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,853
<i>Is like a full-bloomed magnolia</i>

477
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,899
You have a pretty nice voice.

478
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,734
And you're good with the guitar.

479
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:27,990
<i>Whenever I looked at her</i>

480
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,243
<i>It was always like a warm spring day</i>

481
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,499
<i>On the day she first cried</i>

482
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,212
<i>I was shocked out of my mind</i>

483
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,176
<i>Her beautiful face</i>

484
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,179
<i>Was covered with tears</i>

485
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,519
<i>She always smiled no matter the pain</i>

486
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,397
<i>But on the day she first shed tears</i>

487
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,191
{\an8}KIM EUL-NYEO
DEPUTY BRANCH MANAGER

488
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,820
<i>It felt like the world came crashing down</i>

489
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,737
There, there.

490
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,824
<i>I felt so stifled on the inside</i>

491
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,786
<i>But I can't see it anymore</i>

492
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,916
<i>The way she smiled</i>

493
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:25,047
<i>On the day she first cried</i>

494
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,134
{\an8}<i>She left my life</i>

495
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,181
<i>On the day she first cried</i>

496
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,018
<i>She left my life</i>

497
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,822
Why on earth…

498
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,954
do kids grow up this fast?

499
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,252
It feels like
I didn't even get to see you much.

500
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:09,758
What have I lived for all these years?

501
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,311
Mom.

502
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,274
Ms. Eul-nyeo.

503
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,362
I love you.

504
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,454
You're driving me crazy.

505
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,585
Come on out, Mi-ho!

506
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:52,968
Oh, my.

507
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:57,765
Why did you get two watermelons?
Those must've been heavy!

508
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,808
They were so light
I thought they were tangerines.

509
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,227
Show me your hands.

510
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,771
With all this stuff,
your hands must've been sore.

511
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,147
Hey, Nam-mo.

512
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,650
This is for you and Grandma.

513
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,152
Gosh, you didn't have to get us one.

514
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,657
Little Ms. Oh, you should be
fully dressed before you walk out.

515
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,116
I'm fully dressed.

516
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,993
Oh, my. You're unbelievable.

517
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:21,872
You can't go around looking like this,
exposing all of your body!

518
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,582
My goodness. I can't believe it.

519
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,709
I don't want to wear this, Ms. Jung!

520
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,294
-You have to!
-This is fashion!

521
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,837
You can't go out like this.

522
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,881
People will be
terrified of you in this state.

523
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,509
-No, she's just my style.
-Silence.

524
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,761
You look much better.

525
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,196
Good grief, Ms. Jung.
Here comes the peacock.

526
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,241
He's just born that good-looking.

527
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,828
Looking racy and nice. Good.

528
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,871
Where's Mi-seon?

529
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,503
Let's go! I'm ready.

530
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,965
Why do you have so much stuff?

531
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:17,219
I boiled some eggs and corn and packed
side dishes, lettuce, and chili peppers.

532
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,013
These will cost money outside.

533
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,059
Please stop acting so miserably stingy.

534
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,103
Why? I love how smart she is.

535
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,106
-Well, please keep an eye on my grandma.
-You love it?

536
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,025
She's been sleeping a lot lately.

537
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,067
Cut it out.

538
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,987
The elderly tend to lose energy
in the dead of summer.

539
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,448
Have a relaxing time there.

540
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,783
Thank you. We'll make it quick.

541
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,452
Nice job with the brows.

542
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,329
-So what?
-"So what?"

543
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,788
-Back at you.
-No, you.

544
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,790
-You're so annoying!
-Hey, Beom!

545
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,626
We'll leave if you don't come out!

546
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,922
-Oh, my.
-Wow.

547
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,384
-Look at you.
-I'm nothing compared to that guy.

548
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,427
He's the real deal.

549
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,346
The sea is calling out to me!

550
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,298
SAMPO, THE BEACH OF LOVE AND ROMANCE

551
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,469
Tubes for rent!

552
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,350
Oh, wow.

553
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:53,023
-Mi-seon, how far does the sea stretch?
-Everything you see out there is the sea.

554
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,611
Are you scared? Come here.

555
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,154
Come to me.

556
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,871
Let's go and look at the sea!

557
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,375
Here we go.

558
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,546
Beom, the sea is vast and deep.

559
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,589
The sea stretches all the way to there.

560
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,717
-Then we'll die if we go that far.
-Is that so?

561
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,554
What do you think is under the sea?

562
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,473
-Hey.
-That's cold.

563
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,268
It feels cool.

564
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:35,774
There are waves,
sand, and fish in the sea.

565
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:38,110
And whales and treasures.

566
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,194
That's right.

567
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,452
{\an8}Even when you face
something big and scary,

568
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,829
{\an8}try to think of what's inside.

569
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,623
No matter how vast the sea is,

570
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:56,378
in the end,
it all began with this cool water.

571
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,137
-Hey!
-What?

572
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,891
Hey, Beom, with this, you won't die
even if you go all the way out there.

573
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,184
-Put it on.
-Put it on!

574
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,520
Hey, the sun's going down.
Let's have fun already!

575
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,980
-Be careful! Don't fall!
-Let's go!

576
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,357
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

577
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,818
-Oh, my!
-It's so cold!

578
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,237
Come on in!

579
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,531
Come and join us!

580
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,290
Did you just splash me?
Get back here! Back here!

581
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:34,708
Come join us!

582
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,588
There.

583
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:41,757
So muscular.

584
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,426
Catch me if you can!

585
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:47,679
Catch me if you can!

586
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:56,271
I said catch me, not toss me in the water!

587
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,774
-I'm sorry.
-What am I going to do?

588
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,862
I'm leaving!

589
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,075
Wang Nam-mo!

590
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,245
Wang Nam-mo, you! I'm going to kill you!

591
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,918
Stay here, Beom.

592
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:25,384
Mr. Kang Tae-poong.

593
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,721
You were thinking about work again.

594
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,683
I was thinking about my girlfriend.

595
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,731
This won't do. Come here.

596
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,899
-Why?
-Come.

597
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,905
-Do we leave him there?
-Yes, just for a moment.

598
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,211
Mr. Kang, look over here.

599
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:04,631
There are clams everywhere! Look.

600
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,971
Do you see these seaweeds in here?

601
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,056
The clams are the ones eating it.

602
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,766
It's this clam. Littleneck clam.

603
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,144
This is what you're looking for.

604
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,272
Littleneck clams.

605
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:23,942
Wait.

606
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,529
What? What is it?

607
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,864
Is this sea mustard?

608
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,492
Is this sea mustard?

609
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,661
I found some sea mustard.

610
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,539
Why was it there?

611
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,459
Look at this.

612
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,171
It's sea mustard, right?

613
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,757
Yes, it is, and there's a bunch of them.

614
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,800
So look for littleneck clams
instead of that.

615
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,427
So sea mustard isn't actually a plant.

616
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,846
If you think about it,
it shouldn't be called seaweed.

617
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,056
It's marine algae.

618
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,726
Marine algae.
Stop looking for marine algae.

619
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,269
You can look for these now.

620
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,234
The seaweed soup we had together
last birthday was so delicious.

621
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,863
My goodness! Let's go eat.

622
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,031
Let's go.

623
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,283
Let's just go home.

624
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,578
We can go home for food.
I have plenty of it.

625
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,667
I'm actually out of side dishes.

626
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:26,088
Happy birthday to our new employee,

627
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,256
-Kang Tae-poong!
-Cheers.

628
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,424
Cheers.

629
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,967
-Thank you.
-Sure.

630
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,052
Thank you.

631
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,388
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

632
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,224
-Thank you.
-You should eat.

633
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,018
It's delicious.

634
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,312
It's good.

635
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,569
We can't collect these after sunset.

636
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,405
So hurry up and find some.

637
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,407
Find some more. Yes, that's it.

638
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,325
You're taking the marine algae home?

639
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:01,623
More sea mustard.

640
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,588
This feels like manual labor.

641
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,757
Anyway.

642
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,846
How did Littleneck 1 and Littleneck 2
end up getting caught by us?

643
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,099
-Stop naming them. We'll be eating them.
-What?

644
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,144
I gathered those as food.

645
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,278
-There's a huge clam.
-Where?

646
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,697
Where is it?

647
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,449
Oops, I tripped!

648
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,616
Gosh.

649
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,910
Hey, be careful.

650
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,499
Hey, my littleneck clams.

651
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,294
Why did you do that?

652
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:52,007
Well, after spending
a few hours with them, they grew on me.

653
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,425
They grew on you that quickly?

654
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,635
How can I eat those cute things?

655
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,930
-My gosh.
-Oh, dear.

656
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,561
But you had nothing else on your mind
while doing this, right?

657
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,023
That's so true.

658
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,111
I had nothing else on my mind.

659
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,116
Neither the promissory note
nor Pyo Merchant Marine.

660
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,746
That's good enough then. That will do.

661
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,669
Oh, right! Try to guess what I brought.

662
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,046
Did you bring something?

663
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:32,714
-Look.
-What is that?

664
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,302
It's a top shell. It hangs onto sounds,
so you can hear waves in it.

665
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,388
Let me hear it.

666
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,309
-You can, right? Can you?
-You're right. I can.

667
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,229
-My gosh. Yes.
-You hear it, right?

668
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,355
I can.

669
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:53,777
I love you.

670
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,702
{\an8}Can you hear my feelings?

671
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,373
I can hear it loud and clear.

672
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,504
You got something on your face.

673
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,756
I think your hand is dirtier.

674
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:17,425
-No.
-Are you putting it on my face?

675
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,428
No way. Look.

676
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,598
You're getting more on me.

677
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,183
No way.

678
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:58,216
Then Ji-yeong,
who ranked second in her class,

679
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,344
pushed Min-ji,
the top student, off the rooftop.

680
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,512
Why?

681
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,765
And Min-ji fell headfirst.

682
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,269
After that incident,

683
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,731
Ji-yeong was at her evening study session.

684
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,233
Soon, she realized
she was there all alone.

685
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,904
-Then she began to hear something.
-Okay.

686
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,241
Thump, thump, thump.

687
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,952
"She's not here."

688
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,749
Thump, thump, thump.

689
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,043
"She's not here either."

690
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:37,380
Thump, thump, thump.

691
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,592
Thump.

692
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,929
"She's here!"

693
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,013
She's here!

694
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,765
-Stop it!
-Don't do that!

695
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,768
-She's here!
-Stop it!

696
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,437
-That was so shocking!
-Mi-seon's good at this.

697
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,065
-Hey, forget it.
-Why are you so shocked?

698
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,734
Why was she there?

699
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,694
I feel bad for that girl, though.

700
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,197
-Ranking second is still good.
-Right?

701
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,450
Hey, Beom. Forget that.
Have a bite, go inside and go to sleep.

702
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,954
I'm not sleepy.
Stop telling me to go to sleep.

703
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,623
Beom, do you want your brother-in-law
to sing you a lullaby?

704
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,959
I decline, Mr. Wang Nam-mo.

705
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,466
Are you leaving? Good night.

706
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,762
That was so shocking.

707
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,390
My gosh.

708
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,975
Ji-yeong sounds so evil. How awful.

709
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,935
-How can she push her?
-Hello.

710
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,062
<i>Hello? Can I speak to Mi-ho?</i>

711
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:37,691
Who would call at this hour?

712
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,527
No one.

713
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,655
-Who was it?
-Someone had the wrong number.

714
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,615
It was the wrong number. A stranger.

715
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,076
-I mean it.
-You're acting odd.

716
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,828
-I'm serious.
-Is she cheating on you?

717
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,787
I said no.

718
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,709
-But she's acting suspicious.
-It's no one.

719
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,293
She can't cheat.

720
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,171
What do you mean, I can't?

721
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,383
What's with you, Mi-seon?

722
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,011
Hey, why is your ex-boyfriend
looking for you?

723
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,012
You mean Tae-min?

724
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,514
-Why didn't you put me on?
-Hey!

725
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,018
Why do you stay in touch
with your ex-boyfriend?

726
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,729
Because I had to say something to him.

727
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,398
Anyway, if he calls again, put me on.

728
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:19,399
Hey!

729
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,193
You're not up to anything, are you?

730
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,654
I'm not. What's with you?

731
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,243
She seems so suspicious.

732
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:46,217
-Are you sure you can sleep here?
-I'll be fine.

733
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,011
I like sleeping in the car.

734
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,430
The tent is too small,
so let Nam-mo and Beom stay.

735
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,348
And you can relax with Mi-ho.

736
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,394
It seems uncomfortable.

737
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,521
It feels so nice and comfy.

738
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,607
Go to sleep.

739
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,654
It doesn't seem all right.

740
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,864
Gosh.

741
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:08,948
It's so relaxing.

742
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,631
You're really going to go to sleep?

743
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,220
I'm tired.
And we have to get up early tomorrow.

744
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,847
Can we talk?

745
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,558
Later. Let's talk later.

746
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:38,812
Later. You always say later.

747
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,858
You said you'll take up another job
after this summer break.

748
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:47,070
Even now, I only see you
in the dead of night. How is this dating?

749
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,155
It's just a late-night stroll.

750
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:52,992
Why? I like seeing you like this
even if it's for a brief moment.

751
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,994
Do you not feel that way?

752
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:56,788
No, I don't.

753
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,333
Darn it. Forget it. Whatever.

754
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:29,946
It could be somewhere here.

755
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:49,841
The ceiling…

756
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,070
What's this?

757
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,823
Let's see.

758
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,076
It looks old.

759
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,078
Could it be…

760
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,040
Why is this here?

761
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:25,168
1986 STUDENT RECORD

762
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:31,382
ETHICS B, KOREAN D, MATH F, SCIENCE F,
PHYSICAL EDUCATION A, ENGLISH D

763
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:35,428
HE MAY HAVE AWFUL GRADES,
BUT HE HAS AN EXEMPLARY PERSONALITY

764
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:37,931
It's been so long.

765
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:45,813
{\an8}I APOLOGIZE FOR MY SON'S POOR PERFORMANCE
PLEASE CONTINUE TO GUIDE HIM WELL

766
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,274
That's so dad.

767
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,157
"I apologize
for my son's poor performance."

768
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,210
My gosh.

769
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,133
You must've been surprised
when my sister hung up.

770
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,301
Sorry.

771
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,429
Anyway, have you considered
what I said last time?

772
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:24,561
Don't be like this, Tae-min.
You said you'd love to.

773
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,604
You're just awful.

774
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:30,650
Don't be so awful.

775
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,779
<i>I'd like to do that one of these days.</i>

776
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,206
It's not like that.

777
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,791
Hey!

778
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,545
Good luck with him.

779
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,592
Hey, Nam-mo!

780
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,720
Darn it.

781
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,604
What's going on?

782
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,773
What are you looking for?
The promissory note?

783
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,652
Well, I heard
this car was his favorite thing.

784
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,197
I thought it might be here somewhere.

785
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,538
What happens if you don't find it?
The deadline is coming up.

786
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:32,962
In that case…

787
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,053
I have to give up

788
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,181
my position as the CEO.

789
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,891
-What did you say? Ouch!
-Wait.

790
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:47,644
-Are you okay? What happened?
-Wait. Darn it.

791
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,647
Are you okay? Is the car okay?

792
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,856
Are you okay, Mi-seon?

793
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,694
Give up what? Your position as the CEO?

794
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,738
What are you talking about?

795
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:02,659
Well, I couldn't sit around
and let the business go bankrupt.

796
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,663
And from the company's perspective,

797
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,248
me leaving is the easiest way
to handle things.

798
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,626
How is that easy?

799
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,127
Jeez!

800
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,338
That must hurt.

801
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:17,465
So what are you…

802
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:20,134
After all that,
you're talking about moving offices?

803
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,265
It was a promise.

804
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:29,686
-Six!
-Hey.

805
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,605
-Okay.
-What now?

806
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:34,774
-All of a sudden?
-Okay.

807
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,235
He's so mean.

808
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:39,070
Zero.

809
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,322
Three.

810
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,870
I am back.

811
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,875
You're back, Mr. Bae!

812
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,753
Everything went well thanks to you!

813
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,380
So while we're on the subject,

814
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:01,634
why don't I get promoted
to manager when this deal ends?

815
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:02,552
Manager Bae.

816
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,723
Was he a part of the company?

817
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,600
-Is he on the payroll?
-Not really.

818
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,438
-Good work.
-Good work.

819
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:15,815
So?

820
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,317
What do you want to do once we get paid?

821
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:23,030
How about some barbecue
at Jangsu Barbecue Restaurant?

822
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,866
Let's eat some ribeye.

823
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:28,911
True love can be expressed
when cash is exchanged, you know.

824
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,123
I'll leave you at that. You know, right?

825
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,753
I want us to return to our old office.

826
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,838
I miss my old desk.

827
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,508
I miss that place.

828
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,310
<i>I made my promise on that day.</i>

829
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,980
That we'd go back to our old office
the first thing when we made money.

830
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,156
What if we don't find it?

831
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,366
Do you have a plan for that?

832
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,828
I'll face it when the moment comes.

833
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,331
Good grief.

834
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,374
Stop that.

835
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,210
Don't do it.

836
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,591
What's that? Is that a piece of paper?

837
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:25,009
-Is that it?
-No, not this one.

838
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,594
Why not? Let me see it.

839
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,054
-It's nothing.
-That might be it.

840
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:41,067
Should we look for it tomorrow?

841
01:03:49,617 --> 01:03:50,451
Gosh.

842
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,915
-Mi-seon.
-Yes?

843
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:58,709
Mi-ho is laying down,
but she keeps swearing.

844
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,254
-What? She did?
-Go and scold her.

845
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,173
All right. Go to sleep.
Will you sleep here?

846
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:05,758
Why would she swear?

847
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:19,689
TYPHOON TRADING

848
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,026
Please put it there for now.

849
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:24,944
Okay.

850
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:40,668
Why won't he pick up?

851
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,839
Mr. Kang.

852
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:48,050
You're going to visit Mr. Pyo?
He's not picking up.

853
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,887
He's not, but today is the day
we agreed on, so I have to show up.

854
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,347
I'll go with you.

855
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,225
Listen.

856
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,645
I'll take this too.

857
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,688
What's that?

858
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,482
A cashier's check.

859
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,651
The price for the gloves
you took from him.

860
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,822
No, we got those gloves
in return for the money he owed us.

861
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,825
I know. The amount he borrowed in 1989
along with the interest

862
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,869
is much more than the gloves we took.

863
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:19,749
But it's also true
that you didn't find the promissory note.

864
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,461
There's a letter of guarantee.

865
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:28,966
And that letter is the acknowledgement
that there is a promissory note out there.

866
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:34,347
So I'll meet him today
and make an offer to just call it even.

867
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,224
Okay, let's hurry.

868
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:49,153
I'm not here to fight today.
I have an appointment.

869
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:51,364
Mr. Pyo is busy.

870
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:55,117
-Call him before you come!
-He won't pick up! What can I do?

871
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,286
I have to meet him today!

872
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,747
But is he inside?

873
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,709
What now? Are you doubting me?

874
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,211
Doubting, my foot.

875
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,421
-Move aside!
-Hey, wait!

876
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,840
-Hey!
-Security!

877
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:16,305
Why do you keep avoiding me?

878
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:19,850
What?

879
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,019
Where's Mr. Pyo?

880
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:30,236
What's he talking about?
Introducing himself?

881
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,198
Where's the CEO?

882
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:35,241
CEO PYO BAK-HO

883
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:41,288
Hey. Where's your dad?

884
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:43,791
You little punk.

885
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,168
Why do you keep asking for him?

886
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,464
-Say it to me if you need to talk.
-I have nothing to say to you.

887
01:06:50,548 --> 01:06:51,799
Where's the CEO?

888
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:53,843
I'm the CEO.

889
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:55,886
Cut this crap and tell me.

890
01:06:59,056 --> 01:07:01,017
Goodness, I'm sorry.

891
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:02,309
Why, you…

892
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:05,271
How dare you barge in here? Get out.

893
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,356
Stop lurking around and get out!

894
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,315
Okay, I'll go.

895
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:10,067
The CEO isn't even around.

896
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:15,906
This looks adequate.

897
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:20,036
-What's the time, Ms. Oh?
-It's 11:15 a.m.

898
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:23,622
What the heck are you doing?

899
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,797
All of you saw me here.

900
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:34,842
I came here on the scheduled date.

901
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:38,804
Let's go.

902
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,348
KANG TAE-POONG
11:15 A.M., JUNE 29TH, 1998

903
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,975
That's a permanent marker.

904
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,982
Did you notice the desk?
He really seemed absent.

905
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,108
I noticed.

906
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,029
What do you think happened to him?

907
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,865
We'll see in time.

908
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:02,745
Let's go. It's a good day,
and everyone's waiting.

909
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:03,746
Okay.

910
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:42,576
This place brings back so many emotions.

911
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:45,996
Be quiet and get me water.

912
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,541
Sure, it's placed inside the pantry.

913
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,960
Do we have to make such a huge fuss?

914
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,171
-Where are the scissors?
-They're on my desk.

915
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,970
You're making this worse.
Can you play just one song?

916
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:05,641
Is this broken?

917
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,227
Mr. Kang, I get it,
but you're wearing white pants

918
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:11,564
with your shirt buttoned down there.
Isn't that too revealing?

919
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:15,317
I know a thing or two about fashion.

920
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,912
Watch out, Myung-gwan.

921
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,789
We've returned in glory!

922
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:30,457
No!

923
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,086
Are you okay?

924
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:37,047
-Come on!
-What's this?

925
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,717
What is this?

926
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,637
You should've set this out
after the plant came in!

927
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:44,555
Come on!

928
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:48,809
Let us cut the tape
to celebrate Typhoon Trading's return.

929
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,644
I will call out Typhoon Trading.

930
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:54,523
Then, everyone, please shout out,
"We can do it!"

931
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:58,527
Typhoon Trading!

932
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,862
We can do it!

933
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,285
You didn't set a timer?

934
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,453
I didn't set a timer.

935
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,412
Me neither.

936
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,207
What did we just do? Are you guys dumb?

937
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,543
Mr. Bae, you should've set up the timer.

938
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:18,255
Hey, why are you getting on my case?
That's not my vibe today.

939
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:20,716
Hey, that's not my vibe today either.

940
01:10:20,799 --> 01:10:22,843
Then should I do it? Or Myung-gwan?

941
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:25,095
His hands keep trembling.

942
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,014
Let's just take turns.

943
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:28,891
-Let's put these back together.
-Let's do it.

944
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,184
Should I bring the stapler?

945
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,936
It's too ragged.

946
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:34,063
-Right. A stapler.
-I'll bring it anyway.

947
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:36,815
-What are we doing?
-We can just stick them back together.

948
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,526
Is that right? Okay. All set.

949
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,111
-We're set.
-Okay.

950
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,613
Did you stick them together?

951
01:10:43,447 --> 01:10:44,990
Hey, you'll staple your hand!

952
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,575
-I won't. Be careful.
-No!

953
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,827
Come on!

954
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,162
Typhoon Trading!

955
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,705
We can do it!

956
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,875
{\an8}One, two, three.

957
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:09,348
Anyway.

958
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,102
Where did Pyo Bak-ho go?

959
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:16,021
Forget about him on a good day like this.

960
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,732
He's not around. What can he do?

961
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,859
Why won't you use the CEO's office?

962
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:27,157
I want to leave the place as is.
I also like it out here.

963
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:32,413
This rice cake is nice and chewy,

964
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,789
just like our future.

965
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,418
-I can't seem to swallow it.
-It's choking me.

966
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,005
Anyway, where's Mr. Bae?

967
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:43,090
He went out to pick up a call.

968
01:11:43,173 --> 01:11:46,635
What? He's been on the phone
for half a day now.

969
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,263
-He's back.
-Mr. Bae.

970
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,266
Have some rice cake, Mr. Bae.

971
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:53,600
Have some.

972
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:55,728
Mr. Bae.

973
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:03,110
-Is something going on?
-Hey, what's wrong?

974
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,406
Mr. Bae.

975
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:11,785
What's wrong?

976
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,206
Mr. Bae, what's going on?

977
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:20,461
It's my dad.

978
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:27,176
He's going to kill himself.

979
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,685
What am I going to do?

980
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:17,351
BORN IN THE WIND

981
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:52,386
TYPHOON FAMILY

982
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,430
{\an8}<i>Dad… Dad!</i>

983
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,516
{\an8}<i>And yet, they proceeded</i>
<i>to declare bankruptcy right away.</i>

984
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:58,684
{\an8}<i>That does seem fishy,</i>

985
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,645
{\an8}<i>but what I find odd</i>
<i>is that I ran into Hyun-jun there.</i>

986
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,105
{\an8}<i>It's voice-activated.</i>

987
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:06,400
{\an8}<i>It follows the source of the sound.</i>
<i>My father had it patented.</i>

988
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:09,361
{\an8}<i>You two are walking</i>
<i>unusually close together.</i>

989
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,320
{\an8}<i>Be careful, okay?</i>

990
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,697
{\an8}<i>You could end up catching feelings.</i>

991
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,117
{\an8}Get the hell out!

992
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,952
{\an8}<i>If you got lost without a fuss,</i>

993
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:20,289
{\an8}<i>everyone outside</i>
<i>could at least keep their jobs.</i>

994
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,666
<i>Wait for me, Dad.</i>

995
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:24,209
<i>I won't ever give up.</i>

996
