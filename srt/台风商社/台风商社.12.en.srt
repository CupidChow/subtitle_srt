00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,961
TYPHOON FAMILY

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,379
Break!

3
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,968
{\an8}That was absolutely amazing!

4
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,554
{\an8}Please give them
another big round of applause!

5
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,731
{\an8}That was amazing!

6
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,363
{\an8}<i>I once asked Nam-mo</i>
<i>what was most precious to him.</i>

7
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,409
{\an8}Soldiers, even as we speak right now,

8
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,288
{\an8}there is someone
who spends her nights up thinking of you.

9
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,999
{\an8}It's none other than your mothers.

10
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,755
{\an8}<i>Back then, he chuckled,</i>
<i>asking why I asked him that question.</i>

11
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:32,926
The forever refuge of our hearts.

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,928
Let us call on her.

13
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,722
-Mother!
-Mother!

14
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,224
Here she is.

15
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,897
Thank you for coming today, ma'am.
Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,317
-Why, hello.
-Yes, hello.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,111
You must've brought
lots of delicious food.

18
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:57,742
No, I didn't go through much trouble.
I just bought everything my son likes.

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,994
-Is that so?
-Yes.

20
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,497
Ma'am, can you brag
about how great your son is?

21
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:10,171
My son has very long limbs,
and he's good-looking.

22
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,592
He also has a melancholic look
in his eyes, which isn't a bad addition.

23
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,010
He's good-looking.

24
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,266
She can't seem to stop laughing
at the thought of meeting her son soon.

25
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:22,559
-Right?
-Yes.

26
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:27,689
If any of you think
this lady is your mother,

27
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,107
come up on the stage.

28
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,567
Private Wang Nam-mo, sir!

29
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,443
Corporal Bae Song-jung!

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,118
I am sure she is my mother!

31
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,995
Do you have a reason for that?

32
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,873
Look at my long limbs
and melancholic eyes.

33
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,502
She has to be my mother!

34
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,212
What about you?

35
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:54,215
I already know
the lady back there is not my mother!

36
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,842
Then why are you here?

37
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,844
I wanted to say something
to my girlfriend.

38
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,431
Young-in, you're free
to go on dates for now.

39
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,100
But let us reunite after 19 months!

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,436
-Say it!
-Goodness.

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,438
Now, why are you here?

42
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,481
My mother cannot cook!

43
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:13,693
I always made her breakfast
even before I was enlisted!

44
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,738
If she chose to buy takeout food
even on a day like this,

45
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,782
I am perfectly sure that she is my mother!

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,332
So, whose mother is she?
Let us all call her out here together.

47
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,210
-Mother!
-Mother!

48
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,880
Here she is.

49
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,382
Please give her a big hand.

50
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,051
Do you see your son up here?

51
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,386
Have you met your son?

52
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,389
-Nam-mo.
-Her son's here!

53
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,768
Goodness, ma'am.

54
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,478
-Oh, dear.
-Oh, my.

55
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,356
His legs must've given out
because he was too nervous.

56
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,899
Are you all right?

57
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,318
Did you gain weight? Why are you so heavy?

58
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,654
-Good grief, you punk.
-Ma'am, please.

59
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,072
Oh, my. What do I do now?

60
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,282
-You're with your son now.
-I'm sorry.

61
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,577
Salute! I am Private Wang Nam-mo, ma'am!

62
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,871
Mother, please receive my bow!

63
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,542
Her son is giving her a deep bow.

64
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,337
Look at how brave he is.

65
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,839
He's a proud soldier of the ROK.

66
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,758
He's such a gallant soldier.

67
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,302
Ma'am, why don't you give him
the biggest hug?

68
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,641
Nam-mo.

69
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,352
Nam-mo…

70
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,732
<i>But he didn't have to tell me</i>
<i>what was most precious to him.</i>

71
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:39,279
And now, it's time to return home!

72
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,323
-Mom!
<i>-Back then, it was such an easy question.</i>

73
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,825
Thank you!

74
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,122
<i>But now…</i>

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,459
Although it's one-sided.

76
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,299
It's my first unrequited love.

77
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,315
-Unrequited love?
-Yes, unrequited love.

78
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,402
My unrequited love for you starts today.

79
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,571
What should I do?
Do you think I'll do a good job?

80
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,659
Do whatever you want.
You don't have to ask me.

81
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,164
Wait for me, my dear unrequited love,
Ms. Oh Mi-seon.

82
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,796
-What makes you so confident?
-Because it's an unrequited love.

83
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,883
Be careful. Behind you.

84
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:53,019
<i>If someone asked me</i>
<i>what is most precious to me now,</i>

85
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,774
<i>how should I answer that question?</i>

86
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:03,529
EPISODE 12:
MY REASON FOR LIVING

87
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,385
It's kind of off.

88
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,241
No, this won't work. It's too high.

89
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,919
Wang Nam-mo!

90
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,089
Hey, Mom. When did you get here?

91
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,007
That darned guitar. I'd better…

92
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,264
Tae-poong's company went under,

93
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,725
but he's still the CEO.

94
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,524
Good grief!

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,026
-Clean up everything.
-Have you eaten?

96
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,446
-Do you want <i>ramyeon?</i>
-No, I don't want to eat.

97
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,948
My goodness. This place is messy.

98
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,616
What on earth is this?

99
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:42,336
THE CUSTOMER'S HAPPINESS IS OUR PRIDE

100
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,255
I'm leaving first. Goodbye.

101
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,381
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

102
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,966
-Bye.
-Look at that girl.

103
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,968
She's going to get a stomachache.

104
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,726
Nam-mo.

105
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,562
Are you still writing music?

106
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,647
It's just a hobby.

107
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,402
Who's this girl?

108
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,821
What do you think?
She's your son's girlfriend.

109
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,656
-Your…
-Isn't she pretty?

110
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,160
Don't fall for girls
just for their looks, please.

111
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,954
Think about what really matters, you punk.

112
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,415
You both look equally pretty.

113
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:24,921
Good grief. You fool!
I can't deal with this anymore.

114
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,672
-Get rid of these.
-What's wrong, Mom?

115
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,591
-Throw these away.
-What do you mean?

116
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,009
-I'll rip this out!
-No!

117
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,305
Are you all right?

118
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,808
Why did you suddenly come
and make a scene?

119
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,686
-Are you hurt?
-Cut it out. I'm fine.

120
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,366
It's okay to date just anyone for now.

121
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,285
But you should be serious
when it comes to marriage, got it?

122
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,578
Mom.

123
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,666
-What do you mean, "just anyone"?
-That girl…

124
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,336
What do her parents do?

125
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,924
Which school did she graduate from?
Where does she live?

126
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,884
She's just anyone if you don't know that!

127
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,845
Mom, I also don't have a dad
if you say it like that.

128
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,891
I barely got into a university,
and our family is penniless too!

129
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:20,476
Isn't that so?

130
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,562
You fool!

131
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,524
How dare you…

132
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,402
How dare you talk like that to me?

133
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,699
Just go, Mom.

134
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,493
Go home. I'm sleeping here tonight.

135
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,591
Do whatever you want.

136
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:57,888
And you…

137
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,685
You better act wisely around that sly girl
named Oh Mi-ho or whatever.

138
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,571
How does she know her name?

139
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,471
Ma'am, it's still hot.

140
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,682
So blow on it first.

141
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,477
Goodness, you're too kind.

142
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,105
-I appreciate it.
-Don't mention it.

143
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,315
It looks good.

144
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,319
Hey, Beom.

145
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,073
Wake up already.
Do you know what time it is?

146
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,532
Goodness, you're a mess.

147
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,077
Open your eyes, Beom.

148
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,246
Stay alert and watch out for cars.

149
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,707
-Okay.
-Have a great day!

150
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,376
Tae-poong! Time to go to work!

151
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:11,045
-I'm leaving!
-Okay, goodbye!

152
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,052
Grandma, eat slowly.

153
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,888
Okay? You have to chew well
and eat slowly.

154
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,139
Okay.

155
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,313
What's with him this early?

156
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,274
-I'm leaving, Grandma.
-Bye.

157
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,491
I'm going to work.

158
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,421
Little Ms. Oh.

159
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,964
Are you busy this week?

160
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,507
Well, take a look at this.

161
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,927
What?

162
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,178
What's this?

163
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,560
It's a notice from the Green Mothers' Club

164
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,272
for moms to stand in front of the school
with a flag for traffic control.

165
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,149
I could always fill in,

166
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,068
but I thought it'd be better
if his pretty sister showed up.

167
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,825
Why did he fold it like this?

168
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,494
He's that thoughtful.

169
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,040
Okay.

170
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,126
I'm leaving.

171
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,379
Have a great day.

172
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,465
-Can we have six sandwiches to go?
-Sure.

173
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,092
-We'll eat two here.
-Okay.

174
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,510
It's better when it's hot.

175
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,513
All done.

176
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,848
Here.

177
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,017
-Thank you.
-You got it on your hand.

178
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,394
Thank you.

179
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,521
I'm fine.

180
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,565
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

181
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,153
-It's hot.
-Is it?

182
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,240
One second. We'll take a milk.

183
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,036
-Go ahead.
-No, I'm fine.

184
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,544
You must enjoy my sandwich a lot.

185
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,047
Isn't she adorable when she eats?

186
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,965
I like her.

187
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,100
Thank you.

188
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,982
It was good, wasn't it?

189
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,400
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

190
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,195
We're at work now.
You need to stop doing that.

191
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:42,530
Stop doing what?

192
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,989
That.

193
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,660
Your unrequited love.

194
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,458
Separating work from my feelings.

195
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,961
What a shame.

196
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,588
-Okay?
-Yes, ma'am!

197
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,967
-Thank you.
-Sure.

198
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,220
Wait.

199
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,598
Why are we the only ones eating?
What about you two?

200
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,685
-We already had one on our way here.
-Is that so?

201
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,272
Why didn't you have it with us?

202
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,774
-Because of my love.
-What?

203
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,194
-My love for a hot sandwich.
-Yes.

204
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,238
-I see.
-Enjoy.

205
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,990
Thank you.

206
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,283
I also have love…

207
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,744
for sandwiches loaded with sugar.

208
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,873
I'm disappointed, Ms. Oh.

209
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,167
You missed my preference today.

210
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,545
Sure.

211
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,384
Things seem slow here.

212
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,390
You're all having some sandwich.
Is it good?

213
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:58,397
The surgical gloves aren't manufactured
in three different places.

214
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,191
There's only one place in America.

215
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,778
That's monopoly.

216
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,822
So, who will benefit from this?

217
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,245
Those punks had bottles
of expensive liquor,

218
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,706
then gave us no discount.

219
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,875
They have a good reason not to, actually.

220
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,338
Blaze Eagles are monopolizing
the powdered gloves industry right now.

221
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,422
Monopolizing?

222
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:28,260
All right.
They're the only ones we can turn to.

223
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:35,726
Typhoon Trading has probably realized
they're bust, right?

224
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,771
They probably know they're bust.

225
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,193
-Hey, get over here.
-Yes?

226
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,581
PURCHASE SPECIFICATION

227
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,874
We received an estimate,

228
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,627
and their price is fixed,
regardless of quantity or conditions.

229
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,921
They hold a monopoly
and face no competition,

230
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,048
so there's no reason to negotiate.

231
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,050
This is a serious problem.

232
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,469
If the cost price is the same,

233
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,263
it's clearly an advantage
to Pyo Merchant Marine.

234
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,809
Why? Because they have a vessel?

235
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,478
Not just that. They have a warehouse too.

236
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,356
Those two already cost a fortune.

237
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,859
They may have a ship,
but it comes with an operation cost.

238
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,697
Why don't you run the numbers
with our profit margin at three percent?

239
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,829
We'll only make 9.18 million won.

240
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,288
Goodness, that's too low.

241
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,833
Are there any other costs we can cut?

242
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,420
We can cut on the warehouse cost
if we schedule everything perfectly.

243
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,296
The risk is too high for that plan.

244
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,924
Even the sea routes gets jammed sometimes.

245
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,802
-Where's the factory? In America?
-Malaysia.

246
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,392
Can we talk for a moment?

247
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,446
-Why? What do you want?
-We have something to discuss.

248
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,822
Don't mind us and carry on.

249
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,493
This is my area.
You should knock before you enter.

250
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,704
Are you two really friends?

251
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,372
We'll leave soon.

252
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,085
Do you have to do this, Mr. Kang?

253
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,172
-Pardon? But--
-I know.

254
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,632
We all worked very hard on this,

255
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,218
and we don't have
an alternative right now.

256
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,097
However, this is already a finished game.

257
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:42,478
It was your first time bidding,
and bidding is all about money.

258
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,481
The starting line
is basically different for us and them.

259
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,234
We're already seven to eight percent
behind Pyo Merchant Marine

260
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,278
in logistical costs.

261
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,447
Forget about the three percent.

262
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,950
This kind of gap is difficult to make up
even if we sell it without profit.

263
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,663
Are you saying we should give up?

264
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,292
That's your decision to make as the CEO.

265
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,796
Let's say we got lucky

266
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:12,466
and somehow landed the deal
without any profit margin.

267
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,053
Then what? We have to sign the contract
and pay the security deposit.

268
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,222
What will you use to pay that amount?

269
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,808
You know where that money is from.

270
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:25,104
I do. It's what we got
after moving out of our previous office.

271
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,650
Think wisely with both your heart and head
to make a sound decision.

272
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,568
It must be a burden.

273
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,907
But I guess that's the weight
you must carry as the CEO.

274
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,744
The weight of five people
who depend on you to make our living.

275
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,465
Hey, Tae-poong. I'm against that.

276
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,885
You won't give up until the end, will you?

277
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,222
That's the attitude that suits you.

278
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,401
SHIPMENT, DEPARTURE, ARRIVAL,
DELIVERY, STORAGE, BID PRICE

279
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,361
Is there really no way around this?

280
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,157
We're at different starting lines.

281
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,659
The starting lines.

282
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,873
-Hey.
-The starting…

283
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,249
You're still here?

284
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,251
Yes, I had to think about something.

285
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,129
Thinking is a wonderful thing.

286
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,926
Have I run out already?
I thought I had enough.

287
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,097
I always had this at wholesale price,

288
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,474
so it feels too expensive
to buy it out there.

289
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,522
-Is there a huge difference?
-Quite a bit, actually.

290
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,737
What about chicken?
Does that come at a wholesale price?

291
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,531
Yes, there's a business
that delivers only raw chicken.

292
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,116
That's where we get it.

293
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,745
You know, we still used
high-quality chickens here.

294
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,121
By any chance…

295
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:10,375
By any chance, do you know a way to get it
even cheaper than the wholesale price?

296
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,128
Would I sit around like a bum if I knew?

297
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,633
How would you do that?
Go to the farm and slaughter chickens?

298
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,053
The farm?

299
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,971
TYPHOON TRADING
PYO MERCHANT MARINE

300
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:28,018
If we have different starting lines,
why don't we pull up one more step?

301
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,437
Here's what I mean.

302
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,982
Instead of the headquarters in America,

303
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,026
let's go straight
to the factory in Malaysia.

304
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,904
FACTORY - COST

305
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,575
Then, we'll get it at a cheaper price.

306
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,703
Would Blaze Eagles let this slide?

307
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:50,165
It's all right.
That's not the only client they work with.

308
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,503
That's a relief. We might have a chance.

309
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,715
Should I find out
the factory's phone number?

310
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,635
No, it'd be better
to go in person instead of calling.

311
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:06,014
The bidding is in two days,
and you should be there, Mr. Kang.

312
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,893
Of course, someone else
will have to go to Malaysia.

313
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,580
<i>Please?</i>

314
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,583
You want to swap shifts with me?
Are you going somewhere?

315
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,045
-I have to go to my brother's school.
-That little boy?

316
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,840
I already have plans.

317
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,467
-Please? Just this once.
-Jeez.

318
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:44,594
All right.

319
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,555
It's my turn next, okay?

320
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,267
Really? Thank you so much.
I'll treat you twice next time.

321
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,351
Go, now.

322
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,812
Thank you. I'm leaving!

323
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,238
Does she not have family?

324
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,657
She lives with her grandma,
but she has dementia.

325
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,451
Dementia?

326
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,202
Once her older sister gets married,

327
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,788
her grandma and younger brother
will be her responsibility.

328
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,083
That poor girl.

329
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,755
-Have a great day.
-All right. Thanks, bye.

330
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,033
Goodness.

331
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,997
Oh, my. Does this even cover anything?

332
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,666
It looks more like a mask.

333
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:00,462
Jeez.

334
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,193
-Nam-mo.
-Yes?

335
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,486
What do you think?

336
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,571
Let's see.

337
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,074
This doesn't look like your style, Mi-ho.

338
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,202
How do I put this? It's for older…

339
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:36,081
-No, it's a mature style.
-Really?

340
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,376
Will I look like his mom?

341
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,631
Excuse me. Coming through.

342
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:48,176
Nam…

343
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,517
My back hurts.

344
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,643
-Nam-mo.
-Yes?

345
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,688
-Is that all she has to wear?
-Mi-ho.

346
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,148
I love it when you do that.

347
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,608
-But I'm gross and sweaty now.
-No, not at all.

348
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:05,026
She's wiping sweat with her hand?

349
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,320
-You're so wet!
-Doesn't she have a handkerchief?

350
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,365
Great, I'm all recharged now. One moment.

351
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,286
My gosh.

352
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,958
Now, where am I headed next?

353
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,794
The next stop? Let me help you.

354
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,381
All right.

355
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,471
Wow! Made in America.

356
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,604
Awesome.

357
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,442
I even love the popping sound.

358
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,992
-American juice surely is good.
-It is good. Yes.

359
00:24:54,951 --> 00:25:00,290
Mr. Pyo still believes all these
are on their way to the PPS.

360
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,501
We need to make space for the gloves.

361
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,295
-Just pull them out.
-Yes, sir.

362
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,632
And we can always sell these somewhere.

363
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,260
My friend is the son
of Center Department Store's CEO.

364
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,179
-Reach out to them.
-Yes, sir.

365
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,015
Okay, we're all done here.

366
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,312
Did you run the numbers on our bid?

367
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,981
Yes, I ran the numbers
with our bidding price

368
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,984
at a profit margin of 12%.

369
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,527
-At 12%?
-Yes, sir.

370
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,823
Jeez.

371
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,283
That sounds too high.

372
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,620
-Did you want to make money with this?
-No, sir.

373
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:44,042
Mr. Pyo, we already have the upper hand
because of the logistics costs,

374
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,211
and we need this profit
to run the business--

375
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,089
Stop racking your brains
and drop the price.

376
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,636
Let's play it safe.

377
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,063
It is good.

378
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,607
-Mr. Ha!
-Yes, sir! I just gave it a taste.

380
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,142
I'll get it.

381
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,768
Hello, you've reached Typhoon Trading.

382
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,562
<i>-It's me.</i>
-It's Mr. Bae!

383
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,189
Hey, put him on speaker.

384
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,358
<i>Hello? Can you hear me?</i>

385
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,320
Yes, we can. Did you arrive?

386
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,404
What?

387
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,824
No, I haven't eaten anything yet.

388
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,910
Did you hurt your ears?
Did you get into an accident?

389
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,787
That's not what's important.

390
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,331
I came, and there's huge trouble.

391
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,166
The factories have changed.

392
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,419
What? The factories have changed?

393
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,172
Yes, the head office
called off the contract,

394
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,466
so this factory now makes pillows.

395
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,759
<i>It's three for 10,000 won.</i>

396
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:19,471
-Pillows? Like for sleeping?
-What about the gloves?

397
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,389
They don't make the gloves here.

398
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,141
It's now made on another island,

399
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:27,228
but this country
has well over 800 islands.

400
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,772
But tomorrow's the bidding.

401
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,648
It's on another island?

402
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,944
When was the contract canceled
at that factory?

403
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,365
<i>I heard it was quite recent,</i>
<i>but I don't have a way of finding out…</i>

404
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,741
-Hello?
<i>-Hello?</i>

405
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,993
Can you hear me? Hello?

406
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,912
-Hello?
-Mr. Bae!

407
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,038
-Mr. Bae!
-Mr. Bae!

408
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,499
-Mr. Bae!
-It was cut off.

409
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,793
-It got cut off.
-You can't get him back now.

410
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,963
It took so many tries to get through!

-Whose mom is that? She's really pretty.
-What are you talking about?

414
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,990
{\an8}PLEASE STOP AT THE LINE

415
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,493
She's my sister.

416
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,204
She's my sister
who's much better than any mom.

{\an8}Has Mr. Bae reached out?

422
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:15,003
He called, but the call
keeps getting disconnected.

423
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,006
There was something I asked him to do,
but it's not easy to reach him.

424
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,924
What can we do now?

425
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,844
We have to go.
Otherwise, we'll lose the bid bond.

426
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:28,433
Yes, we'll go and bid at a very high price
or do our best and lose heroically.

427
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,644
Let's go there for now and wait.

428
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,773
I know he'll do
whatever it takes to reach out to us.

00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,476
-Looking great.
-Good.

435
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:16,481
You're good. You're loosening up.

436
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,691
Excellent. Great posture.

437
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,568
-You're all good.
-You're good.

438

Don't let anyone guess

00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,658
-Okay.
-Good.

441
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,620
-Where there's a will, there's a way.
-What now?

442
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,163
Where there's a will, there's a way.

443
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,998
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

-All right?
-Impressive. You have grown.

Mr. Kang.

447
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,965
-Yes!
-Yes!

448
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,260
Mr. Kang, take a look at this.
If you get confused, choose one from here.

449
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,137
I ran the numbers
from 5% profit margin to 15%.

450
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,057
Hey, Ms. Oh, this is even more confusing.

451
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,476
Mr. Kang, let me share my secret with you.

00:30:56,187 --> 00:31:00,358

454
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,532
Thirteen.

455
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,208
Okay, this is it.

456
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,251
Go with this number.

457
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,212
-You want me to take the fifth option, 9%?
-Yes.

458
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,798
-Bid that number.
-Are you serious?

459
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,300
Mr. Koo.

460
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,886
If you keep this up,
you'll end up in hell.

00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,178
That paper has been blessed.

462
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:36,019
What a bunch of bums.
You all are such a joke.

463
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,857
Are you trying to be
the terrifying underdogs?

464
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,569
You look way too serious.

465
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,529
Hey, Freckles.

466
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:48,907
You're the female lead.

467
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,912
-Don't look that way.
-What's going on here?

468
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,788
This isn't a flea market.

469
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,333
Is the entire staff
of Typhoon Trading here?

470
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,417
Good grief!

471
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,836
I want to see only two here,
just like them.

472
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,296
The rest can wait outside.

473
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,756
He hasn't called, right?

474
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,674
Buy some time.

475
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,301
Stall for time.

476
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,720
Excuse me. I have a question.

477
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,223
Do you have a policy of keeping only two?
I haven't seen it. Why two?

478
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,767
Could you tell me the reason?

479
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,310
-I don't see it.
-It's not in here.

480
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,478
Why should only two remain?

481
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,687
-There's no rule.
-Right?

482
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,022
Get out of here. Now!

483
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,524
You have to tell me why.
I can't leave without a reason.

484
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,818
My goodness. She's so stubborn.
This is killing me.

485
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,654
She just told you to leave!

486
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,030
We need more time.

487
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,909
-Where is that rule? Two people?
-I don't see it.

488
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:34,827
-I don't see it.
-I have to pray now.

489
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,288
What? You have to pray!

490
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,874
I'm sorry to ask,
but I must be here alone.

491
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,793
-May I have some privacy?
-Hey, look.

492
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,378
-He has to pray to live.
-He does.

493
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,380
Hey, you can't do this!

494
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,423
-This guy?
-Get them out of here.

495
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,383
He's a Buddhist.

496
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,176
-One second.
-He has to pray right now.

497
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,135
He has to pray now.

498
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,053
Mister!

499
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,139
Get him out of here!

500
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,184
<i>-When we're upset</i>
<i>-When we're upset</i>

501
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,102
What's he doing?

502
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,436
-He's not done.
-No.

503
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,439
-You can't do this here!
-Stop bothering him!

504
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,941
You have to get up.

505
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,025
Get out.

506
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,903
-We have to start bidding.
-Bless you!

507
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,613
Follow your heart.

508
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,824
-You have to leave now!
-Why do we have to go?

509
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,743
-What is wrong with you?
-My gosh!

510
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,497
We'll begin now!

511
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,134
We will begin the bidding.

512
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,637
The bidding ends at 11:15 a.m.

BIDDER: PYO MERCHANT MARINE
AMOUNT: 433,444,043 WON

514
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:47,942
Yes, sir.

515
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,322
Hey, what are you doing?

516
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,241
Are you scared?

517
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,953
Let me give you a hint.

518
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,164
Try begging and say, "Please."

519
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,373
Please.

520
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,505
Hey, you need to start thinking
with some common sense.

521
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:13,384
You don't do business
by pulling petty tricks.

522
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,012
You do it with money.

523
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,767
But you have no money,
no warehouse, and no ship,

524
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,895
which makes you a loser
from the beginning.

525
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,107
-Let's go, Mr. Pyo.
-Okay.

526
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,942
All right.

527
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,987
You've lost.

528
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,162
Here.

529
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,128
And here.

530
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,548
Lastly, here.

531
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,219
Why is this so complicated?

532
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,347
Mr. Kang.

533
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,891
You need to start writing now. Do it.

534
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,185
We still have some time.

535
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,187
Just a little more.

536
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,566
-I'm sure he'll reach out.
-Okay.

537
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:53,961
Officer.

538
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,093
-A telegram came.
-A telegram?

539
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,470
-For me?
-No.

540
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,014
-Mr. Kang Tae-poong?
-Yes!

541
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:10,728
How important was that telegram
that it had to be sent here?

542
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,313
-A family event?
-Please leave.

543
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,814
Wait.

544
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,734
This is unfair.
There are only three minutes left.

545
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,985
Wait, it's…

546
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,321
It's very urgent.

547
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,075
-It's my father--
-He died, you punk.

548
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,410
His deeply beloved wife, my mother.

549
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,997
Goodness gracious. How important is this?

550
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,333
I'm getting curious. Read it.

551
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,377
Cut the crap. Open it now.

552
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,796
-Open it now!
-Right? I'll do that.

553
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,090
I wanted to open it. I'll do it.

554
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,134
TO KANG TAE-POONG,
SEOUL PUBLIC PROCUREMENT OFFICE

555
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,640
"Five, one, one, one, stop.
Four, zero, stop. Okay, stop."

556
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,766
What is this?

557
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,067
-Is this…
-It sounds like a code.

558
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,652
-Right?
-Is he a spy?

559
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,196
I know.

560
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,949
"Work five days a week,
every hour and minute for 40 years, okay?"

561
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,537
I don't think that's it.

562
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,875
It's about time you wrapped up everything.

563
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,504
We have a while…
Oh, no! We have a minute left.

564
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,089
You have a minute to make your bid.

565
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,924
Please hurry.

566
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,519
BIDDING APPLICATION

567
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,360
-I'm on my way.
-It must be sealed!

568
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,446
-Right.
-You have to seal it tightly first.

569
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,363
Sealing.

570
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,490
-Stay calm.
-Tightly.

571
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,117
Sealing tightly.

572
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,328
-Stay calm.
-Sealing.

573
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,664
-And I need your seal.
-Yes, of course.

574
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,083
-The seal. The inkpad.
-The inkpad.

575
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,301
Why the heck is she so strong?

576
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,180
Two.

577
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,350
-All right.
-Three.

578
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,442
We did it!

579
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,284
-Good work.
-Sure.

580
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,119
Great job.

581
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,900
The old geezers are here.

582
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:08,072
We'll sit here.

583
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,662
Now, the bidding has ended.

584
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,831
Let me announce the winning vendor.

585
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:23,796
The vendor that made the winning bid
for three million surgical gloves is…

586
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,285
The winner is

587
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,328
Typhoon Trading.

588
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,917
-All right!
-Yes!

589
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,462
-My gosh!
-Yes!

590
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,465
-We did it!
-Yes!

591
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:09,842
Cut the crap!

592
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,471
-That doesn't make any sense!
-See it for yourself then.

593
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,183
<i>-We won</i>
<i>-We won</i>

594
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,226
-See it for yourself.
-We got it!

595
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,021
-Hey, get that from him later.
-Yes, ma'am.

596
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:26,025
{\an8}PYO MERCHANT MARINE: 433,444,043 WON
TYPHOON TRADING: 428,580,315 WON

597
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,485
{\an8}This can't be.

598
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,323
Let me take that if you're done.

599
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,827
They couldn't have bid that price.

600
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,914
This is bad.

601
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,172
We won, so let's get out of here.
Let's go back to the office. Hold hands.

602
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,966
Let's leave quickly
before they raise an objection.

603
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,718
Let's go. I'll order <i>tangsuyuk.</i>

604
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,886
-Really?
-Yes.

605
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:56,222
Great work.

606
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,141
It's all thanks to Mr. Bae.

607
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:04,813
<i>-So when was the contract canceled?</i>
-They said it's been about ten days.

608
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,023
-Ten days?
-Ten days?

609
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,984
That means they couldn't have removed
the gloves in stock.

610
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,153
Mr. Bae, do they have them in stock?

611
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,030
What? The stock?

612
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,990
They don't just have a little in stock.

613
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:17,701
There are over 5,000 boxes,
5,111 to be exact.

614
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,038
-Then let's take everything.
-Let's do that.

615
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:24,750
The problem is the price.
I don't know how much to offer.

616
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,045
-Well, you can go with--
-We have to lowball them.

617
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,421
Go for like 60%, maybe 70%.

618
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,131
-We shouldn't do that.
-How about 59%?

619
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,551
No, I think we should
take our time to negotiate.

620
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,510
<i>Hello?</i>

621
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:35,928
-Hello?
-Hello?

622
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,346
<i>-Mr. Kang?</i>
-Hello?

623
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,014
-Mr. Bae.
-Hello?

624
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,267
-Hello?
-Mr. Bae?

625
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,270
-Bae Song-jung?
-Where did he go? Hello?

626
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,272
Jeez.

627
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,600
That's going to get me in trouble.

628
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,248
TELEGRAM

629
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,127
"Five, one, one, one, stop.
Four, zero, stop. Okay, stop."

630
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,045
What is this?

631
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,921
<i>They don't just have a little in stock.</i>

632
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,299
<i>There are over 5,000 boxes,</i>
<i>5,111 to be exact.</i>

633
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,223
We got it!

634
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,783
{\an8}STANDARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT
CONTRACTOR: TYPHOON TRADING

635
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,995
Are you that happy?

636
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,623
We can make a living now.

637
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,710
People might think
you've been starving all along.

638
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,801
Don't smile like that.

639
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,511
You're too pretty.

640
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,556
No, it's after hours,
so you can be pretty.

641
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,227
You know…

642
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,940
It's hard to separate work from feelings.

643
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:54,900
Jeez.

644
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,530
So, is Mr. Bae coming back tomorrow?

645
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,199
Yes.

646
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,788
Where did you get the idea
that the factory would have stocks left?

647
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,917
From three aspects of sales,
clients, revenue, and…

648
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,377
-Inventory.
-Precisely.

649
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,629
You know that well.

650
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:20,884
But you know, lowballing them was a bit…

651
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,263
-Was that awful?
-No, it was way too cool!

652
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,432
I knew it.

653
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,351
That's why
you're Typhoon Trading's trader.

654
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,812
Thank you.

655
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,355
-Sure.
-Thank you.

656
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,496
What's the most precious to you, Ms. Oh?

657
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,501
I don't know. I've never thought about it.

658
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,088
Well…

659
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:03,844
Rice and briquettes
are both very precious.

660
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,972
But you know,

661
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,726
to me, it's tomorrow.

662
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,395
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

663
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:18,484
In the past, I could endure today
only by thinking that there's tomorrow.

664
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,570
But it's a bit different now.

665
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,908
When tomorrow comes,

666
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,412
I will have learned some more
and reflected a bit more,

667
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,167
so I could become
slightly better than I am today.

668
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,965
What about you?
What's the most precious to you?

669
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,427
Me?

670
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:50,974
To me…

671
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,823
The most precious thing is…

672
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,123
I can't tell you yet.

673
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,625
I'll tell you later.

674
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,856
Darn it.

675
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,608
This again. Jeez.

676
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,403
It's such a mess.

677
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,662
Thank you.

678
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,042
My dear Nam-mo must be looking for you.

679
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,253
Yes.

680
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,969
-Sorry?
-I am Nam-mo's mother.

681
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,056
And you better throw that away.

682
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,812
I was going to throw it away.

683
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:24,693
Hey, can we chat for a moment?

684
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,117
Well, may I buy you food somewhere?

685
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,457
When you address your elder,
use proper words like "treat" and "meal."

686
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,666
Okay.

687
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:45,589
And it's not going to be a long chat,
so let me make it quick right here.

688
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,259
I don't want you to date Nam-mo.

689
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:55,557
-Sorry?
-It must feel too sudden, right?

690
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,854
But I thought I should make
something like this loud and clear.

691
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,735
Nam-mo is a kid who always does as I say,

692
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,279
so I'll convince him the best I can.

693
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,614
So,

694
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:16,912
stop seeing each other
before it gets more serious, okay?

695
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:18,622
Let's do that.

696
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,459
Why?

697
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,087
What do you mean?

698
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,089
Why do you hate me?

699
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,925
No, it's not that I hate you.

700
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:33,804
It's different from hating you.
It's not hatred, but…

701
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,306
Gosh.

702
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,060
You are…

703
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,778
You're extremely poor, aren't you?

704
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,616
And your parents aren't with you.

705
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:59,037
Your grandmother has dementia,
and your brother is still very young.

706
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,332
I have an older sister too.

707
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,877
Right. I see.

708
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,339
But you know, once she gets married,

709
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,300
she's as good as a stranger.

710
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:18,098
When that happens, your remaining family
will become my son's responsibility.

711
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:21,059
He doesn't have the ability
to handle that kind of life.

712
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,354
When that happens,
I'll end up with the burden,

713
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,897
but I can't handle that either.

714
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,942
You know it, don't you?

715
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,486
Poverty…

716
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,532
is like a joint guarantee
without a contract.

717
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,952
That's why I'm scared of it.

718
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,249
I don't plan to give him my burden.

719
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,002
That…

720
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,840
is easier said than done.

721
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,223
Miss.

722
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,604
When I was younger than Nam-mo's age now,

723
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,524
I became a widow.

724
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,030
People around me pitied me

725
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:18,450
and treated me nicely
when they were with me.

726
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,078
But they were saying behind my back
I had bad luck.

727
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,247
It felt so unfair.

728
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,877
But what can I do?

729
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,296
That's how the world works.

730
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,674
Ms. Oh Mi-ho.

731
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:38,970
Since you and I are the unfortunate ones,

732
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,765
let's avoid each other.

733
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,683
Please.

734
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,393
Okay?

735
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,521
Mom.

736
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,235
How did you… Why are you here?

737
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,198
Hey, why are you crying?

738
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,703
-What did you say to her?
-I didn't say anything.

739
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,913
What did you just say?

740
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:07,791
I told her to stop seeing you.

741
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,419
You too, get a grip!

742
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,257
Your friend is a CEO
who wears a tie to work.

743
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,051
Will you continue to haul
those bags of clothes every night?

744
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,761
Is that Mi-ho's fault? Is it?

745
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,681
Why are you blaming someone else
for my incompetence?

746
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,268
Why are you blaming her
for our wrong life choices?

747
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,271
-What?
-It's true!

748
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:33,275
I had an impossible dream,
and you believed that total fraud's words.

749
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:38,488
Mom, we ended up like this
not because of the world or other people.

750
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,200
It's because we lived like fools!
Aren't I right?

751
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,578
You…

752
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,123
And you.
Are you going to break up with me?

753
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,084
No, let me make this clear first.

754
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:55,297
I don't care what my mom said.
I'm not leaving you, okay?

755
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,924
-Enough is enough, Wang Nam-mo!
-What's enough?

756
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,261
I don't plan to break up with Mi-ho,
so apologize to her right now!

757
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,430
You've lost your mind!

758
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,349
I am…

759
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,193
not sure anymore.

760
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:19,905
Mi-ho.

761
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,824
You're dating me, not my mom.

762
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,411
Let's go.

763
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,709
Wang Nam-mo!

764
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:37,130
If you take one more step,

765
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,634
I will never see you again.

766
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:43,428
Mom.

767
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,306
I'm paying rent for the store
thanks to Tae-poong,

768
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,934
and Tae-poong
is living off Mi-ho's family.

769
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,019
Mi-ho is the best off among us!

770
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:53,480
If anyone wants to break us up,
it should be her family!

771
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,582
Let go of me.

772
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,834
Let go.

773
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:17,629
What do you want?

774
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,423
Why are you mad?

775
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,843
You need to go.

776
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,180
I haven't decided
if I'll break up with you or not.

777
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,810
So, I don't want to see you. Get lost!

778
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,019
Hey, Mi-ho.

779
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,063
Why do you act tough when you're with me?

780
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,608
You should've said everything
you wanted earlier, just like now.

781
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:41,236
Why did you look like
you did something wrong?

782
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,198
Don't just stand there like a fool
when someone messes with you!

783
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,409
She's your mother!

784
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,498
Yes, I am extremely poor.

785
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,168
But I've never begged anyone for help.

786
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,964
I've never coveted what wasn't mine.
My grandma…

787
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,009
My grandma

788
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,345
raised me like that.

789
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,725
So, why would my sister be a stranger?
Why is my family a burden?

790
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,185
What's so great about your family?

791
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,522
I speak better English than you,

792
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:20,150
and I worked at the department store
longer than your mom.

793
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,610
So, how dare she talk and look down on me?

794
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:27,032
-What a weird woman.
-My mom said those things because--

795
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:33,163
I feel like a fool for not saying a word
just because she's your mom,

796
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,791
so you need to get lost, please.

797
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,092
One more thing.

798
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,428
My life isn't unfortunate.

799
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,682
I may not have parents,
but I have three in my family.

800
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,061
I may not have parents,

801
00:55:57,062 --> 00:56:01,483
but I have my grandma,
Beom, and my sister,

802
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,611
whom I love very much.

803
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,201
I'm sorry, Mi-ho.

804
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,498
I'm so sorry
you had to hear that from her.

805
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:26,216
BELLUA DEPARTMENT STORE

806
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,565
Jeez! Enough!

807
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,609
You idiot.

808
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:30,572
I thought you had stopped causing trouble,
but you ended up with this mess?

809
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,782
I'm also as pissed off as you are.

810
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,244
-I'm much more irritated than you are!
-Irritated?

811
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:40,540
Your irritation doesn't matter.
Do you know how much the juice was?

812
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,625
It was $150,000!

813
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,086
How are you going to make up
over 200 million won of loss?

814
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,129
Dad.

815
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,716
-I have a plan too.
-What plan?

816
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,511
You couldn't possibly have a plan!

817
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,347
If the department store returns it,
that'll be the end!

818
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,643
You're…

819
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,780
I told Mr. Ha to remove your office.

820
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,034
-Get ready to go to America.
-America?

821
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,248
-And return the juice?
-Go there and study.

822
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,751
You're nothing right now.

823
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,170
You have such a long way to go.

824
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,088
-You can't do anything!
-Dad!

825
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,007
It's not over yet.

826
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,886
I may have taken a few jabs,
but one uppercut will end that punk.

827
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,262
Business isn't like boxing.

828
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,182
It doesn't matter
if you get beaten up and fall down.

829
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:43,228
-Whoever lasts longer in the ring wins!
-I don't care who lasts longer!

830
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,899
I'll land a big blow on him

831
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,194
and buy out the entire game.

832
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,334
What is it?

833
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,837
Why did you suddenly want to see me?
There's no business between us.

834
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:10,922
Hey, lady.

835
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,884
Darn it.

836
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:21,140
Who do you think would feel
more humiliated if we were seen together?

837
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,725
That's not what I mean.

838
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,230
This situation is ridiculous.
Why should I meet you?

839
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,232
You're a spy, right?

840
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:34,612
What are you talking about?

841
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,534
I can't believe
you stabbed Tae-poong in the back.

842
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,452
Stabbed him in the back?

843
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,080
-I haven't done anything like that yet.
-"Yet"?

844
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,042
That means you're planning to.

845
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,507
I saw something at my dad's desk.

846
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,428
It had your home address,
the names of your family,

847
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,513
and everything else written up there.

848
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,601
I wonder what he's going to do.
It's a shame.

849
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,356
I don't care
what that piece of paper says.

850
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,025
What do you want from me?

851
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,862
I'm sick and tired
of that promissory note!

852
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,406
Promissory note?

853
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,332
I see.

854
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,586
So, that was it?

855
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,258
Oh, no.

856
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:50,104
SAMGOK WAREHOUSE

857
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,314
Excuse me.

858
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,442
The gloves came earlier than expected.

859
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,778
I could've done the due diligence alone.

860
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:59,447
It'd be better if we do it together
and have it done faster.

861
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:01,658
I also get to see you.

862
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:05,411
There's the truck.

863
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,748
-Hello.
-Hello.

864
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,877
-This is the last one.
-Thank you.

865
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,588
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

866
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,090
-Let's go eat.
-Thank you.

867
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,967
Thanks for your hard work.
Enjoy your lunch!

868
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,432
Gosh.

869
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,101
-Everything is here now.
-Yes.

870
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:31,771
It'll take a while
to check all the quantities.

871
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,981
Then you must be hungry.

872
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:37,694
-I'll get us something to eat.
-I didn't see anything nearby.

873
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,029
No, there are a lot of food joints
just down the corner.

874
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,698
I'll get some in a flash.

875
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,408
-Okay, see you.
-Okay.

876
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:10,143
SURGICAL GLOVES INVENTORY

877
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,278
-My goodness.
-What happened?

878
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,904
Are you badly hurt?

879
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,031
I'm fine.

880
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,450
Really?

881
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,410
Something's making me uneasy.

882
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,329
But he said he wasn't traveling far today.

883
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:35,376
It's true.
The students were all drafted as soldiers.

884
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,714
I was worried sick
as I waited for my husband.

885
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,050
I can't imagine
what it's like to wait for your son.

886
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:48,139
My children are still young,
so I don't know what that's like.

887
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,892
You're right.

888
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,855
I don't feel at ease staying home
while pushing my son out to work.

889
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:57,815
Oh, dear.

890
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:04,989
All right.

891
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:08,826
Come here.

892
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,871
Let me see that.

893
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,999
Let me put this on like this.

894
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,795
Oh, dear.

895
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:20,880
All good.

896
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,216
You're done.

897
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,932
It must be hard to live in poverty

898
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:35,686
after living many years
of such a good life, isn't it?

899
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:42,318
But you never show it
to anybody under this roof.

900
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:45,279
I can tell that you're very kind.

901
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:49,492
Everything's going to work out, okay?

902
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,412
Ma'am…

903
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:57,291
All done.

904
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:08,845
What is that smell?

905
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,275
What?

906
01:04:36,455 --> 01:04:37,290
No, wait.

907
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,791
Oh, my gosh!

908
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,752
No, this can't happen!

909
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,421
What do I do? But how?

910
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,755
How did a fire break out?

911
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:46,007
Wait. Let's see.

912
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,635
No, please.

913
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,138
Please stop.

914
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:53,556
No, this can't happen.

915
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,099
No, please.

916
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:56,475
No.

917
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,896
No!

918
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,077
NATIONWIDE

919
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,038
BIRTH OF THE G2 DIGITAL PCS!

920
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,248
Would Ms. Oh like that?

921
01:05:44,523 --> 01:05:45,858
What do I do?

922
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,360
It's hot!

923
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,111
What do I do?

924
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,582
Please help!

925
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,045
This can't be happening.

926
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:10,591
No…

927
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,053
What do I do?

928
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:37,618
Jeez!

929
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,537
Ms. Oh!

930
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:41,122
Ms. Oh!

931
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,374
Darn it.

932
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,959
Oh Mi-seon!

933
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,961
Hold on. Hang in there.

934
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,064
Please…

935
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,401
Ms. Oh!

936
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,867
Ms. Oh!

937
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,460
<i>Back then, Nam-mo also asked…</i>

938
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,545
Ms. Oh!

939
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,547
<i>…what was most precious to me.</i>

940
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,340
Oh Mi-seon!

941
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,641
<i>If someone asked me the same question,</i>

942
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:46,520
<i>about what was most precious to me…</i>

943
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,105
Mi-seon.

944
01:07:52,777 --> 01:07:53,944
<i>…I would say</i>

945
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:55,654
<i>it's you.</i>

946
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:01,952
Hang in there.

947
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:03,621
Hold on.

948
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:10,961
Oh Mi-seon!

949
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:27,937
MY REASON FOR LIVING

950
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,972
TYPHOON FAMILY

951
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:06,142
{\an8}<i>And yet, the warehouse burst into flames.</i>

952
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:07,226
{\an8}<i>Are we sure it wasn't arson?</i>

953
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:11,355
{\an8}<i>From now on, I will never leave you alone.</i>

954
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:14,483
{\an8}You've had an accident
with only a week left until the deadline?

955
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:15,484
{\an8}<i>Tell me you're joking!</i>

956
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,653
{\an8}<i>Did you go through the documents here?</i>

957
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,239
{\an8}<i>I swear I had these arranged neatly.</i>

958
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,532
{\an8}I've got it.

959
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,451
{\an8}<i>I found out why Blaze Eagles</i>
<i>has a supply shortage.</i>

960
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,703
{\an8}Hyun-jun!

961
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,496
<i>Even if I die,</i>

962
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:29,456
<i>Typhoon Trading won't go down.</i>
