-Excuse me...
-Excuse me...

3
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,510
You want to talk about it later?

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,520
Sure.

5
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,570
Let's talk somewhere else.

6
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,110
I'm... Sorry about earlier.

7
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,310
It's all my fault for getting inexplicably worked up.

8
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,470
Are you okay?

9
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,340
There's no misunderstanding here, right?

10
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,760
Misunderstanding?

11
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,270
What misunderstanding?

12
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,759
Did you misunderstand anything?

13
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,890
No.

14
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,020
So if there wasn't any misunderstanding...

15
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,110
I didn't get carried away at the moment.

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,630
Then what is it?

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,780
To be precise, we...

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,870
We've waited for each other for seven years.

19
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,329
Because I...

20
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,030
I think I've fallen in love with you since that moment.

21
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,110
You don't have to answer me right away.

22
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,650
I've been in unrequited love with you for seven years.

23
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,560
If you keep me waiting a bit longer...

24

It's okay.

Anyway,

27

I don't hate you.

28
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,060
If you don't hate me, it means you like me.

29
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,190
That's not what I meant.

30

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,740
It's a photo of me.

34
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,500
Is it yours?

35
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,700
No.

36
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,750
Then why are you hiding it?

37
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,620
Give it to me.

38
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,510
Since it's not yours.

39
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,420
What do you want to do with it?

40
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,660
Throw it away.

41
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,120

42
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,420
Are you crazy? No way!

43

Wow.

It turns out my Ji-woo

45
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,130
is actually a fan of mine.

46
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,690
No wonder.

47
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,840

48
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,460

This actor thing...

162
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,720
I quit.

163
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,620
What did you say?

164
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,730
Hey.

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,620
It's not like you at all. Why are you running in the middle of the night?

170
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,920
Are you...

171
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,320
Feeling burdened because I like you?

172

You told me before that
even if I find the fans' love overwhelming,

174
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,140
I must stand up and keep going.

175
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,120
Something must be bothering you.

Why?

181
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,970
It's because of that incident, isn't it?

182
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,410
Jeong Si-woo?

183
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:59,010
What is the truth about that?

184
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,320
Was it really you...

185
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,470
Who hit him first?

186
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,160
Yes.

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,820
There must be a reason for that.

188
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,940
You're not the kind of person who would hit someone for no reason.

189
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,510
When I was filming "Striker",

190
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,810
he criticized my acting, saying it was tacky.

191
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,710
And he said my character was really bad.

192
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,610
Senior.

193
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,230
That movie "Striker".

194
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,310
I don't know if it was his tacky acting or the character itself,

195
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,330
anyway, the leading role was really bad.

196
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,990
Even if we try to rationalize it,

197
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,640
his acting is third-rate, and his mental state is still that of a child.

198
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,620
People like him

199
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,320
would feel happy even if they spent their whole lives as losers.

200
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,840
What's so good about that kind of plot? To think you wasted your money on the tickets...

201
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,530
You bastard!

202
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,680
But you still shouldn't have... Hit him.

203
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,350
You don't want to act?

204
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,360
No.

205
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,100
I also don't want to act anymore in the future.

206
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,510
What?

207
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,220
In the future?

208
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,800
I also made myself clear when I saw Mr. Seo today

209
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,760
that I don't want to be an actor anymore.

210
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,500
At first, I thought acting was fun.

211
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,260
But now, I'm not sure if it suits me anymore.

212
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,430
Ouch! Ouch!

213
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,920
Gosh.

214
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,790
Hey, it hurts!

215
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,170
You...

216
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,340
You once asked me how I overcame my low points.

217
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,140
Actually, I haven't got through it yet.

218
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,550
But...

219
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,050
Because of you,

220
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,310
I can still hold on.

221
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,410
Do you know why?

222
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,510
It's because I'm your fan.

223
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,990
Even if the game didn't go well and I wanted to die one day,

224
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,830
just because I'm someone's fan,

225
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,880
I'd think there's still a small spot in the world that belongs to me.

226
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,960
You told me before that I needed to achieve victory.

227
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,310
Is quitting acting the real victory you want?

228
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,480
Be honest with me.

229
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,330
Do you want to get back into acting?

230
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,440
Even if it's for your fans, please start your acting career over.

231
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,960
No.

232
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,760
Even if it's for me,

233
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,960
please start it over.

234
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,770
Bad news!

Ji-woo... Ji-woo, he...

236
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,310
What happened? What's with the shouting?

237
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,030
What happened to Ji-woo?

238
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,380
Look at this.

"Do Ji-woo kept assaulting his juniors in the name of instructing them."]

240
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,250
Captain.

241
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,510
How could Ji-woo possibly have done such a thing?

242
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,900
No wonder

243
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,230
when Jeong Si-woo showed up, I noticed something was off.

244
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,150
His target isn't Yoo Kang-jae,

245
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,780
but Do Ji-woo.

246
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,080
Call Ji-woo right now.

247
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,150
Okay.

248
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,900
That bastard Yoo Kang-jae. Where did he bring this kind of scum from?

249
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,270
Where are you?

250
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,030
Did you see the news?

251
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,550
Just stay home and don't come out.

252
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,280
If the reporters find out, things will get out of hand.

253
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,890
What do you plan to do?

254
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,950
The news is not true. Just deny it.

255
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,800
Jeong Si-woo isn't someone to be trifled with.

256
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,440
He must have been fully prepared to refute us.

257
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,020
Besides...

258
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,410
This is my problem. I'll take care of it.

259
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,170
Do you trust me?

260
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,560
Yes.

261
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,280
Be careful.

[Jeong Si-woo]

263
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,319
Pulling the vanishing act, huh?

264
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,240
You'll be dead if I catch you. Darn it.

265
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,500
Gosh.

266
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,110
I should've taken care of you first.

267
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,130
You startled me.

268
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,470
What are you doing here so late?

269
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,840
You punk.

270
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,550
Tell me, what should Ji-woo do now?

271
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,310
Where did you bring back such a scum? You messed up the whole team.

272
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,530
You seduced the guy who only cared about soccer. Calling him your old classmate,

273
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,720
yet you're trying to make him give up his career as a soccer player?

274
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,430
When did I seduce him?

275
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,990
Darn it.

276
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660
Yes.

277
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,760
I did seduce him. Satisfied?

278
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,500
What do you mean satisfied?

279
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,110
You know Ji-woo and I are close, don't you?

280
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,810
To save our team in trouble, we...

281
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,220
I also came here to save this team.

282
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,450
I even gave up being an actor.

283
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,470
What did you give up?

284
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,780
They didn't even ask you to play Crony No. 3.

285
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,950
You barely made it into the team.

286
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,380
It wasn't Crony No. 3, but Crony No. 1, okay? Darn it.

287
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,110
Whether it was Crony No. 3 or Crony No. 1,

288
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,660
if you want to live, bring everything back to normal,

289
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,430
and bring Ji-woo back to the soccer field.

290
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,180
Ji-woo...

291
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,670
If he can't play soccer, he won't be able to live.

292
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,820
Mr. Seo, promise me one thing,

293
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,690
and I'll agree to be an actor.

294
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:20,960
[Remember to eat!!! Are you tired?
I'm okay! I miss you so much.]

[Me too.]

00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,170
Why are you here?

297
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,590
Brother.

298
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,070
I asked, what are you doing here?

299
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,400
Let's talk.

300
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,130
Then let's talk here.

301
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,260
Even if someone takes the photo of us being together

302
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,030
and makes a thing out of this, it won't have anything to do with me.

303
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,050
Sure. It won't be your business.

304
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,500
Are you feeling better now?

305
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,840
Yes, I feel good.

306
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,330
It seems you don't think you can beat me with soccer,

307
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,240
and you have no pride. You just do whatever Jeong Si-woo tells you to do.

308
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,950
I just borrowed his name, that's all.

309
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,760
Because I felt bitter about you and that tall guy.

310
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,290
I didn't expect things to get so out of hand, okay?

311
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,510
Anyway,

312
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:59,490
if that's why you're here, I have nothing to say.

313
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,240

You were also used by him.

315

316
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,350
from the past to now,
all our teammates were and will continue to be the talk of the town,

317
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,220
and it will come back to you.

318
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,580
Everyone will get hurt because of this.

319
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,910

324
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080

325
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,450
or "What are you doing?", things like that.
