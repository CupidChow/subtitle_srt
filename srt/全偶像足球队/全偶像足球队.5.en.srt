Forget it. I won't do it.

200
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,760
It's normal that you don't know how to do it. Why keep scolding me?

201
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,430
You told me to do it.

The way you just stuffed that gesture into the wardrobe

shows your character really isn't great.

What would you do if that gesture felt too heavy for you?

347
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,010
How is that heavy?

348
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,350
Even if it's gratitude,

349
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,760
even if it's a kind gesture, it still feels heavy to me.

350
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,700
It's heavy?

351
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,040
If it feels heavy,

352
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,180
does that mean it can just be tossed aside?

353
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,060
What?

354
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,690

You're too confident.

363
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,230
I was in a morning drama.

364
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,070
I have a lot of "auntie" fans.

365
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,130
Your sunglasses are more eye-catching.

366
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,120

Did I say I've overcome it?

371
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,440
No?

372
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,550
Well...

373
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,020
Much better than a few months ago.

374
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,430
So how did you get better?

375
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,430
Besides playing soccer. I tried to find something else I like.

376
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,480

377
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,360
Which one?

378
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,550
Well, just looking around.

[Tears when reading their stories. Striker.]

380
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,710
Even if I went back to that moment,

381
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,680
I would still pass the ball to you.

382

[Kyung-jae has arrived!
Hoo hoo, Kyung-jae has uploaded a photo wall!
Amazing! Actor Ryu Kyung-jae is really great, I really like Ryu Kyung-jae.
Is his appearance real?
My actor is just different.
Does Kyung-jae have any new photos? Please share the Kyung-jae boyfriend GIFs!!]

383
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,960
But there's nothing better than soccer.

384
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,390
What else can I do? I can only overcome it by playing soccer.

385
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,730
The lows faced on the field must be overcome on the field.

386
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,190
There's no other way.

387
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,070
Oh.

388
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,720
I thought this was out of production.

389
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,320
Do you like that drink?

390
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,040
Yes.

391
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,430
We don't sell this drink in our neighborhood.

392
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,590
It's amazing.

393
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,620
I once endorsed this brand.

394
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,650
Really?

395
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,550
No. I think someone else endorsed it.

396
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,880
The actor... Jung...

397
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,510
He took it from me after my accident.

398
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,130
Yes. That handsome guy was in a suit for the commercial.

399
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,370
Handsome?

400
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:36,440
I've worn a suit before.

401
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,870
Really?

402
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,610
Anyway, once you return, please say something to the advertiser.

403
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,470
Please don't stop production.

404
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,110
Do you believe I will definitely come back?

405
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,110
Yes, I do.

406
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,250
Isn't that your dream?

407
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,100
Hey.

408
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,350
Don't buy this drink anymore.

409
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,700
Oh, right.

410
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,230
-Put it in the car.
-What?

411
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,290
I forgot something.

412
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,030
Where are you going?

413
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,950
Hey, Do Ji-woo.

414
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,040
Do-hyung.

415
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,360
You look great.
