1
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,970
Do Ji-woo.

2
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,020
Senior.

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,250
I knew you'd come first.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,100
Did you do it on purpose?

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,800
I've always had this habit.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,620
Actually... It's not really a jinx.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,920
I know.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,350
There's talk of Do Ji-woo coming to work earlier than the ghosts in the locker room.

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,570
Stop making fun of me.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,470
I'm saying it's good, you fool.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,470
By the way, Senior,

12
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:41,050
did you make a deal with Mr. Kim too?

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:41,820
You mean...

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,520
The so-called "soldout"?

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,350
What about you?

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,250
I want to try my best.

17
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,250
What about you, Senior?

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,670
How could I leave you here and go off on my own?

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,650
Wow. As expected from our leading player.

20
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,270
How have you been?

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,350
Without me around, you must've been really happy, right?

22
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,620
No. I've said I'm not going.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,850
But you're the one who sent me to another actor.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,100
When I'm on a break, you won't make any money even if you stay by my side.

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,020
And I don't know how long this break will last.

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
What about soccer?

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,700
Have you really made up your mind?

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm at the soccer field now.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,170
So early?

30
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,620
I can't fall sleep again after I wake up these days anyway.

31
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,770
Wow. You used to nag me

32
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,020
about coming to pick you up too early.

33
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,400
Seems like you've changed a lot.

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,270
That's true.

35
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,920
So...

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,070
What have you been up to lately?

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,670
Why is he here?

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,100
-But he said he couldn't get up early in the morning.
-What?

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,400
Who?

40
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,750
No... Nothing.

41
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,850
Why are you looking at me like that?

42
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,950
You...

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,020
I...

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,050
You... I?

45
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,850
What are you trying to say?

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,250
What?

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,650
Darn it.

48
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,370
Friends.

49
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,650
If...

50
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,700
I mean if

51
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,120
you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work,

52
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,260
[Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?]

53
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
what will you do?

54
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,860
[Resign] [If Kyung-jae came, I'd love the company even more] [This isn't your real experience, right, "Crisp and Tender Lion"?] [Ryu Kyung-jae didn't show up at your club, did he?] [Gosh, I feel so happy just thinking about it...] [It's Monday morning, and there're many more people who are hurt] [That won't happen! Repeat "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" to yourself!] ["The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" LOL]

55
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:30,780
[Friends, if you meet your Mr./Ms. Right at work, what will you do...?]
[Resign] [Gosh, I feel so happy just thinking about it...] [If Kyung-jae came, I'd love the company even more] [It's Monday morning, and there're many more people who are hurt] [That won't happen!

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,700
As the saying goes, "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest."

57
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:42,220
[Since it's early Monday morning, I was just thinking out loud. Of course, "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest..."]

58
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,770
The biggest fans are always the unluckiest.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,670
Turn off the lights.

60
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,670
I will. Because I'm heading out.

61
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Shall we go for a run together?

62
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,570
Starting to run early in the morning

63
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,300
is something only crazy people do.

64
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,500
But why are you sleeping here?

65
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,050
Did I say I was sleeping?

66
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,700
Then why are you lying here instead of going back home?

67
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,350
Because I woke up.

68
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,500
So, all that stuff he said in the interview about having trouble getting out of bed in the morning was a lie?

69
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,300
The hell.

70
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,350
I didn't expect the disaster alarm to go off again

71
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,900
after a period of silence.

72
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,970
Where did they go?

73
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,100
They were right here.

74
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,870
What are you doing?

75
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,070
Nothing.

76
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,620
I'm such an idiot. Come on, think about it.

77
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,920
What happened?

78
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,120
Ji-woo?

79
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,100
My soccer shoes... They disappeared.

80
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,700
I thought you cherished those shoes.

81
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,400
You only wore them for important games, right?

82
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,350
Why? Because they're expensive?

83
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,700
No, that's Ji-woo's jinx.

84
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,120
Something bad will happen to the team

85
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,900
if he doesn't wear those shoes in important games.

86
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,570
Huh...

87
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,450
As a sportsman,

88
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,800
such trivial things are sometimes even more important than your life.

89
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,650
It's the little things that make the difference between winning and losing.

90
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,900
Why did they suddenly disappear?

91
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,620
Hey.

92
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,620
-Go look for them too.
-Yes.

93
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
This is bad.

94
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,600
I finally arrived first.

95
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,600
I don't even care about the jinx.

96
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
At this rate, I'll die from lack of sleep.

97
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,500
Could I really have lost them?

98
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,170
Hey, Jinx Elf.

99
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
You're here.

100
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,700
You startled me.

101
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,320
Why did you come out of there... Today?

102
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,820
Oh, right.

103
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,420
Those jinxed... Soccer shoes.

104
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,900
I looked for them too.

105
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,370
When did you start caring about others' affairs?

106
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,320
Forget it.

107
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,320
Here.

108
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,600
What... Is this?

109
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,900
I found them on my way here.

110
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,100
Soccer shoes?

111
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,350
To be honest,

112
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,470
I didn't know about that. I threw them away. I'm sorry.

113
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,800
The soccer shoes'... Jinx.

114
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,450
What?

115
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,620
I want to say something in my defense.

116
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,200
Actually, I didn't know what happened.

117
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,520
They were right in front of my locker.

118
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,470
I thought they were discarded, so I casually put them aside.

119
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,500
But later I found they were gone.

120
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,470
I looked for them all day yesterday.

121
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,870
Maybe the cleaner took them.

122
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm not quite sure.

123
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,000
How long would it take for soccer shoes to look like that?

124
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,420
Those shoes should be thrown away.

125
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,920
It was like those shoes were saying,

126
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,320
"Please throw us away," or

127
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,450
"Please kill us..."

128
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,800
That kind of thing.

129
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,700
This pair of shoes is several times more expensive than that one.

130
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,420
Why don't you take this opportunity to wear something nicer?

131
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,170
Why don't you use honorifics when talking to me?

132
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,550
What?

133
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,800
You've been like this since the beginning.

134
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,670
Why don't you use honorifics?

135
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,870
You threw it away?

136
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,020
You're a celebrity, so what?

137
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,220
Why else would I have done that?

138
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,370
So why is that?

139
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,850
We've only known each other for a short time. How dare you not use honorifics in front of me and even mess with me?

140
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,850
How dare you touch my stuff without my permission?

141
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,600
Do you think I'm someone who can be easily bullied?

142
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,950
"We've only known each other for a short time?"

143
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,100
Is that so?

144
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,300
It seems... You don't remember.

145
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,100
Right, I think you can be easily bullied. So what?

146
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,950
You jerk.

What happened between you two?

152
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,470
I already apologized to you.

153
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,300
I don't want your apology or your soccer shoes. So get lost!

154
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,850
Look how bad your character is.

155
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,870
I should have realized it when you were arranging the water bottles.

156
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,070
Stop!

157
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,670
That's not a jinx.

158
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,250
It's all in your head. That's the only way you can feel at ease.

159
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,900
What do you know? How dare you keep talking nonsense?

160
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,700
-The hell...
-Stop it!

161
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,900
Let go of me!

162
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,020
Well... Is this the content you talked about?

163
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,050
Are you trying to make a gangster movie?

164
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,220
Why are they fighting...

165
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,370
The most urgent issue at the moment is the teamwork between the players.

166
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,820
Yes, but it's like the so-called teamwork has been fed to dogs.

167
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,400

Winter training?

171
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,170
Go film it.

172
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,470
So... Can I livestream it?

173
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,150
Of course.

[Urgent!!!] [New gif posted] [New New New] [Gosh, is Kyung-jae finally done living in seclusion?!] [Who's the guy next to him?] [What's going on? Is that their team uniform???]

178
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:21,820
[They all look so handsome] [Gosh, it seems that's a soccer team] [Why are they so handsome? Is this a celebrity soccer team?] [Is that guy next to him an idol?? Who knows his name!!! This is urgent!!!]

179
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,940
[He's not an idol... He's a soccer player.]

180
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,770
Hello, Dong-hee's friends.

181
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,050
This is "The World in Dong-hee's Eyes: Dong-hee's World TV."

182
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,770
I've posted a trailer in the community before.

183
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,850
I'm going to record the behind-the-scenes video for our team.

184
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,970
Today is the day we set off for winter training.

185
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,520
Wow...

186
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,450
Player Kang Min-soo.

187
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,300
What?

188
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,170
I'm sorry. I thought you wanted to steal my...

189
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,400
Darn it.

190
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,400
Player Ji-woo.

191
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,970
How do you feel about the winter training?

192
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,350
Are you in good condition?

193
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,900
What are you doing? Give me some reaction.

194
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,520
If you have nothing to say, you could at least make a heart for the camera.

195
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,050
Hey.

196
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,070
Whatever it is, content or container, just stop filming.

197
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,170
Stop bothering him.

198
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,750
No matter what kind of emotional environment Ji-woo is in,

199
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,750
his heart rate won't exceed 60 beats per minute.

200
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,320
He can be called the AI of soccer.

201
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,670
He won't get mad even if the opponent blocks him hard.

202
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,670
Instead, he'll only start running with the ball. He knows nothing but playing soccer.

203
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,070
So you'd better not film him or make him your video content.

204
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,570
But... This is about playing soccer. Why do you need any content?

205
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,020
I'm a YouTuber with a million followers.

206
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,150
Haven't you heard of "Dong-hee's World TV"?

207
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,200
Don't any of you know?

208
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,620
Are your lives just about eating and playing soccer?

209
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,450
Yes.

210
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,570
-Yes.
-Yes.

211
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,470
Is this our car?

212
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,820
It can't be.

213
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,070
Our team's bus...

214
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,950
Is everyone here?

215
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:22,150
Mr. Seo, is it only us?

216
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,800
What about the others?

217
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,020
We only picked players who needed training in teamwork this time.

218
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,950
It's too crowded.

219
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,050
Mr. Seo.

220
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,120
Don't you have a better car?

221
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,020
I rented this car for the right number of people.

222
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,820
Anyway, the weather is nice.

223
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,070
That's true.

224
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,750
What's wrong?

225
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,520
You're indeed handsome, but it's a pity.

226
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,200
You can even be an idol.

227
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,250
How is he handsome?

228
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,349
He's got the look of a good soccer player.

229
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:18,369
He is handsome. I have high standards.

230
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,950
You must be happy then.

231
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,400
With such low standards, no wonder you fall for people a lot.

232
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,420
What... What about you?

233
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,670
What about you?

234
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,400
Do you think you look...

235
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,450
The person who was on my phone screen

236
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:38,300
is now right in front of me. It's really unbelievable.

237
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,070
Aren't we... Here for training?

238
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,000
This hotel looks familiar.

239
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,870
I know this place.

240
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,300
Because I'm a big fan of dating shows.

241
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,150
What's that?

242
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,720
-Dating reality shows.
-Oh?

243
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,270
How do we train here?

244
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,520
Attention.

245
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Our CEO often says that

246
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,900
soccer games start in the changing room.

247
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,850
And the winner also depends on the changing room.

248
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,220
What does that mean?

249
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,570
Training is not just about exercise.

250
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,370
To be one team,

251
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,870
you need to trust each other

252
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,000
and improve the team atmosphere. That's equally important.

253
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,870
Could this be because of me?

254
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,250
There are indeed some key figures who undermine teamwork here,

255
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,800
but it’s not all about that.

256
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,400
This was decided after monitoring the team atmosphere for a week.

257
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Alright then.

258
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,150
Let's go inside

259
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,550
and start with choosing your roommates.

260
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,520
Name a team member you want to learn more about,

261
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,670
okay?

262
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,620
It must be fun.

263
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,120
Yes.

264
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,800
Let's go in.

265
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,250
Let's start. Who wants to go first?

266
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,050
Since no one has raised their hand, I'll go first.

267
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,250
As for me...

268
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,250
Why is he acting so shy?

269
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,200
I have objections.

270
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,750
Don't do that.

271
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,220
I like Min-soo too.

272
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,770
I want him to be my roommate.

273
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,450
Let's do that then.

274
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,950
Let's go.

275
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,550
Hurry up and choose your rooms.

276
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,050
Otherwise, the good ones will be taken.

277
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,650
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

278
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,100
I'll pick Ji-woo then.

279
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,270
Me?

280
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,150
Okay.

281
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,070
By the way, he snores.

282
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,770
He always snores on the bus.

283
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,350
Be careful about your choice.

284
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,670
What's this about? Why are you always targeting me?

285
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,670
Whatever. Let's go random then.

286
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,400
You've all made your choice, right?

287
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,320
You can open your eyes now.

288
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,700
Who is No. 201?

289
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,320
Hey, you guys are in cahoots, right?

290
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,420
We're not.

291
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,970
I'm No. 202.

292
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,500
Come with me then.

293
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,220
What? Am I the only one who'll live alone?

294
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,820
You don't want to be alone? How about switching with me?

295
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,650
No.

296
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,600
Hey, you can't abandon your roommate.

297
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,420
Darn it.

298
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,020
See you later.

299
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,850
Let's go too.

300
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,400
When exactly are we going to play soccer?

301
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,820
When?

302
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,120
We need to put our luggage away before we do anything else, right?

303
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,670
Are you not coming?

304
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,970
If you don't like it, go to Dong-hee's room.

305
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,850
Oh, this is nice.

306
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,600
It's 100 times better than my place.

307
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,770
Oh, right, Brother.

308
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,850
What is it?

309
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,600
Can I call you Brother?

310
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,800
Oh... Sure.

311
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,770
As expected. I've liked you since the beginning.

312
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,550
I always feel like we've known each other for a long time.

313
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,470
Do you feel the same?

314
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,750
Me too.

315
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,750
-Really?
-Yes.

316
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,300
Why are you already working out? We just got here.

317
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,770
Because I'm a soccer player.

318
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,920
I thought you said you were an idol.

319
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,250
Then dance next to me.

320
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,250
You didn't say that to make me laugh, did you?

321
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,150
Yeah, I'm serious.

322
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:57,550
Why don't you come work out with me?

323
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,520
I'll help you correct your posture.

324
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,750
Forget it.

325
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,520
I've done commercials for this before.

326
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,520
So what?

327
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,420
What are you trying to say?

328
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,650
What are you doing? Let me see.

329
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,150
Don't come near me.

330
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,820
-Let me see.
-Don't follow me.

331
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,000
-Let me see.
-Stop it...

332
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,350
I was once the spokesperson of this brand.

333
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,050
You must be happy since you shot so many commercials.

334
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,550
Not a lot, actually.

335
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,250
But are you sure you've never seen my commercials?

336
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,770
No, I haven't.

337
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,500
But a lot of the products you use are my commercials.

338
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,700
That's... Just a coincidence.

339
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,650
I'm so tired.

340
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,300
Actually, there are more.

341
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
In my bag.

342
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:10,500
[It's Monday morning, and there are many more people who are hurt] [That won't happen! Repeat "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" to yourself!] ["The biggest fans are always the unluckiest" LOL]

343
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,500
The biggest fans are always the unluckiest.

344
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,550
They all say "The biggest fans are always the unluckiest,"

345
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,720
but I'm becoming the biggest fan with the best luck.
