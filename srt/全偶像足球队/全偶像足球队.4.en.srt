00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:06,710
[CEO Kim Dae-soo of FFF Entertainment]

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,880
You want me to be an idol?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,460
You can choose to be an idol, an actor,

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,840
or a model.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,590
I can't sing well.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,560
Don't worry about that.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Sign the contract first. We'll train you

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,720
and find out what works for you gradually.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,740
Well... As soon as I saw you,

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,280
I had this feeling.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,520
I don't just give my business card to anyone.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,020
In this school, I only gave it to two students,

13
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,920
including you.

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,630
Who is the other student?

15
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,570
You're in the same grade, so I suppose you know him well.

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,660
His name is Do Ji-woo.

17
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,170
I see.

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,260
Did he... Say yes?

19
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,750
Ji-woo turned me down straight away.

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,170
He said his dream was to become a soccer player.

21
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,140
Oh, right.

22
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,970
I heard he's about to transfer to a school with a soccer team.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,590
Good for him.

24
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,960
He'll definitely regret it in the future.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,870
It doesn't matter. After all...

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,160
You're my first choice, Kyung-jae.

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,280
I'll think about it.

28
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,200
Don't make me wait too long.

29
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,410
Come on. Exhale.

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,160
Ouch.

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,700
Hang in there.

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,690
For a soccer player, the most important thing is to prevent injuries.

33
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,620
Exhale.

34
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,640
Yes, that's it.

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,979
Now I feel teamwork.

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,900
I'm not the only one who feels it's weird, am I?

37
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
Is your belly okay?

38
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,970
No.

39
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,920
I've already apologized to you.

40
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,470
You're just saying that.

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,030
You're the one who's been pulling pranks.

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,070
I'm hurt here too.

43
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,090
Gosh.

44
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,140
It seems they had a fight in their room last night.

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,130
What? They got physical?

46
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,750
Ryu Kyung-jae is a real piece of work.

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,020
But Ji-woo isn't the type to admit defeat.

48
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,190
Why should you be so worried?

49
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm not worried that he'll lose.

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,280
I'm worried that our Ji-woo will be distracted by him.

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,620
Our Ji-woo?

52
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,800
Ouch. Ouch.

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,690
I'm the one who's hurting more.

54
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,300
I'm the one who's hurting more.

55
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,470
Where's Ji-woo?

56
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,520
He's taking a shower.

57
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,510
By the way, what are you doing here?

58
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:10,130
I'm waiting for Ji-woo.

59
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,010
Just ignore me.

60
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,079
Hey, Do Ji-woo.

61
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,040
You've gotten in better shape.

62
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,210
Don't flatter me.

63
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,900
I've just gained weight.

64
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,230
Well, what brings you here at this hour?

65
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,660
I just came to hang out with you. I missed you.

66
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,100
What? But...

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,740
It's only been 30 minutes since our practice ended.

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,050
Didn't we agree to analyze other teams?

69
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,140
Oh, right.

70
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,090
It's him.

71
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,280
-You mean Number 10?
-Yes.

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,240
Yes. As far as I know, he's really fast.

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,670
So we have to be careful with our defenses

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,320
and keep an eye on him.

75
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,380
But anyway, we've got you.

76
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,520
No. I think he's a hard nut to crack.

77
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,170
We should set up good defenses before we attack.

78
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,320
Also, we need to keep an eye on them.

79
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,100
In short, we...

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,530
Sorry.

81
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,510
Were we too loud?

82
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,700
No.

83
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,920
Hey, close the door on your way out.

84
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Okay.

85
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,610
Also, this Number 7.

86
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,210
As Captain, he's obviously siding with him.

87
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,409
No, wait.

88
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:37,600
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

89
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,770
That's my room.
Why was I the one who felt awkward and left?

90
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,370
Did you move here?

91
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,250
Sounds like a good idea.

92
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,600
How about I just move in here?

93
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,480
Where's Do Ji-woo?

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,920
Boss was looking for him, so he went downstairs.

95
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,370
Didn't you see him?

96
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,010
Oh...

97
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,450
Listen.

98
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,500
Brother.

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,250
Calling me "Brother".

100
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,250
Why? Do you have something to say to me?

101
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,280
Not really. I just have something to ask you.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,620
What is it?

103
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,900
How close are you with Ji-woo?

104
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,220
Do you know what my position on the soccer field is?

105
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,690
Do I need to know?

106
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,090
Center back.

107
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,170
I'm a defender.

108
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,409
Do you know what Ji-woo's position is?

109
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,980
He's a forward.

110
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,380
Right. To be precise, he's the left forward.

111
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,580
You must think that as a defender,

112
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,910
I should not be close to Ji-woo, who's a forward, right?

113
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,030
I stand in front of our goal,

114
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,730
while Ji-woo stands in front of the opponent's goal.

115
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,770
But the people who know and trust each other the most on the team

116
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,970
are me and Ji-woo.

117
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,800
Why do you think that is?

118
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,990
Center backs are at the furthest back,

119
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,460
watching forwards move throughout the entire game, so that they can collaborate.

120
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,410
I'd see where Ji-woo goes and follow him.

121
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,600
On the contrary, if I get attacked,

122
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,740
Ji-woo will come to the goal and help with defense.

123
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,180
This is how we
trust and depend on each other.

124
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,400
Okay.

125
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,280
Also, my advantage is to keep an eye on people.

126
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,300
One-on-one defense.

127
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,950
I'll keep an eye on you.

128
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,290
Huh?

129
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,990
Why should you keep an eye on me?

130
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,950
Did I give Do Ji-woo a hard time or something?

131
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,909
Sure you did.

132
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,780
You also bullied Ji-woo yesterday, didn't you?

133
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,080
What?

134
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,330
We really didn't get physical yesterday. In fact...

135
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,800
Anyway, no matter what you did and what you think,

136
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,530
I'm not interested at all.

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,650
Just don't mess with Ji-woo.

138
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,390
All we think about is soccer. Don't get in our way.

139
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,750
-What if I don't agree?
-What?

140
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,700
Since you want to compete with me in such a childish way,

141
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,790
in fact, I've known him longer than you.

142
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,010
I wonder if you've heard of that.

143
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,190
Is that so? You went to the same school?

144
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,780
Listen.

145
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,820
I've been sweating with Ji-woo in games for five years.

146
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,230
What we have is completely different from

147
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,610
you two's relationship as unfamiliar classmates.

148
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,650
So what do you want?

149
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,010
Do you want to be Do Ji-woo's guardian?

150
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,800
Even if Ji-woo and I fight,

151
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,820
it's between us. Stay out of it.

152
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,390
Is that so?

153
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,060
Does Ji-woo think so too?

154
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,310
[FC Soldout]

155
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,790
Why are you finished already?

156
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,380
I came early today.

157
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,450
I see.

158
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,260
Oh, right.

159
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,600
We'll train together later, right?

160
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,020
Of course. I didn't forget.

161
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,840
Last night... You took digestive pills before going to bed, right?

162
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,870
Yes.

163
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,310
But... How did you know?

164
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,820
As your roommate, of course I know.

165
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,780
-Here.
-Drink this.

166
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,290
What are you guys doing?

167
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,300
I have my own drink. It's okay.

168
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,940
So awkward. I can't even eat.

169
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,820
Senior.

170
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,680
I'll go first.

171
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,590
Okay, I'll be right there.

172
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,680
Hey.

173
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,980
Where are you going?

174
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,190
The practice field. Why?

175
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,410
What about me?

176
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,820
You haven't finished yet, have you?

177
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,250
Still...

178
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,540
You should've said, "Come over after you finish."

179
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,730
Darn it.

180
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,620
Okay. Hurry up.

181
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,050
Why didn't you ask me?

182
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,040
About what?

183
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,260
Training together.

184
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,580
You want to go too?

185
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,070
Am I not a player on the team?

186
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,990
Why is he acting up too? Seriously.

187
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,900
Dribble first.

188
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,530
Find the right position.

189
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,570
Okay.

190
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,600
Captain.

191
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,100
I want to practice too.

192
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,990
Okay.

193
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,110
I'll take a rest then.

194
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,050
Come on.

195
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,420
Lower your body.

196
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,400
Harder.

197
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,470
Come on, hold on.

198
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,130
Be gentler.

199
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,590
Okay, okay.

200
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,640
Again.

201
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,420
Train with me.

202
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,240
But I just finished.

203
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,190
Just practice a bit longer.

204
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,880
Why are you so serious all of a sudden?

205
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,890
I've always been serious about soccer, okay?

206
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,720
As serious as you are, maybe even more so.

207
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,960
Beat me first, then we'll talk.

208
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Bring it on then.

209
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,950
Don't split your legs like this.

210
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,720
Is this K's?

211
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,330
It's so hot. I'm going to be tanned.

212
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,050
How should I wear this?

213
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,560
It's working.

214
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,610
It's so good. Really good.

215
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm now going to be reborn as a delicate-skinned soccer icon.

216
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,760
That's mine.

217
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,850
It's not what it looks like.

218
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,690
I just saw it on K's bed, so...

219
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,290
Don't get me wrong. I just...

220
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,450
I was just wondering what this is.

221
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,750
Do you want it?

222
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,210
What?

223
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,390
I lent this to K.

224
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,880
You can have it.

225
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,520
But isn't this expensive?

226
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,490
If you also know how to take care of your skin, this should work pretty well for you.

227
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,450
Really?

228
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,890
It's just I don't dress up normally for soccer.

229
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,330
If I put my mind to it, I can be like Ji-woo.

230
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,040
What does he like?

231
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,270
You mean Ji-woo?

232
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,440
Yes.

233
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,130
Playing soccer.

234
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,370
All Ji-woo does is play soccer.

235
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,320
-I don't think that's the case.
-What?

236
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,930
Nothing.

237
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:15,830
Then what does he hate?

238
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,990
I don't know what he hates,

239
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,610
but there's one thing I'll never forget.

240
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:22,060
He may not look like it,

241
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,640
but he's actually very sympathetic.

242
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,510
He likes to take care of people.

243
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,820
If someone needed help, he wouldn't stand by and do nothing.

244
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,610
Umm...

245
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,740
By the way,

246
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,010
once he saw an old lady working alone at a restaurant,

247
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,100
and he suddenly started waiting tables without even finishing his meal.

248
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,350
I see.

249
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,490
Thank you.

250
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,030
If you tap here twice, it can help shrink your pores.

251
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,710
Great!

252
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,730
Hey.

253
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,980
Why are you thanking me? I should be thanking you.

254
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,640
I knew you were a warm-hearted person.

255
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,350
I, Kang Min-soo, is really going to be reborn.

256
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,500
Why are you telling me this?

257
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,790
A game where one side has an absolute chance of winning is too boring.

258
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,800
Game?

259
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,960
Stop asking the obvious question.

260
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,520
You want to be close to Ji-woo even more than Captain,

261
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,040
don't you?

262
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,330
I don't care.

263
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:16,230
Just tell me if you want to win or lose.

264
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,830
I want to... Win.

265
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,310
Then trust me this once.

266
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,340
Ouch. Ouch.

267
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,360
What happened to my leg?

268
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,180
What's wrong? Does it hurt?

269
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,100
It's weird. My front thigh is tight and stiff.

270
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,350
That's because you kicked the front muscle when you swerved.

271
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,540
You did that during the practice earlier.

272
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,760
Me?

273
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,100
Try the back muscles.

274
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,500
In order to make a soccer movie,
I received special training for a few months.

275
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,440
Maybe it's been too long, and my body has completely forgotten about it.

276
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,710
Movie?

277
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,950
Ah...

278
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,060
It's called "Striker", right?

279
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,870
Yes. Have you seen it?

280
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,190
No.

281
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,550
It's amazing.

282
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,830
You said you didn't see it.

283
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,210
What?

284
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,080
I've seen it.

285
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,710
Sorry, I'm drunk.

286
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,200
A soccer player telling me he saw it makes me feel a bit embarrassed.

287
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,910
I liked it.

288
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,050
That's great.

289
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,170
But...

290
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,950
What's the right way to use my hamstrings?

291
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,240
You should teach me. I really don't know.

292
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,840
You want me to teach you?

293
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,600
Oh. You find it troublesome, right?

294
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,380
Forget it if you don't want to.

295
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,730
I didn't say I wouldn't.

296
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,610
It's just a bit weird to call it "teaching you."

297
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,420
How about I be your training partner from now on?

298
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,000
Really?

299
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,910
I'll count on you from now on.

300
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,410
By the way, when you were making that movie,

301
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,330
was there a soccer player that you imitated?

302
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,120
A soccer player that I imitated?

303
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,650
Your acting was so real.

304
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,940
I did refer to this person.

305
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,010
-Who?
-You...

306
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,070
Have never been so curious about me.

307
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,100
I thought you weren't interested in me.

308
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,150
No. I'm curious.

309
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,470
I'm very interested.

310
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,750
Wow. I'm so touched.

311
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,200
But who that soccer player is will remain a secret.

312
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,680
I can't tell you yet.

313
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,030
Sorry.

314
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,670
I'll go to bed.

315
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,600
You've finished reading?

316
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,220
In this world, can you still...

317
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,330
Imprison your artist?

318
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,990
It's only because you've been delaying your next work.

319
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,760
Are there any roles in here you want to play?

320
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,700
[They Won't Give Up
Striker]

321
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,920
I didn't expect you to be into sports.

322
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,020
Did you go over the rest carefully?

323
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,560
I think there should be roles more suitable for you.

324
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,740
Compared to the theme of soccer, I like this lead more.

325
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:10,840
[They Won't Give Up
Striker]

326
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,900
It is a storyline in which a player who hits rock bottom in a bad team situation

327
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,350
perseveres to finish the game and leads the inferior team

328
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,130
to the league championship.

329
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,430
But this...

330
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,100
The ending is they fail to win.

331
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,990
Isn't it too obvious?

332
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,960
I'm not sure if that's the case,

333
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,260
but I can do it well.

334
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,910
You told me to do what I'm best at, didn't you?

335
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,380
You mean soccer?

336
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,680
This is not something that can be done well just by acting.

337
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,950
There are many actors who ended up screwing up
due to careless imitations.

338
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,130
Don't worry about that.

339
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:41,620
Because it reminds me of someone.

340
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,190
I want to make that movie.

341
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,320
No.

342
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,820
The lead.

343
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,670
I must

344
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,150
play that role.

345
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,560
-Come on. Follow me.
-Okay.

346
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,720
What are you going to teach me today?

347
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,620
-Direction change.
-Direction change...

348
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,660
Where are you going?

349
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,680
I promised him I'd practice soccer with him today.

350
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,870
Since when?

351
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,490
Since yesterday.

352
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,790
I thought we agreed to play games together.

353
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,590
I'm sorry, Senior.

354
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,880
Are you jealous?

355
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,490
Of whom?

356
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,150
Those two.

357
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:38,310
Ah. I was just making defense. I was worried they'd fight again.

358
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,670
I thought... You were jealous.

359
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,480
We're all teammates. Why should I be jealous?

360
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,450
Why are you grinning?

361
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,170
I get jealous a lot.

362
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,990
Of teammates and others.

363
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,340
What?

364
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,780
I dated a boy group member before.

365
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,690
What?

366
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,470
Have you never heard of it?

367
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,830
I didn't expect them to really keep their mouths shut.

368
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,070
Then why did he volunteer to leave?

369
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,280
Well...

370
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,000
You'd better ask him yourself.

371
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,200
I dated a boy group member before,

372
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,420
and we were secretly photographed by the paparazzi.

373
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,530
The company wouldn't let it go. That's why I quit.

374
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,850
That said, do I still need special management?

375
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,810
From today on, can we live separately?

376
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,160
Hey.

377
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,860
Do you think we need to live separately just because you're jealous?

378
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,570
No.

379
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,250
Then...

380
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,940
Do you suddenly get jealous of others when you play soccer?

381
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,920
Then what are your concerns?

382
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,690
What a cute boy.

383
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,300
Trying to avoid my surveillance secretly.

384
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,890
It seems Ji-woo isn't the problem.

385
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,020
That won't do.

386
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,550
I'll first keep an eye on you.

387
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,170
Got it?

388
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,540
Go wash up.

389
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,330
Okay. Give me five.

390
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,240
Excuse me.

391
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:20,380
[Excuse me...
Has anyone uploaded Kyung-jae's high school graduation photos?]

392
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,410
Has anyone uploaded Kyung-jae's high school graduation photos?

393
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:24,130
[Here~]

394
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,640
Oh...

395
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,230
It really is our school's uniform.

396
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,710
What's with this?

397
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,230
He always sits in the same seat.

398
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:48,100
He always looks focused.

399
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,080
That's why we never made eye contact properly, not even once.

400
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,600
Did he forget to take it?

401
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,860
Are you asleep?

402
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,560
You said you had no heartbeat.

403
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,510
Your heart is beating just fine.

404
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,830
You said you didn't remember,

405
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,690
then why are you dreaming about this period of time?

406
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,300
I won again.

407
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,470
You closed your eyes.

408
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:38,190
