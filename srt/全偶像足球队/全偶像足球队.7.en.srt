The cause of the altercation between the lead actors Yoo Kang-jae and Jeong Si-woo on the drama set is now a hot topic.
It is said that Yoo Kang-jae, though the lead, was dissatisfied with his small role, especially after Jeong Si-woo took away what little screen time he had. After an argument, he physically attacked him.
As a result, Jeong Si-woo needs three weeks of treatment to recover, and the drama's filming has been halted.
What's more shocking is that one of the staff members, who tried to intervene, was injured during the fight.
This incident has caused even more stir.]

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,450
My heated discussion group?

180
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,200
I have a group like that?

181
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,390
Well, that's normal.

182
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,320
Yoo Kang-jae.

183
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,500
[Participate in open chat: Join Yoo Kang-jae's heated discussion group]

184
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,210
[Join open chat: Close to Kyung-jae's heated discussion group]

185
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:31,950
[I'm so happy today because I saw Kyung-jae's photo, haha.]
[I can't wait to meet him. Do I have to wait until soccer season to see him?]
[I wonder if he received my fan letter]
[I wonder if he read my fan letter]

186
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,270
Aren't you going to read them?

187
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Read what?

188
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,900
The fan letters--aren't you going to check them out?

189
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,480
I never said I wouldn't read them.

190
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,690
You're such a bad person.

191
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,640
What?

192
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,460
If so many people are cheering for me,

193
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,750
I'd feel so supported.

194
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,130
But you just stuffed their sincerity into your closet...

195
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,690
That's not very nice.

196
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:21,340
[He'll definitely read them! Because it's hard to fulfill the wishes of fans who want to see him. Even if he doesn't read them immediately... he will definitely read them. He'll definitely keep them safe.]

197
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,010
Crisp and Tender Lion.

198
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,150
[Crisp and Tender Lion]

199
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't call anymore, these malicious commenters.

200
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,640
Hey, Mom.

201
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,220
Yes.

202
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,910
No.

203
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,440
I should be heading out now.

204
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,990
Cleaning?

205
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,890
Got it.

206
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,690
Come here later.

207
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,640
You know the password, right?

208
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,330
Okay.

209
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,550
Mom?

210
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,330
[The fresh air of the South Sea is coming your way.]

211
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,450
Darn it.

212
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,950
What should I do about all these?

213
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:57,090
[Watch their story, you'll cry. Striker, they won't give up!]

214
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,840
Do you need help?

215
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,020
Listen to me... It's not what you think. That...

216
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,060
What's going on?

217
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,540
Senior Kyung-jae is here too.

218
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,690
Oh, he must be in pain.

219
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,260
Look at how scared you are. It's pretty normal.

220
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,890
I totally understand.

221
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,880
So...

222
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,360
This... I hope you can keep it a secret for me.

223
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,570
Does Yoo Kang-jae not know?

224
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,360
Listen to me.

225
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,940
Kyung-jae and I just started getting along.

226
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,320
So I don't want things to get awkward.

227
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,130
I don't want him to know that I'm his fan.

228
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,960
And I don't expect anything else.

229
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,340
No proof?

230
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,160
What?

231
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,710
It'd be best if you have some kind of feeling, just take a photo.

232
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,960
Is it fine to just follow the script?

233
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,410
You should also act a little bit.

234
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,650
But...

235
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,990
It says here he hit his head.

236
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,480
It's acting, it's fine.

237
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,790
I see.

238
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,530
I hope you can help me this time.

239
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,470
Because I always forget my lines.

240
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,390
If you can seriously cooperate with me and act,

241
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,940
I can keep the things I saw earlier a secret for you.

242
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,050
Why hit me?

243
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,470
Dad, what did you do for me?

244
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,080
Do you want me to kick you too?

245
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,030
No, you need to take this seriously.

246
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,080
Aren't you awake yet?

247
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,420
Bro.

248
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:17,730
It's you.

249
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,770
Thanks for earlier.

250
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,840
Mm.

251
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,500
This is for you, bro.

252
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,910
What is this?

253
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,090
Hats and T-shirts, things like that.

254
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,240
They're sponsored by the brand.

255
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,570
Because this color doesn't suit me,

256
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,160
I thought it might look good on you.

257
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,750
No need, I don't need this.

258
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,370
I don't need it either.

259
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,530
If you don't want to wear it, just throw it away.

260
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,160
But if possible,

261
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,890
instead of throwing it away, let someone who suits it wear it.

262
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,020
Thanks.

263
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,120
Darn it.

264
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,050
Suddenly, becoming so close.

265
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,640
You guys aren't using honorifics anymore.

266
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,830
No, it's not like you think.

267
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,760
Earlier... together.

268
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,660
Earlier, together...

269
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,040
What did you do?

270
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,500
Practice.

271
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,990
Practice?

272
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,300
Hey.

273
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,910
The person who wants to get along with him is me,

274
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,260
not for you guys to get along.

275
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,750
Didn't you say everything was settled?

276
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,200
Don't trust that guy too much.

277
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,610
I don't think he's that bad.

278
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,340
Anyway...

279
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,230
Don't be too polite with him.

280
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,550
Got it.

281
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,060
Darn it.

282
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,650
Ji-woo.

283
00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:58,640
I've been your supporter since TA started.

284
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,020
I support you guys.

285
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,560
Okay, thank you.

286
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,810
Fighting.

287
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,510
Wait a minute.

288
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,600
Thank you for cheering for us.

289
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,620
Hello.

290
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,330
I've been supporting you guys

291
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,460
for three years since FC TA started.

292
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,070
Although a lot has happened this year...

293
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:30,250
I just want to say that I still support you.

294
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,490
Because FC Forworld

295
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,950
is a strong force in my daily life.

296
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,390
Even if the sponsor changes, the supporters won't leave.

297
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,510
I'll be content if I can see you guys

298
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,220
on the field in the next season.

299
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,640
Let's go to the next level.

300
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,900
This week's friendly match,

301
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,560
you have to win. I'll cheer for you all.

302
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,200
I really want to win this game.

303
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,410
Don't think of this as just a friendly match.

304
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,970
The season hasn't started yet, so don't underestimate it.

305
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,630
I also want to win this match.

306
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,320
Me too.

307
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,290
Then let's win.

308
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,540
Let's go.

309
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,590
One, two.

310
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,500
-Forworld, Forworld.
-Forworld, Forworld.

311
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,310
-Fighting.
-Fighting.

312
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,780
Friends, we finally...

313
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:58,480
[Forworld isn't over yet!! We have to play well in the second half. Do Ji-woo seems a bit off today. Hoo, this is the last chance, we must win. The opponent seems tough, trembling. We have to win the second half! How many do you think it will be? The defense has to be solid. Tae-ryong, fighting~ Anyway, it's much better than last time~ Forworld fans, raise your hands~ No matter what, I still believe in Do Ji-woo player. Jiwoo, go~~~ Yoo Kang-jae is pretty good, huh? Please make sure to catch the ball when it's passed over. Dong-hee's defense behind him, whew. Even though it's not an official match, I still hope we can win. Anyway, the artist team is a bit... What's going on? The first half ended like this?! Looking for Forworld supporters. FC Forworld, come on! Watching this, you start to feel attached. Let's really win this time. The opponent team is tough too, but even though we lost to Hamsan FC, this time we will definitely win! Do Ji-woo, fighting!!!!!! Kyung-jae, I believe in you.]

314
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,140
The long-awaited season opener

315
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,570
of FC Forworld has arrived.

316
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,810
The final friendly match.

317
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,510
Sadly, we lost to the opponent in the first half.

318
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:41,020
Also, that scene where we all shouted together...

319
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,090
When Do Ji-woo player had a one-on-one chance with the goalkeeper,

320
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,540
he passed the ball to Yoo Kang-jae,

321
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,560
but the opponent intercepted it.

322
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,190
What would have happened if he had just shot at that moment?

323
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,830
Such a regretful moment.

324
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,980
I hope we can turn things around in the second half.

325
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,210

FC Forworld, fighting, yay!

328
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,490
Guys, the match is only halfway through. Stay focused.

329
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,360
Dong-hee.

330
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,610
I told you, you can't always neglect the defense behind you.

331
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,930
Yes.

332
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,670
Hey, if you're going to play like this, you might as well quit.

333
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,130
I also want to quit.

334
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,170
If Mr. Kim didn't assign it,

335
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,970
Ji-woo,

336
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,020
you need to be more confident. Be confident.

337
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,820
If you get the chance to shoot, just go for it.

338
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,300
You can do it, Do Ji-woo.

339
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,800
Yes.

340
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,640
Yeah, Ji-woo, you can do it.

341
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,930
FC Forworld can do it.

342
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,770
Please, win the second half.

343
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,310
Let's go. Let's all cheer together.

344
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,650
Gather round, gather round.

345
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,650
-One, two, three, go!
-Go!

346
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,400
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

347
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,620
Do Ji-woo.

348
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,670
You once asked me, when filming Striker,

349
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,000
which person I referred to.

350
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,350
That person was you.

351
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,850
What?

352
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,210
You also asked me

353
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,590
if I remembered leaving my umbrella on the school playground.

354
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,720
I still remember.

355
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,160
That wasn't me forgetting.

356
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,690
I left it there for you to use.

357
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,180
I think you were really cool,

358
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,810
the way you played football at the time.

359
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,100
You were the protagonist in my movie.

360
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,520
Whether back then or now,

361
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,570
Do Ji-woo, you've always been the protagonist in my story.

362
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,610
You probably didn't even know that.

363
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,090
Because it was so silly.

364
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,820
But now you should know. You are so brilliant.

365
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,420
Yoo Kang-jae.

366
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,640
Let's go.

367
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,250
We have to win.

368
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,660
Yoo Kang-jae player got the ball in a good position.

369
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,750
Don't hesitate, kick it.

370
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,800
Pass it to Do Ji-woo, Do Ji-woo.

371
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,670
Ji-woo.

372
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,670
Good, good, very good.

373
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,400
Keep going, keep going.

374
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,840
Keep going, shoot, shoot!

375
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,260
Shoot, Do Ji-woo, goal!

376
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,540
Goal! Do Ji-woo!

377
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,060
Wow, Do Ji-woo!

378
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,410
Do Ji-woo, awesome, awesome.

379
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:29,900
