<i>How's your hand? Is it hurt badly?</i>

<i>- Well...
- It's getting better.</i>

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,290

<i>Guys taking care of each
other without a woman present?</i>

12
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,910
<i>Women more careful
and gentle anyway.</i>

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,270
<i>How was it?</i>

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,020
<i>Finished with your sweetness?</i>

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,190
<i>What crazy sweetness?
That's nonsense.</i>

<i>That's enough.</i>

19
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,640
Let me go already, Wee.

20
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,720
I'm not letting you
go until you bless me.

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,540
If you want me to bless you,
you have to let me go.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,410
Then, I'm not letting
you go until you bless me.

23
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,270
Let me go.

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,830
Let him go!

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,530
Kawee?

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,310
P'Tonmai?!

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,240
Why did you
punched my brother?!

28
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,530
He's your brother?

29
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,790
Yes!

30
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,330
You two know each other?

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
Yes.

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,320
You! Why did you
punched my brother?!

33
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,590
I saw he was harassing you.

34
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,290
So I got mad.

35
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,250
Kawee, I'm sorry.

36
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,060
It's alright.

37
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,180
You pack quite a punch.

53
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,770
Why are you here so early today?

54
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,270
What?

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,530
I normally come at this time.

56
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,990
No.

57
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,140
You normally came after me all the time.

58
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,140
Is there anything special today?

59
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,030
Or...

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,750
is it because of the new employee?

61
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,650
Hold it, Ai'Kok.

62
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,590
You're teasing me now?

63
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,380
I just woke up early today,
so I came here early. That's all.

64
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,120
Fine, I believe you.

65
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,950
What about you and N'Tai?

66
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,640
You're always sticking together.

67
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,380
I didn't see you like this before.

68
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,620
Well, lately I...

69
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,560
don't have much classes.

70
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,180
so I have time to come and see him.

71
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,430
That's right, that's right.

72
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,710
We were always sticking together
before, you just didn't noticed it.

73
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,260
Both got nervous.

74
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,370
Not bad.

75
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,170
No.

76
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,530
Sawasdee krub, everyone.

77
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,680
Sawasdee kru...

78
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,840
What's the matter?

79
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:18,270
Did something
happened to your mouth?

80
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,020
Your friend punched me.

81
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,530
My friend?

82
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,090
Ai'Tonmai?

83
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,140
Yes.

84
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,440
What did you do that got
you inn a fight with him?

85
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,620
There were some misunderstanding.

86
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,150
But we've cleared it up.

87
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,390
I think we just get the cafe ready.

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,280
Then please excuse me.
I have class in 10 AM.

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,290
I got to go now.

90
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,760
I'll pick you up in the evening.

91
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,980
OK, see you.

92
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,190
Sawasdee krub.

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,060
You have a chauffeur picking
you up every evening now?

94
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,860
That's too much, P'.

95
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,540
There's no need
to send you home now.

96
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,080
Let's get the cafe ready.

97
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,480
Go, go get the
chair off the table first.

98
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,540
OK.

99
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,210
I need to talk you.

100
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,990
About what?

101
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,600
I know...

102
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,950
that you like Kok.

103
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,880
What are you talking about?

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,610
No need to act like you don't know.

105
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,390
I can tell.

106
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,780
Your eyes...

107
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,790
your behavior...

108
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,870
it shows that you like Kok.

109
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,730
If I really do like him...

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,210
So...

111
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,710
what's it to you?

112
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,190
Nothing.

113
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,970
But if Kok knows...

114
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,430
what will happen?

115
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,670
You're threatening me.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,710
No!

117
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,660
Let me tell you something.

118
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,170
The reason Kok is being nice to you...

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,050
is because he feels guilty.

120
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,150
The same way you
feel guilty towards him.

121
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,180
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,080
What feeling guilty?!

123
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,850
It's about you cause him to
get kicked out by his aunt.

124
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,270
because he
took the blame for you.

125
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,680
How do you know that?

126
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,050
It's not important.

127
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,510
Let's just say that I know.

128
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,010
That you had a
fight with Kok's aunt's son.

129
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,650
Because that kid
said that Kok is an orphan.

130
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,600
So Kok helped you...

131
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,890
took the blame in your place.

132
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,440
Because he knows that you're causing
trouble to him so Kok protected him.

133
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,090
From that moment on,
he's being nice to you.

134
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,450
But do you know something?

135
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
He doesn't have any feelings for you.

136
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,000
He probably feels uncomfortable
with you always sticking around to him.

137
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,820
But he has to endure it.

138
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,880
I don't care how much you know.

139
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,700
Besides...

140
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,400
I don't believe...

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,200
that Kok being nice to me...

142
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,930
because he feels guilty.

143
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:05,190
So are you saying this
to make me sad and have me...

144
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:06,810
leave Kok?

145
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,170
Not gonna happen.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,470
One other thing...

147
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,220
the relationship
between me and Kok...

148
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,970
are very inseparable.

149
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,830
No one can come in between.

150
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,000
Or do you want to get in between?

151
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,400
Let me tell you something.

152
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,590
It's probably a little hard.

153
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,580
Try harder.

154
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,470
I have to go now.

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,470
Uncle, hear me out.

156
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,560
Move.

157
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,720
I won't.

158
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,340
Until you stop angry at me first.

159
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,170
I told you, I'm not angry. Let me go!

160
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,910
I'm not letting you go.

161
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,110
I said let me go!

162
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,290
You're not gonna
stop angry at me, right?

163
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,710
Go.

164
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,490
Do you forgive me yet?

165
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,490
Yes!

166
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,020
I am.

167
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,170
Then...

168
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,370
smile first.

169
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,240
If you're not angry anymore...

170
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,800
you need to smile first.

171
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,910
You're not gonna smile, right?

172
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,680
You're not smilling yet.

173
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,860
Fie, I'm smiling now.

174
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,130
I'm smiling now, OK?!

175
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,630
Happy?

176
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,370
Very good.

177
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,030
You're a lot cuter smiling like this.

178
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,330
Then you can move aside now,
I need to go to work.

179
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,190
OK.

180
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,510
Please go to work now.

181
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,190
This way please.

182
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,880
We're gonna
have a long conversation.

183
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,280
See you after work.

184
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,730
I'm always ready, or...

185
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,980
you can talk to me every night.

186
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,100
Is there something you need?

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,790
How did Ai'Tonmai punched you?

188
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,980
He thought I was
sexually harassing P'Gawin.

189
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,840
Sexually harassing?

190
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,620
P'Gawin is my brother.

191
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,350
I was hugging him so
he came and punched me.

192
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,710
But I think if that's the case...

193
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,200
he should have
punch your brother instead.

194
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,130
Why?

195
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,650
Ai'Mai likes you.

196
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,860
P'Tonmai likes me?!

197
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,370
Never.

198
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,680
Ai'Tonmai likes you for real.

199
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,080
He will never likes me.

200
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,760
He doesn't like me
since the first time we met.

201
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,930
My friend...

202
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,930
is not good at
conveying his feelings.

203
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,960
That's why he seems that way.

204
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,020
But...

205
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,360
I think he actually likes you.

206
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
He doesn't like me, he likes...

207
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,660
He likes who?

208
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,870
I don't know.

209
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,390
He definitely isn't into me.

210
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,310
He doesn't like me, 100%, 1000%.

211
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,270
Alright, alright.

212
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,430
If you say it like that...

213
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,090
I take your words for it.

214
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,220
By the way...

215
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,190
does it hurt?

216
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,330
It is.

217
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,730
Let me have a look.

218
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,420
Is it hurt?

219
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,560
It is.

220
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,020
What are you doing?

221
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,500
During childhood,
when I got wounded...

222
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,350
my parents did like this to me.

223
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,710
It heal you fast.

224
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,720
But I'm not a kid.

225
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,710
You're still younger than me.

226
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,530
Are you secretly
taking P'Phupha's photo?

227
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,030
No.

228
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,450
I'm not secretly taking his photo.

229
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,050
What's going on?

230
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,450
If you're gonna take my photo...

231
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
ask nicely and I'll let you.

232
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,090
I'm not taking your photo.

233
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,470
What are you smiling at, Ai'Kok?!

234
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,230
"If you want to take my photo...

235
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,640
I'll let you."

236
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,900
What's this about, P?

237
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,640
What are you talking about?

238
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,710
Whatever, back to work.

239
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,940
Sorry.

240
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,540
Gawin, today...

241
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,390
are you going anywhere after work?

242
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,340
Wanna have dinner with us?

243
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,930
Well...

244
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,590
I don't have any plan.

245
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,770
Then come have dinner with us.

246
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,410
It's been awhile since you join us.

247
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,050
I...

248
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,290
no rejection.

249
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,470
Everyone else is going.

250
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,580
It's all booked in advance.

251
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,040
It's just a meal. No drinking.

252
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,740
No drinking.

253
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,040
He's not free.

254
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,220
He already has
an appointment with me.

255
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,380
What are you doing?

256
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,970
Follow me.

257
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,880
Fine.

258
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
What the heck?

259
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,610
You can get change first.

260
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,360
Tonmai!

261
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,550
What's got into you?!

262
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,860
Ever since you punched
my brother in the morning...

263
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,050
and now you hold my hands
in front of my company colleagues.

264
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,460
What's wrong?

265
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,780
I don't know either.

266
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,480
I feel like I don't like it.

267
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,010
I'm not happy...

268
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,070
when someone
else stick close to you.

269
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,210
That's it.

270
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,480
I don't like it!

271
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,890
The why do you have to like it?

272
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,910
Whomever I want
to talk to or whatever...

273
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,490
It's got nothing to do with you.

274
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,450
How can it not?

275
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,720
Because you...

276
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,220
are my friend.

277
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,350
The only one.

278
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,970
Whatever I have to say...

279
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,600
you'll listen.

280
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,520
Giving me advice...

281
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,250
and encouragement to me.

282
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,660
Do you know...

283
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,580
whenever I'm with you,
I'm very happy.

284
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,290
Because of this, I can be myself
to the fullest when I'm with you.

285
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,590
Everything I do is that I don't
want you to enjoy with others...

286
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,900
more than me.

287
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,150
Let me get change.

288
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,480
Where?

289
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,340
The restroom.

290
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,540
It's too far. Here...

291
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,000
you can change
in my car like usual.

292
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,270
It's much more easier.

293
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,650
You like to force people.

294
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,590
We're arrived at your house.

295
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,650
Are you...

296
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,990
not going out?

297
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,590
I am but...

298
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,360
are you hungry?

299
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,160
Well...

300
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,510
a little.

301
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,420
I'm starving.

302
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,910
My refrigerator
has a lots of stuff too.

303
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,350
It's a pity that I'm
not good at cooking.

304
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,950
So...

305
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,100
do you want me to
cook for you, is that it?

306
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,540
Is it possible?

307
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,170
If it's not then...

308
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,940
it's fine.

309
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,940
Sure thing.

310
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,210
I'll cook for you.

311
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,120
OK, then...

312
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,800
park the car...

313
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,630
in my house.

314
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,860
OK.

315
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,640
Any idea what you wanna make?

316
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,590
There's cabbage.

317
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,640
I'll make a fish
stir-fry with cabbage.

318
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,880
There are some eggs too.

319
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,690
A steamed egg too.

320
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,740
OK.

321
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,300
So...

322
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,910
is there anything for me to help?

323
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,650
Help?

324
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:48,870
Then...

325
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,710
help me wash the vegetable.

326
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,100
Kawee.

327
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,990
Yes?

328
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,480
I've finished wash the vegetable.

329
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,380
Where do you want me to put this?

330
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,030
Over there will do.

331
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:22,070
The rest, leave it to me.

332
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,500
You can wait.

333
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,660
It's alright.

334
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,080
I think...

335
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,790
I want to watch you cook.

336
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,520
What are you doing?

337
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,080
Helping you cook, of course.

338
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,390
Stir the eggs like this.

339
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,680
It's fine, really.

340
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,900
Hurry up.

341
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,560
I'm starving.

342
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,720
Am I luring him...

343
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,150
or is he luring me?

344
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,160
Is there something
you want to tell me?

345
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,360
I think I'm sure now why Tai is
being nice to you more than a friend.

346
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,500
Really?

347
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,020
Yes.

348
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,400
Tai wasn't feeling guilty
or trying to make up for you...

349
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,530
but he really
has a feeling for you.

350
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,050
I'm sure.

351
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,570
Yesterday, I went to talk
to him to test his heart.

352
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,680
You...

353
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,180
If you still don't believe me,
I can help you with it once again.

354
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,950
I'm gonna get scolded and
hated for helping, I suppose.

355
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,710
I'm sorry that you
have to help me on this.

356
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,710
It's fine, we're friends.

357
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,280
I'm sincere in helping.

358
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,380
But just this one more time, OK?

359
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,720
Otherwise, Tai will definitely hate me.

360
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,730
OK.

361
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,480
I'll treat you to a big meal then.

362
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,980
You've said it.

363
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,210
Let's go home.

364
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,810
Wait up.

365
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,560
My water is not finish yet.

366
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,090
Staring my water like that...

367
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,370
do you want it?

368
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,960
Nonsense.

369
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,380
It's late, I want to go inside.

370
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,510
Move.

371
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,500
No.

372
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,920
Are you out of your mind?!

373
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,300
You troll kid!
<i>[ This is actually a slang term calling someone
who often causing troubles or create chaos]</i>

374
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,030
Then, I'm going home now.

375
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,760
It's not too late today?

376
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,810
No.

377
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,540
Why?

378
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,060
Nothing, it's just that it's late.

379
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,350
And...

380
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,820
I'm worried that you it
might be hard for you to drive.

381
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,700
Wanna sleep here?

382
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:20,040
You've slept here once, anyway.

383
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,030
It's not too late yet.

384
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,480
But today, I have to go
home no matter how late it is.

385
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,150
Because I need to know truth about
how my brother knows your firend.

386
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,050
OK.

387
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,300
Then drive safely.

388
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,760
Drive safely...

389
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,520
LINE me when you arrived.

390
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,340
Come in.

391
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,550
You wanna ask
about this morning, right?

392
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,450
Yes.

393
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,470
Tell me.

394
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,350
How did you know P'Tonmai?

395
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,040
It was the day you
dragged me to the boxing gym.

396
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,670
He punched my hand while trains me.

397
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,010
So he volunteered to pick me
up and send me off as an apologies.

398
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,980
But your hand heals a while ago.

399
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,700
Why is he still coming...

400
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,030
picking you up and send you off?

401
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,480
Exactly.

402
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,560
He likes to come and
consult with me about his love.

403
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,090
I don't know who
he's having a crush on.

404
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,600
What about you?

405
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,320
How did you know that kid?

406
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,910
He's P'Phupha's friend.

407
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,920
I met him at the cafe.

408
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,720
Do you know...

409
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,170
who he's having a crush on?

410
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,010
I don't know.

411
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,670
He has a crush on P'Phupha.

412
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,490
He has a crush on his own friend.

413
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,450
Tonmai likes men?

414
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,610
Yes.

415
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,490
Don't tell that you think...

416
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,760
he has a crush on a woman?

417
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,120
Yeah.

418
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,070
But I'm still
confused about this morning.

419
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,830
Why does he seems
so worried about you?

420
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,640
He even punched me.

421
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,000
It's nothing.

422
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,910
You know the truth, right?

423
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,110
Go to bed.

424
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,470
You need to wake up early and
lure a man tomorrow, aren't you?

425
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,650
What luring?

426
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,040
No.

427
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,390
It's called making him fell in love.

428
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,570
OK, my dear cute brother.

429
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,840
Go to bed. Go.

430
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,230
Why are you thinking like this, Ai'Win?

431
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,370
It's not about you.

432
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,420
What are you doing?

433
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,550
It's as you see, tidying up the bed.

434
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,530
Hold on.

435
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:43,690
So you're making the bed for Kok?

436
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,910
A lovers...

437
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,680
making each others' bed.

438
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,490
It's nothing strange to it.

439
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,550
Lovers?

440
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,420
What lovers are you talking about?

441
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,080
When did Kok
became your boyfriend?

442
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,130
Well...

443
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,710
last night,
Kok asked me to be his girlfriend.

444
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,330
Then we...

445
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,300
sleep together.

446
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,750
I don't believe you.

447
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,460
No matter what...

448
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,700
Kok will never ask
you to be his girlfriend.

449
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,910
Why?

450
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,900
You are his close friend.

451
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,680
You should be happy
that he has a girlfriend.

452
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:28,090
So you don't have to waste your time
and taking care of him out of guilt.

453
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,710
Actually it's a good thing
having me taking care of him.

454
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,380
It might give you
time to find a girlfriend...

455
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,660
and do something else.

456
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,910
I don't want to have a girlfriend.

457
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,310
And I took care care of him...

458
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,850
it's not because of guilt.

459
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,160
Then...

460
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,630
what was the reason?

461
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,440
Well...

462
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,290
You're not saying anything...

463
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,960
that means you're taking
care of him out of guilt.

464
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,050
I think it's enough.

465
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,050
It's not true.

466
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,600
I took care of him...

467
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,110
because I...

468
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:08,990
have a good feeling for him.

469
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,230
Very much too.

470
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,180
Did you heard that?

471
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,570
Shocked?

472
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,660
Don't be so shocked.

473
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,420
Find a way to console him.

474
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,140
I think Tai probably...

475
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,020
won't come to see you again.

476
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,760
Really?

477
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,070
Yes.

478
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,570
Don't forget to console him today.

479
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,050
Do it after you finish work.

480
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,910
I'm so sorry, P. Something
happened made me came late.

481
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,030
It's alright.

482
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,510
Calm down.

483
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,230
How's everything?
You said something happened.

484
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,290
Have you sort it out?

485
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,560
Not yet. I'll clear it up tonight.

486
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,770
I'm really sorry.

487
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,480
This won't happen again.

488
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,230
It's alright

489
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,810
Get ready.

490
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,840
Then...

491
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,570
go get change, customer is coming.

492
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,480
OK.

493
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm sorry that you had to
organize the cafe by yourself.

494
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,470
I'll treat for a meal as a recompense.

495
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,550
Sure.

496
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,320
I eat a lot, OK?

497
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,600
I can handle it.

498
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,380
Wait, wait, wait.

499
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,750
What treating for a meal?

500
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,020
Probably can't, P'Kawee.

501
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,430
Someone here might be jealous.

502
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,270
Ai'Kok!

503
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,500
Go and get change!

504
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,110
You even came late! Go!

505
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,750
Please excuse me to get ready.

506
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,400
This brat.

507
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:35,560
Should I smack him?

508
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,580
There's blueberry cheese pie today.

509
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:42,310
One blueberry cheese pie.

510
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,420
A Pepsi? OK.

511
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,460
OK, latte.

512
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,540
3 orders, right?

513
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,820
P'Kawee. I'm gonna get take break.

514
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,850
I'll be right back ASAP.

515
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,830
- No need to hurry.
- OK.

516
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,470
Need to hury.

517
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,500
Coffee beans.

518
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,360
What did P'Phupha use
to grind the coffee beans?

519
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,080
What are you looking for?

520
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,090
Nothing.

521
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,890
I asked, what were you looking for?

522
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,870
Let me go.

523
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,250
I wasn't looking for anything.

524
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,510
I was just...

525
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,810
standing here
thinking about random things.

526
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,470
So...

527
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,200
in your thoughts earlier...

528
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,910
is there me in it?

529
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,760
You always like to talk like that.

530
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,810
I won't make funny faces this
time to make you laugh at me.

531
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,560
Tired?

532
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,860
Not really.

533
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,990
You've gotten better.

534
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,720
If it was before, you would
probably be out of breath by now.

535
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:17,940
Yeah.

536
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,250
Why do I noticed lately that you
haven't talk about the person that...

537
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,770
you have a crush on?

538
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,240
Do you...

539
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,320
had it fulfilled?

540
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,680
Not yet.

541
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,360
The person you have a crush on...

542
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,860
is a guy, right?

543
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,360
What are you talking about?

544
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,170
Don't deny it.

545
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,480
I know...

546
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,940
that the person you
have a crush on is Phupha.

547
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,630
From now on...

548
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:57,770
you don't need to pick up
and give me a ride anymore.

549
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,460
No, Uncle.

550
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,530
Are you disgusted
at me that I like men?

551
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,610
No.

552
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,990
If you don't...

553
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,010
why can't you let me pick you
up and send you off like usual?

554
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,610
Use your time
picking and send me off...

555
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,870
wouldn't it be better to spend it on
the person you have a crush on?

556
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,940
Why are you
wasting your time on me?

557
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,630
Don't make excuses!

558
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,010
You're disgusted at me.

559
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,250
Just be honest.

560
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,380
I can accept it.

561
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,830
It's not a big deal.

562
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,770
Why would I hate you?

563
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,260
My brother also likes men.

564
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,910
What I said was
out of good intention.

565
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,190
I want you to
have your love fulfilled.

566
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,290
Uncle, listen to me.

567
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,710
I admit that before...

568
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,620
I thought I like Phupha.

569
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,320
But when I met this one person...

570
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,930
it made me realize...

571
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,330
that actually I don't like Phupha.

572
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,690
Probably just because
of close relationship...

573
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,710
like more of a worrying for a friend.

574
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:55,140
I'm afraid that if someone
took my friend away one day...

575
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,580
and I won't have anyone else.

576
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,780
But now...

577
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,870
that I've met that person...

578
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,920
my heart beats
faster when I'm near him.

579
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,870
And...

580
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,180
This person made me confident...

581
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,490
that I like him.

582
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,700
You said I should spend
time with the people I like.

583
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,780
Right now...

584
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,230
I'm doing it.

585
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,960
The guy you're having a crush on...

586
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,820
who is it?

587
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,110
I know you know who it is.

588
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,650
I don't.

589
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,140
You know!

590
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,960
Don't act like you don't.

591
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,130
I don't.

592
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,410
Uncle, wait for me.

593
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,900
Kawee

594
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,830
P'Phupha?!

595
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,770
Hello.

596
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,650
You answered so fast.

597
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,300
Is there something you need?

598
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,320
Nothing.

599
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,470
I just wanna say...

600
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,740
the rice I bought today...

601
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,810
is not good.

602
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,560
You're calling me just for that?

603
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,910
I'm just calling to tell you that...

604
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,290
it's not as delicious as your cooks.

605
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,290
When I ate it, it made think of you.

606
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,030
You're calling...

607
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,390
wanting me to cook for you?

608
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,710
Why do you know?

609
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,660
You know me so well.

610
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,730
You said it that much.

611
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,920
Anyone would know.

612
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,320
Really?

613
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,450
Then...

614
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,880
if there's nothing else...

615
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,060
I need to sleep first.

616
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,140
Well...

617
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,240
Do you need me to pick you up?

618
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,550
It's alright.

619
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,120
I feel bad.

620
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,970
No need.

621
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:14,230
So you don't have to
drive and burn so much fuel.

622
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:15,530
OK?

623
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,740
Actually...

624
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,620
it's not.

625
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,310
Your cafe is not that far.

626
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,240
Let me pick you up
so we can save the earth.

627
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,530
Hold on.

628
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,350
Save the earth, how?

629
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,940
Global warming, Kawee.

630
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,600
Haven't you heard about it?

631
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,800
Same direction...

632
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,290
go together...

633
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,050
go far and reduce
energy consumption.

634
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,000
Wait, P.

635
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,640
Your house and mine...

636
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,460
are in different directions.

637
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:51,390
But we're heading
towards the same direction.

638
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,200
Well...

639
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:05,920
you want to pick me up, aren't you?

640
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,090
Yes.

641
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,800
Want me to pick you up?

642
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,860
Then...

643
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,880
<i>OK.</i>

644
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,950
OK.

645
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,890
Then...

646
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,170
see you tomorrow.

647
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:18,350
OK.

648
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,760
Goodnight.

649
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,480
Goodnight.

650
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,930
Hey!

651
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,600
Did I succeed in luring P'Phupha?!

652
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,750
Paew!

653
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,880
I gotta call Paew.

654
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,490
Goddammit Phupha.

655
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,700
How did I come up with
that global warming thing?

656
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,650
Same direction and going together?

657
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,040
Manfah?

658
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,770
Phupha.

659
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:34,470
Manfah?
- Phupha.
