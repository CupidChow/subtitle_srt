<i>Wait, wait,

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,690
<i>No one's gonna eat it,

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,800

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,580
<i>I haven't.</i>

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,450
<i>I'm home to eat your cooking.</i>

21
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,640
Uncle, can I have the water?

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,570
Am I that old to you that
you had to call me "uncle"?

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,450
No.

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,070
But you told me yourself
that you're older than me.

25
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,590
So I call you "uncle".

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,670
That's true.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,090
But you can call me "P", right?

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,800
I want to call you "uncle".

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,610
Why?

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,920
I can't?

31
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,480
Fine, go ahead.

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,780
Uncle, can I have the water now?

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,220
I'm thirsty.

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,580
So, Uncle.

35
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,810
Can I ask you something?

36
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,070
Have you ever...

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,710
had a crush on someone?

38
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,490
Why do you ask?

39
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,310
Just answer my question.

40
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,710
Because you're having a
crush on someone, aren't you?

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,610
The reason you were
siting and sad all day...

42
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,120
it's because of this, right?

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,160
You know too well.

44
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,020
Whoever you're
secretly love or like...

45
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,430
just tell them.

46
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,170
Will they know
if you don't tell them?

47
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,520
I don't dare to.

48
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,250
I'm afraid of the answer.

49
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,830
You're having a
crush on a friend then?

50
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,460
You know it again.

51
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,950
Don't tell me
you can read my mind?

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,680
Nonsense.

53
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,770
Let me tell you.

54
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,280
If you secretly love
or like someone, go for it.

55
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,330
Whether it'll be
a happy ending or not...

56
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,010
forget about that first.

57
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,430
The more you keep it inside...

58
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,760
the one who'll be
siting uncomfortably and sad...

59
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,400
is you.

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,390
It's better for
you to let them know.

61
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,700
At least if you get sad,
it'll be only once.

62
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,700
It's better than you siting and feel sorry
for yourself over and over again.

63
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,990
when you see them
doing things with someone else.

64
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,950
Fighting.

65
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,570
Love...

66
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,030
there's nothing certain about it.

67
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,160
You have to
understand and accept it.

68
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,680
Thank you, Uncle.

69
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,950
Yeah.

70
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
Hurry and eat.

About what?

107
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,210
About Phupha.

108
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,300
From now on...

109
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,820

No chance of wining.

Why?

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,520

I'm not.

119

Because love...

120

121
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,990
It's more about the
hearts between two people.

122
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,020
P'Gawin, your brother
left me alone again.

123
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,330
Why did you got left behind?

124
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,740
He left me and went
with a guy, of course.

125
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,140
Serve you right.

126
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,900
What?

127
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,270
I'm joking.

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,110
Let me handle this.

129
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,900
There he is.

130
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,470

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,500

Sis Paew.

133
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,060
Don't call me "Sis".

134
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,820
Handle this yourself, OK?

135
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,940
I'm outta here.

136
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,940
You said you're going to help me.

137
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,080
Kawee.

138
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,240
Sit.

139
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,650
Here, right here.

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,290
You left me alone again.

141
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,160
I'm not.

142
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,150
Who did?

143
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,330
You left me and went with a guy.

144
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,210
How's that ot leaving me alone by
letting me drink coffee all by myself.

145
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,940
I thought you already went home.

146
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:06,800
Since you left me,
have you made any progress?

147
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,670
I don't know.

148
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,350
He was just like playing aroud.

149
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,510
I don't know how to say it.

150
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,130
Playing around?

151
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,470
I don't think so.

152
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,630
I think...

153
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,980
if you could get a lot closer to him...

154
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,830
you may be able to
make further progress.

155
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,820
Because just
you being only this close...

156
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,790
I can feel that he
has a heart for you.

157
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,070
How can you know that?

158
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,370
Trust me.

159
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,990
I have so much experience.

160
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,620
That you're taking care of someone...

161
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,420
and then being dumped by them?

162
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,130
You're cutting off my feels again.

163
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,260
What should we do?

164
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,270
What should I do?

165
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,510
I can't think of anything.

166
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,920
What are you doing?!

167
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,780
You're overreacting.

168
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,350
Overreacting?

169
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,520
You even have to ask?

170
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,040
It can be seen
from 300 miles away.

171
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,290
I'm thinking of a plan for you.

172
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,600
What?!

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,140
I've got an idea.

174
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,170
You need to apply as
a waiter in P'Phupha's cafe.

175
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,320
No.

176
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,330
Why?

177
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,810
Think about it.

178
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,690
Besides being his boyfriend...

179
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,580
you can also steal his coffee recipe...

180
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,620
in order to develop your cafe.

181
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,060
Is that a good idea?

182
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,140
Absolutely.

183
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,760
Trust me.

184
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,930
But, I think...

185
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,250
Stop it.

186
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,610
Shut up.

187
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,060
Tomorrow...

188
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,900
we will apply as a
waiter in P'Phupha's cafe.

189
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,450
Let me help.

190
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,860
No need, go home.

191
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,310
Or you'll get scolded again.

192
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,320
What's your deal?

193
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,110
Always chase me away.

194
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,330
When I really did go...

195
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,810
you'll feel...

196
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,890
Feel what?

197
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,380
I don't know.

198
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,740
You figure it out.

199
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,240
Teasing me?

200
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,580
What teasing?
I'm just shake the clothes to dry it off.

201
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,200
- You wanna play, right?
- What?

202
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,160
What? What?

203
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,300
Give up.
Are you not gonna give up?

204
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,240
Not gonna give up?

205
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,740
- Give up yet?
- No.

206
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,910
Enough!

207
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,850
OK, enough. I give up.

208
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,510
Enough.

209
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,980
Good that you surrender.

210
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,180
Let me tell you this...

211
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,710
you don't just lose to me in this.

212
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,550
You have to lose
to me in everything.

213
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,770
What?

214
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,770
One day...

215
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,180
you'll know.

216
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,850
What are you looking at?

217
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,330
Hang the clothes.

218
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,590
Fine.

219
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,610
Do you...

220
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,390
want me to go home for real?

221
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,370
I told you.

222
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,910
Don't talk about this again.

223
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,530
I'm...

224
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,010
sorry...

225
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,770
for making things end up this way.

226
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,580
P'.

227
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,130
Can you get out of my head?

228
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,300
You have to enter.

229
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,510
I'm talking to you and
you don't talk to me back.

230
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,640
Whatever.

231
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,880
I'll make you love me to death.

232
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,750
What am I talking
crazy to myself here?

233
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,450
P'Win?!

234
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,980
When did you came in?

235
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,560
Well, since...

236
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,760
"I'll make you love me to death".

237
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,580
Well...

238
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,570
I... I...

239
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,000
You like him?

240
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,920
I'm not.

241
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,600
If you like him just say it.

242
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,940
There's nothing wrong with it.

243
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,100
We have the rights
to like and dislike anyone.

244
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,120
For that reason,
it's not weird if you like him.

245
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,400
I do like him.

246
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,110
Just like?

247
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,490
Are you trying to trick me to answer?

248
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm not, I'm just asking frankly.

249
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,160
You love him, don't you?

250
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,900
It's not to that level, I just like him.

251
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,390
You love him.

252
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,880
If you don't really love him,
you won't be talking nonsense here.

253
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,070
It's not true.

254
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,290
I don't mind with
whom you like or love.

255
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,680
But be careful...

256
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,020
don't love him too much.

257
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,030
Can I hug you?

258
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,310
Can I hug you?

259
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,950
What? No.
It gives me the creeps.

260
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,440
What creeps?

261
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,230
Give me a hug, quickly.

262
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,090
What did you give
the teddy bear to wear?

263
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,350
It's my shirt.

264
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,370
Do you have a shirt of this color?

265
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,300
I do.

266
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,500
I'm sleepy.

267
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,260
Go, I'm sleepy.

268
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,250
Fine.

269
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,660
I'm leaving.

270
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,050
Go!

271
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,190
By the way, whose shirt is that?

272
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,700
P'Win!

273
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,170
I'm kidding, I'm leaving.

274
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,830
P'Kawee.

275
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,410
I'm heartbroken.

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,860
Why are you making that face?

277
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,300
Just to accompany me here.

278
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,610
Why it has to be me?

279
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,320
No one else was free.

280
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,860
P'Paew can't come here.

281
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,290
Besides, I've help
you once with P'Phupha.

282
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,060
Can't you even keep
me accompany here?

283
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,800
I have no one else.

284
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,990
No one understands me.

285
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,640
OK, OK, OK.

286
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,780
I'll be here with you.

287
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,150
Really?

288
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,010
Pew.

289
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,680
Are you here for hang out?

290
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,170
Yes.

291
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,570
I'm here to chill.

292
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,270
So...

293
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,130
the guy you snatched
from me aren't coming?

294
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,970
Your previous guy?

295
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,910
He's not coming.

296
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,980
He listens to me obediently.

297
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,700
I told him to
stay at home and he did.

298
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,610
I need to
excuse myself to my table.

299
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,170
The kids are waiting for me.

300
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,880
Go then,
I didn't put a chains on you.

301
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,970
P'Wee, you'll see.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,420
Soon, those two will sit with us.

303
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,610
I want to show you...

304
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,370
I'm nobler than he is,
that shameless.

305
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,330
Soon.

306
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,470
Pew.

307
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,690
I think we shouldn't bother them.

308
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,470
Just mind our own business.

309
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,710
No way.

310
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,230
He took away my boyfriend.

311
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,650
I won't admit defeat.

312
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,850
Soon those two will sit with us.

313
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,410
Sawasdee krub,
have you guys have a table yet?

314
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,810
Not yet. Can you get one for me?

315
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,040
Here, just nice.
Have a sit first and I'll take your order.

316
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,860
OK.

317
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,430
Thank you.

318
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,490
Come, don't be afraid of him.

319
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,600
Thank you.

320
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,730
What are you laughing at?

321
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,440
If they're not interested...

322
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,290
stop hooking them up.

323
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,180
We'll find out if
they're interested or not.

324
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,790
How?

325
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,410
This.

326
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,650
Pew.

327
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,150
Are you using money to lure them?

328
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:28,660
I'm willing to do anything to win.

329
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,230
But isn't that too much...

330
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,940
by using money?

331
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,350
No it's not.

332
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,450
Compare to him
snatching away my boyfriend.

333
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,090
Sawasdee krub,
P'. Can we sit with you?

334
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,460
Don't you want to sit at that table?

335
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,320
Well, that table has nothing
interesting than this table.

336
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,610
Sure thing, sit next to me.

337
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,620
I'm Thum.

338
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,110
I'm Max.

339
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,390
My name is Pew,
you can take me home with you.

340
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,660
So what's your name?

341
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,160
He's beautiful too.

342
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,870
I'm Kawee.

343
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,890
That's a nice name.

344
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,570
I don't have the strength to drink.

345
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,630
What should I do?

346
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,700
Let me help you with that.

347
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,300
OK.

348
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,400
He's gonna hold up the
glass and feed me the drink.

349
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,220
Aside from having no
strength to pick up the glass...

350
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,720
I don't have the strength to eat too.

351
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,540
What should I do?

352
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,830
Pew.

353
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,670
I can feed you.

354
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,100
No need, just sit there.

355
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,230
Don't pay attention to him.

356
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,990
Let us cheers together.

357
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,100
I want to know you better.

358
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,200
That's enough, my mouth is full.

359
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,500
Thank you.

360
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,870
You're taking me for a drink?

361
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,100
I couldn't sleep.

362
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,580
Come now.

363
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,070
Drink with me for awhile.

364
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,540
OK, OK.

365
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,810
Just for a little while.

366
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,330
I need to open
the cafe tomorrow morning.

367
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,850
I know, Mr. Phupha,
the handsome barista.

368
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,890
Come.

369
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,010
Mai, Ai'Mai.

370
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,000
Yeah?

371
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,470
That's N'Kawee.

372
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,890
The N'Kawee that you like.

373
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,500
There's a guy hitting on him.

374
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,760
Don't worry, buddy.
I'll deal with this.

375
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,770
You can mess with lots of people.

376
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,930
And you have to mess
with the one my friend likes.

377
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,470
Ai'Phu, wait...

378
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,670
N'Kawee, Sawasdee krub.

379
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,760
P'Phupha?

380
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,680
What a coincidence again.

381
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,310
It's just so happened that
we don't have any table.

382
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,280
Can we sit together?

383
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,010
Sure thing.

384
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,400
Please sit.

385
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,640
Find a chair to sit.

386
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,170
Is there anyone sits here?

387
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,130
I'll take it, OK?

388
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,720
Are you here with your friends?

389
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,210
I never met them before.

390
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:48,640
Not a friend.

391
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,910
I want to be more than
just a friend with Khun Kawee.

392
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,040
In that case...

393
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,820
You have to get disappointed.

394
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,910
Why?

395
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,870
Khun Kawee said that he's single.

396
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,950
Still single...

397
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,130
but in a moment...

398
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,070
he'll have a boyfriend, right?

399
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,020
Yes.

400
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,900
Are you hitting on Kawee too?

401
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,990
I'm sure to call it a hit on...

402
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,150
but it might be close.

403
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,080
For that reason,
looking at you today...

404
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,990
I probably have
to see you sad and cry.

405
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,750
You look so confident.

406
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,710
Khun Kawee...

407
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,060
never said he's
agreed with you yet.

408
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,300
I think you should check your...

409
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,220
ears a little.

410
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,820
There might be
something wrong with your ears.

411
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:55,010
I told you, didn't I?

412
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,820
That in a moment,
he'll have a boyfriend.

413
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,470
I think you should move to your table.

414
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,360
Sitting here will only make you sad.

415
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,270
Is P'Phupha trying to win me over?

416
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,790
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.

417
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,590
My heart is shaking like hell.

418
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,870
Max, Max!

419
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,650
What?

420
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,200
I think we should go back to our
table, the momentum is not right.

421
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,250
Let's go, get up.

422
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,720
N'Thum, sit here with me.

423
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,010
Looks like the atmosphere is not good.

424
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,930
Anyway, thank you
for the money kha, Auntie.

425
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,600
Hurry up, Max. Let's go.

426
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,750
I'm spending money on a sissy?!

427
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,010
Oh dear!

428
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,170
Cheer up.

429
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,100
As the saying goes,
desire blinds the eyes.

430
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,050
To the point of not
realizing that he's a sissy.

431
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,660
What do you want?

432
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,300
You know that in your heart.

433
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,530
You want to open a
fight table with me, right?

434
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,750
Sure.

435
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,470
Wanna duel like we did the other day?

436
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,600
That's enough!

437
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,440
No need to have any duel today.

438
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,420
Just have chill drinking.

439
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,720
Ai'Mai, let's switch places.

440
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,430
Why do you want to switch places?

441
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,630
If I let you sit next to Ai'Mai,
you'll have a duel again.

442
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Someone might
die if you're not taking easy.

443
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,830
We won't fight,
just let him sit here is good.

444
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,360
Right?

445
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,900
It's good, right?

446
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,430
That's right.

447
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,430
Sit like this is better.

448
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,930
Am I right, N'Kawee?

449
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,140
Yes.

450
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,710
Sit like this is better.

451
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,040
So we can see
each others' face clearly.

452
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,110
Am I right, P'Tonmai?

453
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,040
Yes.

454
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,260
How much did I just spent?

455
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,610
So many.

456
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,120
Do you want me to
send you home, N'Kawee?

457
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,990
I mean...

458
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,790
do you want me and
Ai'Mai send you home?

459
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,520
It's alright, you guys go ahead.

460
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,400
I want to have
someone send me home.

461
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,070
I feel so dizzy here.

462
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,750
Ai'Phupha, let's go home.

463
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,890
I'm sleepy.

464
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,000
Let's go.

465
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,080
Why are you standing there?

466
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,060
Then, I'll take my leave.

467
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,090
- P'Kawee
- What?

468
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,320
Those two...

469
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,520
didn't hear what I said?

470
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,840
Maybe.

471
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,790
But you said it quite loud.

472
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:13,180
Are you saying that they only
gonna send you home, is that is?

473
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,100
But I think P'Phupha likes you for sure.

474
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,820
You must tell P'Paew about this.

475
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,170
What are you talking about?

476
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,740
I'm saying according
to what I've seen.

477
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,660
He was so jealous
in the bar just now.

478
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,240
He even wants to send you home.

479
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,210
He starts to have
heart for you for sure.

480
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,450
He starts to like you for sure.

481
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,120
You need to get closer to him.

482
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,080
I guarantee that he'll fall for you.

483
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,170
You're such a beauty.

484
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,090
What now?!

485
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,530
I forgot that I'm heartbroken.

486
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,040
My tears are out when I talk.

487
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,420
I'm sad.

488
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,960
I'm heartbroken.

489
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,160
You two brothers
are really the same.

490
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:00,870
Let's go home!

491
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,940
I don't want to.
I want to drink some more.

492
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,420
Let's go home!

493
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,920
OK.

494
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,660
Ai'Tai.

495
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,530
Wake up.

496
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,690
Wake up...

497
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,180
Don't disturb me, I want to sleep.

498
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,260
You can't sleep here. Get up.

499
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,830
Don't disturb me,
I'm sleeping here.

500
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,190
- Get up.
- What's your problem?

501
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,140
Stand still.

502
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,560
What's your problem?

503
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,390
What are you doing?

504
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,270
What's your problem?

505
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,270
Ai'Tai!

506
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,190
What's on my leg?

507
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,250
Ai'Tai, don't look!

508
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,370
Close your eyes.

509
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,250
What's your problem?

510
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,880
What are you smiling at?

511
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,860
Well...

512
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,040
because I saw...

513
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,530
Stop taling.

514
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,830
Why are you shy?

515
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,350
We both have the same thing.

516
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,460
And I've used to seeing yours.

517
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,420
You've used to it?

518
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,940
How?

519
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,480
Well...

520
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,390
When I come in
here in the morning.

521
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,450
I woke you up.

522
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,090
But you didn't wake up.

523
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,400
So I...

524
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,180
So I remove your blanket.

525
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,120
Who would've thought that you
didn't wear any clothes sleeping.

526
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,160
You're saluting the flag
every morning, aren't you?
<i>[ It's a slang for men having an erection ]</i>

527
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:17,810
You've seen mine all the time?

528
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,560
You...

529
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,180
No need to be shy.

530
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,580
If...

531
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,370
you want to see mine as
a recompense, you can.

532
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,980
Mine might be bigger than yours.

533
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:39,880
Do you know?

534
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,160
I'm not going to!

535
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,970
Shut up!

536
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,390
Sober now?

537
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,350
Shy?

538
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,360
You're taking all the blanket.

539
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,920
Shut up, just sleep.

540
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,560
If you wanna see mine as
recompense, just let me know.

541
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,570
Shut up!

542
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,600
My heart was shaking again.

543
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,240
Why did you do this to me?

544
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,860
Do you like me...

545
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,610
or what exactly?

546
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,050
But wait.

547
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,300
Did you forget about
your lover that quick?

548
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,410
Your lover went overseas.

549
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,210
P.

550
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,850
Did you get over people that easily?

551
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,580
Or what you're doing...

552
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,110
you're not give
any thoughts about it?

553
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,710
It's just me...

554
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,480
who are in fault.

555
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,120
To like someone who
already has someone else.

556
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,590
This can't happen, Kawee.

557
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,180
I can't let it happen.

558
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,930
Endure this for the cafe.

559
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,080
Do it for the cafe.

560
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,830
Do it for the cafe.

561
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,900
Do it for the cafe!

562
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,740
Are you hitting on Kawee too?

563
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,870
I'm sure to call it a hit on...

564
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,210
but it might be close.

565
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,940
Now that you've mentioned it...

566
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,530
it's itchy over here.

567
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,020
Scratch it for me.

568
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,340
I don't know what you're stressing about
and what  problem you're facing.

569
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
If you're only siting here and sigh...

570
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,610
it's not gonna help
you with your problem.

571
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,100
We all have our problem.

572
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:18,820
It's up to you...

573
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,360
on whether you want to solve the
problem or avoid the problem.

574
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,660
I'm coming.

575
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,230
What's the rush?

576
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,410
Get in the car.

577
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,080
What for? Today is a weekend.

578
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,290
I don't work today.

579
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,600
I said get in the car. Get in nicely.

580
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,690
Fine.

581
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,200
You're not getting in, right?

582
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,330
If you don't want to get hurt...

583
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,120
get in the car.

584
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,230
Alright.

585
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,850
Fine.

586
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,730
- What is this?
- Follow me.

587
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,210
Sit!

588
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,800
I said sit, Uncle.

589
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,880
Wait for a moment.

590
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,760
That's enough.

591
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,240
Are you crazy?

592
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,590
You took me here...

593
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,870
then kicking that sandbags
without saying a word.

594
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,500
Why did you bring me here?

595
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,200
I'm pissed.

596
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,110
I just want someone to be with me.

597
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,110
Hold on, you want someone to be
with you but you're talking with?

598
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,150
Why it has to be me?

599
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,210
I don't know.

600
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,610
I just feel that
when you're with me...

601
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,660
it feels warm.

602
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,420
It's like having an
elder relatives perhaps.

603
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,980
You brat.

604
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,370
I told you that I'm not that old.

605
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,220
Just "P" will do I think.

606
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,210
I will call you "Uncle",
do you have a problem with it?

607
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,670
Do as you please.

608
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,610
By the way, what's pissing you off?

609
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,100
Alright.

610
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,800
I kow now.

611
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,760
You're frustrating about the person
you have a crush on, right?

612
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,770
Are you a seer?
You know this well?

613
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,310
Honestly, a kid with no job...

614
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,240
who spend all day hanging around like you
won't have anything much to frustrated you.

615
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,190
Are you insulting me?

616
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
No.

617
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,270
I'm not.

618
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,530
So what's up?

619
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,880
Your crush got closer or...

620
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,230
having something
with someone else?

621
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,420
Worst.

622
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,110
My crush thinks
that I like someone else.

623
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,870
Even helping me hit on that person.

624
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,860
Why does that person thinks that?

625
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,660
That's the thing,
I have no idea either.

626
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,790
I don't get it why
that person thinks that.

627
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,780
I'm gonna ask you frankly.

628
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,320
Your crush is probably...

629
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,570
beautiful and very cute, right?

630
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,020
That you're keeping it
inside and frustrated this bad.

631
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,320
Well...

632
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,850
If you ask whether
that person is cute or not...

633
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,450
probably not.

634
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,660
Is that person cute? Not really.

635
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,300
You're amazing.

636
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,730
You're not looking to
date because of looks.

637
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,920
That means you must be serious about
the girl you're having a crush on.

638
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,880
Yes, something like that.

639
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,740
Are you calm now?

640
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,920
If you're calm now then...

641
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,230
send me home.

642
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,170
It's the weekend,
I want to sleep.

643
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,620
Sleep?

644
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,710
Here, you can sleep here.

645
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,160
No need to go home.

646
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,750
Here, sleep here.
You're sleepy, right?

647
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,910
Hey, are you for real?

648
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,030
So are you gonna
let me sleep or not?

649
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,510
P'Phupha, please let
Kawee be a waiter here.

650
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,170
He's still jobless.

651
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,980
He wants to share the
living load with his brother.

652
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,720
He's orphan.

653
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,130
Please let him be a waiter here.

654
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,110
What are you doing?

655
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,200
Why are you crying?

656
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,450
I'm practicing my lines to ask P'Phupha
to accept you as a waiter at his cafe.

657
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,300
Does it have to be that extreme?

658
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,180
- Yes.
- Isn't that too exaggerated?

659
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,580
It has to.

660
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,130
It's not exaggerated.

661
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,180
Come on, let's hurry.

662
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,290
Hurry.

663
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,760
What are you looking for?

664
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,900
It's P'Win.

665
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,030
Today is a weekend.

666
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,200
Normally he's already
down here making lunch.

667
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,280
Let him rest, let's go.

668
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,470
Hurry up!

669
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,800
- Hurry up.
- OK, OK. Let's go.

670
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,580
Why are you knocking? Come in.

671
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,320
Jeed?

672
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,610
Sorry, I thought you were Ai'Tai.

673
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,190
Can I come in?

674
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,650
Sure.

675
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,030
I'm bringing you the lecture sheets.

676
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,730
I didn't get all of it the other
day and I happen to have a
speaking on stage tomorrow.

677
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,040
Thank you so much.

678
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,660

00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,600
<i>to a point of blindness.</i>

690
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,040

697
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,380

698
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,560
