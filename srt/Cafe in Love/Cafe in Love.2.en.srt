<i>Take it off? Take off what?</i>

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,430
<i>Your shirt.</i>

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,240
<i>You have to take
responsibility for it, Kawee.</i>

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,620
<i>Take it off and my
friend will wash it for you.</i>

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,900
<i>The male lead and the
female lead in a Thai drama...</i>

8

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,150
<i>Small world, unexpected.</i>

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,130
<i>Are you here to return my shirt?</i>

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,890
<i>Yes.</i>

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,510
<i>Where is the shirt?</i>

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,290
<i>What are you confounded about?
Give it back to him.</i>

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,730
<i>What are you confounded about?
Give it back to him.</i>

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,010
<i>The shirt's ruined.</i>

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,000
Why did you tell me
you were coming home?

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,210
So I can pick you up.

18
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,130
I want to come
back and surprise you.

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,500
Are you happy?

20
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,530
Good.

21
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,000
So will you be here long?

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,980
Well, maybe around 3-4 months.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,050
Good, that way
I'll be having a friend.

24
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,030
When I was away,
don't you have any friend?

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,580
Lonely?

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,740
It's not that.

27
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,560
By the way...

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,340
She(He)'s doing good.
<i>[ He says "kao" so I don't know
if he's referring to a he or she ]</i>

29
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,130
Still dating the same person.

30
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,670
What is this?

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,800
I haven't said anything.

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,840
I've been your friend for a long time.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,560
Why wouldn't I know
who you're asking about?

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
Don't you forget
about that person yet?

35
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,330
The person we love and like...

36
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,970
the time we take to
forget them is different.

37
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,730
Then let's have dinner this evening.

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,960
I'll pick you up
when you close the cafe.

39
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,160
OK?

40
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,070
But...

41
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,880
No rejection.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,040
We'll do this.

43
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,160
I'm leaving.

Hold on.

60
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,980
No.

61
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,180
I think I'm going to
do a new color for my hair.

62
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,140
I want to make it brighter.

63
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,900
Do you think it will suits me?

64
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:20,980

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Right?

66

If it doesn't suits you, dye it back.

67
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,070
Sorry, my friend
just got back from abroad.

68
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,700
- OK.
- It's all right.

69
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,990
So...

70
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,620
have you pick your menu?

71
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,760
What should I get?

72
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,740
Pick!

73
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,070
It's alright.

75
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,880
If you can't choose, then I'll
choose a menu for both of you.

76
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,710
Good idea.

77
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,010
Then we'll see if my chosen
menu matches your desire.

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,240
Wait for a moment.

79
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,250
Sure thing.

80
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,980
My friend here is good at waiting.

81
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,950
You're good at waiting?

82
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,420
Maybe.

83
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,640
Just like me.

84
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,430
I'm good at waiting too.

85
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,270
But I guarantee that today...

86
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,680
you won't have to wait long.

87
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,740
OK.

88
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,510
Hey.

89
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,690
What?

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,960
When he said he's good at waiting...

91
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,850
does he means about
him waiting for his lover?

92
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,240
I know, why are you emphasizing it?

93
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,190
I emphasize it to be sure
and make you try harder.

94
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,450
How about this?

95
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,340
Switch places with me.

96
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:12,280
So your eyes and
stare and lure him, hurry up.

97
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,260
OK, OK.

98
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,170
See?

99
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,970
It's here.

100
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,230
This is for P'Paew.

101
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,030
Here you go.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,230
And this is for N'Kawee.

103
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,040
- P'Phupha.
- Yes?

104
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,760
Why is there no heart in my cup?

105
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,420
Then I'll change one for you.

106
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,590
It's fine, I'm kidding.

107
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,430
So, aren't you gonna drink it, N'Kawee?

108
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,150
You've been staring at it too long.

109
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,720
I'll drink, I'll drink.

110
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,620
By the way...

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,130
why is it a heart shape?

112
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,550
I make a heart shape...

113
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,060
because I want you
to open up your heart.

114
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,190
My friend as always
been opening is heart.

115
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,060
But no one wants him.

116
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,930
Don't tell me you don't have a lover?

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,110
Still single?

118
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,700
He's single!

119
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,310
Very single.

120
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,450
I don't know if he's going
to keep his virginity until he
wins a lottery or something.

121
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,850
P'Phupha, why is there
no customer in the cafe?

122
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,880
I close the cafe today.

123
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,170
We thought it was open.

124
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,920
We can leave now.

125
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,680
It's alright, you can stay.

126
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,670
I was gonna to tell you
yesterday that I close the cafe.

127
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,870
But coincidentally you want to
come to give my shirt back.

128
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,760
So I didn't get to tell you on time.

129
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,810
But today, I had Ai'Kok to open the
cafe early and wait since the morning.

130
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,910
OK.

131
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,850
P'Phupa, can I go to the restroom?

132
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,000
It's like an army is about to burst in.

133
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,970
OK?

134
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,830
- P'Paew.
- Yes?

135
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,060
This way.

136
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,150
Can you hold my bag for me?

137
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,250
Is it that bad?

138
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,120
Kok!

139
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,880
P, what do you want?

140
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,480
I need to ask you something.

141
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,240
Ask me what?

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,700
I want to know what Phupa
likes to do, what he likes to eat,
where he likes to go and his faorite place.

143
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,490
P, that's a lot of questions.

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,510
I don't know which
I should answer first.

145
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,390
So...

146
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,350
why do you want to know?

147
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,020
Just tell me.

148
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,830
I don't know much either.

149
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,860
I'll tell you what I do know, OK?

150
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,440
Was it expensive?

151
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,060
Not really.

152
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,980
Next time, no need to buy a new one.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,260
I feel bad.

154
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,130
I have to buy a new one.

155
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,430
I'm not that irresponsible.

156
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,450
Actually I wasn't sure...

157
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,300
whether it'll fit you.

158
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,280
But the store said that if it doesn't,
I can come back and get a new one.

159
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,620
You didn't check with my old shirt?

160
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,140
I forgot.

161
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,270
But I think I pick the right size.

162
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,920
It'll fit you.

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,610
What are you doing?

164
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,800
Well, try out the shirt of course.

165
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,770
So I can know if the size is right or not.

166
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,450
OK, P'.

167
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,870
Let pick that up.

168
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,550
Hey, what are you doing?!

169
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,650
Pick up the shirt's bag.

170
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,500
Well...

171
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,870
I'm about to try out the
shirt he bought for recompense.

172
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,710
Really?

173
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,930
Why are you here so quick?

174
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,890
I'm too lazy to wait elsewhere.

175
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,250
So I figure I'd wait at your cafe.

176
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,000
Hurry and try it out.

177
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,870
I'm trying it here.

178
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,330
Why are you so pissed off about?

179
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,020
The weather is hot
that's why I'm a bit upset.

180
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,450
If you're hot then have a sit, buddy.

181
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,280
You're quite good at picking size.

182
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,980
It fits my size perfectly.

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,050
Krub.

184
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,840
Ai'Phu, you've tried it.
You can keep it now.

185
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,980
You're not changing
your clothes back?

186
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,050
No.

187
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,260
I better wear this one.

188
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,430
But it might be itchy.

189
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,610
I think...

190
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,190
the shirt hasn't been washed yet.

191
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,750
You're right.

192
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,910
Now that you've mentioned it...

193
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,470
it's itchy over here.

194
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,040
Scratch it for me.

195
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,370
A bit lower. OK.

196
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,400
So...

197
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,400
what are you laughing at?

198
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,900
You got tricked easily.

199
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,350
You tricked me?

200
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,890
You still have me siting here, buddy.

201
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,480
So today...

202
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,780
you don't have class?

203
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,180
It's late.

204
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,360
I've graduated.

205
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,620
You don't go to work?

206
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,060
I haven't start working yet,
still looking on what should I do.

207
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,850
Then...

208
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:29,050
I'll be heading home now.

209
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,490
So you guys can catch up.

210
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,750
Why the rush?
You can stay and talk with us.

211
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,630
Why are you holding him?

212
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,730
He has something to do.

213
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,230
I should be heading home now.

214
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,440
Sawasdee.

215
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,500
Why are you here?
You're not going to class?

216
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,570
The professor cancelled the class.

217
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,410
Really?

218
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,820
- Yes.
- Are you lying?

219
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,460
It's true,
the class was really cancelled.

220
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,970
- Are you sure?
- It's true.

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,880
I intend to come and pick you up.

222
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,910
Come pick me up?

223
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,740
Yes.

224
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,960
You talk like you have a ride.

225
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,800
You don't know yet?

226
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,770
A vespa?

227
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,460
Cool.

228
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,900
Was it expensive? I want one too.

229
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,990
No.

230
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,210
I bought it from a friend.

231
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,840
It had a great discount.

232
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,280
Bu I think you don't need to have one.

233
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,840
Because from now on,
I will be picking you up and drop you off.

234
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,490
What are you talking about?

235
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,290
I bought this bike specifically to
come pick you up and drop you off.

236
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,500
Hold this.

237
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,140
Safety first.

238
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,010
Come, I'll put it on you.

239
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,390
I can put it on myself.

240
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,910
Come on.

241
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,830
Don't be stubborn, come here.

242
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,080
Stay still.

243
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,350
Done.

244
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,380
Ready?

245
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,810
Ready.

246
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,140
So cool.

247
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,410
Of course.

248
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,660
Hold me tightly.

249
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:57,830
OK, P'.

250
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,580
- I'm going now.
- Let's go.

251
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,270
Don't, I can take it off myself.

252
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,920
Thank you so the ride, my friend.

253
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,340
Because from now on,
I will be picking you up and drop you off.

254
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,570
No need, it'll troubles you.

255
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,650
What troubling?

256
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,560
It's you that got
troubled because of me.

257
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,640
Ai'Tai.

258
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,370
You don't have to do this again.

259
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,330
It's not your fault.

260
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,520
I chose this.

261
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,790
So, from now on...

262
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,600
I will be picking you up and drop you off.

263
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,870
OK?

264
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm leaving.

265
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,520
Are you really sure that he'll be here?

266
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,100
I've done my research from Kok.

267
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,550
I'm sure.

268
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,030
What were you talking about?

269
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,170
Nothing, it's just that
we don't know where to start.

270
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,430
There's no staff here too.

271
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,670
Let me ask them.

272
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:43,820
Here, hold this for me.

273
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,850
OK.

274
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:50,270
Excuse me,
do you know where the boss here?

275
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:50,940
Come on.

276
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,770
Over there.

277
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,030
Thanks.

278
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,830
As the owner,
I have to put these stuff back.

279
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,690
Is this right?

280
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,970
I'm the boss and I
have so many employees.

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,640
Should have them pack these things.

282
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,300
Excuse me.

283
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,240
Yes?

284
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,850
I want to ask about...

285
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,050
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,460
Khun?

287
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,250
You...

288
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:31,800
didn't see it, right?

289
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,770
Fully with my two eyes.

290
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,600
You've seen my beloved "son", right?

291
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,500
But I didn't see for long,
only for a short moment.

292
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,930
But still, you've seen it.

293
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,090
You saw...

294
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,110
No!

295
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,010
Relax, Khun.

296
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,300
I have the same thing,
no need to be serious.

297
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,800
But if you're not OK, you can see mine.

298
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,520
No, no. Stop.

299
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,410
Why are you here anyway?

300
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,970
I'm here to ask about boxing.

301
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,930
OK.

302
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,700
Let's just...

303
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,930
don't tell anyone that you've seen...

304
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,840
you've seen my "son".

305
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,530
Sure thing.

306
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,150
Come, if you want to
learn boxing, come with me.

307
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,840
Here he is.

308
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,410
What should we do?

309
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,200
Go in.

310
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,060
Sorry.

311
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,490
I didn't know that
you also practice boxing here.

312
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,540
Normally I always came
here to practice boxing.

313
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,710
So, P'Paew and N'Kawee often
come to practice muay thai here?

314
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,020
Yes, my brother wants to
practice so he drag us both here.

315
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,680
But we don't know where he went to.

316
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,360
In that case, can you coach us in boxing?

317
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,390
Sure thing, I'm happy to.

318
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,560
How can you come in?

319
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,820
This!

320
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,610
I told them I
left my key in the room.

321
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,940
You're too much.

322
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,760
How so?

323
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,840
It's not that much.

324
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,590
I bought you some food.

325
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,950
Then, I'll serve them on plate.

326
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,990
Yeah, yeah.

327
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,490
Come.

328
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,400
Come.

329
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,950
You need to pay attention,
I'll only teach you once.

330
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,400
Then you practice at home.

331
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,610
OK. Come.

332
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,880
First, get into boxing position.

333
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,310
Raise your fists and bring
your arms close to your body.

334
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,050
Look straight ahead for protection.

335
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,660
OK, next is punching.

336
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,980
There are 6 forms of punches.

337
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,680
First is called the straight punch.

338
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,380
I'll demonstrate for you to see.

339
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,140
Punch forward and hard.

340
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,140
Yes.

341
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,960
Yes, OK.

342
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,490
Alright, now you punch my hand.

343
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,700
Ready?

344
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:44,920
Go.

345
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,520
Sorry, sorry.

346
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,110
Who told you to punch at full strength?

347
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,140
I didn't know.

348
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,340
You didn't exactly tell me to punch softly.

349
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,220
I really don't know what to say to you.

350
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,380
This is the second time
you did something to me.

351
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,920
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,340
Come, punch me back so we're even.

353
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,320
Are you sure you
want me to punch you back?

354
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,890
But, you'e seen...

355
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,030
my junior already.

356
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,340
So, are you gonna let me see yours?

357
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,680
So we're even?

358
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,540
You've seen mine too.

359
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,490
Come, for the punch.

360
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,610
Punch.

361
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,540
OK, you're sure?

362
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,230
OK, don't cry about it.

363
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,050
Sorry.

364
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,430
Are you alright?

365
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,440
Eat a lot.

366
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,140
These are all your favorite.

367
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,170
Really, I only see your favorite.

368
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,810
I want you to have
the same favorite as mine.

369
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,980
Hello.

370
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,660
Yes.

371
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,760
Why can't I come?

372
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,480
I thought we've talked about this.

373
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,310
If this continues...

374
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,100
I will move out and live on my own...

375
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,860
like I once told you.

376
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,120
Ai'Tai.

377
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,190
You don't have
to come to me after this.

378
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,380
You saw that every time you come...

379
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,600
you'll always quarrel with your mother.

380
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,110
We'd quarrel anyway
even if I don't come here.

381
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,960
You don't have to stop me!

382
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,180
Can you not be stubborn?!

383
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,030
I said don't come then don't.

384
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,170
I think you're...

385
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,490
not worried about
me quarreling with my mom.

386
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,150
But you...

387
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,430
don't want me to come to you, right?

388
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,070
Is there something wrong?

389
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,080
Paew is taking too long to get change.

390
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,210
I'm here!

391
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,300
Where did you find time to
find that extravagant outfit?

392
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,270
This is Paew's level.

393
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,300
A famous clothing store owner like me.

394
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,970
What do you think?

395
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,150
I was gonna say
that your outfit is very nice.

396
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,820
Thank you.

397
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,040
OK, before we start our boxing practice...

398
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,520
The first most important
thing is to learn to wrap our wrist.

399
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:39,010
It's for protection too, so we won't hurt
our wrist and fingers while practicing.

400
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,950
This is yours, P'Paew.

401
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,240
I chose a color
that I think suits you.

402
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,480
Thank you.

403
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,940
And...

404
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,130
this is yours, Kawee.

405
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,640
Hold out your hand.

406
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,400
Hold out your hand, Kawee.

407
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,400
P'Paew, try to do as I do.

408
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,550
You're not gonna do it for me?

409
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,750
It's better you do it yourself.

410
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,730
So you can do it the next time.

411
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,400
OK.

412
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,040
Starts from the wrist...

413
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,210
then wrapped around the palm

414
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,750
Like this.

415
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,720
Kawee...

416
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,670
why are you smiling?

417
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,860
I'm not smiling.

418
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,340
I'm not.

419
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,520
I saw you were smiling.

420
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,050
Just now.

421
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,430
I wasn't smiling, for real.

422
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,810
Continue wrapping my hand.

423
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,030
Alright, raise your hand a bit.

424
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,060
Clearly treating me like air.

425
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,060
<i>[ Meaning doesn't exist ]</i>

426
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,440
I can't.

427
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,150
Thank you for the ride.

428
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,970
How will you go to work tomorrow
with your hand hurts like that?

429
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,060
Taxi, of course.

430
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,980
What time will you go to work?

431
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,850
Around 6 AM, more or less.

432
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,810
OK, here's what we do.

433
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,300
Starting tomorrow moving forward...

434
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:53,240
I'll pick you up and give you a ride.

435
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,150
Until your hand heals.

436
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,500
No need.

437
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:58,070
I can go by myself.

438
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,070
Don't talk too much.

439
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,830
We'll do it like this, OK?

440
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:12,420
The posture when kicking...

441
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,190
let's start with kicking, OK?

442
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,500
Right foot support, right?

443
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,180
Put your left foot in front.

444
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,200
Raise your left hands.

445
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,810
When we kick,
we turn our left foot a bit.

446
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,760
Kick.

447
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,630
Try it.

448
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,480
If we swing our right hand,
it will help make it stronger.

449
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,450
Try.

450
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,470
Why am I here today?

451
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm here to help a friend.

452
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,960
What's wrong with me,
I'm talking to myself. I'm going crazy.

453
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,710
You can do it one more time.

454
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,760
OK.

455
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,800
I think that's OK,
try to add some hand waving.

456
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,240
Use the strength of the swing.

457
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,390
That's better, again.

458
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,000
Be more careful, Kawee.

459
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,350
Next time, I won't catch you.

460
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,970
OK.

461
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,180
Good at falling, good at stumble.

462
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,480
Good at taking opportunity.

463
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,970
So, would you like to try your left foot?

464
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,410
OK.

465
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,570
- Do it.
- I thik I'm gona fall again, P'.

466
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,760
Like that?

467
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,380
Then let's do the right side first.

468
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,010
Wait, Nong.

469
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,840
Here.

470
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,550
- OK, you can enter.
- OK.

471
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,340
Hello, where are you?

472
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,370
You're not coming?!

473
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,600
What about me?

474
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,920
All right. all right.

475
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,990
P'Kawee!

476
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,870
Sawasdee kha, P'Kawee.

477
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,700
Pew.

478
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,910
Yes, P'Paew send me here.

479
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,340
He made a merit and will
not go into a bar for a year.

480
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,010
I don't know what he wish for
with the merit, it might come true.

481
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,750
Don't make that expression, P'Kawee.

482
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,640
I will help you myself.

483
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,580
Because I know everything.

484
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:49,580
You knew all of it?!

485
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,990
Yes!

486
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,400
What's the confusion?

487
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,450
Hold on, see this.

488
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,890
His name is P'Phupa, right?

489
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,470
Yes.

490
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,780
I did my homework.

491
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,420
He's handsome.

492
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,430
Let's go and lure the guy.

493
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,950
Come, follow me.

494
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,130
Is he here yet?
- Not yet.

495
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,780
Why don't we see him?

496
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,320
Let's look around.

497
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,360
- I don't see him.
- I see a beautiful dress.

498
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,160
P'Kawee.

499
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,820
Why can't I see him?

500
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,550
I didn't see him either.

501
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,280
He's siting with his friend.

502
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,980
Isn't that P'Phupha's friend
named Mai-Mai something?

503
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,160
It's Tonmai.

504
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,540
Tonmai.

505
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,510
That big obstruction
that P'Peaw told me.

506
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,750
But it's alright,
we'll pretend to walk back
and forth so he'll say hello.

507
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,040
Come, let's go.

508
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,280
He didn't see us.

509
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,410
He didn't see.

510
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,830
Again.

511
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,210
Pew, was I hidden by you?

512
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,530
How's that relevant?

513
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,790
Let's try.

514
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,840
This time, walk slowly.

515
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,540
He didn't see us.

516
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,770
Come, one more time.

517
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,570
Why he didn't see us?

518
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,760
Yeah!

519
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,780
What should we do?

520
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,370
Let's do this, then.

521
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,460
P'Kawee!

522
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,710
Where should we sit?

523
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,780
He sees us now.

524
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,020
N'Kawee.

525
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:48,070
P'Phupha?

526
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,140
Didn't I'd see you here.

527
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,200
It's not weird, I'm regular in this bar.

528
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,370
So have you two got a seat yet?
Wanna sit here?

529
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,840
Good, very good.

530
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,370
Can I sit?

531
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,840
Thank you.

532
00:32:05,360 --> 00:34:17,020
<i>[Warning liquor can cause brawling and crime]</i>

533
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,010
I haven't formally introduced my friend yet.

534
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,480
This is my friend, Tonmai.
He just got back.

535
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,000
And this is N'Kawee.

536
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,440
And...

537
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,310
Pew, P'Paew's sister.

538
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,500
This is the kid who bought
you that shirt the other day.

539
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,250
Yes, you've met him.

540
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,780
He also went to your boxing gym today.

541
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,420
My boxing gym?

542
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,940
I didn't see you.

543
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,270
It's not that weird, buddy.

544
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,100
Even I didn't see you there today.

545
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,440
So, do you often come
to my gym to fight someone?

546
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,370
No.

547
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,250
I want to try it so I went there.

548
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,730
I didn't think I'd met P'Phupha there.

549
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,360
What a coincidence.

550
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,350
Like now, right?

551
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,490
Yes.

552
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,200
Very coincidence.

553
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,580
I was the one who
asked him to come here.

554
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,340
Didn't expect to see you guys here.

555
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,710
Where's P'Paew?

556
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,500
He won't enter a bar for a year

557
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,100
She made a merit.

558
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,570
My throat's dry.

559
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,230
Sure thing.

560
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,500
So...

561
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,340
is there something bothering you?

562
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,500
Nothing.

563
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm fine.

564
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,400
Come.

565
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,540
Let's cheers.

566
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,450
This one is really strong.

567
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,360
There is no liquor that's too strong.

568
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,140
Is your heart too soft?

569
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,990
You thought this through?

570
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,150
Then, please excuse
me to the restroom.

571
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,200
I'll be back.

572
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,740
Let's cheers.

573
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,020
Sure. You often come here, P'Pew?

574
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,120
Nong.

575
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:26,970
Yes?

576
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,030
I need to talk to you for a bit.

577
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,980
Sure.

578
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,800
Do you like my friend?

579
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,840
Why do you think that?

580
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,620
Based on what you're doing...

581
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,750
from bought him the shirt...

582
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,490
to the coincidental meetings.

583
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,700
I think it's surely suspicious.

584
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,840
What about you?

585
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,250
Do you like your own friend?

586
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,340
Ai'Tai.

587
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,610
Tai.

588
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,180
Ai'Tai, wake up.

589
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,050
Why are you sleeping here?

590
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,080
Get up, quick.

591
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,890
- What?
- Get up, now!

592
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,800
Get inside.

593
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,970
So, why were you sleeping
in front of my room?

594
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,370
I don't want to go home.

595
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,810
I'm lazy to argue with my mom.

596
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,340
Then why didn't you come and
sleep in the room properly?

597
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,130
You said...

598
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,060
that you don't
want me to come to you.

599
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,300
So I didn't dare to enter.

600
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,580
What's wrong with you?

601
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,480
Normally, no matter how I
chase you away, you still come.

602
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,300
You're scared now?

603
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,620
Because you were serious yesterday.

604
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,790
So I was scared.

605
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,170
So are you going to work?

606
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll give you a ride.

607
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
No! Go to sleep.

608
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,320
Why?

609
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,840
Worried about me?

610
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,480
No.

611
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,590
In that case, I'll give you a ride.

612
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,530
But can I shower first?
My body is so sticky.

613
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,810
Also, your shirt...

614
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,540
can I borrow one?

615
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,860
And you...

616
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,900
wait for me here.

617
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,740
If I get and don't see you...

618
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,440
you'll be sorry.

619
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,270
What's his problem?

620
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,930
Why are you so late?

621
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,570
You said more or less 6 AM.

622
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,680
I told you not to come pick me up.

623
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,000
Are you saying it's my fault?

624
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:23,850
Fine, I'm sorry.

625
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,770
Hurry and get in the car,
or you'll be late.

626
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,480
But we go with my car.

627
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,290
No talk, no rejection.

628
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,670
Let's get going or you'll be late.

629
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,910
What are you staring at?

630
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,030
You're not working?

631
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,110
Well, I don't have any work to do.

632
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,070
Then why don't you find a job?

633
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,720
I'm lazy.

634
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,850
Tell me the way.

635
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:21,630
Just drive straight.

636
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,550
What are you laughing at?

637
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,220
No.

638
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,500
I'm not laughing.

639
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,720
I think...

640
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:37,080
you are younger than me.

641
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,090
So what?

642
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,730
In that case, you'll have to call me "P".

643
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,730
No.

644
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,670
Up to you then.

645
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,790
Thank you so much.

646
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,400
In that case,
I'll go back and sleep now.

647
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,950
I'll pick you up when you finish work.

648
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,800
Are you going back
to sleep at your house?

649
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,290
Your room.

650
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,860
Why aren't you going home?

651
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,420
I want to sleep in your room.

652
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:32,210
Why? Can't I?

653
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,890
Fine, up to you.

654
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,830
I forbid you, you'll go anyway.

655
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,300
- I'm leaving.
- Yeah.

656
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,710
See you.

657
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,810
P'Phupha?

658
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,430
<i>Just order what you want,
it'll be my treat.</i>

00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,060

661
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,620
<i>I can't have dinner with you.</i>

662
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,910

663
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,290
<i>No, I want to eat at your house.</i>

00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,840
<i>You uncle.</i>

666
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,310
<i>You're calling me "uncle"?</i>

667
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,510
<i>You can just call me "P".</i>

668
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,290
