A bit headache.

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,600
Come, let me get that.

No.

72
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,740
OK.

73
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,350
Come.

He doesn't read nor reply.

84
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,830
A hot milk.

85
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,950
It's so hot!

86
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,640
I told you it's a hot milk.

87
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,840
Why aren't you careful

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,610

89
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,420
I can blow it myself.

90

You're sick, just sit still.

91
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,790

00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,310
don't talk too much.

93
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,560

94

98
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,900

Yes?

103
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,820
Staring at me like this,
am I caught that I pretend to get sick?

104
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,980
No!

105
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,180
Your cheeks are so red.

106
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,010
Your body is so hot too.

107
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,590
I think you should drink this hot
milk quick so you'll get better.

108
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,610
Then you can get some rest.

109
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,160
OK.

110
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,120
Kawee.

111
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,820
I think...

112
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,510
you should sleep here.

113
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,040
That won't be necessary.

114
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:05,610
I...

115
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,970
OK, OK, OK.

116
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,940
It's alright. Then...

117
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,630
I'll give you a ride home.

118
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,220
I don't think that's a good idea.

119
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,460
You'll take my car
and send me home, right?

120
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,150
Then it'll be difficult for
you to come back home.

121
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,050
What should we do then?

122
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,710
You don't want
to sleep at my house...

123
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,150
I do!

124
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,120
I mean...

125
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,110
I want to rest.

126
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,050
And I have a headache.

127
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,940
OK.

128
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,420
Then, after you finished
drinking the hot milk...

129
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,990
I'll take you to bed.

130
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,490
It's finished.

131
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,400
It's not hot?

132
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,800
It is!

133
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,410
What are you gonna do?

134
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,370
I'm going to carry you to bed.

135
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,770
You're sick, you might fall.

136
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,500
Or you're fine now?

137
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm not.

138
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,190
I'm having another headache.

139
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,610
Carry me.

140
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,440
Alright, alright, alright.

141
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,160
Let's go.

142
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,490
Don't forget your phone.

143
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,340
Let's go.

144
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,190
Wake up.

145
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,850
Wake up!

146
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,110
You're gonna sleep like this, are you?

147
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,570
Fine.

148
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,600
Tonmai!

149
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,100
Tonmai!

150
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,530
Ai'Tonmai!

151
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,510
You troublemaker.

152
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,670
You're gonna sleep like this, are you?

153
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,730
Fine.

154
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,490
Take off your shirt and pants.

155
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,220
What are you gonna do?

156
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,830
I said take off your shirt and pants.

157
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,680
Shirt and pants?

158
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,440
You're unwell, right?

159
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,520
I'm gonna give you a wet towel bath.

160
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,400
I'm gonna wipe your
body so it'll cold down.

161
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,710
It's fine, I can do it on my own.

162
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,700
No way, I'm worried.

163
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,130
I'll do it.

164
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,110
Do I have to take my clothes
off in front of P'Phupha?

165
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,200
My heart's beating so fast.

166
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,100
If he can't control himself...

167
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,550
what's gonna happen?

168
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,170
I never done it before.

169
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,090
Take your shirt and pants.

170
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,180
Kawee.

171
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,880
Are you gonna
take them off or not?

172
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,310
Yes!

173
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,120
I'll take it off now!

174
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,200
That's too rush.

175
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,060
That's fast.

176
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,600
If it's too hot or too cold, let me know.

177
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,730
Handsome, nice and warm.

178
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,820
How am I not falling in love?

179
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,860
That should be enough.

180
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:39,370
That's enough.

181
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,550
I think...

182
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,390
you should do it for
yourself for that part.

183
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,310
Which part?

184
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,030
OK, sure.

185
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,960
But...

186
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,000
You need to look away first.

187
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,850
Look away.

188
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,510
And...

189
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,400
don't look back.

190
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,050
OK.

191
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,060
Are you done?

192
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,080
Almost.

193
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,170
All done.

194
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,740
Did you wipe it clean?

195
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,840
It's clean.

196
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,930
Really?

197
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,710
Should I take a look again?

198
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,200
No need, I...

199
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,220
I think it's more than enough.

200
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,720
OK, then...

201
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,770
Give me the towel, I'll put it away.

202
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,660
But...

203
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,950
I've wipe it already.

204
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,710
It's alright.

205
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,950
I don't mind.

206
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,110
Then...

207
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,550
Take a rest, OK?

208
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,110
Call me if you need anything.

209
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,390
OK.

210
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,100
A delicious porridge...

211
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,250
Can't sleep?

212
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,810
I can't sleep.

213
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,010
What's wrong?

214
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,450
Stress?

215
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,190
Or...

216
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,470
are you still thinking
about me and Jeed?

217
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,700
Are you crazy?

218
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,820
Why would I think about it?

219
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,630
I told you, didn't you?

220
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,970
That if you two kissed...

221
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,430
I won't be angry.

222
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,470
But your face says otherwise.

223
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,200
Are you forcing me to get angry?

224
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,660
If you're angry at me...

225
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,820
I'll coax you.

226
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,520
Aren't you tired...

227
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,270
or get annoyed?

228
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,470
If it's you...

229
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,700
I'm not tired...

230
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,730
nor annoyed.

231
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,310
I'm good at coaxing too.

232
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,710
If you wanna smile, just smile.

233
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,240
What smile?

234
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,340
Who's smiling?

235
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,920
You're imagining things.

236
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,710
Ai'Tai.

237
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,830
You're my only friend.

238
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,320
If I don't coax you...

239
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,710
who else should I be coaxing?

240
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,040
You make me feel that
I'm not alone in this world.

241
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,720
Thank you so much.

242
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,520
I'm sleepy.

243
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,120
I should go to bed.

244
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,360
What are you doing?

245
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,810
I'm gonna carry you to
bed like you're drunk.

246
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:36,800
Let's go.

247
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,100
If you can...

248
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,230
then do it.

249
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,170
Ai'Kok!

250
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,530
Ai'Kok!

251
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,620
Get up now.

252
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,680
You want me to "get up"?
<i>[ "Look/get up" also means get erection ]</i>

253
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,050
Yes, get up.

254
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,670
The pose is just right.

255
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,360
I didn't mean that.

256
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,650
I mean you get off of me.

257
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,980
Not to "get up" on me.

258
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,300
- Is that so?
- Yes!

259
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,110
I thought you want me to...

260
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,880
Ai'Kok, shut it.

261
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,240
Hurry up and get up.

262
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,950
Let me sleep for a bit.

263
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,410
It's nice.

264
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,870
OK?

265
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,090
Fine.

266
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,900
Whatever you want.

267
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,940
You're not stopping me.

268
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,280
You like it?

269
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,000
Like what?

270
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,140
Let me go.

271
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,280
Drive me away...

272
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,290
but you told me to
"get up" last night.

273
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,550
I mean, get off of me.

274
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,800
But you should
take a shower now.

275
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,480
I'm gonna buy some breakfast.

276
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,090
It's warm.

277
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,740
Can't I hug you for a bit?

278
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,040
That's enough, get up.

279
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,250
Let me go.

280
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,970
All right, fine.

281
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,070
Hurry and buy some food, OK?

282
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,990
Don't smile blindly.

283
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,760
What smiling?

284
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm getting up to buy food now.

285
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:32,270
Is he really not gonna wake up?

286
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,830
Tonmai.

287
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,610
Tonmai, wake up.

288
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,370
Tonmai!

289
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,790
Wake up.

290
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,470
How did I ended on top of you?

291
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,770
You're so drunk
that you don't remember?

292
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,990
You really don't remember?

293
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,430
I remember.

294
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,620
You really do?

295
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,810
I remember went for
a drink with you at the bar.

296
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,700
After that,
I don't remember anything.

297
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,810
But my face is so numb today.

298
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,410
Why is my mouth is so painful?

299
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:18,720
You...

300
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,230
you fell and hit the door. Then...

301
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,930
I tried to hold you
but your hand slipped.

302
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,200
Then you fell and
your mouth hit the door.

303
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,000
Really?

304
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,030
I think it hurts like being punched.

305
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,010
What punched? Who punched you?

306
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,350
Are you crazy?!

307
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,820
Go and take a shower.

308
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,090
Why don't you shower first?

309
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,420
I'm gonna prepare
breakfast fist then shower.

310
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,820
If you're not gonna shower then...

311
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,080
go have breakfast like that,
no need to shower.

312
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,610
You're trying to spin your word.

313
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,330
You're awake?

314
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,250
Yes, I'm awake.

315
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,070
The aircond in my room is cold, right?

316
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,930
Yes, it's very cold.

317
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:41,030
Then it's not weird...

318
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,460
that you were hugging me.

319
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,270
Kawee.

320
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,330
Look at me and talk to me, quick.

321
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,260
I'm not angry.

322
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,840
With my aircond too cold like this...

323
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,360
it's not weird for you to hug me.

324
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,890
Don't think too much.

325
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,680
Kawee.

326
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,480
Yes.

327
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,850
You always making that
funny face at me again.

328
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,760
Go shower.

329
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,860
I've prepared your clothes.

330
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,270
OK.

331
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,020
Thank you.

332
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,150
Kawee.

333
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,150
Yes.

334
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,800
Hugging me...

335
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,260
was it warm?

336
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,470
That's the mirror.

337
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,250
My hair is a mess.

338
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,580
Tai, we're waiting for you.

339
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,250
I've bought sushi for Kok.

340
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,340
As a thank you for
buying me coffee yesterday.

341
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,610
What did you bought for me?
Let me take a look.

342
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,420
I think you should
put this away for now.

343
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,520
I've already
bought a lot of sushi.

344
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,660
Am I right, Tai?

345
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,060
You can eat what
Jeed bought you first.

346
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,850
Mine...

347
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,630
you can eat it...

348
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,840
in the evening.

349
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,170
Come, let's eat.

350
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,440
But I...

351
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,230
want to eat what
Tai has bought too.

352
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,950
Can I take a look?

353
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,720
But I think...

354
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,860
There's only my favorite food here.

355
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,750
You really know me.

356
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,760
Then...

357
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,540
I'm gonna eat them at the cafe later.

358
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,040
OK?

359
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,470
OK.

360
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,040
Thank you my beloved friend.

361
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,820
Are you not hurry to class?

362
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,940
You'll be late.

363
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,570
Ai'Tai has an afternoon class.

364
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,940
Come, let's eat. I'm hungry.

365
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,790
You're not eating?

366
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,160
I'm waiting for you.

367
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,030
Why?

368
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,880
Because I want to eat with you.

369
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,170
Fine.

370
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:55,430
I made a boil rice because your
mouth's hurt so you can eat easily.

371
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,540
I hurt my mouth because of you, right?

372
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,010
Why do you ask? Why me?

373
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,920
I didn't do anything.

374
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,800
You're taking like you're guilty.

375
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,560
Who's guilty?

376
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,060
No.

377
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,790
I didn't do anything to you.

378
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,270
Right.

379
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,980
You just didn't catch me properly...

380
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,690
I slipped and hit
my mouth on the door.

381
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,260
It hurts.

382
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,510
It's good enough that I
brought you to my house.

383
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,470
If you didn't bring me home...

384
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,510
you gonna get some from me.

385
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,000
What doesn't that mean?

386
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:38,570
If you want to know...

387
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,470
try to leave me next time.

388
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,040
You'll know what you'll get.

389
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,170
Nonsense, eat up.

390
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,940
Troublemaker kid.

391
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,100
My hand doesn't hurt anymore.

392
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
You don't need to
pick me up anymore.

393
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,940
I said you don't need
to pic me up anymore.

394
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,340
No way, I will pick up
and give you a ride as usual.

395
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,770
But my hand doesn't hurt anymore.

396
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,230
Why do you still wanna pick me up?

397
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,730
Then, please excuse me.

398
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,080
Also...

399
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,560
thank you for last night.

400
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,770
And...

401
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,110
for the breakfast.

402
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,370
Let's just say...

403
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,200
I'll pick you up tomorrow as usual.

404
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,850
Hey, I told I'll drive on my own.

405
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,740
If you don't allow me to pick you
up and give you a ride as usual...

406
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,270
I'll say it that you...

407
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,180
will face the same thing as last night.

408
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,570
No.

409
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,460
More than last night.

410
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,640
Anyway, see you tomorrow.

411
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,110
Uncle.

412
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,290
Face the same thing as last night.

413
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,800
That means...

414
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,500
I can't take it anymore.

415
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,150
Why is he so cool
just by wiping his hair?

416
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,500
Ai'Kawee, look away.

417
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,830
Don't stare!

418
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,360
Don't stare!

419
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,420
Is there something stuck on my hair?

420
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,290
Kawee?

421
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,160
Yes?

422
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,740
What was that?

423
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,200
I asked, is there
anything stuck on my hair?

424
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,050
Or...

425
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,810
I didn't wash my
body clean enough?

426
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,190
It's clean.

427
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:50,910
Clean all over.

428
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,770
From head to toe.

429
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,840
Then why were you
staring at me like that?

430
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,050
I...

431
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,980
I was staring at your towel.

432
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,440
I assume it's good.

433
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,040
Just wipe it for a short
while and gets dried instantly.

434
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,330
I...

435
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,870
want to know...

436
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,480
where did you buy it and...

437
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,020
what brand is it?

438
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,910
Calm down.

439
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,630
If you like...

440
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:23,420
my towel that much...

441
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,240
I'll take you to buy it.

442
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,400
OK. Thank you.

443
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,710
Then I'm gonna wait outside.

444
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,210
Can you help me...

445
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,190
blow my hair first?

446
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:39,120
Blow your hair?

447
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:39,900
Well...

448
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,640
I...

449
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,030
hurt my arm so bad.
I have no idea who slept on my arm.

450
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,770
Also, it's...

451
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,340
It's numb all over,
I don't think I can blow my hair.

452
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,210
OK, OK, OK, then I'll...

453
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,570
I'll blow it for you.

454
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,390
Listen to me

455
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,830
I probably said it many times

456
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:19,580
There was a time
that you're close to me

457
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,120
It's my dream life

458
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:30,010
The past days and nights

459
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,070
Perhaps it's a confused memory

460
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,000
Not everything is clear

461
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,710
You don't need to help me.

462
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,800
You can go home and
prepare for your class.

463
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,110
I want to help.

464
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,250
Why?

465
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,840
Can't I?

466
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,090
I told you...

467
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,970
that you don't need to feel guilty.

468
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,580
I know.

469
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,350
But if you want me to feel nothing...

470
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,460
it's not possible, right?

471
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,750
Plus, today...

472
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,630
the reason I'm helping you...

473
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,280
is not because I feel guilty.

474
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,670
But I'm helping because
I really want to help you.

475
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,820
You came to me...

476
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,560
how did you tell your family?

477
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,690
I told them that...

478
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,120
it's busy lately.

479
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,760
So I need to
stay with a friend often.

480
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,490
Sawasdee krub, P'Phupha.

481
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,640
Sawasdee krub.

482
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,560
Since when I have a new helper?

483
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,230
My friend wants to help out.

484
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,470
He'll go home soon.

485
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:58,620
He has an afternoon class.

486
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,710
Then have something
to eat before you go.

487
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,100
I just bought it on the way here.

488
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,720
We've eaten.

489
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,030
Thank you.

490
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,870
OK, then...

491
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,340
please organize the cafe.

492
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,160
- OK.
- Thank you.

493
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,960
This evening...

494
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,500
I'll pick you up.

495
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,900
Because I have to have breakfast
at home tomorrow morning.

496
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,020
And I have to sleep at home.

497
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,910
Because I've already
stayed with for many nights.

498
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,990
Good.

499
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,150
If your family catches you,
it'll be trouble.

500
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:35,930
Good?

501
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,760
Hold on.

502
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,400
What does that mean?

503
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,780
Or are you gonna
bring Jeed to stay with you...

504
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,820
Then...

505
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,270
having a sweet time together.

506
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:50,970
That's right.

507
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,820
The hell it is!

508
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,160
I've told you...

509
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,820
that Jeed and I are friends.
Not more than that.

510
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,020
You're not but she does.

511
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,510
What are you complaining?

512
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,200
Nothing!

513
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,120
Here.

514
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:09,960
It's done.

515
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,890
In that case, I have to go now.

516
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:15,230
And you...

517
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,570
Work diligently, my friend.

518
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,380
Don't flirt with girls.

519
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,730
Because whenever you do...

520
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:24,190
and...

521
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,600
P'Phupha find out...

522
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,670
you'll get fired.

523
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,680
OK, my dear friend.

524
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,050
- Don't do it.
- OK.

525
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,410
- I'm leaving now.
- Yes, go.

526
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,360
Come here, sit here.

527
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,730
What's your problem?

528
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,750
Before you tell me about last night,
I'm gonna ask you...

529
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,180
the shirt you're wearing, it's his, right?

530
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,040
That means, you got into his house...

531
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,350
Stop what you're thinking.

532
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,410
I'm not like you.

533
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,190
Only runs and force
yourself on men here and there.

534
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,710
So what?

535
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,590
Does he seems that
he has a heart for you?

536
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,890
What have heart?

537
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,800
It's just me...

538
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,230
who got naked alone.

539
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,050
Only you got naked?!

540
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,640
I was staring just at him...

541
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,110
while he was sleeping.

542
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,310
And...

543
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,710
he's so handsome.

544
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,070
He's even
handsome when sleeping.

545
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,400
So I keep staring at him.

546
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,200
That means you and him kissed...

547
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,520
Are you crazy?!

548
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,250
We didn't.

549
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,810
Just that my face
was very close to his.

550
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,010
Most importantly...

551
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,050
he wasn't sleeping.

552
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,670
He even asked me...

553
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,540
why was I staring at him.

554
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:53,890
What's your problem?

555
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,470
I'm not finish.

556
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,280
When I woke up in the morning...

557
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,470
I was hugging him so tightly.

558
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,050
To a point...

559
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,640
that I even put my face on his chest.

560
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,410
I really want to be you.

561
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,950
Think about it.

562
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,610
Strong and powerful chest muscles of his,
just thinking about it makes me so fin.

563
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,440
I'm stress here.

564
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,260
Can you let fantasize it for a bit?
He's so handsome.

565
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,210
By the way, did he said anything?

566
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,650
He didn't.

567
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,710
He surely knows that I like him.

568
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,800
What are you smiling at?

569
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,980
I'm stress here.

570
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,260
Think about it.

571
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,150
This means he...

572
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,890
has heart for you.

573
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,330
If he doesn't...

574
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,540
he'll kicked you off
the bed a long time ago.

575
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,230
This means,
he surely has heart for you.

576
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,200
He didn't even mind...

577
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,600
he didn't scold me.

578
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,440
He even speaks weirdly.

579
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,040
Like he's tricked...

580
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,920
or fooled me.

581
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,990
I don't know how to say it.

582
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,890
No way.

583
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,390
I needd to prepare a plan.

584
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,510
For you to be his waiter.

585
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,680
Tell me first.

586
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,550
What's your plan?

587
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,660
I'm gonna tell you.

588
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,200
You'll wait and see.

589
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,040
Your cafe...

590
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,520
will get back to prosper for sure!

591
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,300
Uncle, it's noon

592
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,160
Uncle, it's noon

593
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,160
Let's have lunch together

594
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,490
Uncle, it's noon

595
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:56,490
Let's have lunch together

596
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:09,920
Uncle, it's noon

597
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:09,920
Let's have lunch together

598
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,400
Uncle, it's noon

599
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,400
Let's have lunch together

600
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,400
See you at the park near your house

601
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,940
Uncle, it's noon

602
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,940
Let's have lunch together

603
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,940
See you at the park near your house

604
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,940
I'll wait for you

605
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,940
Uncle, it's noon

606
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,940
Let's have lunch together

607
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,940
See you at the park near your house

608
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,940
I'll wait for you

609
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,550
He'll be here.

610
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:46,020
Why am I getting nervous?

611
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,050
He probably won't come.

612
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,380
Damn it, Ai'Tonmai.

613
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,310
When faced something like that...

614
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,230
who would dare to meet up?

615
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,550
Hold it, hold it.

616
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,410
What now?

617
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,660
Is your plan gonna work?

618
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,150
Trust me.

619
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,260
Trust you?

620
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,510
Whenever I trusted you...

621
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:21,410
it always end badly.

622
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,570
All right.

623
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,140
Then I'll go home.

624
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,310
You're not gonna stop me?

625
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:30,870
I'll come back here
again on my own then.

626
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,510
Trust my plan.

627
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,750
Let's go.

628
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,980
Hurry.

629
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,710
Let's sit here.

630
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,410
N'Kok.

631
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,150
How are you? Tired?

632
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,990
No, I've just rested.

633
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,470
Don't you want
to go to the toilet?

634
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,040
No.

635
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,180
Paew.

636
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:12,730
What are you up to?

637
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,220
Why asked him like that?

638
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,520
Just sit still, let me handle this.

639
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,730
You guys not
gonna order any drinks?

640
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,750
I'll order later.
I think to think what I should order.

641
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:28,960
OK.

642
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,180
- What?
- Go order some coffee.

643
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:35,950
Then why are you not coming?

644
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,460
I'm gonna watch over Kok.

645
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,670
Go quick.

646
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,180
- Hurry up!
- All right, all right.

647
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,530
Sawasdee krub.

648
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,920
Sawasdee krub.

649
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,870
P'Phupha.

650
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,180
P'Phupha!

651
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,210
What?

652
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:02,210
I need to go to the toilet for a bit.

653
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,710
The usual, N'Kawee?

654
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,950
Yes.

655
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,880
Paew too.

656
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,090
I only remember yours.

657
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,030
I don't remember P'Paew's.

658
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,520
Paew's is a iced coco.

659
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,490
Iced coco.

660
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,330
Iced coco, OK?

661
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,880
Then...

662
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,580
you have a seat and wait first.

663
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,140
OK.

664
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,540
Will this work?

665
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,510
Kok, I'm sorry.

666
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,760
But for my friend's sake,
I have to do it.

667
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,860
Fuck it.

668
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,390
Just do it, Paew.

669
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:27,990
<i>What are you doing?</i>

670
00:42:28,020 --> 00:43:06,800
{\an9}<i>[Next Episode]</i>

671
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,720
<i>You've seen me without clothes.</i>

672
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,680
<i>You think you
can get away with it?</i>

673
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,330
<i>Uncle, wait.</i>

674
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,670
<i>Did you forget...</i>

675
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,890
<i>that we've actually seen
each others' since day one?</i>

676
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,470
<i>Why are you
embarrassed about?</i>

677
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,520
<i>How is your hand?
Is it hurt that bad?</i>

678
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,250
<i>It's better.</i>

679
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,230
<i>I took care of him.</i>

680
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,690
<i>Guys taking care of each
other without a girl present?</i>

681
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,970
<i>Girls more careful
and gentle anyway.</i>

682
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,210
<i>How was it?</i>

683
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,930
<i>Have you done
with your sweet moment?</i>

684
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,730
<i>That's crazy.</i>

685
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,140
<i>What are you saying?</i>

686
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,190
<i>You're putting your knees up.</i>

687
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,280
<i>That's good enough.</i>

688
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,800
