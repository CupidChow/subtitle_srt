when did you arrived in Thailand?

35
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,130
I arrived here today.

36
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,790
When I got here, I have to find you.

37
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,870
Why do you look
unhappy that I came here to you?

38
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,780
So...

39
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,020
what about your boyfriend?

40
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,750
Don't talk about him.

41
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,850
We...

42
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,520
parted ways.

43
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,930
So...

44
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
you came back,
do you have a place to stay yet?

45
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,580
Well, I actually came here to ask to
stay with you for the time being.

46
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,200
When I get a place to stay,
I'll move out.

47
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,530
You don't mind, right?

48
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,990
Why?

49
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,800
Do you have a girlfriend now?

50
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,610
No, Manfah.

51
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,120
I don't have a girlfriend yet.

52
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,660
Well...

53
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,110
If you want to stay here...

54
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,880
you can.

55
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,410
You're still single, so that means...

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,260
you still keep your promise
that you'll wait for me, right?

57
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,250
You must be tired.

58
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,250
Wanna get a shower and rest?

59
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,400
I'll prepare a room for you.

60
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,700
Phu.

62
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,410
is there anything you need?

63
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,430
Well...

64
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,740
I think I want to sleep in
the same room with you.

65
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,450
But...

66
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,180
I've prepared a room for you.

67
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,470
Phu...

68
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,610
you're acting like we
haven't sleep together before.

69
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,470
But it was a long time ago.

70
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,790
I think...

71
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,560
you better sleep I the
room I've prepared for you.

72
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,620
You've changed a lot.

73
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,540
I really can't forget about you.

74
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,090
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,160
What are you doing, Ai'Kok?

76
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,380
Let me go.

77
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,920
I thought you'd ever
come to see me again.

78
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,010
I called you many times
but you didn't pick up.

79
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,900
I went to alley of house
but you didn't come out.

80
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,980
I wasn't free.

81
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,840
I had to submit an assignment
to the professor yesterday.

82
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,780
But now...

83
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,200
let me go.

84
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,010
Are you sure that
you were doing assignment?

85
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,920
You're not mad at me, right?

86
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,400
No, what mad? No.

87
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,950
Then why are you avoiding my face?

88
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,810
You're definitely mad at me.

89
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,000
I said I'm not.

90
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,630
You can look away now.

91
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,750
No.

92
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,340
Until you admit...

93
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,690
that you're really mad at me.

94
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,540
So...

95
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,720
you...

96
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,660
want me to get mad at you, right?

97
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,320
No, my friend.

98
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,790
Go and take a shower.

99
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,250
OK.

100
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,800

104
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,180
so we go together, right?

105
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,970
Are you mking fun of me?

106
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,910
No, I was just...

107
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,560
saying what you said.

108
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,370
Go together...

109
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,440
the world will get a lot cooler.

110
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,580
Kawee...

111
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,020
you're not gonna stop
making fun of me, aren't you?

112
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,810
Let's get going, P.

113
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,510
I won't say anymore.

114
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,220
You're naughty.

115
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,450
I keep this in mind,
I'll get back at you later.

116
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,050
That's Ai'Phu's car.

117
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,830
Who is he picking up?

118
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,480
Or...

119
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,220
he's picking up Kawee?

120
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,300
What are you daydreaming about?

121
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,370
What were you daydreaming about?

122
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,120
What daydreaming? I wasn't.

123
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,630
I'm just missing someone.

124
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,360
Don't you wanna
ask who that person is?

125
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,370
No, I don't want to know.

126
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,980
You don't wanna know...

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,180
but I want to tell.

128
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,580
Right now...

129
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,870
I'm missing someone
who's much older than me.

130
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,060
This one old man.

131
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,000
You mean me?

132
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,480
You think I miss you?

133
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,440
No, I miss my father.

134
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,830
This brat.

135
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,350
Drive.

136
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,620
Closer.

137
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,450
Awesome.

138
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,020
Can you do a combine heart?

139
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,850
Is there any other pose, Kawee?

140
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,780
How about the
one that Paew suggested?

141
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,080
Is that a good idea?

142
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,040
We're out of pose now.

143
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,970
There's nothing to lose.

144
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,460
We'll try.

145
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,920
What is this, Tonmai?

146
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,940
I have no idea too.

147
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,490
Shocked?

148
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,490
What is this, P'Paew?

149
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,820
Are you sad?

150
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,480
No.

151
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,950
I'm very chilled.

152
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,320
So...

153
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,200
Why are those two doing that?

154
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,110
Because koo-jin is
very trendy right now.
<i>[ Koo-jin = imaginary couple ]</i>

155
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,750
This.

156
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,420
The coolest barista
and the cool waiter.

157
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,450
What is this craziness?

158
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,980
What crazy, bitch?

159
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,880
We're very open in this day of age.

160
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,740
Phu!

161
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,870
Can I talk to you?

162
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,090
Sure.

163
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,140
She's Ai'Phu's ex-girlfriend.

164
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,190
This is the person...

165
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,310
that he promised to
wait for her to come back.

166
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,620
Wait.

167
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,740
P'Phupha's ex is...

168
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,590
not a guy?

169
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,210
No.

170
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,930
What makes you think that?

171
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,910
Ponfah...

172
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,270
is the first girlfriend...

173
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,070
and the only girlfriend of Phupha.

174
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,160
Phupha loves her so much.

175
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,230
He made a promise...

176
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,680
that he'll wait for her to come back.

177
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,380
And he won't accept anyone.

178
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,010
Now that you know,
don't you feel jealous?

179
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,360
I think this question...

180
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,000
I should ask you.

181
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,910
Then I confess to you here...

182
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,060
that I...

183
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,090
already stop liking Phupha.

184
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,170
I have been persistent
for so many years...

185
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,850
before I realized it.

186
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,530
I find out that it's the kid
of liking that lovers have.

187
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,720
But now...

188
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,790
I have someone I really like.

189
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,620
You can call it love too.

190
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,640
Do you wanna know...

191
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,110
who that person is?

192
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,810
Even if you don't wanna know...

193
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,260
it's alright.

194
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,630
But I want to tell.

195
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,920
The person that I really like...

196
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,630
is...

197
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,950
your brother.

198
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,130
Don't think about stopping me.

199
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,830
Because I really want this person.

200
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,460
What is this, Phu?
What were you doing?

201
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,010
Taking photos.

202
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,700
What taking photos?

203
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,950
Why do you have to
hug a guy like that?

204
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,670
It doesn't mean anything.

205
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,930
Is this what you
mean waiting for me?

206
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,300
That's too much.

207
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,620
I took photos earlier...

208
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,730
because the customers ask for it.

209
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,640
So I give them that service.

210
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,960
They like it.

211
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,550
This will also increase sale.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,040
How can I not do it?

213
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,860
You really don't have
any feelings to that kid, right?

214
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,530
Don't forget about
your promise to wait for me.

215
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,100
Fah!

216
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,280
But it was years of torture.

217
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,590
If I want to forget...

218
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,070
I don't think it's a problem.

219
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,850
Phu...

220
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,900
But I'm back now.

221
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,470
If you forgot it then it's fine.

222
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,780
But from now on,
you can remember it.

223
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,960
Then...

224
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,690
you should get back to work.

225
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,780
All done.

226
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,280
Too many customers today, P.

227
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,070
There wasn't eve enough cake to sell.

228
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,460
Never thought that the koo-jin
trend got our cafe to sell this good.

229
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,810
Of course.

230
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,520
This is on a koo-jin.

231
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,080
If it's...

232
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,410
Paew!

233
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,760
I'm kidding, friend.

234
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,990
But I'm gonna be honest.

235
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,220
You two look matched together.

236
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,500
I even got blushed seeing
you guys taking pictures.

237
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,340
If it's a real couple...

238
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,560
I guarantee...

239
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,940
our cafe...

240
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,440
The sale will surely doubled.

241
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,620
There, your real one is here.

242
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,640
The cafe is closed?

243
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,360
Anyway today...

244
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,960
I have to thank...

245
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,410
N'Paew so much for helping.

246
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,830
More like it's forced.

247
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,000
Then I'll transfer you
the fee for your work.

248
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,790
N'Paew can send your account number
to Kawee and he can send it to me.

249
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,430
It's alright.

250
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:05,580
The coffee I drank
and the cake I ate today...

251
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,220
it's more than the
amount of work I did.

252
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,590
Are you gonna
chat for a long time?

253
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,020
I'm tired so if it's gonna
take log, I'll sit and wait.

254
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,480
It won't be long,
I'll be home soon.

255
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,610
But...

256
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,660
I'm gonna give
Kawee a ride home first.

257
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,860
It's alright.

258
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,720
I can go home with Paew.

259
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:35,690
No way.

260
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,370
I picked you up this morning.

261
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,830
So I have to send you back.

262
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:41,780
Phu.

263
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,660
He said he can go back o his own.

264
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,630
Besides, today...

265
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,450
you're going for a dinner
with me, did you forget?

266
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,060
Let's hurry. come on.

267
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,780
Hurry up, Phu.

268
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,420
Let's go.

269
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,690
Please excuse me.

270
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,220
I don't like Phupha's ex.

271
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,300
What about you, Kok?
Do you like her?

272
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,040
No.

273
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,960
She seems...

274
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,980
if she wants to be my girlfriend,
I won't want it.

275
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,190
She has this somewhat a scary face.

276
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,640
Besides...

277
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,390
she seems jealous of
P'Phupha and P'Kawee.

278
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,860
Absolutely.

279
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,140
Look at her
expression and her eyes.

280
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,140
Paew, Kok!

281
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,990
Let's get a drink.

282
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,760
What's it gonna be?
Are you coming or not?

283
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,360
Then I'll go by myself.

284
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,900
I...

285
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,330
can't enter a bar for a year.

286
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,650
I'll send Pew in my place.

287
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,060
Don't sulk at me and...

288
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,600
look, Kok is coming with you.

289
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,090
Right?

290
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,940
Yes.

291
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,210
I'm coming.

292
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,350
This night will be heavy for sure.

293
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,440
You seem to care
so much about that kid.

294
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,430
I was the one who
picked him up today.

295
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,320
If I don't send him home,
it's a little disgusting act.

296
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,470
Nothing more than that, right?

297
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,310
You said you're hungry, right?

298
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,470
Shall I cook
something delicious for you?

299
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,920
You're still as adorable as before.

300
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,140
Then...

301
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,010
you can wait here.

302
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,350
- Just a minute, OK?
- OK.

303
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,670
N'Pew.

304
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,170
Long time no see.

305
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,900
There must be something
good that got you here.

306
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,250
It might be something
bad on the contrary.

307
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,600
Introduction is in order.

308
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,620
This is P'Gawin,
P'Kawee's older brother.

309
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,640
And this is N'Kok,
a waiter at P'Phupha's cafe.

310
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,920
And N'Tai is...

311
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,360
a friend, I guess. Or...

312
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,040
a boyfriend, I wonder.

313
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,870
A friend!

314
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,860
Answer at the same time,
no suspicious at all.

315
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:49,290
Something's bothering you, P'Tonmai?

316
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,480
What's with that face?

317
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,110
Nothing.

318
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,350
What am I not satisfied about?

319
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,300
Good then.

320
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,500
Because if you're
not satisfied, I think I might...

321
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,610
N'Kawee.

322
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,590
I'm very happy.

323
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,260
Good that more
people here. More fun.

324
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,230
Nong.

325
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,730
I'll have four cups please.

326
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,790
What are you smiling at?

327
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,480
Nothing.

328
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,520
I just feel that you look weird.

329
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,670
Or you wanna
sit just the two of you?

330
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,830
Why does it have
to be just the two of  us?

331
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,360
Well...

332
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,390
Come, come.

333
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,350
Drinks are here.

334
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,010
Let's drink.

335
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,470
Let me take care of it.

336
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,320
I'll help.

337
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,320
OK.

338
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,970
What's the matter?

339
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,420
Nothing, P.

340
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,820
Just a little stress.

341
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,800
It looks more than that.

342
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,890
When you're ready to tell me,
then you can tell me.

343
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:06,290
Brothers hugging each others,
They're brothers.

344
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,490
I saw that.

345
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,100
I didn't say anything.

346
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,890
Here you go.

347
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,150
This is Kawee's.

348
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,540
Come.

349
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,150
I'll drink with you tonight.

350
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,640
He must be very stressed.

351
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,570
I understand.

352
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,570
How can you?

353
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,840
Well...

354
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,430
the feeling of
having a crush on someone...

355
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,820
One person seems to want
to give another person hope.

356
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,240
In the end, though...

357
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,150
they can only be brothers.

358
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,990
I think he...

359
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,000
has someone he likes.

360
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,210
What? What are you looking at?

361
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,470
You're like him?

362
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,690
What?

363
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,450
I just understand the feeling
of someone having a crush.

364
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,270
How torturous it is.

365
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,950
You talk too much, just drink.

366
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,980
P'Tonmai.

367
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,070
Are you not gonna stop P'Gawin?

368
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,930
What about you? Don't you
think about stopping N'Kawee?

369
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,080
Your cooking...

370
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,210
looks appetizing as usual.

371
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,860
By the way,
how about your feelings?

372
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,850
Is it still the same?

373
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,340
I think...

374
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,960
we should just eat, shall we?

375
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,240
I can tell by watching you cook.

376
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,840
I know that your feeling is the
same and haven't changed.

377
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:56,810
Right?

378
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,390
So...

379
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,290
How did it goes
on finding a condo today?

380
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,820
You talk like...

381
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,010
you don't want me to stay.

382
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,460
I didn't mean it like that.

383
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,020
Well...

384
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,780
you're a woman.

385
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,660
Staying in a man's house...

386
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,150
it doesn't look nice.

387
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,290
Excuses.

388
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,780
We're in this age now.

389
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,940
No one cares about this kind of stuff.

390
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,840
You don't want me here, just say it.

391
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,060
If you want to stay, I don't mid.

392
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm just afraid that
people will look badly at you.

393
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,800
The I'll stay.

394
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,920
I don't want to find a condo.

395
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,560
Please let me stay with you.

396
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,490
Up to you.

397
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,610
I don't want to eat anymore,
I'm gonna take a shower.

398
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,730
OK.

399
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,070
Uncle, you're drunk.

400
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,820
You have to go
to work tomorrow.

401
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,390
I can ask for a leave.

402
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,910
Give that to me.

403
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,020
I'm drinking with my brother.

404
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,270
Don't drink too
much or you'll get drunk.

405
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,520
You have to go to work.

406
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,380
I know, I only had a few cups.

407
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,750
I won't get drunk.

408
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,020
Why?

409
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,870
Why is there no one
worries about me like this?

410
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,740
This is so sad.

411
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,990
What are you doing?

412
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,240
Well...

413
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,880
To sleep with you.

414
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,800
I don't want to sleep alone.

415
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,830
Fah.

416
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,860
I think...

417
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,160
you should go back to your room.

418
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,440
Do you hate me that much that
you don't want to sleep with me?

419
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,260
I don't hate.

420
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,770
Don't hate, then why you
won't let me sleep with you?

421
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,410
Yes, Mai?

422
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,970
What's up?

423
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,810
Wasted?

424
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,450
OK, OK, OK.

425
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,580
What's wrong with Tonmai?

426
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,040
Tonmai told me
that Kawee is wasted.

427
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,500
I have to take him home.

428
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,590
I won't let you.

429
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,990
Why?

430
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,250
Why do you give so
much importance to this kid?

431
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,460
Fah.

432
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,220
I give priority to all my employees.

433
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,550
But this is too much,
let Tonmai do it. Why it must be you?

434
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,850
Fah.

435
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,880
Tonmai has someone
else he has to take home.

436
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:16,760
Phu...

437
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,710
Fah!

438
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,420
I think we should
stop arguing about this.

439
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,240
If it is as you said, then good.

440
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,950
Whatever you wanna do,
don't forget your promise to me.

441
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,400
I went out of
my way to come home.

442
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,970
Tonmai...

443
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Stay calm.

444
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,310
Don't look.

445
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,890
Don't look.

446
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,150
Don't look.

447
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,210
Fuck it, we're already here.

448
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,820
I'll clear it up tomorrow.

449
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,070
Be mine, Uncle.

450
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,760
Kawee.

451
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,130
Kawee.

452
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,780
Kawee.

453
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,140
Wake up, Kawee.

454
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,290
It's morning.

455
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,860
P'Phupha!

456
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,060
How are you here?!

457
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,340
Why are you so shocked?

458
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,350
Who was it last night...

459
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,940
drink too much and got wasted?

460
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,240
I had to pick you
up and bring you home.

461
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,950
Is this your room?

462
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,490
Look carefully.

463
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,560
What time is it?!

464
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,020
I need to go shower now
or I'll be late for work.

465
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,200
What's the rush?

466
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,550
Are you fully conscious now?

467
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:13,030
Do you remember
what you did to me?

468
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,060
Don't tell me that...

469
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,590
I...

470
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,460
you?

471
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,130
Why did you uncover it?

472
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,020
It's alright?

473
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,770
I know when you did it...

474
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,380
you were very drunk.

475
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,830
So...

476
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,990
I'm not mad.

477
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,460
I don't the blame
on someone who's drunk.

478
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,150
I'm sorry.

479
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,290
Don't stress about it, Kawee.

480
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,180
Get out of my room!

481
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,170
Uncle.

482
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,240
Hear me out.

483
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,710
I'm not listening to you.

484
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,560
I said put on your
clothes and leave my room.

485
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,340
Don't make me lose my patience.

486
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,920
Kawee.

487
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,370
Yes?

488
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,580
Lift your face and look at me.

489
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,280
Lift your face and look at me.

490
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,020
Look into my eyes.

491
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,350
I told you.

492
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,200
I'm not mad at you.

493
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,210
I know you did
because you were drunk.

494
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,730
I don't mind either

495
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,630
So...

496
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,670
we get to the way we're before, OK?

497
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,300
OK?

498
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,680
Behave normally.

499
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,160
Phu.

500
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,410
Are you creating the imaginary scene?

501
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,150
N'Kawee, if you finished
creating the imaginary scene
the you should get back to work.

502
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,130
Let me handle things at the counter.

503
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,770
Phu.

504
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,240
Where did you sleep last night?

505
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,380
I slept alone last night, you know.

506
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,880
When did you got back?
You didn't even wake me up.

507
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:04,440
Ponfah,  I think I
should get back to work.

508
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,890
Customers are full.

509
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,790
I'll help.

510
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,520
Let's eat outside,
I don't want to eat boxed food.

511
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,110
Fah.

512
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,460
This is my working time.

513
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:28,080
After lunch I need to go back in.

514
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,510
I don't want to eat boxed food,
please eat outside with me.

515
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,450
Fah.

516
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,620
I told you that
today is my working time.

517
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,250
How can you expect me to go out?

518
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,300
But this is your cafe,
you go whenever you want
and do whatever you want.

519
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,620
It is because this is my cafe...

520
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,650
that I have to go back
in and brew coffee for my
customers after my lunch.

521
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,100
There are so many customers waiting.

522
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,390
There's a customer, right, Kawee?

523
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,230
Alright, I'll go in
and brew coffee for them.

524
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,070
Thank you for letting me know.

525
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,000
N'Kawee.

526
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,230
Yes?

527
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,780
Let me warn you about something.

528
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,920
About that imaginary thing,
just let it be imaginary.

529
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,430
Don't think more than that.

530
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,460
I fear you might get sad.

531
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,150
Phu will never like someone like you.

532
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,950
Like me how?

533
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,640
Unusual unlike me.

534
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,320
You should know what is real...

535
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,160
and what is false.

536
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,570
Do you wanna have lunch?

537
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,720
Please.

538
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,790
The other box is mine.

539
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,070
Don't steal it.

540
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,800
It's not nice.

541
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,240
I won't.

542
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:16,040
Because I...

543
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,060
doesn't like to eat old stuff.

544
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,800
I should just throw it away.

545
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,950
Because no matter what, old stuff...

546
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,580
is not delicious anymore.

547
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,810
P'Phupha, he...

548
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,890
might not want to eat old stuff too.

549
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,000
Because new stuff...

550
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,630
is a lot more delicious.

551
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,220
Thank you.

552
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,460
How will you go back today, Kok?

553

<i>So you won't have to feel
courteous to get back to me.</i>

567
