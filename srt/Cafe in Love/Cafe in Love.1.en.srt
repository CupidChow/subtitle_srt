What coffee is this?

3
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,760
How can you serve this kind
of coffee to your customer?

4
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,030
I'm sorry, I've only
started with brewing coffee.

5
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,860
Please inform me if
there's anything I can improve.

6
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,030
Everything.

7
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,420
Otherwise, just close the cafe.

8
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,370
How can you make this kind of
coffee and serve to your customer?

9
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,720
I'm really sorry.

10
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,800
But, I won't charge you for this drink.

What's the matter?

27

P'Win, I'm stressed.

28
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,380
Stress like...

29
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,880
very stessful.

30
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,530
It's about the cafe, right?

How do you know?

32
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,440
Because you've been
complaining about this every evening.

33
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,100
You've been
complaining for a month now.

34
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,470
I told you to just sell it.

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,110
No way.

36
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,450
I won't sell it, no matter what.

37
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,940
Our house...

38
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,510
we already sold it
to pay for my tuition fee.

39
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,720
That we have rent a house like this.

40
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,600
and you still want me to sell the cafe?

41
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,760
Is it because I can't run the business?

42
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,770
It's the final thing...

43
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,000
that Mom and Dad's request.

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,550
No matter what, I will safe this cafe.

45
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,290
Then how are you gonna do it?

46
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,660
The customers are
decreasing day by day.

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,430
I think Mom and Dad
will understand if we sell it.

48
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,900
Enough, P'Win.

49
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,640
If you're not gonna help me...

50
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,260
then don't say anything.

It's not that I don't
want to safe the cafe...

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,260
But you can't do it.

54
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,190
You can't even brew coffee.

55
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,460

to take responsibility of.

If you want to be able to safe the cafe...

57
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,900
you need to find someone to help you.

58
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,140
Yes!

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,730
Need someone's help?!

60
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,110
Who?

61
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,510
I know a guy.

62
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,350
I like to drink coffee at his
cafe before going to the office.

63
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,300
It's a small cafe
but lots of people there.

64
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,400
I think his name is Phupha.

65
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,230
He's a famous barista.

66
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,140
I think if you need someone's help...

67
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,780
it's surely his cafe.

68
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,480
I have to go now.

69
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,060
How am I
supposed to ask for his help?

70
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,030
Your coffee is ready.

71
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,700
Kok.

72
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:43,630
This is for table 3.

73
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,140
Sure thing, P'Phupha.

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,300
- OK.
- Take the order too.

75
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,580
Sure thing.

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,050
Your coffee is ready.

77
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,220
The cafe is small...

78
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,880
The environment..

79
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,210
is just plain.

80
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,800
Even the cafe's signboard is ugly.

81
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,500
Here you go.

82
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,990
How can he get so many people?

83
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,820
I need to find out...

84
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,040
what is his secret.

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,390
What will you have?

86
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,790
Sure thing.

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,580
OK.

88
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,510
Hello, yes, yes.

89
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
Chart.

90
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,990
Yo.

91
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,690
Why didn't  you come in?

92
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,180
Too many people.

93
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,700
Here is more convenient.

94
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,760
What's up?

95
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,230
I'm here to say goodbye.

96
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,870
I have to go.

97
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,130
When is your flight?

98
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,050
Tonight.

99
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,170
Can I not drop you there?

100
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,080
Why?

101
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,080
Afraid you might cry?

102
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,170
Don't be sad.

103
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,020
I'll be back in no time.

104
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,020
Four years?

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,350
Well...

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,470
I can fly back for a visit.

107
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,100
Give it here.

108
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,860
Take care of yourself.

109
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,150
<i>Take care.</i>

110
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,690
I love you.

111
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,370
What?!

112
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,410
Are you saying that Phupha is gay?

113
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,810
Yes.

114
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,450
I saw him hugging his boyfriend.

115
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,030
His boyfriend is going oversea.

116
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,020
I've got an idea!

117
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,300
What is it, Sis?

118
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,470
Can you stop calling me "Sis"?

119
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,670
Stop making me look old,
with my face looking like a kid like this.

120
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,880
Don't you look at
your face before you speak?

121
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,970
So do you want my help?

122
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,340
You have to act sad.

123
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,790
I won't call you "Sis" anymore.

124
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,010
By the way...

125
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,580
What is your plan?

126
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,680
Well, you said...

127
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,440
that his ex is going oversea.

128
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,940
That means Phupha...

129
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,880
must be lonely, empty and...

130
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,160
Wait, wait. That's too much.

131
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,830
You use this method.

132
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,290
Get to know
him and get close to him.

133
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,790
Hold on.

134
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,040
Do you expect me
to trade my body for it?

135
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,290
Then...

136
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,720
why can't we just
ask him directly fo help?

137
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,880
Are you stupid or stupid?

138
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,380
He's running a cafe just like you,
he won't help you.

139
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,300
We'll use this method.

140
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,540
But I don't like...

141
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Stop!

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,900
Were you gonna
say that you don't like me?

143
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,640
But I never seen a
single woman approaching you.

144
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,000
When any of them came for you,
you chase them all away.

145
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,010
I did that?

146
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,180
Yes!

147
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,220
Plus, you're almost died screaming
for the muscular football players.

148
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,580
You think I didn't know?

149
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,110
Enough, enough!

150
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,240
You talk too much.

151
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,180
Fine, I admit it.

152
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,300
We'll use this method then.

153
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:49,920
By the way...

154
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,390
you're not gonna drink
the coffee I brewed for you?

155
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,860
I have to say this coffee taste, it's..

156
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,560
It's alright.

157
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,270
The taste is
exactly like your face now.

158
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,630
How's your meeting with Phupha?

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,630
He's gay.

160
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,470
Gay? I don't think so.

161
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,320
It's true.

162
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,150
I saw it with my own two eyes.

163
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,930
He hugged his lover...

164
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,110
that it's almost became one person.

165
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,800
But it's good that he's gay.

166
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,200
It would be easier.

167
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,800
You want to make
him as your first one?

168
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,080
How do you know?!

169
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,050
Wee, hold on.

170
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,770
Are you really gonna do that?

171
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,550
Stop, stop.

172
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,690
It's not to that extend.

173
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,030
I just gonna make him like me...

174
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,080
and when he likes me,
I can ask anything from him.

175
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,580
Easy peasy.

176
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,630
Be careful of your own scheme.

177
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,460
And not go to like him for real.

178
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,440
Are you crazy?

179
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,530
I like me...

180
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,670
Men!

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,980
You like men, how can I not know?

182
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,080
You knew?!

183
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,430
So...

184
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,320
did Mom and Dad knew?

185
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,710
Mom and Dad?

186
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:24,000
They knew since you got upset that
you couldn't get into the football team.

187
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,780
Actually you were upset that you didn't
get to be with the senior you like, right?

188
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,180
You know everything?

189
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,600
Wee.

190
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,850
Approach someone with
the intention of deceiving...

191
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,830
the result is not going to be good.

192
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,250
It's better to do this sincerely.

193
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,740
Don't say anything
if you don't want to help.

194
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,600
I've decided that
I will use this method.

195
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,360
Then prepare
for the consequences.

196
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,090
I've warned you.

197
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,220
It's been 2 years...

198
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,990
that we have to be apart.

199
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,040
Rest in peace, Mom and Dad.

200
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,510
The cafe is good.

201
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,650
I will safe the cafe.

202
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,530
Pray for me, please.

203
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,750
Pray that I will succeed.

204
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,410
He's cool...

205
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,860
handsome...

206
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,550
he's so suitable to be
the father of my children.

207
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,750
Stop it.

208
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,480
Paew.

209
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,720
You're the one that came up
with this plan for Ai'Wee, right?

210
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,220
I did not, P'Gawin.

211
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,140
I'm just suggesting.

212
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,450
Everything else, Wee handles it.

213
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,600
You instigated
me to do this yesterday!

214
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,460
Really? I don't remember.

215
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,990
Enough, enough.

216
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,270
If you want to do it, be my guest.
Take responsibility of this on your own.

217
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,150
I won't interfere in this.

218
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,390
If you're not gonna woe him,
I'll do it myself.

219
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,000
Better not.

220
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,720
What?

221
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,480
Am I not beautiful?

222
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,930
I'm beautiful.

223
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
I'm going to work now.

224
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,550
Think carefully
whether to do this or not.

225
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,180
Bye.

226
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,730
What?

227
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,260
You have to do it.

228
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,990
You cannot not do it.

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,410
Who knows, you might
get a husband and the cafe.

230
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,860
Freaking awesome.

231
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:22,740
I have collected a lot
of ways to get a couple.

232
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,060
First...

233
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,140
you have to make
eye contact with him.

234
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,390
No need, I guess.

235
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,540
Seeing you're smiling like that...

236
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,120
you're so good at this.

237
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,670
I'm here alone, perhaps?

238
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,530
I'm here alone,
I came here alone, I guess.

239
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,820
What?

240
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,690
Your eyes...

241
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,340
were pointing straight at him.

242
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,960
If I let you go like this,
you'll probably have sex with him already.

243
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,590
He's coming.

244
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,780
- Sawasdee krub.
- Sawasdee kha.

245
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,310
You two came
here for the first time, right?

246
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,280
Yes.

247
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,640
Let me introduce myself.

248
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,610
I'm...

249
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,800
P'Phupha, the cafe owner.

250
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,500
You knew me?

251
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,940
By the way, you're calling me "P"?

252
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,020
Because we just known each other,
so I'm being respectful.

253
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,940
But who doesn't know you?

254
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,520
P'Phupha, the most famous barista.

255
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,780
I'm(Nu) Paew.
<i>[ "Nu" is used to address oneself to an older
people in a respectful way, usually used by girls ]</i>

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,740
"Nu" too.

257
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,110
Nice to meet you.

258
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,460
Yes, it's nice.

259
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,120
By the way...

260
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,120
what's your name?

261
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,330
What's your name?

262
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,010
What's your name?

263
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,760
My name is...

264
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,600
Kawee.

265
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,180
N'Kawee.

266
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,710
How's the coffee taste like?

267
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,650
It's excellent.

268
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,650
You're asking Kawee?

269
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,900
No, I'm asking both of you.

270
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,910
Kha.

271
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,900
By the way...

272
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,450
your friend...

273
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,020
seems quiet.

274
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,120
Is he normally don't talk much?

275
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,770
Please excuse me for today,
I'll come again next time.

276
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,760
OK.

277
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,480
Kok, please clean this table.

278
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,380
OK.

279
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,190
Wee.

280
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,760
What?

281
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,540
You just suddenly went outside here?

282
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,370
I got shy!

283
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,940
I didn't know what to do.

284
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,390
Get tender with
him so he'll addicted to you.

285
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:29,360
Not you getting addicted to him.

286
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,560
Well, I got shy.

287
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:35,050
I never had a guy get
his face this close to me.

288
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,640
Fine, newbies in love.

289
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:41,220
Don't let me find out that you're
wild in sex behind my back.

290
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,400
Never!

291
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,900
A virgin.

292
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,800
You talk too much,
why do you hae to emphasize?

293
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,070
Whatever.

294
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,150
If you haven't you have to anyway.

295
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,370
Phupha has to be your first one.

296
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,550
But, I...

297
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,230
No argument.

298
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,050
End of discussion.

299
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,380
I'm scared.

300
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,980
I'm scared that I have
to close the cafe for real.

301
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,490
If you're scared...

302
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,260
you have to be tender with
P'Phupha until he get addicted.

303
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,390
Will it really be successful?

304
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,840
Look at my face.

305
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,250
Look at my face.

306
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,660
There's nothing on your face,
why do I have to look at it?

307
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,190
I asked you to look at my face...

308
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,120
because I want to tell you that...

309
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,130
you have a helper
who's very talented...

310
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,250
smart...

311
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,580
and extremely beautiful.

312
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,410
About being talented and smart...

313
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,640
that I can accept.

314
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,640
But about being beautiful...

315
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,630
no way.

316
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,210
I'm your friend,
it doesn't hurt to compliment me.

317
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,170
Fine, fine.

318
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,650
You're beautiful, my friend.

319
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,070
That's a bit relieve.

320
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,280
So...

321
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,260
what should we do next?

322
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,350
Drama.

323
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,590
Like a Thai drama.

324
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,090
Drama?

325
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,230
What Thai drama?

326
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,720
A drama like in Thai drama.

327
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,260
How the male lead
and the female lead meet?

328
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,420
With that expression,
that means you don't know.

329
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,030
The male lead and the
female lead in a Thai drama...

330
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,660
they meet by coincidence.

331
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,430
Small world, unexpected.

332
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,310
Are you looking
at your lover's pictures?

333
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,190
What's wrong with you?

334
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,220
Do you miss your lover?

335
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,880
Watch your mouth.

336
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,860
I'll deduct your salary payment.

337
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,110
P', I'm just kidding.

338
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,570
Are you gonna cut my payment?

339
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,160
Fine, I won't.

340
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,610
So, how are you doing?

341
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,890
Not thinking about having a lover too?

342
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,310
No.

343
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,730
I can't even take care of myself,
how am I supposed to care for other?

344
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,370
Good that you're thinking that way.

345
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,660
What about your study?

346
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,850
It's good, I'm smart.

347
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,700
What about you?
Don't you think about finding a
helper on Saturday and Sunday?

348
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,640
So you can open the
cafe until late at night.

349
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,750
I have classes,
so the cafe has to be close early.

350
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,250
You get a lot less earning.

351
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,530
Sometimes it's good to close
early o Saturday and Sunday.

352
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,620
So there's time for rest.

353
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,490
Don't worry about my cafe.

354
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,330
Use your time to
focus on your study.

355
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,850
If you fail your exam...

356
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,340
it'll be troublesome.

357
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,950
Don't worry.

358
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,110
I will definitely pass the exam.

359
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,930
And I'm not thinking
about being a waiter forever.

360
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,650
I need to prove...

361
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,420
that I...

362
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,220
can be more than just a waiter.

363
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Good.

364
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,500
I believe...

365
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,070
that you can do it.

366
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,800
You're talented.

367
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,780
But if you're having problem,
you can come to me.

368
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,930
Always.

369
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,650
Thank you so much
for always helping me.

370
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,310
Don't make
that emotional face with me.

371
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,180
I know...

372
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,710
that you're siting here with me...

373
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,970
because you want to slack off, right?

374
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,830
No, P'. I'm going.

375
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,090
Whenever I come here...

376
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,990
I always miss Mom and Dad.

377
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,730
Me too.

378
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,170
This cafe...

379
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:07,980
is what enabled Mom and Dad to
send me to study until I graduated.

380
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,340
That's true.

381
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,570
And you still wants me to sell it?

382
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,790
Actually...

383
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,400
I don't want to sell it.

384
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,470
I'm sorry for not helping
you taking care of the cafe.

385
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:28,660
No need to apologize.

386
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,050
You have your duty to do.

387
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,720
As for this cafe...

388
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,180
I'll do it on my own.

389
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll do it the same as...

390
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,620
when Mom and Dad was here.

391
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,470
Fighting, my smart boy.

392
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,020
Dear customers,
the cafe will close in 10 minutes.

393
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,390
OK.

394
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,510
Paew, this is our second time here.

395
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,480
Isn't it weird?

396
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,620
What's weird about it?

397
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,760
It's not weird for people to
be having coffee for 2 to 3 times.

398
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,690
Look at those bitches.

399
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,090
They come here everyday.

400
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,540
Maybe they're
free and has nothing to do.

401
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,170
It doesn't seem weird.

402
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,050
Then, I'm gonna go to the restroom.

403
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,370
A drama scene.

404
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,760
This is great.

405
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,030
My bad.

406
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,230
I'm sorry, P'.

407
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,550
Kawee, Phupha's shirt is all dirty.

408
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,110
You have to be responsible for it.

409
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,650
Take it of, P'Phupha.

410
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,890
Take it off? Take off what?

411
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,300
Your shirt.

412
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,150
You have to take
responsibility for it, Kawee.

413
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,210
Take it off and my
friend will wash it for you.

414
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,280
I'll wash it for you then.

415
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,150
Take it off.

416
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,520
So I really need to take it off?

417
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,640
Yes.

418
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,440
Take it off.

419
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,510
All right.

420
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,650
Button no. 1.

421
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,430
Button no. 2.

422
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,730
Button no. 3.

423
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,550
The last button.

424
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,120
His six packs are so tight!

425
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,310
So strong.

426
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,120
So cool.

427
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,870
Calm down, Kawee. Calm down.

428
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,940
Kawee.

429
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,270
N'Kawee.

430
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,010
Yes?

431
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:57,800
Shirt.

432
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,550
Take your pants off too.

433
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,970
That's alright,
there's no dirt on my pants.

434
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,290
It didn't splash on his pants!

435
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,070
But I think it does.

436
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,930
Yes!

437
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,960
Then, I'll leave the shirt to you.

438
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,010
I'm gonna get a change of clothes.

439
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,200
Thank you so much.

440
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,260
Excuse me.

441
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,510
So tight.

442
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,180
Strong and muscular.

443
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,300
If I get him, I promise that
I'll go for ordain for a year.

444
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,030
You're overreacting.

445
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,080
You have to get him.

446
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,640
The fuck are you on about?!

447
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,850
Don't you feel absent-minded
like you're being hypnotized?

448
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,530
Not like in the drama at all.

449
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,230
Nonsense.

450
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,170
So good at being happy.

451
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,570
Good at smiling.

452
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,300
Good at walking too!

453
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,160
What are you talking about?

454
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,590
What good at walking?

455
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,170
We came here by car, right?

456
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,040
Are you gonna walk home?

457
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:26,190
I just come out to exercise.

458
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,560
Sitting too long got my legs hurt.

459
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,060
Don't let me find out that you'll be
using that shirt for something unmoral.

460
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,170
Kawee!

461
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,630
Kawee!

462
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,720
You're leaving me again!

463
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,950
He's already acting like this
after only gets a man's shirt.

464
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,370
What will happen if
they become boyfriends?

465
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,680
Fine, I'll go home by myself.

466
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
Paew!

467
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,220
Did I forgot about him?

468
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,830
You...

469
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,430
I'm sorry.

470
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,850
You already forgot your friend
after getting your man's shirt.

471
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,240
Do you know that
I had to walk home alone?

472
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,650
So tired.

473
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,260
It's dark and secluded road.

474
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,520
<i>Do you know that men
might take advantage of me.</i>

475
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,320
That's enough.

476
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,140
Someone like you walked home?

477
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,140
You'll get tired
just by taking 2 to 3 steps.

478
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,450
You don't believe me?

479
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,060
<i>Not even a little bit?</i>

480
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,790
By the way, how's P'Phupha's shirt?

481
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,110
I washed it.

482
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,790
You washed it...

483
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,280
you're not gonna hug it to sleep then...

484
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,690
Enough, enough.

485
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,760
See you tomorrow at P'Phupha's cafe.

486
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,270
That'll be all.

487
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,420
- P'Paew.
- Yeah?

488
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,800
I think it's better to be
left by a friend than by a guy.

489
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,240
E'Pew.

490
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,570
I forgot that you
don't have a boyfriend.

491
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,920
I'll have one soon.

492
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,920
I'd like to see that,
will it be tomorrow?

493
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,860
Can you wait?

494
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,130
I can't wait anymore
to see my brother-in-law.

495
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,240
So cute.

496
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,320
Am I going crazy?

497
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,560
Have a sit.

498
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,620
You're so good at cleaning table...

499
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,850
I really want you to clean up my room.

500
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,590
Will you go? I'll pay.

501
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,570
That's enough.

502
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,410
If he goes, he'll have no future.

503
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,980
Even though I'm not that pretty,
I can pay for anything.
<i>[ He uses the word "sai-pay" which is a slang for
someone who'd pay for anything usually for pleasure]</i>

504
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,430
Please excuse me.

505
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,440
Sit.

506
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,120
You're a "sai-pay" now?

507
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,930
You think your family's rich you
can spend money on anyone like this?

508
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,370
I'm just saying.

509
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,580
Are you here to return my shirt?

510
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,540
Yes.

511
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,190
Where is the shirt?

512
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,120
What are you confounded about?

513
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,520
Give it back to him.

514
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,010
What are you confounded about?
Give it back to him.

515
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,210
The shirt's ruined.

516
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,150
The shirt's ruined?

517
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,760
How can that be?

518
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,080
Exactly.

519
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,240
I was in a hurry
and the shirt's ruined.

520
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,920
I'll buy a new
one and return it to you.

521
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,010
If the shirt's ruined then...

522
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,630
no need.
You don't need to return it.

523
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,770
It's all right,
I'll have a new one for you.

524
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,260
I'll be responsible for it.

525
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,380
All right,
you can give it to me next time.

526
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,070
Please excuse me.

527
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,930
Thank you.

528
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,940
When you said the shirt's ruined...

529
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,370
you lied, didn't you?

530
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,460
What lying?

531
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,770
Can't the shirt get
ruined when I'm in a hurry?

532
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,800
Anyone makes mistakes.

533
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,190
Fine, I believe you.

534
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,240
But are you sure
that you're not lying?

535
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,790
I'm not!

536
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,320
Are you sure?

537
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm sure!

538
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,300
Are you sure?!

539
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,800
Paew, do you wanna piece of me?

540
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,920
Fine, I ask just to be sure.

541
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,660
I case you're keeping his shirt...

542
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,390
can I have it?

543
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,300
I threw it away.

544
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,980
I put it in a bag and left
it at the door this morning.

545
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,060
Then a car came and it flies off with it.

546
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:05,600
You're good at explaining
and explain it very clearly.

547
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,560
What's wrong?

548
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,410
What's the matter?

549
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,410
Nothing.

550
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:40,250
Just want to sleep on your laps.

551
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,610
Why are you acting tender?

552
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,200
Ran out of money?

553
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,050
Not yet.

554
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,820
I'm fine, I just want
to sleep on your laps.

555
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,630
Let me sleep?

556
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,380
So...

557
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:58,250
are you tired?

558
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,710
About what you mean?

559
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,410
Work.

560
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,310
Tired?

561
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,770
No.

562
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,540
Really?

563
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,350
Wait for me, OK?

564
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,620
If I don't succeed with the cafe...

565
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,040
I'll help you with your work.

566
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,010
Why are you saying that?

567
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,720
Don't ask for that.

568
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,590
Nothing is easy.

569
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:27,160
We need to be
patience and work hard.

570
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,130
I'm not giving up.

571
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,870
But I'm scared that I won't succeed.

572
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,110
Don't worry about
things that hasn't happened yet.

573
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,410
I know that my brother is talented.

574
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,480
Right?

575
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,370
Not good as you.

576
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,860
That's for sure, little brother.

577
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,660
Complimenting yourself.

578
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,310
I want to eat some snacks, feed me.

579
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,660
What is this?

580
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,000
Cookies.

581
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,570
It's you! What's wrong with you?
You're grown up but acting soft like kids.

582
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,760
Because I only
have you to be tender with.

583
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,660
No more?

584
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,570
No.

585
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,160
Put it back then.

586
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,160
You.

587
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,360
What?

588
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,990
When will you start that
coincidental meeting you have planned?

589
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,940
So impatience.

590
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,520
I've been to his cafe.

591
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,450
There's no sign of
him taking interest in me.

592
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,150
So...

593
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,410
when will he loves me?

594
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,170
Hold on.

595
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,040
Love?

596
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,040
Are you crazy?
Just like is enough, right?

597
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,150
Do you want him
to help with your cafe...

598
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,590
or you want him
to be your boyfriend?

599
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,040
Are you crazy?!

600
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,070
I don't like him.

601
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,620
I just want him to
help me with the cafe.

602
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:09,110
Don't like, but your eyes...

603
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,560
were off too far that
even Mars says it's annoying.

604
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,560
I don't like him!

605
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,140
Don't entice me.

606
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,700
Fine.

607
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,220
If you don't like then you don't like.

608
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,850
About the plan, I'll handle it.

609
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:26,570
I guarantee that
your relationship and him...

610
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,590
will go further for sure.

611
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,390
Let's go!

612
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,350
Let's go to his cafe.

613
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,130
Hurry up, let's go.

614
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,580
Don't be lazy, it's time to go.

615
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,900
Why are you following me?

616
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,120
I told you...

617
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,570
that I'm going to
help you open the cafe.

618
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,080
I told you, no need.

619
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,440
You're not going to school?

620
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,060
I have class in the afternoon.

621
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,330
Where, is there anything I can help?

622
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:11,590
Don't you understand?

623
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,090
I said no need, then no need.

624
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,610
Hurry eat and go to class.

625
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,980
Are you worry about me?

626
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,230
What are you talking about?

627
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Sawasdee krub, P'.

628
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:13,830
Sawasdee kha.

629
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,480
You're here early in the morning.

630
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,380
Because I miss you.

631
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:25,790
I'm leaving now.

632
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,100
When you finish work...

633
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,800
I'll pick you up.

634
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,910
It seems like he's mad at you.

635
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,700
Mad at me?

636
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,220
About what?

637
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,170
I know now.

638
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,060
I'll go get P'Phupha, have a sit first.

639
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,900
Ja.

640
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,020
OK, here you go.

641
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,490
Sawasdee krub, P'Paew, N'Kawee.

642
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,780
Sawasdee krub.

643
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,340
I...

644
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,520
bought you
this shirt as a payback.

645
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,290
Thank you so much.

646
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,500
Then...

647
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:24,610
Today will be my treat.
Just order whatever you want.

648
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,680
I'll make it for you.

649
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,090
Sure thing.

650
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,030
Ai'Phu.

651
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,340
Ai'Mike.

652
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,930
Miss you so much, buddy.

653
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,980
Can I kiss your cheek to
get rid of my longing to you.

654
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,230
No!
- Just a little.

655
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,790
What's wrong with you?

656
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,160
What the heck?

657
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,660
A friend missed you here.

658
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,270
Can't you pretend?

659
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:53,230
Then, please excuse
me for a moment.

660
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,500
- OK.
- I'm gonna talk to my friend first.

661
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,060
Does friends greet
each other like this?

662
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,040
They're...

663
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,950
very close, perhaps.

664
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,540
You're close to me too.

665
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,340
We never did that.

666
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,410
Shall we try?

667
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,230
That's enough, keep that thought.

668
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,210
I think P'Phupha's friend...

669
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,060
secretly like him for sure.

670
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,310
I think you already have a rival.

671
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:01,550
<i>And this is for you, N'Kawee.</i>

672
00:41:00,340 --> 00:42:05,370
{\an9}<i>[Next Episode]</i>

673
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,170
<i>P'Phupha.</i>

674
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,060
<i>Why is mine
doesn't have a heart on it?</i>

675
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,700
<i>I made a picture of heart...</i>

676
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,470
<i>because I want N'Kawee
to open up his heart.</i>

677
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,820
<i>Let me grab it.</i>

678
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,060
<i>What are you doing?</i>

679
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,600
<i>Picking up the shirt bag.</i>

680
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,320
<i>I can wear it on my own.</i>

681
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,440
<i>Come on.</i>

682
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,610
<i>Don't be stubborn, come here.</i>

683
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,980
<i>Stay still.</i>

684
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,850
<i>This is it.</i>

685
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,390
<i>What should we do?</i>

686
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:57,970
