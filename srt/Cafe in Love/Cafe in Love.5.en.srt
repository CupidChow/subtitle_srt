<i>You have to enter.</i>

you don't talk to me back.</i>

A delicious porridge...

14
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,120
Sorry.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm disturbing.

16
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,180
I'm just here to
give you a porridge.

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,760

Ai'Tai!

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,220
Excuse me, Jeed.

20
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,970
I'm gonna leave you in the room, OK?

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,430

Sit here, Uncle.

Uncle.

39
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,410
I said, sit here.

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,140
Fine.

41
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll sit.

You don't have to force me.

43
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,710
Wasn't so hard.

00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,560
Do I have to raise my voice?

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,220
Eat this.

It's OK.

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,240

Ever since I went overseas...

55
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,530
I never contacted my friends.

56
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,790
So I have no one.

57
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,290
I only have you.

58
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,240
Don't be sad.

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,230

or something's bothering you...

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,960
or something's wrong,
ou can come to me.

61
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,710
For real?!

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,100
I pity for a kid who has no friends.

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,210
You've said it and you
can't take back your words.

64
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Fine.

65
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,860
Hurry eat and hurry go home.

66
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,940
I'm sleepy,
I need to go home and sleep.

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,780
Yes?

69
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,020
Something's wrong?

70
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,900
You don't look OK.

71
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm having a little
misunderstanding with my friend.

72
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,160
Is it the friend who...

73
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,110
came here to see you often?

74
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,130
Yes.

75
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:13,020
Then you can go clear up
with your friend first for today.

76
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,350
I'm giving you a day off.

77
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,990
That won't be necessary.

78
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,610
I can clear it up later.

79
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,680
But your complexion doesn't look good.

80
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,890
When the café is opened,
I will brighten up.

81
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,120
OK.

82
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,370
But don't forget to clear
things up with your friend.

83
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,050
It's not good if you
wait too long, you know?

84
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,310
Sure thing.

85
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,650
Let's do this.

86
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,220
Come, let's get ready.

87
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,470
Sure.

88
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,740
Tonmai.

89
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,120
You're here early.

90
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,720
Are you here for the coffee or
to see P'Phupha, I wonder.

91
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,420
You're no different.

92
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,740
Are you here for the coffee...

93
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,800
or stare at someone?

94
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,360
Don't quarrel.

95
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,960
You two, wherever you guys meet...

96
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,680
you'll quarrel every time.

97
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,690
P'Phupha, Sawasdee kha.

98
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,550
Sawasdee krub, P'Paew, N'Kawee.

99
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,290
You're here early.

100
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,240
I didn't come here with them.

101
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,930
I met them at the parking lot.

102
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,110
Why are you so jumpy?

103
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,480
I didn't say anything.

104
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,240
It's done, P'Phupha.

105
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,990
N'Kok!

106
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,420
He's probably very tired.

107
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,170
Is it enough for you to only have one
waiter in this big café of yours?

108
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,540
You might want to
have one more employee.

109
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,580
My friend Kawee here,
he's very free lately.

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,300
He's hardworking, patient, and loyal.

111
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,190
No matter how late at night the
work takes, he can bear it all.

112
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,430
Acctually...

113
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,450
better not.

114
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
My café is not that big.

115
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,670
There weren't too
many customers too.

116
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,260
I think one waiter
is more than enough.

117
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,130
Unless...

118
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,420
Ai'Kok.

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,990
You never told me that you're tired?

120
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,010
Are you using P'Paew to tell me this?

121
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,080
No.

122
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,800
But...

123
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,340
Paew, that's enough.

124
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,910
We're here to drink coffee.

125
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,990
Not here to be a waiter.

126
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,970
What are you laughing about?

127
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,530
Nothing, just laugh
at some random things.

128
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,020
You can order your coffee now.

129
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,220
Yeah, I should order some coffee.

130
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm gonna look at the menu.

131
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,420
Then, what do you want
to drink this morning?

132
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,010
I'll brew them for you.

133
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,220
Paew, order for me.
I need to go to the toilet.

134
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,930
Is there something you want?

135
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,720
You like Phuphao so much, aren't you?

136
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,630
Even go as far as to
apply as a waiter in this café.

137
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,740
You want to get close to him.

138
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,970
Your plan is quite high.

139
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,910
If that's what you think,
then be my guest.

140
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,830
That's up to you.

141
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,240
But I don't like P'Phupha...

142
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,470
to a point of blindness.

143
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,880
I can still think rationally enough.

144
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,360
What about you?

145
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,860
You're P'Phupha's best friend.

146
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,540
Don't you know?

147
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,250
That he already have a lover.

148
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,530
And you still want to snatch him...

149
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,260
to be yours?

150
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,790
No, when did he has a lover?

151
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,910
I don't know when.

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,820
But what I do know is
that he already has one.

153
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,130
What's up?

154
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,170
I saw you came at the same time
with those two this morning.

155
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,510
Then you even secretly talking to
him behind the café earlier.

156
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,780
Are you going to
launch a violent attack?

157
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,710
Not bad.

158
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,020
Forget about me.

159
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,870
Let's talk about you first.

160
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,530
About me?

161
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,970
About what?

162
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,990
Do you...

163
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,910
have a lover already?

164
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,380
I never heard you told me before.

165
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,310
What lover?

166
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,740
How should I know?

167
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,120
When did you have one?

168
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,270
I don't.

169
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,540
I don't have a lover.

170
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,060
Where can I have one?

171
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,640
Are you sure?

172
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,550
It's not that you have one
but refuse to tell your friend?

173
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,390
I don't have a lover yet, for real.

174
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,290
Besides, you do know...

175
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,290
how am I supposed to have a lover?

176
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,300
I'm...

177
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,310
still waiting.

178
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,350
Do you still waiting for that person?

179
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,280
Why don't you just look ahead?

180
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,090
How can I?

181
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,540
Ever since that day...

182
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,740
until today.

183
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,650
I tried to do everything.

184
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,530
From having a café, a house...

185
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,050
and even a car.

186
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,300
I think I'm looking ahead
the best I can already.

187
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,600
Then why don't you look at the
other people in front of you?

188
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,510
How long are you gonna wait?

189
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,510
I don't know either.

190
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,470
But what's certain...

191
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,480
I'm good at waiting.

192
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,780
I don't know what to say to you.

193
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,760
If I want to say something,
you're already at this point.

194
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,500
If you're still waiting for that person...

195
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,610
I don't know what to tell you.

196
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,360
But I...

197
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,250
want you to open up for once.

198
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,090
What if one day...

199
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,140
you meet the right and
suitable person for you?

200
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,060
The person who won't make you wait...

201
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,030
hopelessly like this.

202
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,540
Kok.

203
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,890
I've locked your room.

204
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,050
I'm sorry for this morning.

205
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,590
I really didn't mean it.

206
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,370
I have to apologize to you too.

207
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,370
How's Tai?
Have you cleared up with him?

208
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,880
He's gonna be fine.

209
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,190
But I think...

210
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,710
Tai is angry.

211
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,880
Angry for what? He just shocked.

212
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,930
If he's only shocked then good.

213
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,520
No need to stress about it.

214
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,190
Have a sit.

215
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,510
What do you want to drink? The usual?

216
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,780
Just a sec.

217
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,540
Love triangle.

218
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,530
Love between 3 people.

219
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,760
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,830
It's alright.

221
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,900
By the way,
is there something you want?

222
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,320
Well, I...

223
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,620
Can I...

224
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,180
have your LINE ID?

225
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,380
I'm so pretty.

226
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,160
I want a glass of fresh milk,
but no need to be too sweet...

227
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,040
because your smile is sweet enough.

228
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,680
Look at those bitches.

229
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,770
Excessively strange and
excessively beyond others.

230
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:28,900
Don't you think?

231
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,450
He's jealous.

232
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,450
He's gonna drive them away.

233
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,170
Excuse me.

234
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,760
Have you done with your order?

235
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,430
Can I order now?

236
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,240
What would you like to have?

237
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,370
Excuse me, now that you're done...

238
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,820
are you not going back to your table?

239
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,930
Why are you so fierce today?

240
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,750
No, I'm not.

241
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,280
Really?

242
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,660
Stern face...

243
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,300
with a very strong voice.

244
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,600
So strong as if...

245
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,330
you don't like that...

246
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,850
those ladies were talking to me.

247
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,190
It's like...

248
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,540
you're jealous.

249
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,260
I'm dead, I'm dead!

250
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,540
Am I that obvious?

251
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,360
Ai'Wee, damn it!

252
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,130
Cats out of the bag!

253
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,130
I'm kidding. Kawee.

254
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,540
You're kidding but I got shocked.

255
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,770
So, what would you like?

256
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,420
The usual.

257
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,420
The second cup, huh?

258
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,600
The usual, so will be interested to take
my heart with you too with this cup?

259
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,740
Is he for real or joking?

260
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,300
I think it's for real.

261
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,640
I mean...

262
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,220
I'll make a heart shape
picture on top of it for you.

263
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,980
Then I'll have it for
take away for this one.

264
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,020
Sure thing.

265
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,410
How much?

266
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,820
I'll give you a discount
for this cup, 50 baht.

267
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,080
50 baht.

268
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,500
What's the matter?

269
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,370
I didn't bring my wallet.

270
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,410
Let me ask P'Paew.

271
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,190
I don't have my wallet.

272
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,850
I don't have mine too.

273
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,190
Or I should really just sell the café?

274
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,090
I can't afford to hire a barista.

275
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,690
I can't even brew coffee on my own.

276
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,860
I don't want to sell it.

277
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,910
Don't get discourages.

278
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,190
How can I not?

279
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,800
I can't see any way.

280
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,520
P'Phupha...

281
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,180
doesn't accept more waiter.

282
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,460
And...

283
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I can't keep on
offering myself every day.

284
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,300
There must be a way out.

285
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,070
What?!

286
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,430
What's wrong with you?

287
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,890
I've got it.

288
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,730
Today...

289
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,950
I overheard Kok...

290
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,870
was talking to this one girl.

291
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm guessing...

292
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,990
they're surely having a love triangle.

293
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,290
In that case...

294
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,680
I'll just have that girl meet
with that other guy in the café.

295
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,030
So they'll fight.

296
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,350
With this, Kok will get fired.

297
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,880
Wouldn't the shop be destroyed?

298
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,280
Wake up!

299
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,000
You don't know
who the other person is.

300
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,680
Making so that Kok gets fired...

301
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,620
isn't that too much?

302
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,480
It's hard to find job these days.

303
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,720
I don't want to.

304
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,250
I pity Kok.

305
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,400
Isn't there any other way that's like...

306
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,980
so Kok won't get fired...

307
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,490
and I get to be a waiter too?

308
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,820
Have you gone crazy?

309
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,830
Yes!

310
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,800
Go ahead, call me crazy.

311
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,090
But I got an idea...

312
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,840
on what to do...

313
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,710
for you to be a
waiter at P'Phupha's café.

314
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,690
What way?

315
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,800
A way for you...

316
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,810
to be a waiter at P'Phupha's café.

317
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,170
And Kok won't get fired.

318
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,960
I don't think it's gonna work.

319
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,670
Tai, where are you?

320
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,860
Tai, where are you?

321
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,860
Why didn't you pick up my call?

322
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,850
Tai, where are you?

323
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,850
Why didn't you pick up my call?

324
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,850
Pick up my call

325
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,840
What's got into you?!

326
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,240
Do you want to die?

327
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,530
If I don't do this...

328
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,250
will you stop and talk to me?

329
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,210
Were you waiting for me?

330
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:25,350
Yes.

331
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,590
So, if I didn't come?

332
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,480
I'll wait until you come.

333
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,640
What are you doing?

334
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,210
Let go!

335
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,930
Get off my bike too.

336
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,100
Let go!

337
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,140
No.

338
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,680
I won't get off either
or you'll run away from me.

339
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,670
Let go!

340
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,340
About this morning...

341
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
it's not what you think.

342
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,920
Jeed and I didn't...

343
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,660
didn't kiss.

344
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,270
Why are you telling me this?

345
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,280
You want to kiss...

346
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,890
or not...

347
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,380
that's your business.

348
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,670
Because you're mad at me.

349
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,450
Besides...

350
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,980
if I don't care about you...

351
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,140
I wouldn't explain this to you.

352
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,950
You're smiling.

353
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,130
You're not angry anymore, right?

354
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,770
What smiling?

355
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,110
You're imagining things.

356
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,670
Fine, if you say so.

357
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,320
You're not angry anymore, right?

358
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,800
Then...

359
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,290
shall we buy some
food and eat at my room?

360
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,770
I'm hungry,
I haven't eaten anything.

361
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,030
OK, but I...

362
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,900
Please, please, please.

363
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
Let's buy some food
and eat at my room, OK?

364
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,270
All right, fine.

365
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,160
Then ride.

366
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,460
I am riding here.

367
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,750
What are you talking about?

368
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,090
- Get down first.
- OK.

369
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,400
I'll get you a helmet.

370
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:33,060
Didn't think that I'd see you here...

371
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,400
at this hour.

372
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,440
I also didn't think...

373
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,960
I'd see you at this hour too.

374
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,150
Are you going home?

375
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,220
Not yet.

376
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,970
Then, wanna have a
sit there and talk to me?

377
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,920
Why are you
taking a walk at this hour?

378
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,040
Something's been
bothering me a bit.

379
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,070
You have something
stressing you out too?

380
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,990
Sometimes.

381
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,250
What about you?

382
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,690
I, well...

383
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,280
have something
bothering me a bit too.

384
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,880
Have you ever waited for
something for a long period of time?

385
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,720
Waiting for something
for a long period of time

386
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,540
Probably waiting in line to eat shabu.

387
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,860
Actually,
waiting for someone too long...

388
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,690
it's torturing, right?

389
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,380
But they say if...

390
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,710
we waited for so
long and finally gets it...

391
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,940
it's worth it.

392
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,740
That's true.

393
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,290
But what if we wait...

394
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,530
and we don't get what we hope for?

395
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,110
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
ask you something so stressful.

396
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,800
I shouldn't have talk
something stressful with you.

397
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,630
Come to think of it, you probably don't know
that you dropped your wallet in my café.

398
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:18,220
My wallet?

399
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,930
Maybe it fell on the floor

400
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,310
I kept it for you.

401
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,500
You're right.

402
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,590
I didn't realized when it dropped.

403
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,380
But...

404
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,280
Actually...

405
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:33,400
No wonder I can't find my
wallet when I was at your café.

406
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,580
Handsome, why is he so handsome?

407
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,030
His lips is so kissable.

408
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,990
No, no, no. Kawee, no!

409
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,930
Can't let it slip out!

410
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,690
No need to stress about it.

411
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,090
Just that...

412
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,340
and your eyebrows
are squeezed together.

413
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,310
Actually I've kept it.

414
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,120
I didn't think I'd see you
here so I put it in my house.

415
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,220
If you're in a hurry to use it,
you can come and take it at my house.

416
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,810
OK.

417
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,860
Since it's already late...

418
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,840
shall we?
<i>[ He said "bpai ao gun loey mai" meaning "shall
we go get it?" or a slang for "having sex" ]</i>

419
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,110
Let's go.

420
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,400
You can prepare
the food upstairs first.

421
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,320
I'm gonna go buy some drinks.

422
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,920
I'll be back shortly.

423
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,480
Be careful.

424
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,750
Jeed?

425
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,790
I want to talk to
you about this morning.

426
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:20,000
Kok already told me...

427
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,450
that it wasn't like what I saw.

428
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,620
And besides, I wasn't angry.

429
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:31,230
But I think you
look angry and look upset.

430
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,880
But if you're not...

431
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,640
and didn't think of anything...

432
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,110
I'm glad.

433
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,840
Well...

434
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,360
I don't think of anything.

435
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,000
Good, now I can say this openly.

436
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,610
Thing is...

437
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,530
I like Kok.

438
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,650
Actually...

439
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,560
I can tell.

440
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,570
Am I that obvious?

441
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,160
So embarrassing.

442
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,930
And another thing...

443
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,320
supposedly if you
didn't enter this morning...

444
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,400
Kok and I would probably...

445
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,360
already kissed.

446
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,130
I think Kok also has heart for me.

447
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,010
Jeed?

448
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,120
Why are you here?

449
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,300
I'm worried...

450
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,360
about Tai for this
morning misunderstanding.

451
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,990
So I came here and wait.

452
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,420
But I've explained to him that there's
nothing going on between you and I.

453
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,590
I've already explained it to him.

454
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,800
He's not angry.

455
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,100
Don't worry.

456
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,280
I also told Tai that...

457
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,730
the two of us never had
anything in mind more than a friend.

458
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,700
We're just good friends.

459
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,230
Kok.

460
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,070
Let's get upstairs, I'm hungry.

461
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,500
Yeah, let's go.

462
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,150
Please excuse our manners, Jeed...

463
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,850
for not inviting you in.

464
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,320
It's late.

465
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,460
Ladies in a guy's room at night...

466
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,280
it's not proper.

467
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,480
Besides...

468
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,010
we bought food...

469
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,710
only for the two of us.

470
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,160
What rude?

471
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,320
I don't see the problem with it and...

472
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,970
I'm about to go home too.

473
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,650
I have to go now.

474
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,760
Let's go.

475
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,020
<i>♪ And I will take you away ♪</i>

476
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,650
<i>♪ From this soil ♪</i>

477
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,650
<i>♪ Take you, you and me ♪</i>

478
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,890
Can't you make a better expression?

479
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,260
You drag me for a drink...

480
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,120
I don't want to come.

481
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,450
You told me...

482
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,270
that if I'm stress or
upset about something...

483
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,870
I can always come to you.

484
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,950
Stressed?

485
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,960
A guy like you stressed?

486
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,080
You're sitting here
smiling with a good mood.

487
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,610
I am stress here.

488
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,480
So I ask you out to relief my stress.

489
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,810
And to have someone
accompany me too.

490
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,330
Uncle, smile a little.

491
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,060
Smile, like this.

492
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,500
Don't you know how to smile?

493
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,020
Happy?

494
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,270
Cute.

495
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,060
Sawasdee kha, do you
mind cheer drinks with me?

496
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,800
Sure thing.

497
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,320
Are you here alone?

498
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,150
My friend hasn't arrived yet.

499
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,210
There's a lot of place
to sit and she has to sit here.

500
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,040
So what's your name?

501
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,540
I'm...

502
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,160
Uncle's name is Gawin.

503
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,170
He has a wife and two kids.

504
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,070
Sorry, I thought you didn't have a wife.

505
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,120
What a pity.

506
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,850
What the fuck are you saying?

507
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,170
Since when I have a wife and kids?

508
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,750
When you met a woman,
you're smiling from ear to ear.

509
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,030
It's annoying just
watching it, understand?

510
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,570
Uncle, where are you going?

511
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,180
Toilet.

512
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,520
Do you want to follow?

513
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:33,390
If you let me to...

514
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,700
I would.

515
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,330
Don't.

516
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,950
Troublemaker.

517
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,970
Can I have your LINE ID?

518
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,050
He's so charming.

519
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,640
Or you're here with your boyfriend?

520
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,830
No.

521
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,290
He's not my boyfriend.

522
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,650
He's my junior.

523
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,170
Then that means you're single.
Can I have your LINE ID?

524
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,610
OK.

525
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,930
Exchanging LINE ID too.

526
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,760
Why am I upset about this?

527
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,080
Sit and wait here.

528
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,590
I'll go get your wallet.

529
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,290
OK.

530
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,820
Your wallet.

531
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,470
Thank you.

532
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,310
I don't know how to repay you.

533
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,450
Repay?

534
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,270
If you wannt to repay me...

535
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,930
You want to do it now?

536
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,690
I don't even bring any protection.

537
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,020
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!

538
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,660
Can you cook something for me?

539
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,930
I'm starving, I haven't
eaten anything yet today.

540
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,800
Don't you know how to cook?

541
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,190
So-so.

542
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,210
But I'm better at brewing coffee.

543
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,920
Then, sure.

544
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,650
Then you go take
a shower and eat later.

545
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,430
OK.

546
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,840
The kitchen is over there.

547
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,140
You can use
anything in the kitchen.

548
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,100
OK.

549
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,490
I'm gonna shower first.

550
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,030
Thank you so much.

551
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,470
Am I gonna cook for P'Phupha?

552
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,560
Sister.

553
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,100
Is this pretty?

554
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,740
Yes.

555
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,100
Does it suits me?

556
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,950
Very!

557
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:30,240
It fits with this.

558
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,380
So sweet.

559
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,470
Immediately sweet when I put it on.

560
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,860
I should get married, right?

561
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,210
No need.

562
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,000
We don't need a husband.

563
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,060
Who should I marry? I can't choose.

564
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,830
Hello, what's up?

565
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,340
Hello.

566
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,610
Do you know where I am now?

567
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,100
How am I supposed to know?

568
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:59,330
I'm at P'Phupha's house.

569
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,100
How are you there?

570
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,130
I'll tell you later.

571
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,380
But right now, P'Phupha...

572
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
<i>wants me to cook for him.</i>

573
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,510
You need to sleep at his house.

574
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,730
Hold on.

575
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,650
Sleep...

576
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,840
Sleep at his house?

577
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,460
No way!

578
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,780
Listen to me.

579
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:37,160
Can I do that? Kawee!

580
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,210
Hurry up.

581
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,850
I told you to eat first.

582
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,520
I want to wait.

583
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,820
Are you crazy?!

584
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,980
What?

585
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,110
Why did you remove your towel?
Put it back on!

586
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,650
You said you're used to it.

587
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,850
What's the fuss about?

588
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,830
Come on, take a look.

589
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,860
Psychopath!

590
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,370
Put some clothes on.

591
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,320
What the hell?

592
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,570
Uncle, you're not paying attention
when chatting with a woman.

593
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,990
If you're gonna chat that much...

594
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,650
why don't you go
home and continue there?

595
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,990
What woman?

596
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,620
I'm chatting to my younger brother.

597
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,020
Hhe said he won't be home tonight,
he'll spend the night at a friend's house.

598
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,550
You have a brother?

599
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,330
Yes.

600
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,010
Just the two of us.

601
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,050
I thought you
were talking to a woman.

602
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,780
If I were chatting to
a woman, what's it to you?

603
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,940
I don't like you talking to a woman.

604
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,030
Why is that?

605
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,490
Well...

606
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,050
Because you're here with me.

607
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,420
So you need to talk to me.

608
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,390
How can you talk to anyone else?

609
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,850
Spoiled kid.

610
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,280
Can I join you?

611
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,330
No! He's my boyfriend!

612
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,420
The guys you're asking
to sit with is my boyfriend.

613
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,970
I'm very possessive too.

614
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,700
Sorry.

615
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,480
What the fuck are you saying?

616
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,530
You're here with me,
how can you sit with other people?

617
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,280
Not that.

618
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,050
Why did you told
her that I'm your boyfriend?

619
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,740
If I didn't...

620
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,440
she will sit with you.

621
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,660
Jealous?

622
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,630
You troublemaker.

623
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,480
Jealous?

624
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,280
Smell so good.

625
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,230
So...

626
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,380
don't you think it's a bit too much?

627
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,660
It's just four dishes.

628
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,720
But it's just the two of us.

629
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,770
I was afraid that
it won't be enough.

630
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,020
Because these...

631
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,820
are so delicious.

632
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,170
If you say it like that...

633
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:31,950
then let's eat.

634
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,350
I...

635
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,870
want to eat you.

636
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,470
He wants to "eat" me?

637
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,030
I haven't showered yet.

638
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,400
What should I do?

639
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,270
What's with that expression?

640
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,090
I'm joking.

641
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,400
I mean...

642
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,360
I want to eat your cooking.

643
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,480
Yes, P'.

644
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,370
Let's eat.

645
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,060
Yes, come, come.

646
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,540
You troublemaker.

647
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,350
My perfect life turns
chaotic because of you.

648
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,150
Hot!

649
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,150
It's suffocating!

650
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,650
Take my shirt off!

651
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,180
It's so suffocating!

652
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,070
What are you doing, Tonmai.
Let me go.

653
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,880
Don't fight this.

654
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,410
You're not gonna
escape this no matter what.
