1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,110
<i>Phu, you're acting like we
haven't sleep together before.</i>

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:49,770
{\an9}<i>[Previous Episode]</i>

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,100
<i>But it was a long time ago.</i>

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,540
<i>I think...</i>

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,450
<i>you better sleep in the
room I've prepared for you.</i>

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,200
<i>You've changed a lot.</i>

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,890
<i>Same direction...</i>

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,930
<i>so we go together, right?</i>

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,400
<i>Are you making fun of me?</i>

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:42,710
<i>Can I talk to you?</i>

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,890
<i>Sure.</i>

12
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,370
I beg you, leave this place.

13
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,330
Right now,
I came back to Phu.

14
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,180
Besides, Phu has been
waiting for me for seven years.

15
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,210
But he doesn't
dare to love me back...

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,450
because out of courtesy to you.

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,450
He said that he's
afraid that you might be sad.

18
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,700
That's how Phu is.

19
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Always considerate about others.

20
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,490
But if you leave this place...

21
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,990
he'll have to courage to
love me back since he doesn't
have to feel courteous to anyone.

22
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,700
Say what it is you want to say.

23
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,490
I want to
apologize about last night.

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,790
It was my fault.

25
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,590
I couldn't hold myself.

26
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,040
And...

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,710
did that to you.

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,150
Stop talking about last night.

29
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,950
I don't want to remember that.

30
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,230
Just consider that...

31
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,230
last night, nothing happens.

32
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,770
How can you think that?

33
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,580
We did it.

34
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,270
I said, stop talking about it.

35
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,610
Let me ask you straight.

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,820
Last night...

37
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,760
you did it to me, didn't you?

38
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,220
Did to you...

39
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,140
how do you mean?

40
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,290
Well, I mean...

41
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,470
you...

42
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,310
penetrate me, didn't you?

43
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,350
I think I should ask you back.

44
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,770
are you...

45
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,510
sore there?

46
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,230
There?

47
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,360
No soreness, it's normal.

48
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,300
Well...

49
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,980
be that as it may, Uncle.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,240
That means you...

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,720
Yes. I'll tell you, my butt...

52
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
is both hurt and sore.

53
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,150
At first, I didn't think
it would be this bad.

54
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,120
When I woke up...

55
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,440
Stop talking.

56
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,720
Uncle, where are you going?

57
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,340
What now?

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,830
You're not allow to abandon me.

59
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,040
You can't have anyone else too.

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,280
Otherwise, I won't forgive you.

61
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,170
Why do you want to forbid me?

62
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,190
Last night was
just a one night stand.

63
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,330
Because I like you.

64
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,580
I like you very much.

65
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,090
What about you?

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,670
Do you like me?

67
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,800
Uncle?

68
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,330
- Do you like me?
- I don't know.

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,890
If you don't reject me...

70
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,890
I'd consider...

71
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,000
that you like me too.

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,040
Up to you.

73
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,350
Thank you.

74
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,440
How will you go back today?

75
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,600
Tai comes to
pick you up as usual?

76
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,780
Yes.

77
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,210
Then, go home safely.
See you tomorrow.

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,490
Thank you.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,630
Kawee.

80
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,460
Let's go home.

81
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,910
P'Phupha.

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,630
From now on...

83
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,870
I probably won't be
working at your cafe anymore.

84
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,300
Why, Kawee?

85
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,960
Is there any problem?

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,860
Kok's had already healed.

87
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,690
What are you saying?

88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
Ai'Kok hasn't recovered yet.

89
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,410
Right, Kok?

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,060
Yes, it hasn't. It still hurts.

91
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,240
What hurt?

92
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,910
I saw you used that
hand to lift the chairs today.

93
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,180
It hasn't 100% recovered yet,

94
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,950
Some jobs can be done and
some jobs can't be done, right?

95
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,160
Besides, I feel that...

96
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,050
our cafe gets
a lot more customers.

97
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,170
I used to think that
only one waiter was enough.

98
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,140
I think we might we
need 2-3 people now.

99
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,520
Don't you want to
work at my cafe anymore?

100
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,320
I got a new job.

101
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,610
I don't have time to work
at your cafe anymore.

102
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,990
Anyway...

103
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,340
please excuse me.

104
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,980
If that's your decision...

105
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:04,660
I won't try to stop you.

106
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,070
But let me tell you first that I want
you to continue work for me.

107
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,640
But...

108
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,080
I gave my word to
the new place already.

109
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,530
Please excuse me.

110
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,530
What do you want?

111
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,660
I need to talk to you.

112
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,680
About Kok?

113
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,300
I don't care anymore..

114
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,840
that...

115
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,960
whether you're
his girlfriend or not.

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,750
I only hope...

117
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,120
to take care of
him from here, that's it.

118
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,150
I'm not Kok's girlfriend.

119
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,130
Are you joking?

120
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,860
I'm not, I'm serious.

121
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,240
Kok and I are just friends.

122
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,380
Everything that's happened was
because Kok asked me for help.

123
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,870
He wants to know whether
you have a feeling for him or not.

124
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,640
He wasn't sure and
thought you only feel guilty.

125
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,500
Are you serious?

126
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,190
I am.

127
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,340
I don't like Kok.

128
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,180
Because I don't like men.

129
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,470
You can feel relieved now, right?

130
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,150
Don't be mad
and hate me anymore.

131
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,290
I really want to be your friend.

132
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,840
I don't hate you.

133
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,170
But I'm angry.

134
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,150
But...

135
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,030
right now, I'm feeling better.

136
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,380
Me too.

137
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,060
It's been so suffocating for too log.

138
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,200
Plus, you two didn't say
anything that you like each other.

139
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,750
Always been holding back.

140
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,300
What are you talking about?

141
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,020
Keep on being stubborn.

142
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,410
I have to go now.

143
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,820
Tell Kok that
he still owes me a meal.

144
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,810
I'm leaving.

145
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,710
I'm hanging up now,
my brother is here.

146
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,680
Come in.

147
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,040
I've decided to sell the cafe.

148
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,290
Seriously?

149
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,980
Why?

150
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,220
I don't think I'm succeeded.

151
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,260
I should've trusted you.

152
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,740
I shouldn't have
seduced P'Phupha.

153
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,500
To a point...

154
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,240
I fell in love on my own.

155
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,830
At first, didn't Paew said that...

156
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,820
he also have feelings for you?

157
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,120
It was just a joke.

158
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,030
His ex came back now.

159
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,020
They will love each other back.

160
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,120
His ex?

161
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,530
His ex is...

162
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,510
a woman.

163
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,230
He will never like me.

164
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,660
It's alright.

165
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,160
I won't stop you
whatever your decision is.

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,280
Are you sure that
you're going to do this?

167
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,640
About work and Phupha?

168
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,360
I've made my decision.

169
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,360
So I will be done with it.

170
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,050
Phu, come and have dinner.

171
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,110
I've order a lot of your favorites.

172
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,680
I'm sorry, Fah.

173
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm not hungry.

174
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,540
I need to shower and sleep now.

175
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,510
What's wrong

176
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,290
Kawee quits.

177
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
I don't know why he did.

178
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,270
Really?

179
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,840
He really did quit?

180
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,130
Then...

181
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,240
we need to celebrate.
Let's eat and celebrate.

182
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
I didn't think it would
be this easy to talk him out.

183
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,850
What did you say to him??

184
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,500
It's not important.

185
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,550
After this,
no one will block us anymore.

186
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,860
Fah!

187
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:51,040
I asked, what did you say to him?!

188
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,580
Why, Phu?

189
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,400
You seem to care
so much about him.

190
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,070
Why are you so care about him?

191
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,740
It's good that he left.

192
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,410
So you won't have to feel
courteous to get back to me.

193
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,900
What do you
mean by feel courteous?

194
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,560
The reason you were afraid to
show your true feelings for me...

195
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,250
is out of courtesy for him.

196
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,240
You know he likes you.

197
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,130
The there's that koo-jin thing.

198
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,930
Let him leave.

199
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:15,700
Fah, I never
felt courteous to him.

200
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,430
Not courteous...

201
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,920
that means...

202
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,130
you no longer have
any feelings for me?

203
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,540
You said you'll wait for me.

204
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,540
But it's been seven years.

205
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,200
You left me for seven years.

206
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,380
Didn't you ever think
that I'll have someone else?

207
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,890
You said you love me.

208
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,200
You said I'm the
only one in your heart.

209
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,980
It used to be that way.

210
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,930
But now, not anymore.

211
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,140
You talk like this, that means...

212
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,970
you like that kid?

213
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,510
I wasn't sure at first too.

214
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,910
But when you came
back ad act like this...

215
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm sure now.

216
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,460
That I really like N'Kawee.

217
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,420
That's not true, I don't believe you.

218
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,020
You're saying this
just to get back at me.

219
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,550
The truth is, you still love me.

220
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,550
That's enough, Fah.

221
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,430
I admit that I was waiting
for you for seven years.

222
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,550
Until I met him.

223
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,510
Then my feelings changed.

224
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,940
I asked myself,
why am I waiting for a woman
who won't come back for me?

225
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,800
Our lives should start anew, right?

226
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,930
When I got into this realization,
you came back.

227
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,110
I admit, I was confused.

228
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,690
But now I can
answer that myself 100%.

229
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,440
I really want to
have a new start with him.

230
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,890
You're crazy.

231
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,510
You've gone mad.

232
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,740
I've been crazy
since waiting for you.

233
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,710
But now,
I want you to stay away from me.

234
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,370
I will never go back
and love you again.

235
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,780
Phu.

236
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,300
You wait and see
for what you do to me.

237
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,280
It won't just end here for sure!

238
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,020
P'Kawee...

239
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,260
why did he resign?

240
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,880
I don't know either.

241
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,760
But I think...

242
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,450
it might have to do with P'Ponfah.

243
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,070
P'Phupha's ex-girlfriend.

244
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,560
Or...

245
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,180
P'Phupha...

246
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,290
wants to reconcile
with his ex-girlfriend?

247
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,310
I don't know.

248
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
If that's really the case...

249
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,800
I pity P'Kawee.

250
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,640
This is how it is, right?

251
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,940
Someone who is secretly in love...

252
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,260
always hurt.

253
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,140
What about you?

254
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,580
Are you hurt?

255
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,580
What do you mean?

256
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,310
For secretly liking me, of course.

257
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,030
It's you who likes me.

258
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,720
That's ridiculous,
you're the one like me.

259
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,320
You like me.

260
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,520
- Really?
- Yes.

261
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,260
I should get the
plate and serve the food.

262
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,320
You're not gonna tell me anything?

263
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,440
That's you.

264
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,440
Are you gonna tell me?

265
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,330
You first.

266
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,510
How about this?

267
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,960
Together.

268
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,870
OK.

269
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,140
1, 2, 3.

270
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,080
- I love you, buddy!
- I love you, buddy!

271
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,080
You're my best friend.

272
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,290
You too.

273
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,230
You're my best fried too.

274
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,430
Shall we eat?

275
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,780
What happened?

276
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,170
I have no idea either.

277
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,060
It's like this when I arrived.

278
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,780
Ponfah!

279
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,110
You.

280
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,770
Do you really wanna do this?

281
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,510
I can't do it anymore.

282
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,080
But we've already gone this far.

283
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,020
But it's alright.

284
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,970
If you made your decision...

285
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,870
I won't stop you.

286
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,730
You really do
have your own cafe.

287
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,000
P'Ponfah?

288
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,770
You already have a cafe...

289
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,710
but still went to
work at Phupha's cafe.

290
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,430
You must really like him.

291
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,840
How did you seduce him
that got him to choose you?

292
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,790
Choose me?

293
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,700
That's right,
he rejected me last night.

294
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,670
He said he chose you.

295
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,070
Let's see...

296
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,460
if you are disfigured...

297
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,360
will he still likes you?

298
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,740
Take care of him!

299
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,350
Bring it!

300
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,580
Bring it on!

301
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,560
Do you think the two of us...

302
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,480
is gonna be at your mercy?

303
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,210
Go!

304
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,620
Let me go!

305
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,040
Let me go!

306
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,010
Shameless!

307
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,140
The guy doesn't you anymore
ad you still this shameless?!

308
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,980
What a smart mouth there.

309
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,640
Don't hurt my friend!

310
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,790
If you wanna hurt someone, hurt me.

311
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,070
No need to say it.

312
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,020
You'll get it anyway.

313
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,370
Let's see if you're disfigured...

314
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,360
Will Phu still likes you?

315
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,040
What are you doing?!

316
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
- Non.
- Paew?

317
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,920
Who are you?

318
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,970
Let go of my
boyfriend and my friend, now!

319
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,830
Bring it!

320
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,750
Handle him, what you
standing there dumbfounded?

321
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,590
Get up now.

322
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,380
Get up! I said get up.

323
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,980
Where are you going?!
Get back here!

324
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,250
Where are you going?

325
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,790
Stop!

326
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,220
Where are you going?

327
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,760
Step aside.

328
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,500
Let her go.

329
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,980
Don't Kawee, let me handle this.

330
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,310
You slapped me, didn't you?

331
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,110
Scold me. Go ahead!

332
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,170
Insult me. You said I have
a smart mouth, didn't you?

333
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,620
- Darling.
- Yes?

334
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,980
- Call the police.
- OK.

335
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,760
I didn't think you
would do this extreme.

336
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,090
It's because of you, Phu.

337
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,140
Don't blame others.

338
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,980
All of these happened...

339
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,350
is because of you.

340
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,730
You can't accept the truth.

341
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,200
What truth?

342
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,000
The truth that Ai'Phu chose Kawee...

343
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,470
and not you.

344
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,220
Why?

345
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,360
Why didn't you think that
when you didn't chose Ai'Phu...

346
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,480
won't he be
doing the same to you?

347
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,110
But no.

348
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,190
Ai'Phu accepted it and
waited for you to come back.

349
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,900
But you were too late.

350
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,860
It's been seven years.
You made him wait like this for seven years.

351
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,150
Honestly...

352
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,900
who wouldn't changed?

353
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,370
Waiting unconditionally...

354
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,470
who can do that?

355
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,540
Enough, Ai'Mai.

356
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,790
Fah.

357
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,830
Do you know...

358
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,860
why Kawee and I won't
press charges against you today?

359
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,510
Because we
want this to end here.

360
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,660
From now on...

361
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,890
You and I...

362
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,250
let's not meet again.

363
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,330
Fine.

364
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,410
Then good luck to
you and your chosen one.

365
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,740
I wish you stay
together for a long time.

366
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,420
Move!

367
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,560
You shouldn't have forgiven her.

368
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,060
Look at her face.

369
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,970
No remorse at all.

370
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,680
It hurts.

371
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,660
What are you waiting for?
Follow him.

372
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,800
Follow him, P'Phupha.

373
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,640
Follow him and
tell him how you feel.

374
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,280
Kawee.

375
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,360
I'm sorry.

376
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,520
Sorry about what?

377
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,080
Sorry about...

378
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,720
being the cause of
your cafe got wrecked.

379
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,750
If it's about that...

380
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,340
it's fine.

381
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,330
It's my own fault.

382
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,570
I chose something
that's against her wish.

383
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,590
That's why she did this.

384
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,400
I have to apologize...

385
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,130
for one more thing.

386
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,070
About lying to you...

387
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,370
about this cafe.

388
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,170
About that...

389
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,990
I already know about it.

390
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,220
You knew?

391
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,760
I know the reason
you went to my cafe.

392
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,140
And the reason you
went to work at my cafe.

393
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,900
How did you know?

394
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,910
P'Paew.

395
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,540
He told you everything?

396
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,270
P'Paew, that bitch P'Paew!

397
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,660
Don't be mad at him.

398
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,950
It was me...

399
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,890
who forced the
answer from P'Paew.

400
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,330
so he told me.

401
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,200
If you knew...

402
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,760
why...

403
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,730
did you still accept me to work?

404
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,370
I don't know.

405
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,800
I only know that at that time...

406
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm happy when I'm with you.

407
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,620
But now...

408
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,600
I know it well...

409
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,580
and very sure of it too.

410
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,440
You know and sure about what?

411
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,820
I know...

412
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,220
that I want you...

413
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,990
to be by my side.

414
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,770
I'm sure that I...

415
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,100
like you.

416
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,390
Don't you joke around to
make me make a shocked face.

417
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,700
I won't fall for your trick.

418
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,010
I really like you.

419
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,910
In the end, all the
couples get a happy ending.

420
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,370
Yes.

421
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,900
I'm very happy for Kawee.

422
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,650
Both for his love and the cafe.

423
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,960
Other couples already
agreed to be official boyfriends

424
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,300
What about you and me?

425
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,550
What's it gonna be?

426
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,950
You and I...

427
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,190
are friends.

428
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,920
Uncle, I'm serious.

429
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,690
What is your feeling for me?

430
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,550
Well...

431
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,910
you're my junior...

432
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,070
and my close friend.

433
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,610
That's it?

434
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,560
OK.

435
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,520
Then I can put
myself in the right place.

436
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,980
Excuse me.

437
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,080
I'm Tonmai.

438
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,170
This is the first time I jog here.

439
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,600
I still don't know the road.

440
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:17,760
If it's not a bother,
mind if I run with you?

441
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,700
It's lonely running alone.

442
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,710
Are you flirting with
me talking like that?

443
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,380
Can I?

444
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,080
No.

445
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,070
You can't.

446
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,710
How can you forbid me
from hitting other people?

447
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,950
Because I'm not allowing you to.

448
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:44,540
Who are you to stop me
from hitting on someone else?

449
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,660
Exactly.

450
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,260
You can't answer me.

451
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,010
Then I'm gonna go
and continue to hit on him.

452
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,620
What if I'm your boyfriend?

453
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,350
Can I stop you?

454
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,080
Do you mean...

455
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,340
you'll be my boyfriend?

456
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,640
Whose boyfriend
should I be then?

457
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,520
What are you doing?

458
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,120
Hugging my boyfriend.

459
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,230
Absurd.

460
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,660
It's embarrassing with
the people around here.

461
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,450
Why?

462
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,720
Boyfriends...

463
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,220
it's normal to show off some love.

464
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,590
It's nothing weird.

465
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,560
Actually...

466
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,140
we're not just boyfriends.

467
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,960
We already did it.

468
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,800
The first time, I was unconscious.

469
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,340
It doesn't count.

470
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,000
Saying like that meaning
you want do it again?

471
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,580
Like when you're conscious?

472
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,670
Dirty-minded kid.

473
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,260
Mr. Noo.

474
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,160
Sawasdee krub.

475
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,580
I'm here to congratulate
you on your cafe's opening.

476
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,190
Thank you.

477
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,100
Kawee, Phupha.
Come here for a sec.

478
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,120
- Yes?
- This is Mr. Noo.

479
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:30,540
He's the boss at
the office where I work.

480
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,490
- This is Phupha.
- Sawasdee krub.

481
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,050
And this is Kawee, my brother.

482
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,360
The owner of the cafe.

483
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,010
P'Gawin, I think you should
take Mr. Noo for a seat.

484
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,410
I'll have my
employees take your order.

485
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,300
Please.

486
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,590
- OK.
- Please, Mr. Noo.

487
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,120
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

488
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,570
Thank you.

489
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,720
Sawasdee krub, the barista couple.

490
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,430
What are you talking about, Pew?!

491
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,920
It's the truth.

492
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,600
Here you go, congratulations.

493
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,750
Thank you.

494
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,140
I wish for your business to
boom and pack with customers.

495
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,230
Thank you.

496
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,130
By the way, where is my sister?

497
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,650
There.

498
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,320
He's with a man.

499
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,490
He's serving coffee to
the customers over there.

500
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,870
And...

501
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,040
I'm happy...

502
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,840
that your sister
finally gets a boyfriend.

503
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,850
She made a merit, remember?

504
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,660
Not to enter a bar for a year.

505
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,420
She made a big wish, this guy
probably fits her specs very much.

506
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,460
Probably is.

507
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,470
So jealous.

508
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,520
Hugging so tightly.

509
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,530
Excuse me.

510
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,640
Thank you everyone for
helping with the cafe's opening.

511
00:31:58,170 --> 00:31:59,500
Yes.

512
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,010
So, N'Jeed.

513
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,090
Are you not gonna introduce
the person you bring along?

514
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,850
This is Nam, my girlfriend.

515
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,180
Sawasdee to everyone again.

516
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,800
Sawasdee krub.

517
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,520
Thank you for helping today.

518
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,180
I think a thank
you is not enough.

519
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,280
That's right.

520
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,930
What else do you want, Paew?

521
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,350
P'Phupha need to
show a cheek kiss to Kawee.

522
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Cheek kiss.

523
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,930
I did what you asked.

524
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,500
Are you happy?

525
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,740
Very happy.

526
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,140
Slow down with that.

527
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,320
Uncle.

528
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:04,280
this means, our couple...

529
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,270
can't admit defeat to other couples.

530
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,060
No.

531
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,480
It's alright.

532
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,710
We'll do it at home.

533
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,180
Then, Kok and I have
to excuse ourselves first.

534
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,790
Otherwise, the restaurant we
often go to eat may be closed later.

535
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,200
We're heading back too.

536
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,090
I need to bring
someone for a shopping.

537
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,810
She's been fussy
about it since this morning.

538
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,100
You already promised me.

539
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,370
We're in a hurry now.

540
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,130
Otherwise there'll be a problem.

541
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,520
In that case,
shall we all go home together?

542
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,760
There's nothing else to do here.

543
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:41,900
Right?

544
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,750
Thank you so much again.

545
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,140
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

546
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,130
See you.

547
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,350
- OK.
- Thank you, Sawasdee krub.

548
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,860
Kok, tomorrow.

549
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,020
OK.

550
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,600
How are you?

551
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,200
Are you happy?

552
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,360
I am.

553
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,350
I thought...

554
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:07,440
I had to sell the cafe.

555
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,090
Thank you.

556
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,860
Thank you...

557
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,270
for making my life...

558
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,650
perfect.

559
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,600
I thank you too.

560
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,500
For making me happy once again.

561
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,860
What are you doing?

562
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,100
Now that you moved in with me...

563
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,120
don't your mother mind?

564
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,010
We've cleared things out.

565
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,020
She isn't particularly OK with it.

566
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,180
But she accept it.

567
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,840
She said that...

568
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,450
my life...

569
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,190
I choose for myself.

570
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,010
She just wants me to
be a good person, that's all.

571
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,120
But I believe...

572
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,280
that at least...

573
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,900
she's OK with it.

574
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,790
Thanks, dude.

575
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,290
For always being by my side.

576
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,930
Having such a good friend like me...

577
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,560
if you go and date someone else...

578
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,270
I'll tell you...

579
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,200
you won't get away with it.

580
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,130
OK, buddy!

581
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,290
OK.

582
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,310
Shall we sleep now? I'm sleepy.

583
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,370
Ai'Kok!

584
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,070
What are you doing?!

585
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,460
By mine, buddy!

586
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,610
Kok!

587
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,300
You can go home now.

588
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,480
It's late.

589
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,950
No.

590
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,540
I want to sleep with you.

591
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,800
Enough, you won't
want to just sleep normally.

592
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,290
We won't be sleeping for sure.

593
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,540
We're boyfriends.

594
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:34,880
Normally we'd be
holding hands when sleeping.

595
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,890
Go, stubborn kid.

596
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,740
Then...

597
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,330
Let's do it tonight...

598
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,470
once, OK?

599
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,660
P'Win.

600
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,160
Are you asleep yet?

601
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,330
I'm coming in, OK?

602
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,640
Let's take a break.

603
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,530
Are you gonna sleep already?

604
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,710
Yes, I'm so tired today.

605
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,410
Who's next to you?

606
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,680
Who?

607
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,420
No one. It's a bolster.

608
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:16,390
What do you want to talk to me?
Hurry then go.

609
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,640
I need to talk to you.

610
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,720
You said you want to
sleep at Phupha's house?

611
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,740
P'Phupha came to
sleep at our house.

612
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,630
So...

613
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,330
that's why I want
to sleep with you.

614
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,810
I'm nervous.

615
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,520
What's to be nervous about?
I want to sleep, don't think too much.

616
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,080
What's with the "Oh"?

617
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,970
P'Tonmai, you can come out now.
No need to hide anymore.

618
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,090
It's not like what you think.

619
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,590
P'Tonmai's shirt and your shirt.

620
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,310
Have at it, I won't bother anymore.

621
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,010
Now that your brother's left.

622
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,070
Let's continue.

623
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,070
Kawee...

624
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,390
are you ready?

625
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,110
Ready for what?

626
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,500
Well...

627
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
ready to sleep.

628
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,560
Kawee, come and hug me to sleep.

629
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,500
Just...

630
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,670
Let's just sleep normally.

631
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,590
Why?

632
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,970
Are you scared?

633
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,100
I've...

634
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,650
never done it.

635
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,780
Never done it...

636
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,290
there's nothing to be afraid of.

637
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,410
I'm afraid.

638
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,790
Don't be afraid.

639
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,830
I will make you lose your fear.

640
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,340
Please trust me, Kawee.

641
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,960
Wee...

642
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,810
Please be mine.

643
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:46,460
Cafe in Love, welcome.

644
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,190
<i>♫ I probably said it many times ♫</i>

645
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,910
<i>♫ There was a time
that you're close to me ♫</i>

646
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,120
<i>♫ It's my dream life ♫</i>

647
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,330
<i>♫ The past days and nights ♫</i>

648
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,380
<i>♫ Perhaps it's a confused memory ♫</i>

649
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:17,410
<i>♫ Not everything is clear ♫</i>

650
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:22,490
<i>♫ Let the time walks by and passes by ♫</i>

651
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,380
<i>♫ It's good when in times I have you ♫</i>

652

<i>♫ Whether it's happiness or
sadness, it doesn't matter ♫</i>

653
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,700
<i>♫ Just having you standing here ♫</i>

654
