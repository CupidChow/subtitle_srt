00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,440

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,420
<i>Ai'Kok, get up now.</i>

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,470
<i>You want me to get up?</i>

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,620
<i>Yes, get up.</i>

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,530
Just do it,Paew.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,620
Kok, I'm sorry.

18
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,410
I'm so scared of cockroaches,
I saw one there.

19
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,350
How are you?

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,700
Are you alright?

21
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,210
Let me help you up, oh dear.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,710
I'm really sorry.

23
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,090
Are you alright? Get up slowly.

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,110
I act rashly if I see cockroaches.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,820
Are you alright?

Kok, what's wrong?

41
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,150
Earlier I went to the
toilet and saw a cockroaches.

42
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,040
So I was shocked,
bumped to him and...

43
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,640
this happened.

44
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,860
Is it serious?

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,580
My wrist hurts.

46
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,190
Probably dislocated.

47
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,620
Here's what we do,
I'm gonna take him to a doctor.

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,770
I leave him to you.

49
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,730
Do you have a waiter?

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,550
I got it.

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,810
Let Kawee help you.

52
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,440
That won't be necessary.

53
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,120
Yes it is.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,490
Here you go.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,270
All done.

56
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,200
Please excuse me
to take him to the doctor.

57
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,840
Sorry to bother you.

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,470
Kok, if there's anything, call me.

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,860
OK.

60
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,250
I bought a snack you like.

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,390
you've eaten so you
need something sweet, right?

62
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,000
Tonmai.

63
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,140
You're really not gonna eat it?

64
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,860
But I had to stand
and queue up for an hour.

65
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,240
I went through hardship
to buy the snack you like.

66
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,490
What a pity.

67
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,310
Alright.

68
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,800
I'll eat it

69
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,050
I'm just afraid I'll make you sad.

70
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,740
It's stuffed inside.

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,280
Is it good?

72
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,390
Well, it's alright.

73
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,590
It's alright...

74
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,040
but you eat a lot.

75
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,840
I told that I'm afraid
that I'll make you sad.

76
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,790
Besides...

77
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,250
you should have
a sore back and legs.

78
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,100
This is how old people are
when waiting in line for too long.

79
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,370
I'm not that old.

80
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,860
Besides, I'm going to buy it and
come to the park to eat with you.

81
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,930
So I bought it.

82
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,830
Why didn't you call me?

83
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,140
I didn't bring my phone.

84
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,040
When I went there, you were gone.

85
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,490
Then how do you know I'm here?

86
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,840
When you're stressed,
you like to be here.

87
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,120
Forgive me already.

88
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,100
What?

89
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,730
I'm not sulking.

90
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,140
Then what you're now,
what's it called?

91
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,270
I'm just hurt.

92
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm hurt that you ignored me.

93
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,210
Never care about me.

94
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,160
Please come in.

95
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:45,470
Thank you.

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,730
You want a coco?

97
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,990
Lemon tea.

98
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,120
- Sawasdee kha.
- Sawasdee kha.
[ Phupha says "Sawasdee kha". It's common for a guy to use "kha"
instead of "krub" towards women to show politeness or sweetness ]

99
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,540
What would you like?

100
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
Do you have a suggestion?

101
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,150
I have so many
suggestion menu, actually.

102
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,860
But for you, Nong...

103
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,800
Nida.

104
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,860
Nida, right?

105
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,150
I think coffee is too bitter for you.

106
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,500
I suggest you take
an iced chocolate.

107
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,530
Great. Then I'll have one iced
chocolate and one slice of cake.

108
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,860
What cake do you want?

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,350
- Orange cake.
- Orange cake, right?

110
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,620
- Yes.
- OK.

111
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,360
Total is 160 baht.

112
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,680
Here you go.

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,540
One hundred...

114
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,070
OK, Nida.

115
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,630
I'll serve them at your table.

116
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,470
- OK.
- Thank you.

117
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,080
Kawee.

118
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,810
Please serve this at table 3.

119
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,250
OK.

120
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,170
By the way...

121
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,840
which one is table 3?

122
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:53,760
There.

123
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,740
OK.

124
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,040
Please.

125
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,850
What will you have?

126
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,190
We'll have two iced coco.

127
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,850
Two iced coco?

128
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,710
Do you want to add some cake?

129
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,870
No?

130
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,120
Working at my cafe is this hard...

131
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,710
do you still want to be my waiter?

132
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,630
If you have me...

133
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,600
I want to.

134
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,780
Why do you want to
work at my cafe so bad?

135
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,480
Well...

136
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,480
I don't have any job.

137
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,070
I want to do whatever I can first.

138
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,960
Besides...

139
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,090
I like the atmosphere in your shop

140
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,460
So the cafe owner...

141
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,090
do you like him?

142
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,960
I'd better go check on the front desk.

143
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,840
"Do you like the owner of the cafe?"

144
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,260
Do you have to ask me that?

145
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
Not in particular.

146
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,330
But I like it so much.

147
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,570
I'm back.

148
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,560
How was it, Ai'Kok?

149
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,460
Just a little twisted wrist,
nothing serious.

150
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,670
P'Phupha, in that case...

151
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,890
N'Kok can only
serve with only one hand.

152
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,870
You need to add one more waiter.

153
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,320
Paew!

154
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,600
I speak the truth.

155
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,830
I can work, P'.

156
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,050
I know you can.

157
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,250
But probably not
as proficient as before.

158
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,390
Actually I agree with you
about having one more waiter.

159
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,940
Yes.

160
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,100
But I don't agree about one thing.

161
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,960
What is it?

162
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,430
P'Phupha calls me P'Paew.

163
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,210
Why don't you call me Nong?

164
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,720
I'm...

165
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,670
is Kawee's friend too.

166
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,820
Alright, N'Paew.

167
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,000
From now on, I'll call you P...

168
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,120
N'Paew.

169
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,560
Also...

170
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,790
about having one more waiter...

171
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,680
if you're willing to work at my cafe...

172
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,850
I'll hire you.

173
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,890
Really?!

174
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,300
Yes.

175
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,450
But I'll probably
hire you as a temporary.

176
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,780
When Kok heals,
we'll talk about it again.

177
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,080
OK, Thank you.

178
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,580
Uncle, keep up
or you'll be left behind.

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,820
Stop!

180
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,720
Keep up, I'm waiting.

181
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,650
If I catch you, you'll die.

182
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,830
Come on, I'm waiting. Hurry up!

183
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,580
Uncle.

184
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,350
Are you alright?

185
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,580
I feel like fainting.

186
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,500
Why am I so tired like this?

187
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,030
It's how it is.

188
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,940
Because you never exercise.

189
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,480
That's why you're tired like this.

190
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,230
I speak the truth.

191
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,790
How about this?

192
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,720
Starting tomorrow...

193
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,320
you need to
exercise with me everyday.

194
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,640
After work.

195
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,820
OK?

196
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,590
Not OK.

197
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,020
So you're OK with it, right?

198
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,590
Well, that's what we'll do.

199
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,110
I told you I'm not OK with it.

200
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,770
I said you're OK with it!

201
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,820
Fine then!

202
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,830
Uncle!

203
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,140
What are you doing?

204
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,710
You've seen
me without any clothes...

205
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,710
you think you can get away with it?

206
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,320
Uncle, hold on.

207
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,530
Did you forget that actually...

208
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,900
we've seen each
others' since the first day.

209
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,130
Why are you embarrassed about?

210
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,670
You're right.

211
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,580
Yeah, that's right. Let me go.

212
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,950
Honestly...

213
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,900
I wasn't thinking about spying it.

214
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,520
But when I turned
around to ask you something...

215
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,890
I happened to saw it.

216
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,650
Someone like you?

217
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,890
I don't believe it.

218
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,710
Wat are you doing?

219
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,010
I'm letting you see it.

220
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,210
So we're even.

221
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,900
Now, we're even.

222
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,590
Then...

223
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,920
let's continue.

224
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,860
Let's go for a jog
so you won't be too tired.

225
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,100
- Fine.
- Come.

226
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,300
Let's go.

227
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,490
Kok, how will you go home?
Want me to give you a ride?

228
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,830
It's alright, I can get a taxi.

229
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,340
It's better I give you a ride.

230
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,940
Kok!

231
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,200
P, Sawasdee krub.

232
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,300
Sawasdee krub.

233
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,990
Why are you here?

234
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,280
I'm picking you up.

235
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,980
I told you, didn't I?

236
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,470
Let's just go home, hurry.

237
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,420
OK.

238
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,830
- I'm going home now. Sawasdee krub.
- That's your taxi?

239
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,530
- Sawasdee krub.
- OK.

240
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,430
Let's go.

241
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:26,030
Kawee, it's your turn.

242
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,340
Let's go.

243
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,970
Just a moment.

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,920
Paew is in the toilet.
He hasn't come out yet.

245
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,530
Hello, Paew?

246
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,350
Where are you?

247
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,650
What are you doing in the toilet?

248
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,130
You're taking too long.

249
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,190
What?!

250
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,390
You drove home with my car?!

251
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,520
You're home now?

252
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,800
Hello? Paew?

253
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,350
Hello?

254
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,920
Paew!

255
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,160
What's wrong?

256
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,870
Paew drove my car home already.

257
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,410
That Sis Paew.

258
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,580
Then...

259
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,700
Want me to drive you home?

260
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,220
It's fine, I...

261
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,490
No rejection.

262
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,170
You've helped me with
my work all day today.

263
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,220
You didn't even want
a single baht from me.

264
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,190
Consider this a repayment.

265
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,720
OK.

266
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,960
P'Phupha give you a ride?

267
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,130
P'Phupha give you a ride?

268
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:47,130
Lure him until the end, my friend

269
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,390
Stop.

270
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,920
Your hand hurts.

271
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,330
I'll take it off for you.

272
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,720
Thanks.

273
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,590
What about you?

274
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,300
Why did you picked me up?

275
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,810
Because your hand hurts.

276
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,830
I'm worried so I came.

277
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,830
How did you know?

278
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,700
Did you forget?

279
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,110
I called you when you
were at the hospital.

280
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,420
Yeah.

281
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,930
I forgot!

282
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,540
By the way...

283
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,820
how did you got out?

284
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,690
You said you have to sleep at
home and have a dinner at home.

285
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,880
Well, I told my mom I left
my book in my friend's room.

286
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,260
So I...

287
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,650
came to take it.

288
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,470
Thanks.

289
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,200
Then...

290
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,470
I have to go now.

291
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,180
You...

292
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,620
take good care of yourself.

293
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,570
Yes. Ride safely.

294
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm leaving.

295
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,780
OK, see you.

296
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,340
Don't ride too fast.

297
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,430
120.

298
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,980
That's too much.

299
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,270
- Bye.
- See you.

300
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,310
We're here.

301
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,000
Thank you for the ride.

302
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,070
See you on Monday, Kawee.

303
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,900
OK.

304
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,810
Kawee.

305
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,780
Yes?

306
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,900
I...

307
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,680
can I have your LINE?

308
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,530
Sure.

309
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,720
So I can...

310
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,980
talk to you about work.

311
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
Here you go.

312
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,250
Thank you.

313
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,910
Then, I have to go now.

314
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,700
You're teasing me
almost every day lately.

315
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,180
Are you just playing...

316
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,120
or being serious?

317
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,370
Yes, you can come in.

318
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,840
What's up?

319
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,590
What is this?

320
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,860
I noticed that you're on a
mission to lure a guy, right?

321
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,150
Try this.

322
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,960
It might make you
skin fair and beautiful.

323
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,970
Then Phupha will like it.

324
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,230
Thank you.

325
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,310
About Phupha...

326
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:47,510
How was it?

327
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,310
P'Phupha is hiring employee.

328
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,870
I got to be a waiter.

329
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,420
You'll see...

330
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,880
I'll make him fall in love with me.

331
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,830
But from what I've seen,
more like it's you...

332
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,290
that have fallen in love with him.

333
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,360
Think carefully, Wee.

334
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,300
If you want to quit...

335
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,630
there is still time.

336
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,850
I admit that I...

337
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,550
love him.

338
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,270
But I have to restrain myself.

339
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,860
He already has a lover,
you know this.

340
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,520
Everything I did...

341
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,200
is for the cafe.

342
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,990
If you're tired...

343
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,340
put a stop to it.

344
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,830
I can take care of us by myself.

345
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,650
Mom and Dad...

346
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,750
will probably understand.

347
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,340
If the cafe can't go on.

348
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,970
You have to trust me.

349
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,160
I can do it.

350
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,020
By the way...

351
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,680
love...

352
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,600
between men, how is it?

353
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,140
Why do you ask
me that all the sudden?

354
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,740
Well...

355
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,560
I want to know how's
the love of brother is like.

356
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,830
Actually...

357
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,930
it's...

358
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,110
it's like a normal love
between men and women.

359
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,390
It's not weird at all?

360
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,250
I mean like...

361
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,140
when other people look at us.

362
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,710
We're in this age now.

363
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,290
It's normal.

364
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,980
But there might be some people...

365
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,420
those that look at it as weird.

366
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,140
But...

367
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,320
Love is between two people.

368
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,480
They're not the one who love us.

369
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,420
However they want to see us as...

370
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,140
that's their business.

371
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,280
Then...

372
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,700
when out on a date...

373
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,450
like having sweet moments...

374
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,940
holding hands and arms in
arms like men and women?

375
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,180
Holding hands and arms in arms.

376
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:11,720
That's up to the couple.

377
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,490
Another thing...

378
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,830
about sex...

379
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,980
how are we gonna know who's
the top and who's the bottom?

380
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,340
How should I say this?

381
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,740
Actually if the
couple talk to each other...

382
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,690
after some talks...

383
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,820
they'll know by themselves.

384
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,260
But...

385
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,700
supposedly if you really wanna know...

386
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,910
you have to ask him directly.

387
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,940
But...

388
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,360
hold on.

389
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,860
You're asking as if you're...

390
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,760
you decided to like a guy.

391
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,300
What like?

392
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,340
Nonsense.

393
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,710
I'm just asking...

394
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,520
because I want to know what
kind of love my brother is having.

395
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,930
I want to understands you.

396
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:14,970
Really?

397
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,920
You are so cute.

398
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,420
What is this?

399
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,980
You're grown up but
acting all soft like a kid.

400
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:30,220
I'll always be your little brother.

401
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,520
By the way, today...

402
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,630
sleep with me, OK?

403
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,750
Please?

404
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,860
Please?

405
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,610
Alright. Let me go.

406
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,040
Move to give me space.

407
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,420
Come.

408
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,200
What are you doing?

409
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,540
I just want to hug my
brother like when I was a kid.

410
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,790
Why?

411
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,300
I can't hug you?

412
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,470
Such a baby.

413
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
You don't have
to pick me up, honestly.

414
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,150
We can just
meet at the restaurant.

415
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,560
Stop talking.

416
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,010
Your hand is hurt.

417
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,950
Why do you want
to squeeze into the bus.

418
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,390
I can take a cab.

419
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,220
So rich, aren't you?

420
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,260
Enough, let's go. I'm hungry.

421
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,300
- OK.
- Wait.

422
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,600
You...

423
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,710
never dress up properly.

424
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,810
Because I know I have you
to see and check all the time.

425
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,260
- Really?
- Yes.

426
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,470
Let's go already.

427
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,500
Kok.

428
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,280
How's your hand?

429
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,360
Is it hurt badly?

430
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,050
- Well...
- It's getting better.

431
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,150
I took care of him.

432
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,540
Guys taking care of each other...

433
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,100
without a woman present?

434
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,300
Women more
careful and gentle anyway.

435
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,040
I'm fine.
Thank you so much Jeed.

436
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,960
I'm OK now that
Tai is looking after me.

437
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,090
Then, we should go.

438
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,290
Or we'll be late.

439
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,600
I have to go now.
Thank you so much Jeed.

440
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,230
OK, it's alright. I'm sincere.

441
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,140
How are you, buddy?

442
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,750
I'm good.

443
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:45,250
Where have you been?
What were you up to?
Haven't seen you lately.

444
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,590
You were missing in action.

445
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,880
I wasn't going anywhere.

446
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,750
I have work to do.

447
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,270
A guy like you have work too?

448
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,120
Don't let me find out...

449
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,840
that you're eyeing on someone.

450
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,310
Who?

451
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,440
Eyeing what?

452
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,970
Are you crazy?

453
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,450
Are you secretly
eyeing for N'Kawee?

454
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,120
If I am eyeing for him...

455
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,750
I would do it at your cafe.

456
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,140
I noticed he went there everyday.

457
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,630
What?

458
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,550
The coffee at my cafe is delicious.

459
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,460
And you might eyeing for
him at some other places.

460
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,390
No.

461
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,160
Let's stop talking about this.

462
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,260
Fine.

463
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,980
So...

464
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,650
are you here to
help me with something?

465
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,700
What's the matter?

466
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,200
Stay still.

467
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,370
O.

468
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,890
What's wrong?

469
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,240
Dude.

470
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,490
Hug me.

471
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,470
- What?
- Yes.

472
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,930
Please hug me.

473
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,440
For real?

474
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,100
Hurry up, hug me.

475
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:14,310
Come.

476
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,790
What's the matter?

477
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,090
Thank you so much, my friend.

478
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,030
Are you sick or did
someone did something to you?

479
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,470
I think...

480
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,860
it might be the latter.

481
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,280
That bad?

482
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,610
Will you tell me?

483
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,210
Who is it?

484
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,060
It's nothing.

485
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,070
Let's just say...

486
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,440
I'm happy now.

487
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,000
Didn't you say
you're going to get a drink?

488
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,000
You can do it now.

489
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,390
Quickly, I'm thirsty.

490
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,820
What the hell? Changing subject?
-  Hurry up, I'm thirsty.

491
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:07,900
You go get it now.

492
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,490
- Damn you.
- I'll wait here, hurry.

493
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,830
My throat is dry here.

494
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,530
My heart didn't shake.

495
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,480
It didn't beat faster.

496
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,310
Uncle!

497
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,660
What are you doing?

498
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,340
You've seen me without any clothes,
you think you can get away with it?

499
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,340
It's beating so fast.

500
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,370
Just thinking about it got me shaken.

501
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,450
Actually I can just send it to you.

502
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,400
I might have to read it tonight.

503
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,170
I have finished
reading all other subjects.

504
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,460
You're studying hard.

505
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,760
You too.

506
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,980
You and Tai...

507
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,420
look so close.

508
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,440
Have you known long?

509
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,670
Yes.

510
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,410
No wonder you guys look so close.

511
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,780
Yes, I only have
him as my close friend.

512
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,430
Before...

513
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,510
we always do everything together.

514
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,060
So...

515
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,860
Tai has no girlfriend?

516
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:08,410
Ever since I've known him...

517
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,160
I never seen him with a girlfriend.

518
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,580
He once told me...

519
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,320
having me as his friend...

520
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,810
he doesn't need a girlfriend anymore.

521
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,750
What about you?

522
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,720
Don't you want to have a girlfriend?

523
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,150
I haven't thought about that.

524
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,380
I...

525
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,650
still can't take care of myself.

526
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,240
Besides, I don't have the time.

527
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,910
You're not lonely?

528
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,870
Sometimes.

529
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,060
but not much.

530
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,090
Might be because...

531
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,230
I have Tai by my side, perhaps.

532
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,460
I'm gonna be honest.

533
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:51,730
I think...

534
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,380
Tai likes you.

535
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,180
Really?

536
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,890
From what I've observed...

537
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,530
Tai seems...

538
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,340
worried about you more
than a close friend would.

539
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,180
Whatever happens,
he always think of you first.

540
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,570
When he sees me with you...

541
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,910
he seems upset like he's jealous.

542
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,690
I think...

543
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,310
Tai is worried about you
too much, more than a friend.

544
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,350
He doesn't like me.

545
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,340
He's being nice to me...

546
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,990
because he feels guilty, that's all.

547
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,670
Feels guilty?

548
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,250
About what?

549
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,040
It's nothing.

550
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,380
Let's just say...

551
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,180
he doesn't like me.

552
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,020
Are you jogging by yourself?

553
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,350
Are you asking me?

554
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,740
Yes.

555
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,580
I'm jogging with my senior.

556
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,980
Where? I only see you alone.

557
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,620
He'll be here.

558
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,380
Do you come jogging here often?

559
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,620
Started not too long ago.

560
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,320
No wonder you don't look familiar.

561
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,620
I'm Beth.

562
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,050
Tonmai.

563
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,280
I jog here often,
if you want a jogging partner...

564
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,870
you can invite me.

565
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,200
OK.

566
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,350
Can I have your LINE?

567
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,780
Troublemaker!

568
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,920
Uncle, you're here?

569
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,300
I've waited for so long.

570
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,130
You see me now,
that means I'm here.

571
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,850
What are you angry about?

572
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,290
Is this your uncle?

573
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,190
Yes.

574
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,030
Sawasdee krub, Uncle.

575
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,970
Sawasdee krub.

576
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,890
I haven't gotten your LINE yet, Tonmai.

577
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,910
I'm gonna go jog first.

578
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,290
Please excuse me, see you next time.

579
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,690
Wait, Tonmai!
I haven't gotten your LINE yet!

580
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,440
Uncle!

581
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,780
Uncle, what are you angry at me about?

582
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,160
Uncle!

583
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,940
What's your problem?

584
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,150
Nothing.

585
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,750
What nothing?
I can see there's something wrong.

586
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,350
I'm fine.

587
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,060
I was focusing on jogging.

588
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,450
OK, if you say so.

589
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,500
From now on, I don't have to
accompany you jogging anymore.

590
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,300
Why?

591
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,410
I saw that women asked for your LINE.

592
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:02,880
After this,
you'll just jog with the woman.

593
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,050
I'm not important anymore.

594
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,720
Talking like this, that means...

595
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,190
you're sulking?

596
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,960
What sulking?

597
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,720
Don't be ridiculous.

598
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,040
If you're not sulking, that means...

599
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,830
you're jealous.

600
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,900
Are you crazy?
Why do I have to be jealous?

601
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,420
Because...

602
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,140
you like me.

603
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,670
Crazy kid!

604
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:37,100
Can you hear me?!
I don't like you!

605
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,230
I'm a small lady,
why did you dragged me here?

606
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,810
I don't like this kind
of beating people around.

607
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,550
The first time,
you're the one dragged me here.

608
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,570
That was at first.

609
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:03,070
But right now, you can just
lure P'Phupha on your own.

610
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,170
You're my friend,
I need you to be with me.

611
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,410
Come on.

612
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,770
Besides you can play
with those young men.

613
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,670
Young men?

614
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,710
Withh six packs?

615
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,010
You're right!

616
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,850
Young men!

617
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,630
Let's punch here.

618
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,700
Hurry up, hurry up, young men.

619
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,810
P'Phupha.

620
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,050
Kawee.

621
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,040
Are you here to practice boxing?

622
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,000
There.

623
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,820
Paew drag me here.

624
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,820
He's working really hard.

625
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,140
I remember that last time,
your brother came to practice.

626
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,990
Where's your brother this time?

627
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,130
My brother is busy lately.

628
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,240
So he's not coming.

629
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,020
Then today...

630
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,520
would you want to box with me?

631
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,020
I do.

632
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,880
Last time, we did some kicking. Today...

633
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,230
shall we try with the knees?

634
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,710
OK.

635
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,090
This time won't be hard,
you need to grab my shoulder...

636
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:39,320
then pull your knee up
and hit the white spot here.

637
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,420
- OK.
- Pull your knee up this side.

638
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,440
OK.

639
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,620
Try.

640
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,830
Come.

641
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,510
- Left side now.
- OKK.

642
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,480
What are you doing?

643
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,110
What's going on?

644
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,470
Are you alright?

645
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,830
Let's try it again.

646
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,680
OK, N'Kawee.

647
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,800
They didn't see me, perhaps.

648
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,850
There's only the two
of you in this world, I guess.

649
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,560
I've died and became a spirit, I guess.

650
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,560
How was it?

651
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,180
Finished with your sweetness?

652
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,060
What crazy sweetness?
That's nonsense.

653
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,680
"Pull up your knee, please."

654
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,510
"That's it, good."

655
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,270
That's enough.

656
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,140
I'm gonna go buy some drinks.

657
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,460
Do you want some?

658
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,530
Green tea.

659
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,730
Sure thing.

660
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,500
Water, Kawee.

661
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,020
Thank you.

662
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,180
My drink means nothing again.

663
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,140
I'll drink them myself.

664
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,700
Are you that thirsty?

665
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,770
I sweat a lot after exercising.

666
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,280
I'm fainting.

667
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,920
Are you really fainting?

668
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,950
For real. I'm fainting.

669
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,190
If you don't wakke up...

670
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,590
I'll kiss you.

671
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,350
I won't wake up for sure,
please kiss.

672
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,230
Kiss me, I won't wake up.

673
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,260
Awake now?

674
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,540
Not enough, kiss more.

675
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,130
I'm gonna faint.

676
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,750
I'm here!

677
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,380
Again?

678
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,060
Turn around quickly.

679
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,520
And put some clothes on.

680
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,830
You're so think-skinned (shameless).

681
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,300
No need to
feel embarrassed I suppose.

682
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,580
You said you're used to it.

683
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,590
That's true.

684
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,530
But you're Thai, right?

685
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,870
Why are you here?

686
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,400
You said you'll be
sleeping at home for 3 to 4 days.

687
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,830
I brought your favorite duck.

688
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,930
My mother bought three.

689
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,110
So I secretly took one for you.

690
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,910
Eat it, I've cut it for you.

691
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,440
You always worried about me.

692
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,670
Thank you so much.

693
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,270
No big deal.

694
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,540
I don't need much in life.

695
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,670
Just so you're not angry at me...

696
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,290
and to always have
you in life is enough for me.

697
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,270
Ai'Tai.

698
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,530
Don't you think about having a lover?

699
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,800
Why do you ask me this?

700
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:01,070
Nothing.

701
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,660
I just want to know.

702
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,990
Or you already
have someone you like?

703
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,600
Yes, something like that.

704
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,830
I have to go now.

705
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,070
The duck, eat a lot, OK?

706
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,990
What are you hugging me for?
Let me go.

707
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,890
I'm not letting you go until...

708
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,520
you bless me because today...

709
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,040
it's my first day working.

710
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,550
Bless me a little.

711
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,790
I will bless you.

712
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,800
But you need to let me go first.

713
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,400
I'm not letting
you go until you bless me.

714
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,470
Let me go first then I bless you.

715
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,800
No.

716
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:15,030
Bless me first.

717
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,590
Let him go.

718
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,330
P'Tonmai?

<i>♫ Like the days when you are by my side ♫</i>

741
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,040
<i>♫ It's good when in times I have you ♫</i>

742
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,100
<i>♫ Whether it's happiness or
sadness, it doesn't matter ♫</i>

743
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,360
<i>♫ Just having you standing here ♫</i>

744
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:58,030
<i>♫ Stay here and we'll go together ♫</i>

745
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,180
<i>♫ And I will take you away ♫</i>
