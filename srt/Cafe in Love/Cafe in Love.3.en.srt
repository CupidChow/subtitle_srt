17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,230
I don't know, I didn't talk to
him when I was heading out.

18
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,460
Does he has any bad
reaction that he can't drink?

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,060
I don't know.

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,740
P'Wee.

21
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,590
He followed you earlier

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,060
Yes.

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,140
How do you know?

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,030
I got it from lakorns.

25
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,430
Korean?

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,210
It's from Thai lakorn,
if it's Korean it's called series.

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,990

I think...

38
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,150

Talk to me, Kawee.

131
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,420
Actually, I didn't see anything.

132
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,350
I tried to look but
yours are too small.

133

I'm not.

142
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,200
You're being ridiculous.

143
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:54,360
Really?

144
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,790
I'm not. Let me go,
I want to go home.

145
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,130
I'm not letting you go.

146
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:04,040
Until you tell me what
you're thinking just now.

147
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,150
If you don't say it...

148
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,800
then don't go home.

149
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,790
I will count to 3.

150

153
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,300
Just gie it a go.

154
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,020
Sawasdee, please excuse me.

155
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,350
What's all this, Ai'Phu?

156
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,960
What?

157
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,720
Well...

158
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,170
with that kid...

159
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,960
It's nothing.

160
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,890
Are you sure it's nothing?

161
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,660
If there's nothing...

162
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,260
then why is he running in a hurry?

163
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,690
I don't know,
he's rushing home probably.

164
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,710
Rushing home?

165
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,160
This is your house.

166
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,170
How can you let
someone else sleeps here?

167
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,300
Well...

168
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,410
he was wasted last night.

169
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,800
So I brought him here to sleep.

170
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,820
Why are you asking too much?

171
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,280
I'm gonna go shower.

172
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,530
What's wrong with you, Phupha?

173
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,410
How can I kissed his cheeks?

174
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,500
What he did...

175
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,770
he did it just to escape, right?

176
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,820
Yes.

177
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,630
I only did it to escape.

178
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,940
He should understand.

179
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,090
He'll not be mad at me, right?

180
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,580
Please don't be mad at me.

181
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,740
Please?

182
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,270
Where is he?

183
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,580
Is he not here yet?

184
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,720
Who are you looking for?

185
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,420
No one.

186
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,720
I'm not looking.

187
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,420
What are you doing
standing all frantic here?

188
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,760
I saw you and thought you
were looking for someone.

189
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,380
No, I'm not looking for anyone.

190
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,140
Really?

191
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,960
Then you're
stretching out your head...

192
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,530
what's the matter?

193
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,750
My back hurts so bad.

194
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm in pain often lately. Constantly.

195
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,200
My back is in bad shape.

196
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,410
Back is in bad shape.

197
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,680
I think should be the one in pain.

198
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,060
Both right and left side.

199
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,240
I don't know what
happened last night.

200
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,790
The pain is so heavy.

201
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,610
You said you didn't do anything to me.

202
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,010
Then what's with the back pain?

203
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,980
What's so heavy?

204
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,520
Did...

205
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,000
you do something to me?

206
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,000
Calm down.

207
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,110
When I said I'm having back pain...

208
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,480
Because I carried you
home to a taxi last night.

209
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,190
What kind a guy that's short...

210
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,100
but so heavy.

211
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,410
It's concealed by your looks.

212
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,390
I carried you and now I'm sore all over.

213
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,490
What were you thinking?

214
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,660
Nothing.

215
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,450
Where are you going?

216
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,510
Wanna have some coffee with me?

217
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,910
Sorry for kissing your cheek.

218
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,740
What were you making merit of ?
Why can't you enter a bar?

219
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,540
What merit?

220
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,240
I was making a merit
for my shop of course.

221
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,520
Really?

222
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,380
I want my shop to sell well.

223
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,120
Your shop already did great.

224
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,130
Tell me what did you made merit of.

225
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,530
Forget about the merit.

226
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,080
By the way, last night...

227
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,650
how did you went home?

228
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,220
Me?

229
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,420
I went home by taxi.

230
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,510
E'Pew told me...

231
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,300
that you...

232
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,940
went with P'Phupha.

233
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,390
Then you're gone!

234
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,610
No!

235
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,540
I went home to Pew's room.

236
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,420
How can you
went back to Pew's room?

237
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,680
Pew drank until morning.

238
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,750
I was the one who picked
her up and get him home.

239
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,510
You left with P'Phupha, didn't you?

240
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,130
No!

241
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,380
I...

242
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,420
didn't went to his house!

243
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,030
You went to his house, didn't you?

244
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,150
Didn't you?

245
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,430
You went to his house, didn't you?!

246
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,980
Come back here!

247
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,850
You think you can escape from me?

248
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,950
Tell me!

249
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,350
Tell you what, Sis?

250
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,810
I told you not to call me "Sis".

251
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,170
Because you're older than me.

252
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,360
So what?

253
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,130
We're friends. Just call me "kae"(you) is enough.
<i>[ "Kae" is often used by female friends when addressing
each other, you heard them quite often in Thai series ]</i>

254
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,590
But...

255
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,350
Don't force me to use strong words!

256
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,460
You were sleeping with
P'Phupha last night, didn't you?!

257
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,950
Yes.

258
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,850
I slept at P'Phupha's house.

259
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,030
But we didn't do anything.

260
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,170
I was drunk, when I woke up
I was already in his house.

261
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,460
You really are stupid.

262
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,090
You got to his house.

263
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,970
You should've "settled" with him.

264
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,160
Are you crazy?

265
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,540
Why would I do that?

266
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,080
Did you forget?

267
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,880
That you're doing this for this cafe?

268
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,100
If you can build a relationship
with him, anything will be easier.

269
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,670
Opportunity like this...

270
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,730
you shouldn't have let it go.

271
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,720
Come in.

272
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,090
Kok?

273
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,000
Jeed?

274
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,360
You're working here?

275
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,410
Yes.

276
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,770
I came around here many
times but haven't been here once.

277
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,040
If I knew you're working here,
I'll be here a long time ago.

278
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,710
Have a sit.

279
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,380
Where have you been?
You haven't been to class for 2 days.

280
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,290
I was busy so I didn't go to class.

281
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,640
But that's alright,
I've taken the lecture notes for you.

282
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,380
What do you want, just order.

283
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,820
It'll be my treat.

284
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,000
I made this for you.

285
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,830
Who's that?

286
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,010
My friend.

287
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,190
It's nothing, what do you like to have?

288
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,470
Then I'll have a hot mocha.

289
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,790
Hot mocha.

290
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,330
Sure thing.

291
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,910
That's it?

292
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,530
OK, I'll have it ready for you.

293
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,480
Why are you pulling me here?

294
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,360
Let me go.

295
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,970
Come with me, don't worry about it.

296
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,260
Fine.

297
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,900
You're not coming nicely, right?

298
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,790
What are you doing? Let me go!

299
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,580
Where are you going?

300
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,370
Work.

301
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,700
Have a sit first, you can go later.

302
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,830
Hey.

303
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,350
I'm working in an office.

304
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,180
Now the lunch break is over.

305
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,630
I have to work.

306
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,480
I'm not as free as you.

307
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,790
Can't you sit with me first?

308
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,560
I don't know what you're stressing about.

309
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,130
What you're facing and
what problem you're having.

310
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,510
If you're only siting here and sigh...

311
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,670
it's not gonna help
you with your problem.

312
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,040
We all have our problem.

313
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,920
It's up to you...

314
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,260
on whether you want to solve the
problem or avoid the problem.

315
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,670
What you're doing now...

316
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,440
is avoiding from your problem.

317
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,560
And it's not a good way to do it.

318
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,640
Fight for it.

319
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,300
Why are you
sitting here and sighing?

320
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,410
You made this yourself?

321
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,630
What did you cook for me?

322
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,660
What did you cook for me?

323
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,760
If you want to know, then open it.

324
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,680
There's banana too.

325
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,930
You made rice with omelette for me?

326
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,000
Why?

327
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,800
Before I could accomplish that,
I lost a whole tray of eggs you know.

328
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,790
Just an omelette and you
used a whole tray of eggs?

329
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,220
Yes!

330
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,050
I never done this before.

331
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,610
I can't cook either.

332
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,240
And they all burned with
only this remains. The best one.

333
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,010
Is it edible?

334
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,030
Why are you saying that?
Give it here.

335
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,290
I'm eating it.

336
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,390
I'm just kidding,
why do you have to get upset?

337
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,710
It's quite good.

338
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,140
I want some too.

339
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,750
No, you made this for me, didn't you.

340
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,850
I'm not giving it to you.

341
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,200
I want some too.

342
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,250
Alright, fine.

343
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,580
Here, eat on your own.

344
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,630
Are you not gonna feed me?

345
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,480
Fine, I'll feed you.

346
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,830
How's it?

347
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,950
Is it good?

348
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,490
Of course, I made it myself.

349
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,890
You're boasting.

350
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,720
You almost eat the whole box.

351
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,650
Fine, fine, I admit.

352
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,820
Kok, can you give
this to P'Phupha for me?

353
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,890
Sure thing.

354
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,610
Why don't you give it yourself?

355
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,670
Kok, back to work.

356
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,050
OK.

357
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,010
Why do you have to
ask Kok to give it to me?

358
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,320
Well...

359
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,550
Or you're shy...

360
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:55,490
about secretly kissed
my cheek this morning?

361
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,580
Turn your face here and talk to me.

362
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,080
Kissed my cheek and
thinking of running from me?

363
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,670
In that case, shall I kiss you back?

364
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,600
Is no one gonna help me?

365
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,140
Let me help.

366
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,200
Thank you.

367
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,840
Slowly.

368
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,350
I'm Noom.

369
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,720
I'm Paew.

370
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,720
I'm single, rich and will love sincerely.

371
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,390
- Are you hurt?
- Yes.

372
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,730
Hurts.

373
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,370
Slowly.

374
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,080
Thank you.

375
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,930
Don't mention it.

376
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,120
Are you hurt?

377
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,950
Don't ask.

378
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,530
Not a single one of
you help me when I fell.

379
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,900
What were you doing?

380
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,750
I saw it.

381
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,480
You two were going to
kiss each others' cheeks.

382
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,320
No, P'Paew.

383
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,480
No one is kissing anyone's cheek.

384
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,490
That's right, no one's kissing. No one.

385
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,000
But I saw you were about
to kiss each others' cheeks

386
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,050
No, we were just
standing and talking.

387
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,850
That's right,
we're standing far apart too.

388
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,430
Out of sudden...

389
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,190
who's gonna kiss each others' cheeks.

390
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,480
Really?

391
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,380
Or was I dreaming?

392
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,050
But I saw it.

393
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Yes, they were gonna kiss.

394
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,870
I saw it.

395
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,490
I saw you two were gonna
kiss each others' cheeks!

396
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,040
Where did they go?

397
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,420
Why are they avoiding me?

398
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,680
I'm not crazy.

399
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,140
Or am I crazy?

400
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,510
I think we've escaped him.

401
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,690
Where are you going?

402
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,830
Nowhere.

403
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,460
Why did you kissed
my cheek this morning?

404
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,030
I was just trying to escape, P'.

405
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,290
You were not gonna let me go.

406
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,260
So I'm not wrong.

407
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,140
Smells good?

408
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,270
My cheek.

409
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,050
Was it smells good?

410
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,340
Kawee.

411
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,650
I'm asking if my cheek...

412
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,800
smells good?

413
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,780
I should ask you.

414
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,590
Earlier...

415
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:50,990
were you really gonna kiss my cheek?

416
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,530
You're good at changing the subject.

417
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,290
I didn't.

418
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,930
But if you answer, I'll answer.

419
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,970
What's in your mind then?

420
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,640
What's in your mind...

421
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,260
I think the same too.

422
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,900
He did?

423
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,800
He's gone?

424
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,300
You don't want the shirt back?

425
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,450
Thank you for the ride.

426
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,640
I'm hungry.

427
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,420
Hungry?

428
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,450
Then go find something to eat.

429
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,760
Why are you telling me?

430
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,330
I'm hungry.

431
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
Then go find something to eat.

432
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,880
What's your problem?

433
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,260
You're not gonna invite
me for dinner in your house?

434
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,520
Why should I?

435
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,260
Aren't that too mean?

436
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,800
I gave you a ride home.

437
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,610
Don't you think about repaying me?

438
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,760
You're the one who voluntarily
wants to send me home.

439
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,610
I told you not to.

440
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,390
That's true, I volunteered.

441
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,210
But you can be nice to me, right?

442
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,470
In my house...

443
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,980
there's nothing to eat.

444
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,030
My hand is also hurt.

445
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,570
I can't cook for you.

446
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,200
Go eat at a restaurant.

447
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,610
No. I want to eat in your house.

448
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,560
You brat.

449
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,940
This uncle.

450
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,390
You're calling me uncle now?

451
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,510
Just "P" will do I think.

452
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,640
No, I will call you "uncle".

453
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,000
Uncle, uncle, uncle.

454
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,490
Why are you following me?

455
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm hungry.

456
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,490
Here.

457
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,180
Eat.

458
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,820
What the heck?

459
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,440
I was wondering what I'll get to eat...

460
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,980
but it's only an instant noodles.

461
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,300
You're not gonna eat, right?

462
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,650
Yes, yes, I want.

463
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,110
So, you're not gonna eat?

464
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,720
You can't even invite me
to your house for dinner.

465
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,660
I have to eat
instant noodles at the park.

466
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,050
What are you
complaining so much?

467
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,950
Hurry eat and go home.

468
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,700
You're chasing me away.

469
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,450
Think whatever you want.

470
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,180
I'll eat slowly then.

471
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,910
P'.

472
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:34,780
Yes?

473
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,970
The cafe is closed.

474
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
What close?

475
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,020
It's not the closing time yet.

476
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,340
P'Phupha called and said
I can close the cafe already.

477
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,690
He has work to do.

478
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,510
Where's Wee gone to?

479
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,430
I saw P'Kawee
drove home already.

480
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,490
Drove home?

481
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,490
He left me again.

482
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,570
How am I gonna go home now?

483
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,170
Please excuse me then.

484
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,350
How am I gonna go home now?

485
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,710
He always left me behind.

486
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,110
Do you want me to drive you home?

487
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,880
Is that OK?

488
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,190
Yes.

489
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,920
OK.

490
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,550
Come.

491
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,650
Kawee?

492
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,400
P'Phupha?

493
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,620
Don't tell me...

494
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,080
it's another
coincident that we met here?

495
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,700
Yes.

496
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,650
The coincidence is too often that I
think you're secretly following me.

497
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,660
I'm not.

498
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:46,960
Besisdes I like coming to this park.

499
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,780
I was joking.

500
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,560
Again?

501
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,400
You always tease me.

502
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,490
So...

503
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,380
what are you doing here today?

504
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,720
Just taking a walk.

505
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,800
What about you?

506
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,870
I came here to recall past memories.

507
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,510
What memory?

508
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:18,840
It's nothing.

509
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,550
Wanna take a walk?

510
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,510
Why are you grabbing my hand?

511
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,270
I've walked but you didn't follow.

512
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,930
Or you legs are too short
that you can't follow my steps?

513
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,240
You're calling me short?!

514
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,460
Or is it not true?

515
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,520
I have the standard
height of a Thai male.

516
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,200
It's you who are too tall.

517
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,390
Let's go.

518
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,830
Kok.

519
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,220
Jeed?

520
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,160
Are you here for a coffee?
The cafe is closed.

521
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,120
No, I'm here to see you.

522
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,030
Me?

523
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,590
Yes.

524
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,260
I've brought the lecture
note during the class for you.

525
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,210
I'm afraid you won't be able to keep
up with our friend's progress.

526
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,890
Thank you so much,
it's troubling you.

527
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,760
What troubling? It's just notes.

528
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,730
Have you had dinner?

529
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,940
Not yet.

530
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,880
Then, wanna have dinner together?

531
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,130
Kok can't go on a dinner with you.

532
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,560
Today...

533
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,940
he's having dinner with me.

534
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,700
Ai'Tai is joking.

535
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:50,040
What joking?

536
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,580
What do you want to eat, Jeed?

537
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,710
It'll be my treat.

538
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,940
Consider that I'm
paying for the lecture note.

539
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,790
For real?

540
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,110
Then, I won't hold my appetite.

541
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,460
Then, I'm heading home.

542
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,920
You're not gonna join us?

543
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,760
No, I cooked back in the room.

544
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,940
But it's a pity that no one will eat.

545
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,020
I think your friend is probably angry.

546
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,650
Then why don't we go some other time?

547
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,500
It's fine.

548
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,540
Besisdes, I need to
ask for your help too.

549
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,070
What subject do you want me
to take notes for you now?

550
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,400
No wonder you said you
want to invite me to dinner.

551
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,290
That hurts.

552
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,710
Uncle.

553
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,030
Can I have the water?

554
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,970
Do I look that old that
you're calling me "uncle"?

555
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,830
No.

556
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,590
But you told me yourself that
you're older than me, right?

557
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,080
That's why I called you "uncle".

558
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,320
That's true.

559
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,610
But you can call me "P", right?

560
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,260
Because I want to call you "uncle".

561
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,380
Why? Can't I?

562
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,990
Fine, call me whatever you want.

563
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,030
Uncle.

564
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,270
Give me the water.

565
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,510
I'm thirsty.

566
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,100
Uncle.

567
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,220
Can I ask you something?

568
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,570
Have you ever...

569
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,110
had a crush on someone?

570
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,110
Why do you ask?

571
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,420
Just answer my question.

572
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,080
Because you're having a
crush on someone, aren't you?

573
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,100
The reason you were
siting and sad all day...

574
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,560
it's because of this, right?

575
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,690
You know too well.

576
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,530
Whoever you're secretly love or like...

577
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,900
just tell them.

578
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,580
Will they know if you don't tell them?

579
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,230
I don't dare to.

580
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,760
I'm afraid of the answer.

581
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,460
You're having a crush on a friend then?

582
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,960
You know it again.

583
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,600
Don't tell me you can read my mind?

584
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,120
Nonsense.

585
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,220
Let me tell you.

586
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,670
If you secretly love
or like someone, go for it.

587
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,730
Whether it'll be
a happy ending or not...

588
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,360
forget about that first.

589
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,890
The more you keep it inside...

590
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,060
the one who'll be
siting uncomfortably and sad...

591
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,730
is you.

592
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,670
It's better for you to let them know.

593
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,350
At least if you get sad, it'll be only once.

594
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,080
It's better than you siting and feel sorry
for yourself over and over again.

595
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:56,310
when you see them
doing things with someone else.

596
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,250
Fighting.

597
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,100
Love...

598
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,680
there's nothing certain about it.

599
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,770
You have to understand and accept it.

600
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,280
Thank you, Uncle.

601
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,160
Hurry and eat.

602
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,090
What did you cooked?

603
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,100
Why do you ask?

604
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,490
Because I'm hungry.

605
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,210
You've eaten, didn't you?

606
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,280
What are you doing?

607
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,700
Throw it away.

608
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Wait, wait,
why do you want to throw it?

609
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,790
No one's gonna eat it, why keep it?

610
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,690
I'm going to eat it here.

611
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,680
You think I'm being unfaithful?

612
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,260
You've eaten, didn't you?

613
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,670
Not yet.

614
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,930
I came home to eat
your cooks, of course.

615
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,350
But...

616
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:00,030
I don't know if it's edible or not.

617
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,840
Whether it's edible or not, give it a try.

618
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,360
Why talk too much?

619
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,740
If you wanna smile, then just smile.

620
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,790
Don't put on a facade.

621
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,310
What? Who's gonna smile?

622
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,290
You of course.

623
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,790
You talk too much.

624
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,990
So are you gonna eat or not?

625
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,480
Yes, yes, eat, eat.

626
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,840
What?

627
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:38,880
Eat it.

628
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,510
Is it good?

629
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,950
It's edible.

630
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,320
Then don't eat, give it here.

631
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,910
Calm down.

632
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,470
So fierce.

633
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,860
Is there something you want?

634
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,220
I do.

635
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:02,320
I'm here to talk about Phupha.

636
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,800
Why?

637
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,510
From now on...

638
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,030
you and I...

639
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,750
eye for an eye...

640
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,170
and tooth for a tooth.

641
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,380
May the best man wins.
