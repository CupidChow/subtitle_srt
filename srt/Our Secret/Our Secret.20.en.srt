Our Secret
EP20

2
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Thank you.

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,979
The end-of-the-world fireworks

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:49,100
gave me a reason to apply for Hua Qing University again.

5
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,520
Tomorrow

6
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,550
is the opening exhibition of the robotics competition.

7
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,810
Would you like to come?

8
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,110
Don't push your luck here.

9
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,440
We had a deal today.

10
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,370
Hanging out together was an accident.

11
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,750
Well then,

12
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,130
you are gonna have to hang on a little longer,

13
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,030
cause I'm not giving up.

14
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
Xianxian.

15
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,320
Su.

16
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,960
What are you doing here?

17
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
I tried to find you in your room.

18
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,910
Your roommate said you were out.

19
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,240
It was raining outside.

20
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,910
Hope you didn't get caught in the rain.

21
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,800
With me around,

22
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,829
she won't.

23
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:31,160
Am I interrupting something?

24
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,470
No.

25
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,440
A little bit.

26
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,110
Well, how about you give us a minute, then?

27
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,000
Sorry.

28
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,880
There's something about work

29
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,340
to discuss with Xianxian.

30
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,770
She's getting a little tired.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,910
What about another day.

32
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,079
Su, it's okay.

33
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,960
What do you need me for?

34
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,110
Let's find a quiet place,

35
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,829
that we can sit down to talk.

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,110
Okay.

37
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,440
Let's go.

38
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,830
Xianxian, look over this.

39
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,000
This is...

40
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,510
You're everywhere!

41
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,830
Good point.

42
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,120
What's wrong with me being a customer here?

43
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,640
Xianxian,

44
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,110
There was this comic book company in the Huai city,

45
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,710
who asked us to design an app.

46
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,790
It's almost done

47
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,480
and is about to be launched.

48
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
The Director Zhang of the comic book company,

49
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,350
asked me if I could recommend an artist.

50
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,510
And I thought of you.

51
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,350
Tech companies make comic book apps, too?

52
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,080
Your company really does everything.

53
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,160
Yeah, because we are a startup company.

54
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,390
The boss wants to try various services.

55
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,040
He's got foresight.

56
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,320
Thank you.

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,390
If he doesn't,

58
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,600
he wouldn't send me here to cooperate with Xianxian.

59
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,070
You're right about that.

60
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,550
That could be the only common point

61
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,320
that we share.

62
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,230
But,

63
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,670
I have no experience in

64
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,940
working on comic book apps like this.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,330
Don't worry about this.

66
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,480
This app is currently the first one in China.

67
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,070
and the only professional platform exclusively for comics.

68
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,400
I think it's quite good.

69
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,600
I wonder if you're interested.

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,070
So what do I need to do?

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,350
It happens that we are currently in the Huai City,

72
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,670
if you're interested,

73
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,380
come with me to see director Zhang tomorrow.

74
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,200
Tomorrow? Tomorrow is probably not okay.

75
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,830
Are you...

76
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,770
Are you going to see him?

77
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,720
No.

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,790
The show-stand for our comic club needs to be prepared tomorrow.

79
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,510
I'm afraid I can't make time.

80
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,390
Then...

81
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,830
I'll make arrangement when you are free.

82
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,830
That's great. Thank you, Su.

83
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,350
So I'll take my leave now.

84
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,280
I have to work on my sketch tonight.

85
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,270
Let me walk you to your place.

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,880
Don't we all stay in the same hotel here?

87
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,220
See you then. You don't have to walk me there.

88
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,510
Wait a minute.

89
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,600
I need to talk to you.

90
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,610
Could you please give us some privacy?

91
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,160
Su,

92
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,070
how about you go first?

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,760
Okay.

94
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,280
Remember to rest early.

95
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,750
If there's anything,

96
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,790
call me at any time.

97
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,230
Okay, Su, bye.

98
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,200
Bye.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,270
Good night.

100
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,510
Go ahead.

101
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,480
To be honest,

102
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,350
I don't like this guy very much.

103
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,320
But,

104
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,830
what he just said,

105
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,880
sounds like a good opportunity.

106
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,920
It’s worth your consideration.

107
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,070
You chose to do what you love,

108
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,250
I'll definitely stand behind you.

109
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,480
Then I'll go back to my room.

110
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,110
Don't forget to come to the robot exhibition opening tomorrow.

111
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,830
I'll be waiting for you.

112
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,760
Did you two make up?

113
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,710
We were never together.

114
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,110
There can't be "make up".

115
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,880
Forget about that.

116
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,000
You betrayed me!

117
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,520
You've been in the amusement park all day,

118
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,650
and earned a course from Professor Ye.

119
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,900
Couldn't ask for more.

120
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
Xianxian's not here yet?

121
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,210
How could it be？ It's late already.

122
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,280
Hurry up.

123
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,230
Lou Feng.

124
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,670
You put this here first,

125
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,710
then go upstairs to get tomorrow's schedule.

126
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,350
And you need to check out tomorrow's costumes in the dressing room.

127
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,350
I have to go to the dressing room?

128
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,480
I'll go to the dressing room.

129
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,080
My work is done here anyway.

130
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,670
You're not going to the robot contest opening?

131
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,080
No time for chat. Just move.

132
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,110
Okay, see you then!

133
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,520
Xianxian, I love you!

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,350
Get the schedule, hurry up.

135
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:11,080
Sir, this truck is ready to go!

136
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,910
Are you guys ready?

137
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,760
In a minute,

138
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,960
everyone's going to the central exhibition hall to give speeches.

139
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,280
Could you wait a couple minutes?

140
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,740
We need a few more minutes.

141
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,230
How many plans are you gonna show?

142
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,710
Let's go with one first.

143
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
Are you doing this or not?

144
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,780
You can start the show now.

145
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,910
Don't wait for me.

146
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm sorry.

147
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,470
Without Xianxian,

148
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,960
you can still give the show of your robot.

149
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,550
Without her here,

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,400
there is no point in doing the show anymore.

151
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,720
Why don't you just go inside? It's fine.

152
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,110
So, one two three four five six...

153
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,110
Why is it locked?

154
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,450
I'll go to the dressing room. My work is done here anyway.

155
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,880
Anyone out there?

156
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Someone's in here!

157
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,040
Good work. See you guys.

158
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,670
Bye! Bye!

159
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,280
Xing Lufei, I got the schedule.

160
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,150
Good.

161
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,000
Then we're done here today.

162
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,960
Good work.

163
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,440
So...

164
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,380
Where's Ding Xian?

165
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,520
Ding Xian is...

166
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,710
She went to check out the dressing room,

167
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,110
and then I think there's something urgent, and she just left.

168
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,470
Then I'll see you.

169
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
Bye.

170
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,380
Something urgent?

171
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,710
Boss,

172
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,940
The opening ceremony is over.

173
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,880
I don't think Xianxian will come.

174
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,590
Why don't we just go?

175
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,470
It's okay. You can go.

176
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,310
You don't have to wait for me.

177
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,550
Okay, don't be too late.

178
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,030
No worries.

179
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,470
Sir, why do you have Ding Xian's cell phone?

180
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,510
Oh, I'll fetch it right away.

181
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,440
Wasn't she with you?

182
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,100
Don't tell me she is...

183
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,880
still at the Comic-Con Center.

184
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,440
Ding Xian!

185
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,670
Ding Xian!

186
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,710
Ding Xian!

187
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,960
Ding Xian!

188
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,350
Zhou Siyue!

189
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,910
Zhou Siyue!

190
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,710
Zhou Siyue, I'm here!

191
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,080
Ding Xian!

192
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,280
I'm here. Can you hear me?

193
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,960
Ding Xian, are you in there?

194
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm locked inside!

195
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,410
You step back a little!

196
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,400
Step back, okay?

197
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,030
Are you all right?

198
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,760
I'm okay.

199
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,150
Come.

200
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,590
Getting in here like this,

201
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,390
are you sure we won't get caught?

202
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,920
It's an emergency after all.

203
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,040
Just give me a second.

204
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,200
How did you get locked up in there?

205
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,080
I have no idea.

206
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,210
You have to be more careful from now on.

207
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,230
If I'm not around someday,

208
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,430
what should you then?

209
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,200
Well...

210
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,550
I'm sure I'll get out the next day.

211
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,620
I could just wait for someone to open the door for me.

212
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,250
That's enough tough talk.

213
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,960
Oh,

214
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,670
how was your opening ceremony?

215
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,280
I didn't do it.

216
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,520
Why?

217
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,130
Aren't you here,

218
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,790
just for the robot contest?

219
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,220
That's not entirely true.

220
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,990
I'm also here for you.

221
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
My little Lord Zhou,

222
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,320
when did you become so unambitious?

223
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,550
That's because,

224
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,350
I am sure enough that

225
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:28,320
I can get the first place in the contest,

226
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,790
and I will get you too.

227
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,790
I'm leaving.

228
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Why do you hate being with me so much?

229
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,670
Zhou Siyue,

230
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,910
when did you become such a scoundrel?

231
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,330
Maybe you should get to know me better.

232
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,200
Come here.

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,790
Come here.

234
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,320
Stay here and don't move.

235
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,230
Fellows, I'm leaving.

236
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,400
I want to go away and look around.

237
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,230
Will you come back?

238
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,640
I'll be back. Bye!

239
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,910
Goodbye!

240
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:29,030
We'll wait for you to come back!

241
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,670
I'll miss you guys.

242
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,640
Don't you forget to miss me!

243
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,840
Help, help!

244
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,840
He's awake! Yes!

245
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,670
That's great!

246
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,190
I thought

247
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,640
that you never check Weibo.

248
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,190
"Little Monster Dairies"

249
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,560
Catchy name.

250
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,160
Ding Xian,

251
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,520
you once asked me

252
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,160
what is true love.

253
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,350
Now I know the answer.

254
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,950
She seems ordinary

255
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,350
yet day by day I find her even more beautiful

256
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,070
It's like...

257
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,960
she is so stubborn that almost makes in rage

258
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,570
and yet making me feel,

259
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,560
she is the cutest in the world.

260
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,190
It's like knowing that she's lying,

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,350
and yet,

262
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,840
I just couldn't spoil her poor acting.

263
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,070
It's like...

264
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,640
always crying like a mess,

265
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,390
and yet she is still attractive.

266
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,040
You're a mess.

267
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,430
Who is that

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,260
you are talking about?

269
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,280
Ding Xian,

270
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,760
I love you.

271
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,760
Would you be my girlfriend?

272
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,760
What are you doing here?

273
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,680
Who let you in?

274
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,280
How did you get in here?

275
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,760
Now you people don't even give a shit

276
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,690
about us security guards anymore?

277
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,450
Put down your information!

278
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,710
We're sorry.

279
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,280
I brought her there.

280
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,830
So, it has nothing to do with her.

281
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,430
You young lovers nowadays...

282
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,300
Must you have to seek thrills?

283
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,770
Write. What are you looking at?

284
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,880
Just write, everything!

285
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,640
We're not lovers.

286
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,040
Look at your good-looking face,

287
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,230
how come you can't even get a girl?

288
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,920
I was working on it.

289
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,560
And then you cut me off.

290
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,520
Y'all wait here for a sec.

291
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,580
I'll go for a check.

292
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,990
You can't leave until everything's clear.

293
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,690
You haven't given me an answer yet.

294
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,280
Zhou Siyue,

295
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,280
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:32,590
I'm not planning on a relationship, now.

297
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,680
well, you...

298
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,050
you sure can hold a grudge.

299
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,000
Fine,

300
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,730
I'll be waiting for you.

301
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,190
I'll wait for your answer.

302
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,710
Xianxian.

303
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,470
why are you here?

304
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,040
Su.

305
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,310
Mr. Su, what brings you here?

306
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,830
You know them?

307
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,600
They're my friends.

308
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,710
Here.

309
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,430
Thank you.

310
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,430
That's it. You can leave now.

311
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,560
Don't do that again.

312
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,560
Mr. Su, see you then.

313
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Good work.

314
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,110
Why are you here?

315
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,520
The contest starts tomorrow.

316
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,450
I'm here to check the procedures with the organizer.

317
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,950
Are you going back to the hotel?

318
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,080
I can give you a ride.

319
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,230
Sure.

320
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,560
Thank you.

321
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,040
Xianxian,

322
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,190
your mom called me the other day.

323
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,710
She asked me to take good care of you,

324
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,520
since we are both in the Huai City now.

325
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm a little busy these days,

326
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,200
when I'm done, I'll take you out for fun.

327
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,190
Mr. Su, you're so busy,

328
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,620
maybe we should forget about these social courtesies.

329
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:06,760
That's where you're wrong.

330
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,290
For me, Xianxian was never a courtesy.

331
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,590
She always sees me as a brother, too.

332
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,110
Does she?

333
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,990
Then how come I have never heard her mention

334
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,510
you, her big brother?

335
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,880
Maybe it's because you two

336
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,230
were never that close?

337
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,880
It's no wonder that you didn't know.

338
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,040
Of course Xianxian wouldn't tell you.

339
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,230
She wouldn't tell anything to a stranger.

340
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,470
Even if she doesn't tell me anything,

341
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,640
I know what she likes,

342
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,090
and what she dislikes.

343
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,230
Xianxian,

344
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,280
I want to talk to you,

345
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,040
about the comic book app.

346
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,800
What is it?

347
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,300
Do you mind giving us a minute?

348
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,160
It's not a secret.

349
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,120
Can't you talk in front of me?

350
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,160
It's okay, Su. Go ahead.

351
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,470
Director Zhang of the comic book company

352
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,880
saw your works on your Weibo, and liked them very much.

353
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,520
He's having a dinner tomorrow,

354
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,190
and wants to sign the contract with you in person.

355
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,560
That's great. Thank you so much, Su.

356
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,590
I didn't do much.

357
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,850
I just introduced you.

358
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,950
I'll take you shopping for some clothes tomorrow.

359
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,680
It's better to dress formally.

360
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,470
What's wrong with her clothes?

361
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,350
It's okay, Su.

362
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,040
I have clothes.

363
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,190
Don't worry.

364
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,190
Okay then, I'll go with you tomorrow.

365
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,560
Don't be nervous.

366
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,760
Ding Xian won't be nervous.

367
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,790
You don't know her very well.

368
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,190
I'll see you then.

369
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Zhou Siyue,

370
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,070
I have told you,

371
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,560
stay away from Xianxian.

372
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,680
I have told you too,

373
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,400
I won't let go.

374
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,170
So that's all for today's discussion,

375
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,470
I hope that in the contest,

376
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,230
we'll all have a good performance.

377
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,310
Thank you all.

378
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,400
Awake now?

379
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,760
You took notes?

380
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,040
Good for you.

381
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,350
Career, love,

382
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,640
acing in both.

383
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,400
Look at him,

384
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,160
what a social butterfly.

385
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,070
Talking to everyone.

386
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,160
Come on, it's none of your business.

387
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,190
Let's go.

388
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,930
Where are you going?

389
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,920
Comic-Con.

390
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,090
Maybe you shouldn't go.

391
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,710
Why?

392
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,010
Because Xianxian is not there.

393
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,070
How do you know that she's not there?

394
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,800
I asked Lou Feng and she told me.

395
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,830
Then where is she?

396
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,590
She's...

397
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,760
she's taken back to the hotel by Su Bocong.

398
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,310
Xianxian, how was your show today?

399
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,560
It went well.

400
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,310
And there were a lot of people.

401
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:59,440
I finished just now.

402
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,000
So you haven't eaten all day?

403
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,320
- I'm used to it. I'm not hungry. - Ding Xian!

404
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,250
Why didn't you answer my call?

405
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,400
My cell phone is dead.

406
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:23,070
Weren't you at the academic conference?

407
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:24,950
Why are you back so soon?

408
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,560
It's over.

409
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,090
Don't you have a speech to prepare?

410
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,310
I pulled an all-nighter and finished it last night.

411
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,920
Then you should go back to your room and catch some sleep.

412
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,250
What are you doing here?

413
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,830
I wanna see you.

414
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,640
Mr. Zhou, you are really everywhere.

415
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,950
Can't seem to lose you.

416
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:46,950
Right back at you.

417
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,590
Mr. Su.

418
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,850
You're probably not in a position to laugh at me.

419
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,470
Anyone wants some juice?

420
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,000
- I'll get it. - I'll get it.

421
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,230
No, no, no, I'll go.

422
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,880
- Stay here. - Stay here.

423
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,880
Waiter, a glass of juice please.

424
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,070
What kind of juice would you like?

425
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,530
- Blueberry. - Blueberry.

426
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,710
Hot or cold?

427
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,800
- Cold. - Cold.

428
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,800
And sweetness?

429
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,950
- Full sweetness. - Full sweetness.

430
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,110
One cup?

431
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,590
One cup each.

432
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,680
I'll pay for mine, and he pay by himself.

433
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,430
Okay.

434
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,590
Thank you.

435
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,710
This is too much. I can't drink this much.

436
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,400
Xianxian, you must be hungry.

437
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,590
What about have a dinner together before we go back?

438
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,470
Okay.

439
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,880
Mr. Su, you treated me last time.

440
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,340
I feel quite embarrassed.

441
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,470
I'll pay this time.

442
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,590
I haven't said yes yet.

443
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,430
Sure.

444
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,610
Why don't we call up everyone?

445
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,040
We haven't had dinner together yet in the Huai City, anyway.

446
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,880
I know a place that is quite good.

447
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,560
However,

448
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:29,370
Mr. Zhou, I'm afraid it's gonna cost you.

449
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,400
Don't worry about me.

450
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,970
You should worry about

451
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,560
whether you stand a chance anymore.

452
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,920
Too sour.

453
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,640
See you around.

454
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,830
You're back.

455
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,230
What is this?

456
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,590
Blueberry juice.

457
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,680
No, thanks. It's too sour.

458
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,950
Rumors had it, two cute guys

459
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,970
went for you at the same time today.

460
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,470
Tell me tell me,

461
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,160
are you super happy today?

462
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,880
How is that possible?

463
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,640
They are two big babies!

464
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,680
I am so annoyed.

465
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,400
Anyway,

466
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,310
I'm still rooting the CP of you and Zhou Siyue.

467
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,400
You liked him for so many years.

468
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,470
If you can't be together,

469
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,400
it'd be such a huge shame.

470
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,190
Actually,

471
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,030
he asked me If I would be his girlfriend.

472
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:54,470
I almost said yes.

473
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,230
You refused?

474
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,040
I liked him for so many years.

475
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,470
And he's only been after me for a few days.

476
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,470
If I just say yes so easily,

477
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,680
I'll be completely controlled by him

478
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,920
in the future.

479
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,330
You have a point.

480
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
But,

481
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,800
I always feel that something is missing

482
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,560
between the two of us.

483
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,280
What is missing?

484
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,190
I don't know.

485
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:22,560
I can't figure it out.

486
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,000
Is she going?

487
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,800
It's his treat this the evening.

488
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,190
Are you going?

489
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,310
Forget it. I'm not.

490
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,190
Come now!

491
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,950
I'll go out for a while.

492
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,470
Bocong,

493
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,040
why didn't you go inside?

494
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,830
I want to tell you something.

495
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,590
What is it?

496
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,070
Here's the thing.

497
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,250
I know that you like Ding Xian.

498
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,470
I can help you.

499
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,800
Why are you helping me?

500
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,680
For Zhou Siyue?

501
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,110
Well, they're not together yet.

502
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,040
I still have a chance. So do you.

503
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,350
Lou Feng,

504
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,470
did you forget something again?

505
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,470
You're so...

506
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,350
Why are you here?

507
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,310
To take you to dinner.

508
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,430
I'm not hungry.

509
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,470
You don't want to see me?

510
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,920
Don't flatter yourself.

511
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,670
I'm buying dinner for everyone because of you.

512
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,280
I can't believe you're not even coming.

513
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,040
I didn't ask for that.

514
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,190
Anyway, I'll starve myself here if you won't go.

515
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,230
I'm not leaving.

516
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,830
Fine, I'll go.

517
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,230
I'll go eat.

518
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Welcome!

519
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,470
Xianxian.

520
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,400
Here.

521
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,760
Xianxian, this way, I saved you a seat.

522
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,950
Okay.

523
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,640
Zhou Siyue, sit here.

524
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Boss, here.

525
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
I'm telling you,

526
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,720
we've been here for so many days,

527
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,800
and didn't get the chance to get together, right?

528
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,640
Today, my boss pays the bill.

529
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,680
Just order anything you want, cheers!

530
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,830
Okay, thank you, Prince Charming.

531
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,110
You're welcome.

532
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,760
Just enjoy yourself.

533
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,150
Here, order the food.

534
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,640
Thank you.

535
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,590
I want this.

536
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,830
Thank you, handsome.

537
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,280
Nice that we're together here today.

538
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,590
Let's not just eat.

539
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,990
How about playing a game?

540
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,430
Which game? Just the one we used to play.

541
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,710
The King game.

542
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,380
I brought the cards. Here.

543
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,680
You are all prepared.

544
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,520
Of course.

545
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,850
Do you know how to play?

546
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
I don't know.

547
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,110
Here, I'll deal.

548
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,740
It's okay. I'll teach you.

549
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,830
Pass it on.

550
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,430
First hand, who's the king?

551
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,070
I am the king.

552
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,000
My order is simple.

553
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,400
Give me a toast, and call me gorgeous.

554
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,560
That'll do.

555
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,190
Who do you want? Right. What's the number?

556
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,320
What's the number? What's the number?

557
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,430
Number two.

558
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,110
Number two. Who's number two? Who's number two?

559
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,110
Who is number two?

560
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,350
Gorgeous, to you.

561
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,950
What? I can't hear you.

562
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,760
What?

563
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,760
Ban Jiayu, sorry.

564
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:02,560
You gorgeous, here to you!

565
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,590
Drink it up! Up, up.

566
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,139
Drink up. You're good.

567
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,870
Well done.

568
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,760
Nice.

569
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,429
Go on, go on.

570
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,800
Who is the king? Who?

571
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,150
I am

572
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,389
the king.

573
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:33,320
Number three should ask number six a question.

574
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,400
Fine, number three, number six.

575
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,429
I'm number six.

576
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,600
Who's number three? Number three.

577
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,710
Number three.

578
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,630
Number three.

579
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,929
Go ahead and ask.

580
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,120
A question.

581
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,520
Have you done anything bad lately?

582
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,370
What kind of question is that?

583
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,670
You should get punished. Come on.

584
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,270
Are you serious, Zhou Siyue?

585
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,840
You're still holding the grudge about me stealing your chocolate?

586
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,760
That's mean!

587
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,240
That doesn't count. Change the question.

588
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,910
That's fine. I have asked already.

589
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,230
I'll have one myself.

590
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,230
You drink up.

591
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,430
Drink up.

592
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,280
I'm in poor health, don't mess with me.

593
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
No problem.

594
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,190
Come on.

595
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,970
So this time, you deal.

596
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,150
Okay.

597
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,630
What kind of question was that?

598
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,280
I'm missing one here.

599
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,000
I suspect that the other day,

600
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,460
it's her who locked you in the dressing room.

601
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,390
No way

602
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,600
I am the king.

603
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,030
Since you are all so uptight,

604
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,950
I'll be the bad guy.

605
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,800
So, number five and number four.

606
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,910
Kiss each other.

607
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,130
Number four, number five.

608
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,690
Number four, number five.

609
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,220
Number four, number five.

610
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,600
Okay, okay,

611
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,040
Who?

612
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,390
Who is it?

613
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,670
Who?

614
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,200
Who is it?

615
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,800
Who? I'm number five. I'll punish myself.

616
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,280
Wait.

617
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,840
Let's drink together.

618
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,280
Drink up, drink up.

619
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,630
Drink up, drink up.

620
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,190
Drink up, drink up.

621
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,800
Drink up, drink up.

622
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,020
You can hold liquor just fine.

623
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,120
Boring, no kiss.

624
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,600
Boring.

625
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,320
One more round, one more round.

626
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,150
Boss, I...

627
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,080
Zhou Siyue, see you.

628
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,870
See you.

629
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,230
Bye!

630
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,990
Thank you, Prince Charming.

631
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,190
Take care of Yuanfang.

632
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,490
Why should I take care of Yuan Fang?

633
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,320
Zhou Siyue,

634
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,850
You should be clear that

635
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,280
she'll live a better life if she is with me.

636
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,600
The point is if she wants or not.

637
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,910
I don't think so.

638
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,560
Give me some time.

639
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,300
I'll make her understand.

640
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,350
That's some wishful thinking of yours.

641
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,430
That's the truth.

642
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,080
So long as she's willing to,

643
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,230
sooner or later, we'll belong with each other.

644
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,150
What about you?

645
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,600
whether you're studying abroad, or finding a job,

646
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,950
you don't really think that your little high school romance,

647
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,410
is enough to get you through all that, do you?

648
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,870
Think it over.

649
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,440
Here's your change, sir.

650
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,630
Thank you.

651
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,770
You're welcome.

652
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,760
Now I declare the robot contest

653
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,670
successfully completed.

654
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,080
In this contest,

655
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,670
we've seen

656
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:15,320
outstanding students from major universities across the country.

657
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,150
Nanjing University, Heilongjiang University of Science and Technology...

658
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,910
How much longer is this gonna take?

659
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:19,910
Any minute now.

660
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,520
So now, we're going to announce

661
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,920
the top three of this year's robot contest.

662
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,760
First of all, the champion of this contest,

663
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,190
goes to Zhou Siyue from Hua Qing University.

664
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,850
Let's have Zhou Siyue up the stage for the award.

665
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,080
Thank you.

666
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,430
Hello, everyone.

667
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,180
I am from Hua Qing University.

668
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,320
I'm Zhou Siyue from the research team.

669
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,710
Hello?

670
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:13,710
Hello?

671
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,390
Siyue, use this one.

672
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,890
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

673
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,470
Liu Xiaofeng.

674
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
It's been a while.

675
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,950
Yes, indeed.

676
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:44,150
You're here representing the University of Science and Technology?

677
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah.

678
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,760
Why did you go to the University of Science and Technology?

679
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,470
I remember you said you wanted to study economics

680
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,530
You remember that?

681
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,560
Actually, I am majoring in computer because of you.

682
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,220
Uh-wait, no, I didn't mean...

683
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,630
Don't get me wrong.

684
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,840
I'm just really grateful to you.

685
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,400
I'm not sure if you remember,

686
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,080
when the college entrance exam was close,

687
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,470
I was very nervous.

688
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,520
The pressure of that last year of high school was too much.

689
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,320
In fact, I am also very confused.

690
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,560
Whether I get in the university or not,

691
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,600
I am not sure what I should do in the future.

692
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,330
What kind of person I want to be.

693
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,470
In this world,

694
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,190
There are many, many hard-working people.

695
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,910
But not everyone

696
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,360
can get what he wants.

697
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,230
But,

698
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,530
if you can't get what you want through hard work,

699
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,440
then what's the point for working hard anyway?

700
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,810
We work hard so we won't regret.

701
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,390
If it wasn't you,

702
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,470
I would have no confidence to go to the college.

703
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,710
That's gross, man.

704
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,630
No, I mean it.

705
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,800
At that time,

706
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,760
I always thought that you were so out of touch.

707
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,440
But ever since you hang around with Ding Xian,

708
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,120
you've got a little more human touch.

709
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,670
Am I this cold-blooded before?

710
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,840
No.

711
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,200
How do I put it? It like...

712
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,120
Maybe I think that's who you really are.

713
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,520
How are you two now?

714
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,000
Are you together?

715
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Not yet.

716
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,740
I'm still waiting for her.

717
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,470
Why wait?

718
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,910
She's been waiting for me all these years.

719
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,710
I...

720
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,000
should give her enough patience too.

721
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,620
But have you ever thought about this,

722
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,600
for a girl as good as her,

723
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,090
she's never short of admirers.

724
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:07,870
You're right.

725
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,430
Then see you!

726
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,230
Wait.

727
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,950
What are you gonna do?

728
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,840
Go find her.

729
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,430
Hello, hello.

730
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,430
Excuse me, where's Zhou Siyue?

731
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,910
He has some business to attend to and left.

732
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,280
If you have something important,

733
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
I can tell him.

734
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
Here's the thing.

735
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,870
I want to work with him on a project.

736
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,000
Here is my name card.

737
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,190
Please do give it to him.

738
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,800
Okay, thank you.

739
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,910
- Xianxian. - Su.

740
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,760
Wait a minute.

741
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,600
What's the matter? It's the first time I wear high heels.

742
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,190
Not very used to it.

743
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,670
It's hurting my feet.

744
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,120
You look...

745
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
beautiful today.

746
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,630
Really? Yes.

747
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,320
Thank you!

748
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,670
This is for you.

749
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,870
Su.

750
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,560
You've helped me a lot.

751
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,770
I can't take any more gift from you.

752
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,600
And this is too expensive.

753
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,000
Not really.

754
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,470
Just for good luck.

755
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,470
So you could successfully seal the contract tonight.

756
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,560
You're wearing such a beautiful dress,

757
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,190
it should go with a nice necklace.

758
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,080
I can do it myself.

759
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,830
It looks great on you.

760
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,560
Thank you.

761
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,320
If I can seal the contract,

762
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,080
I will buy you a big meal.

763
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,650
I really wish you don't be too polite with me.

764
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,470
Let's go.

765
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,630
Here.

766
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,520
Thank you.

767
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,950
Let's go in.

768
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,160
Director Zhang.

769
00:44:29,390 --> 00:44:30,360
Okay, you can go.

770
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,840
Su, you're here.

771
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,280
This is...

772
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,430
This is the one I told you about before,

773
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:42,080
the author of the Little Monster Dairies,

774
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:42,950
Ding Xian.

775
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:44,190
She's so young!

776
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,940
How do you do, Director Zhang.

777
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,730
First of all, thank you very much for enjoying my comic.

778
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,800
I hope we can have a pleasant collaboration.

779
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,800
About the content of comics,

780
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,950
here's what I think.

781
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,470
I have some new ideas,

782
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,040
and I hope to give you a briefing.

783
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,390
Sure, please.

784
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,120
Here's my idea.

785
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,520
What about making your little monster,

786
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,280
personified.

787
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,120
Then we give the little monster a romance,

788
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,630
and let him fight against evil monsters to level up.

789
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,950
Meanwhile, we lengthen the content.

790
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,320
The audience nowadays,

791
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,760
like that kind of stuff.

792
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:22,950
By the way, if the contract with this little lady

793
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,320
has no problem,

794
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,870
let's sign it today.

795
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,230
Excuse me, Director Zhang,

796
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,840
I need to go to the bathroom.

797
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,470
Director Zhang, will you excuse me for a moment.

798
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,320
Okay.

799
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,840
Xianxian,

800
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520
are you all right?

801
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,560
Yeah.

802
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,520
I just find...

803
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:53,280
this is different than what I thought.

804
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,710
Xianxian,

805
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,740
people in this line of work

806
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,910
only care about maximizing profits,

807
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,720
which might make you a little uncomfortable.

808
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,080
But,

809
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,870
he doesn't even care about my idea about the work,

810
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,800
or the ideas I want to convey.

811
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,450
The two are inherently different.

812
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,390
The comic series that you started out at first was for yourself.

813
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,360
You don't need to care about other people's feelings.

814
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,320
But when it comes to commercial use,

815
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,380
you have to consider whether the public likes it or not.

816
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,800
That's just the way it is.
